rating,review
bad,I would not recommend any one applying for this position. Magment doesn't care about the employees all they care about is the customer amd how happy we can make them. If you need time off or was a contractor they will complain because you want time off. Just a bad company to work for all around
bad,"You had a situation where the bosses hire their friends, you have a few good workers that carry the dead beats. The good people work their hears out and the dead beats get paid about the same.  Management doesn't have a clue as to what they are doing, get rid of good employees to out source, and make them more money. Former government Military officers and management that know all the ins and out of fleecing the government dry."
bad,"don't work there, you will never get a raise.  I did not have to write this review and make it 150 character minimum.  Just thought i would anonymously alert people."
bad,Management needs training on interpersonal skills. Needs work/life balance and better benefits. Needs diversity training and inclusion activities for all.
bad,Taxpayers dollars wasted ; jobs are based on contract time frame.  Unethical; employees aren't treated with respect.  If your a female sleep with boss and job secure as long as the manager is there
bad,"With twice as much experience as any of my male coworkers I was still making $15,000 less a year because I was the only female in the team. I did the same job as everybody else if not sometimes more yet got less"
bad,Dishonest. I was hired to manage locations in two states and refused their requirement to sign fraudulent time cards and turned them in to the USA army. I left. I will never recommend this dishonest organization.
bad,"this was a contract job and the contract ended."
bad,"If you enjoy working for a web portal..."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for.  My project management was inept, retaliatory and corrupt. In addition they would cut workers pay for the sole reason of attempting to drive them off of the project.  The project is now an abject failure and good workers are leaving in droves to get away from the toxic culture that exists in SAIC Hanahan, SC"
bad,"I don't even know where to begin here. Discrimination, harassment, poor management, terrible pay, horrible benefits, zero accountability. This is the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"No work life balance, they make employees work 7 days a week long hours and do not compensate salary employees for it.  Take that into consideration if you are salary before working here.  "
bad,The Oak Ridge Office Closeout Department is horrible.  The upper management is made up of unqualified people.  Work hours are unreasonable.  The compensation is the lowest in the area.  Very high turnover.
bad,"They are liars, and will take any money from you as they can!  They are a horrible company doing horrible work.  Upper management doesn't care except about their own paychecks.  If you want to make money yourself, find some other company to work for that isn't a rotten company like SAIC."
bad,SAIC management was the rudest and crudest I have seen in my 20 years of contractor work. They need serious leadership sensitivity training and personal management skills improvement.
bad,"The following attributes are my personal experience with the workplace;"
bad,"contract was ending and they brought in a new manager to get rid of the higher paid employees."
bad,Management is not interested in fostering a team atmosphere.  A vast majority of our team has left in the past 6 months because management has continually failed to encourage teamwork.  Management continually pits one group against another and shames groups in meetings.  The work itself is challenging and worthwhile -the environment is horrible!
bad,"My typical day at work here is; I show up at 8 am and take non stop back to back phone calls while my management and trainers all sit around and do nothing to help but instead choose to criticize us for everything we do. Sure SAIC is a great place to work if you are some type of management but if you have the unfortunate opportunity to work one of the help desks you'd be better off working at Walmart or digging ditches for the city, its way less busy and more enjoyable than working one of the help desks here at SAIC"
bad,"In the group I worked in at SAIC I found that upper and mid level management do not care for those who actually do the work.  With bloated salaries they will not hesitate to fire someone just to get a bonus or keep one of their friends employed.  It is highly political, mechanical and the worst work environment I've every been in."
bad,"Co-workers not friendly. Poor Management."
bad,Horrible place to work!  Management is incompetent.  Work environment is very uncomfortable.
bad,Not helpful when finding new employeement within the company
bad,"Upper management forgets the folks out in the field, in the customer work space. Very little reachout by management to offsite employees. "
bad,"After accepting a contract job with them. I was so mistreated there. I moved 1500 miles for them and they did not take care of me. This company misrepresented itself to candidates. This job in question I know the MGT team and they are awful. No comunication, bad structure all around sweat shop. The Govenment is not happy with this company, I would take calls and perform SharePoint maintencence for them, they are not happy. Overall any positon in SharePoint should be avoided, They are splitting the company in 2 and the bad management is going on both sides. This job is writen for one of there people and its just a HR cover yourself so it looks like they tried to find the right candiate."
bad,Managers are appointed on the Good ole Boy system. These types tend to make rules yet not follow any of them. Work schedules change daily. Absolutlely no advancement potential.
bad,Liked working in Las Vegas
bad,"Co-workers were good for the most part, but, like any work place you need to be careful of what you say because it will spread like wildfire. Management was horrendous to put it nicely...one of my supervisors literally punched the wall of an engineers cube wall because he was spending time getting his calculations right for our biggest client. Everyday someone was throwing someone else under the bus and no one would own up to their own mistakes. No one was an adult about any situation, especially management. I would never recommend anyone working for SAIC. They give you great raises then tell you that you are too expensive to bill out and lay you off. They are a very immature company with not ethics, morals or values."
bad,"If you have a great manager, you'll have a great work experience.  During my time here, I've experienced 4 different manages.  One manager was fantastic and possibly the best I've ever worked with.  However, the other three I've worked with, have been the worst I've dealt with in my career thus far."
bad,"No Ethics or Morals, Left due to criminal activities by management.  Worked at times 80 hours+ per week with no overtime, and felt disposable at all times."
bad,"Management is corrupt, dishonest and retaliatory.  Don't recommend this company to anyone.  The new management team does not care about their employees."
bad,"Zero upper management and a toxic work environment. There are no process and procedures, no SOP, no KPI, whatsoever. Nobody wants to work for the company so the overall climate is terrible."
bad,"Hands down the most stressful workplace I have ever worked for.  The management is extremely discriminatory and relentless harassment.  Upper management has been notified multiple times but nothing is ever done.  Employees are subjected to micromanagement, humiliation, and harassment."
bad,"Wondered as if every day was your last."
bad,"Management decisions based not on any professional skills but only for ""yes men"" in order to get the answers they're looking for."
bad,"Don't get really sick! No matter how much they say they are a family oriented company, they are not!! I was diagnosed with Cancer after I started there, missed alot of work (I understand it was not their fault), worked from home voluntarily to help out with the work load. ALWAYS told them when i would be off for medical or surgeries, and they never had a back-up there too help in my position. Funny the contract was with the NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE...how ironic is that? It came down to a forced resignation. If you work there, remember one thing, the managers are ALWAYS right and you are ALWAYS wrong, no matter the situation. The Managers were self-centered, too much gossiping and back stabbing between different facility buildings. Direct Supervisor gave me high remarks on my evaluation, and got a whopping $.03 raise!! Way to much to go into."
bad,I am looking for advancement and there is none at this company.
bad,The job was ok at first but there came a point where there was little to no accountability to a person's job or if somebody messed up.  This caused a lot of negative stress and it got to a point where I was no longer happy to be there.
bad,"If you stay longer than a year, the only person you're hurting is yourself and your career.Your schedule will adjust repeatedly, they will revoke all education assistance, and the health benefits are a joke."
bad,"SAIC was a great place to work--back when it was employee owned. Now, the benefits suck, and while they still have a few of the exceptional managers left from the old days, the new ones they are growing are bad news for non-managers. And when these bad managers behave very badly, contacting ""Ethics"" just turns the issue back to SAIC HR, who will do anything to protect management except teach them how to behave better.  I couldn't tell you who is the CEO, so I'm saying ""No"" below."
bad,Toxic location to work and the divisions within the project are at war with each other to obtain attention from the upper level management and to shift blame to other divisions
bad,"Working for a defense contractor such as this one is a truly eye-opening experience that shows how government contracts reward top-level executives while leaving operations and assembly and there first level management underpaid, underappreciated, and their employment status in a precarious cliff's edge. Security clearances, I've been told, are worth more in pay, but that wasn't so with SAIC. I had had a top-level security clearance before this job while in the military and as a civilian. It had lapsed and I reattained it for a particular production project and was rewarded not at all in pay or bonuses even though I was the only employee working on this project. I saw my manager and his manager work long hours and practically sell their soul for the good of the company and then lose their jobs shortly after I left for another job. I started working here as a temp worker with a temp firm that supplies technicians for government contracts and when I was offered employment with SAIC I jumped at the ""opportunity"" although it meant nothing for pay and benefits. "
bad,"While SAIC (and the newly formed LEIDOS) outwardly insist on ethical behavior, fundamentally the management system is so flawed that ethics take a back seat to office politics. Many times I had no idea whom to speak to about a problem, because there are excessive layers of management. Problems with other employees, lack of adherence to Standard Operating Procedures, and poor job performance were consistently ""swept under the rug"", due primarily to intra-office politics and relationships. "
bad,"If your are serious about employment don't go to SAIC. I know this company well. They are all smoke and mirrors. They want you to think they are the best but after splitting this company is not employee friendly. Read about the New York scandal. There software processes and culture is unreasonable and the managers are not experienced and make poor decisions based on friendships and who likes you. Don't go there. The market is getting strong don't get stuck working for this company. They are not the preferred vendor for government contracts and will loss future contracts. Try BAE Systems or Northrop L3, or others which are way better. DONT be FOOLED, I am telling the truth, There might be pockets of good but Orlando is NOT ONE OF THEM."
bad,Fast paced workplace with multiple hats worn on daily basis. Learned the importance of organization and prioritizing tasks.
bad,"Analyzed and priced bills of materials, in support of proposals."
bad,The hardest part of the job at SAIC to continue to be funded in an environment where funding is limited
bad,"Uncaring, bad managers. Employees didn't seem yo have a sense of contributing anything worthwhile."
bad,"Mangement is overbearing and impossible to work with."
bad,They get rid of loyal people and have forgotten that those are the people who built foundations and relationships with customers. Benefits are horrible!
bad,"On call 24/7 never can do enough.   Highers never listened.  PM's are not qualified to do their job and no work balance nor do they live anywhere near their projects.  "
bad,"this job had no documentation at all , the manager had ADA , no communication between management at all , could not talk to my team per manager, from day one"
bad,It would have been better without the back stabbing of your fellow women co-workers.
bad,"Manager was very negative, received little help. Only towards the end did I get training, and my manager still was negative on my behalf. "
bad,"I worked for SAIC in Virginia and enjoyed the honesty, loved my manager the 4 years I worked there.  I moved out to Colorado and the management out here was very deceiving, backstabbing, untrustworthy, not willing to make improvement to the environment, and no loyalty to the employees.  I was very disappointed at how the management is not honest with employees and is will to throw the employee under the bus.  Was expecting to relocate and have the same kind of management here."
bad,The last two years things have taken a downward trend with SAIC and the culture. They are not focused on their employees growth and development. Many employees are required to work 10+ hours of overtime a week. There is not a work/life balance. The compensation is underpaid based on the job functions that each person is doing. There is a continuous turnover effect and makes it very difficult to function day in and day out.
bad,"Employees are negatively impacted by management incompetence at the top. Constant layoffs and corporate speak! They could care less about their employees so unless you are a glutton for punishment, run the other way as fast as you can."
bad,"I've been working at SAIC for 11 years. The pro is that the company pays well and that's about it. The cons are many: terrible management for one thing. One manager I had created such a hostile work environment they let him go but only because I finally complained. They already had 2 complaints but because he performed well they kept him around. New manager came along but they don't engage employees very much and typically are incompetent. Also, there is no job security. As soon as your project dries up you're on your own and no one cares. They will drop you like a 10 pound rock no matter how hard you work or how long you've been there. I haven't received a performance review in 2 years. On top of that it defrauded the City of New York for half a billion dollars. Google ""CityTime SAIC"". My advice: stay away from this company."
bad,This job was very educational because we install electronic equipment in mine resistant vehicles for SPAWAR.And each part of the military install electronic equipment differently in vechicles.
bad,"Was fired for questionable cause. When I had a viable response to the initially stated cause for termination, they simply changed the reason to something else, just stating we no longer have an interest in your services any longer. In California, this would have been a case for wrongful termination!!"
bad,"The culture at SAIC that I picked up on is that they only really care about management or the senior level staff. Everyone else is left in the dust unless they can manage to stay on a team for 10+ years. I had the misfortune of working on a team with 10 individuals. 6 managers, 1 tester, 1 security officer and 2 developers."
bad,"I was hired away from a well paying job in Afghanistan to work in Iraq in July 2016. We were to spend some OJT and admin time in Kuwait before moving forward to Iraq (which had no permanent job openings). Immediately upon arrival at Camp Arijan in Kuwait is when things began to feel and smell very fishy.  "
bad,"1 - confusing on who was the direct functional manager"
bad,"The employees at the working level are excellent and collaborative.  However, management decisions show little respect for employee contributions and hard work."
bad,Bad news from start to finish. Small bonuses. The company does not care about its employees only its bottom line. Sad to see such a huge company do less but expect more for its employees.
bad,Students and FAA instructors get away with things you cant. You work about 60-70 hrs per week with very little compensation   Direct management is great but hire ups don’t know the dealings of what you do
bad,"The business culture constantly changes.  Benefits are horrible, and with no notice they cancel benefits based on the business at the current time.  They sell you on 5K a year tuition assistance, then when you get 1,000 dollars they reject your tuition assistance saying business conditions don't permit, even though they have to program the money at the beginning of the year.  They are not trustworthy, and the benefits are basically non-existent."
bad,"SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees."
bad,"SAIC is just a title. They supposedly have a headquarters in OK, but really it's just a lot of job sites and no real management from any ""head office""."
bad,"There is no job security and the compnay has little or no professional interest in its employees. The company has great policies, but no management enforcement."
bad,"Up for layoff for the third time with this same company. I guess I should have known after first two times. However, continued to try to find work with this company. It is a great place to work if you can find a position that actually has some stability in it."
bad,This company's level of professionalism during pre-employment procedures is horrible. They dont work with the FAA security office to ensure conflict deconfliction with their candidates to be added to contract prior to its starting date. All they care about is meeting personal deadlines.  Be warned: you have to do your own due diligence when it comes to making sure the FAA HR office hears from you if you have an issue with your security clearance.
bad,"This organization has a broad scope of influence in the region, but seemed stove-piped internally and lacked a sense of team building or concern about employees."
bad,"did not care about the employees, just the bottom line. place needs an uplift and is top heavy."
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,"Unless you're part of the good 'ol boy club, there's no chance for advancement. Those that mess up are moved along somewhere else or even promoted. Those that work hard and know their job are pigeon-holed with little or no advancement, if not let go for _____ reason."
bad,"a typical day at work, on the computer for 8 hour, management ok, the workplace culture was horrible the hard part of the job was commutation lack of leadership"
bad,SAIC could be a great company. The problem is the leadership. They don't care about the employees nor do they listen. They are quick to sacrifice employees to save a penny.
bad,"The HSV management teams has a concept of ""working around problems"", not working through them. Which really means, if someone feels uncomfortable at work, management will avoid the issue. Whether the situation pertain to the success of the project, or a EO complaint. Management is filled will people that lie to government customers to attempt to appear like a team. The proposal concept seems to be based off who is the weakest and most willing to bend under pressure rather than people who want to be successful and ensure the customer receives the best product."
bad,"Management at SAIC IT Help desk is terrible. It changes like the wind, seems like managers don't know what they are doing and try to get rid of those who do! Office politics has began to fester for the worse. There is no room for growth or for promotion."
bad,I had a great time working with my team mates but we share an office space with another large group of technical experts in the company. The workspace was not conducive because it could get really loud sometimes. Pay is far and my bosses make sure that I had the proper training before  I took on any task. We have a very informative guides that is very easy to use.
bad,"Pathetic  environment . I work as a lead instructor at one of SAIC, FAA facilities. It’s no wonder, the FAA controller’s are short of people. "
bad,"Management in the billing department is Hot and Cold. One day they will not even say hello, the next they ""care"". They will block your application for other departments because the turn over is so high."
bad,"management was micro"
bad,The management team has no idea what it takes to get the job done. You are expected to work 48-64 hours a week in a job that doesn't qualify for overtime. You are at times given little or no notice of having to work a 16 hour day.
bad,"Great work place but as employee not overseas, I learned new technologies in media. the long working hours were the hardest part."
bad,Lack of Job security. My life was ruined after I was let go from this company. You are just a number at this company. There are no advancement opprtunties with this company.
bad,Upper (top) management may be fine. They interested in quality staff. Lover management and most drafters only care to safe they position and stay employed with any cost. Many good specialist left or been forced to leave.
bad,constantly changing org structure with poor communications and lack of leadership.  The company has tried a matrix structure which has cost too much on OH and won't admit it was a mistake and is trying to solve the balance sheet by laying off people.  A short term solution that will cause problems in the future.
bad,"A typical work day consists of lack of communication which then leads to confusion as to what is happening. When a project is behind they tend to throw more people at the project instead of figuring out a solution to make the situation better. "
bad,Lack of proper training with poor management.  No appreciation for good work. I was loaded with too many tasks with no additional support from the management.
bad,"Low salary, heavy work load, management plays favorites.  No room for advancement, repeatedly told you have growth potential.  Open positions are filled outside of the company for higher pay with no experience."
bad,politics over rules.  Constant  bickering among management. Getting the job done and better relationships with senior  client  management  is not important.  There are no on-boarding protocols. No one wants to answer questions regarding interface methodologies and status.  Atmosphere is totally dysfunctional.
bad,"If you are looking for practical government contracting experience, this is the place for you. The atmosphere is always strained and you must document every conversation and instruction because you will find that you have multiple layers of management who all seem to be in charge."
bad,There is a lack of support by management and the only way to get a significant raise is to be part of corporate management or to find a job elsewhere.
bad,"Ineffective management, questionable ethics and business practices, horrible benefits package and a complete disregard for employees."
bad,"Was a great company to work for...not anymore. SAIC is a large and decentralized company so my experience can be different than others. I think it is a general assessment of employees that the company is far from the employee ownership culture it once had. Going public damaged this--the reduction in defense spending also hurts, but essentially it is a big corporate, short-term bottom line oriented managed company. We used to have good health insurance plan, now it is marginally better than getting an individual plan: effectively a few thousand dollar pay cut. I worked long hours, traveled, performed to my best ability to be burned and let go via email during company restructuring split."
bad,"I can only speak on my business unit. No career advancing, no 401k matching, poor leadership and management."
bad,"This is a company that will lay you off as fast as they can. I waited at least 1 year for my review. This really upset me."
bad,"bad, unqualified and unprofessional management"
bad,"overall not a great experience. Compensation was ok, benefits were average, but the kicker was the management was less than adequate. Played the favorites too much."
bad,You're just another cog in the machine they don't care about service desk employees you're easily replaceable and they know you aren't gonna be there long in my interview I was told they plan on promoting me before a year because most people quit when I got there I saw so many people there for years and no promotion other than to go to a higher level of helpdesk. Asked manager for hour change and got no response 3 weeks later I put in my 2 weeks and got an email back in 3 minutes saying good luck you can quit now. From what I saw while there every other job aside from helpdesk you mean something to the company but if you're working in helpdesk you're useless.
bad,"I really don't have anything to say about SAIC, It was ok to work for this co, but the pay could have been better and the hours per month were terrible with the contract I was on."
bad,"This company is very cutthroat, I was told to apply for another position with in the company, within three days they just let me go, never heard anything back from the Management about the position with EPA after they was awarded the contact."
bad,"Working at SAIC as a contracting company with the Federal Gov't was good....until the time comes where they are forced to make cut backs on the contract you are on. They can cycle you off at anytime for absolutely zero reason, which is what happened to me and a few others. They brag about their redeployment abilities but they didn't have anything for me when I was cycled off. It is the nature of the beast, to be sure, but it was a shock as to why I was selected after leading a team of DBAs for over a year and being the sole DBA for about 6-8mths as well. I felt I sacrificed a lot for the company and was tossed aside rather rudely."
bad,"It was not good, and I would like to move on. I would rather not discuss the environment with this company, other than to say that just need to find a better place to work."
bad,"There was no opportunity for advancement.  Pressure was constant to work more hours and give more OT.  The favoritism culture from the CIO was ludicrous; if one was a pet, one could do anything:  otherwise, the office of CIO did not know who you were.  CIO office would frequently ask ""who's that?"" in conference calls when one of their employee reports would be mentioned.  Not a large workforce (200+); completely aghast that office of CIO could not know who worked for them."
bad,Company/projects lack direction and knowledge from management. The work being completed is more important than being done correctly.
bad,"There is little interaction with your direct manager if you are on site in a customer facility. In a sense you become invisible. You are there generate income for the company and nothing more. I am writing this review prior to SAIC's split into Leidos and SAIC. Had I stayed, I would have been a part of Leidos."
bad,"Non-existent training, though management expectations do not reflect this. After several years there is still no movement or advancement."
bad,"I build and maintain Linux servers, storage arrays and firewalls. Currently over 40 servers to"
bad,company was focused on numbers... very clique oriented. if you were not part of the in crowd you were treated like dirt
bad,"Company says it values it's employees. That is a myth. I was laid off for the stated reason ""we can find someone to do your job for less money."""
bad,SAIC is also a very hard company to gain placement on another contract within SAIC once your current contract has ended.
bad,"Company is in transition. Laid off due to ""overhead issues"". I have experienced 11 wonderful years with great people but the company is changing along with the management strategy. Some great people that I will look forward to working with again."
bad,After 19 years on the job my position was eliminated after SAIC won a re-compete. I was given my lay-off noticed and 30 minutes later was escorted out of the office by armed security guard.
bad,"Same as above summary.  The company was much better before going public at which point the benefits diminished, time off accruement for service reduced, expectations for putting in extra time increased and work/life balance is almost non-existent with calls coming in at all hours and during the weekend for the ever critical needs."
bad,"SAIC touts honesty and integrity and I believe that part is there. The company was split and now it's being merged and the empathy for the employee has gone out the window."
bad,I was at SAIC for a short time and I left after 6 months for a much better opportunity. The compensation and benefits were below industry standards. I would not recommend this company to others.
bad,too much incest when it comes to leadership and promotional opportunities.  too many instances of promotion only for a select few regardless of experience or accomplishment.
bad,Poorly managed and definitely do not look out for their employees.  I would not recommend.  Managers stuck to themselves and were rarely friendly unless it benefited them.
bad,just as any business and job goes; you have your good and bad days.  I did enjoy what i did; however there were times i did not enjoy it under certain conditions.
bad,"Not one of my favorite places to work, as a network administer, at a Law Firm.  The clientele was very aggressive and demanding.  I was only there for a short time."
bad,SAIC I have work there well over 15 years.  Based upon my experience this was a very uptight environment and not very family friendly for work life balance.
bad,I'm embedded at Sandia National Labs. My only real interactions with SAIC are when my manager has to tell us something about time sheets.
bad,"The work SAIC has is excellent.  However, the corporate culture is killing the doers in the company.  They have lost the focus on the employees who provide the excellent products.  SAIC can be summed up by: Great work with no reward."
bad,"I enjoyed working there but a sudden change of management revealed many problems and ignorance.."
bad,"The short time I spent with SAIC was challenging, because most of the people were retired military, from the Vietnam era. The retired military members from the Desert Storm, Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom time frame had a much different mentality and work ethic. The typical workday, since it was on a military installation, was 7 AM to 3:30 PM...with a 30 minute lunch. The work was challenging, but satisfying. However, the work environment was somewhat hostile as the old and young generations did not want to compromise on very many things. Add to that competing companies on the same site, and you have an environment that is conducive to back-stabbing and undue politics. I learned a great deal while I was there and have taken those lessons with me to other jobs."
bad,SAIC had a just get the job done attitude and compensation was low. Management turnover and personnel turnover was quite high
bad,SAIC did a good job in supporting the military while I was employed with the company.
bad,"The company is a body shop. They hire you, use you for as long as the current client has work for you then immediately lays you off. They talk about ""redeployment"" but it is a joke. You have no job security here whatsoever. SAIC bosses never communicate or associate with us - makes it easier for them to write the layoff memo they no is coming because they never had any intention of keeping you long term (even though they said they did in the interview)."
bad,"Benefit was to have a job.  Benefits consistently cut to drop the bottom line, no raises even if well deserved due to the low bidding the contract.  Once the contract was passed over it was strictly a profit based situation that always sided with the company and their low bidding to get the contract, no focus on team building, no information sharing or communication.  Always pointed to a convoluted website that had several log in processes depending on what you were set out to do. Co-workers were convoluted with several sub contractors and lost income due to their taking over the contract.  No career guidance, and not willing to aid employees in gaining a new position when government sequesterization happened in 2013."
bad,Management has been disconnected from the workforce and has not been able to grow the work into other sectors. The recent health care changes have made it difficult to afford personal healthcare. The stock has been poor performing and the constant re-organization has changed the culture negatively for the overall company.
bad,"2nd year with no pay raise, yet bonuses still being paid out. 30-second conversation with supervisor in all of 2012. Management too secretive to employees about contract status."
bad,"My particular set of management was dedicated to company profits at the expense of low-level employee salaries. I was lied to about how I compared to my coworkers to prevent me from getting a raise. I found out after one of my coworkers left that she was making $5,000 more per year when my supervisor told me I was making more than her. I found out after I left that this practice of keeping employee salaries down was common across at least one more project team."
bad,"Corporate has an issue with diversity and discrimination, and any problem is able to be swept under the rug it will be. Since their latest acquisition of Engility they have been cutting benefits and trying to sell them as good things to their employees."
bad,Lack of career development of the employee. The company is not paying attention to employees' technical need for work-related development and the employee remains stagnant.
bad,Wolf in sheep's clothing.  They keep you for as long as they need to get what they need and then let you go.  I was a part of a wave of 20 other employees who were notified 2 weeks before Christmas that their employment was ending just after the new year.
bad,Manager fired me without any contact directly with me.  He let the SAIC Human Resource Manager at an off-site that did not know me at all fire me after over 25 years of being an SAIC employee.
bad,"poor pay, unless your a relative, big promises don't expect any truth, just sooo much old buddy system, SAIC is not getting big contracts any more, going downhill, my guess about to be sold off due to recent spin off of other divisions, and now management renaming to keep up appearances."
bad,"One of the most stressful places I have ever worked. The pace was extremely high, constant fires, 24/7 on call, etc. One major cause of the stress was under-staffing, which allowed for plenty of opportunity to grow and learn different technologies and skills."
bad,"This company has it's issues, as all do. They have gone downhill a bit in the last 3-4 years in the benefits and compensation area. They seem to have lost sight of who they were and what employees mean to them."
bad,Cut throat.  My billet was cut after 9 years with the company and I got little notice I was being laid off.  The company has not done anything to help me find new employment.
bad,OK compensation but poor management- at least on the contract I worked under. No regard for employee advancement for positions below executive level. Poor health benefits.
bad,"Hated it here and would not recommend. The atmosphere is too laid back and only a handful of people actually work. The managers do not know how to lead people and have only made it to lead positions because they have been there forever. A very clique - like environment and if you are not kissing your manager's butt, you won't get any recognition if all you do is work hard and with quality.  The job is simple but after working there you will feel as though you're an idiot. Mind-numbing work. Good place to go if you're right out of school and you're lazy. You will fit in perfectly."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is doing an inventory of critical parts which are hot items needed for every build on the MRAP. I will input and log in faulty parts and place them in their designated area. I will also create work orders for faulty cables as well as cables that need modifications per build. Work with outlook, microsoft word, excel, and SAMS-E. My most enjoyable part of my job is that I know what is expected of me daily and I do it."
bad,"Company has potential. Glad Im not there though, rather clean toilets for a living!"
bad,Loyalty is a thing of the past with SAIC no matter how many years of service you work with them. They promise many things when you work with them especially at the language department but they will not comply.
bad,Job was great minus the management.  Management only cared about their bonus money and didn't care about their employees who are the reason they got the bonus.  Laid off over 75% of their work force due to their leadership skills.
bad,"This job really depends on the leadership coming from the government agency. My SAIC managers are fine to work with and supportive, but the leadership at the agency we serve is another story. They are not responsive to our needs so we cannot get our work done as required. The other civilian employees ignore our requests and treat us with little respect."
bad,"SAIC used to be a pretty nice place to work. But after going public in 2006, the company has steadily slid into a terrible work environment. Pretty much all decisions are now based on what it will do for stock price and quarterly earnings reports. Benefits have been cut every year--including doing away with Employee Stock Program to cutting medical."
bad,Far too many layers of management. Management is concerned with keeping their jobs at the expense of cutting PM's and Ops managers instead of taking out the high value managers.
bad,Everyone was out for themselves. Did not share any information.
bad,It isn't wise for me to give you an opinion about my old employer. What if your security fails and what I say gets out.
bad,"Great workplace, great employees.  As the particular contract came near the end, the management slowly deteriorated in expertise, and experience.  The benefit package is not very beneficial."
bad,"Flat growth and apathetic management take away from the few positives"
bad,"My first time working for such a large company. I was surprised to learn how how difficult personalities could manipulate management. "
bad,The good
bad,"Flex hours for many departments, nice work areas, a real assistant available to each employee in department, management varies greatly, sudden layoffs due to poor bookkeeping on projects."
bad,This was by far the most HOSTILE work environment mentally outside of the military I have ever worked in. The lack of leadership and focus clearly took away from the daily mission.
bad,"Management is the absolute worst, does not care about their employees, only about the numbers in their paycheck."
bad,"This company exists to collect money from US government sources providing system engineering consulting and program management services.  The executive team, and the company culture is great, with a healthy amount of resources and events to communicate the high level status of the company. Excellent here, however one level below this executive team is where the company has problems. Middle management is based on a volunteer type basis to capture contracts. The ones I have encountered so far are not capable as business managers, with poor people skills.  "
bad,"Hurricane Sandy brought in increased shoal levels throughout New Jersey.  FEMA in association with the state of New Jersey Contracted a company to do the drudging.  They also contracted a company (SAIC) to monitor work flows and Quality Assurance of the job.  "
bad,"Few foot solders and too many chiefs."
bad,Joined in with high hopes of PS HR 9.0 Core HR and Benefits implementation and support but it was more of document change control and maintenance role.
bad,"Looking "
bad,"I worked in Charlottesville, VA. After leaving the contract for a new position and many, many months of limited answers, promises and assurances that my upcoming position was moving forward, I am once again looking for work. The management gives only the most basic information to employees and never attempts to give you information that you do not ask for. You have to write and call several different heads of departments before you are dealt with in a legitimate manner. The managers do not care about employees, they simply care about getting their end of year performance review so they can move up the chain."
bad,"Easy going, nice people, benefits and pay aren't very competitive, projects can be interesting depending on where you land and you might get to do what you like or not!"
bad,"SAIC continually bids for short to medium term contracts tied to the government, or private sector companies that carry government contracts.  The jobs differ greatly, and like any contract job is innately unstable."
bad,"the management is disengaged or too engaged no middle ground for growth"
bad,"Good Ole Boy network is very rampant in the Charleston, SC business unit.   If you're outsider, then you will have no place  there.  During my time there, I see those who were part of the network advance while others who were more qualified did not advance."
bad,"SAIC is a horrible work experience. Benefits were reduced to a nearly non-existent state while the costs of the benefits rise steeply. Layer after layer of bureaucratic management but no leadership anywhere. Overpaid corporate executives with only an eye on the profit margin are the norm. Nepotistic hiring practices, fraud accusations and convictions, and questionable ethical practices are rampant. Lay-offs with no compensation, severance, or even placement assistance are a company policy."
bad,"I unfortunately, had several ineffective line managers. By them not following up on reports and learning the truth, I lost my job. My project team was devastated. The best part of my job was my project team and co-workers. Dedicated, ethical, hardworking, yet fun to work with."
bad,"This company now operates on the fringes.  The hiring is simply pathetic, the employees are worse, and the culture is getting worse by the minute.  Used to be an awesome company, now simply chasing the dollar sign."
bad,"A frustrating place to work. The company, especially Human Resources is very secretive about everything. Policies are open to interpretation depending on who you are and the situation at the time. HR rarely if ever gives a good answer to questions asked. A lot of politics. Money is the main concern for this company."
bad,"At SAIC, you are just another employee, a number. The benefits are the most complained about issue at the company. Many of my coworkers left because of healthcare coverage."
bad,I have no comments.  I no longer for this company and there is nothing special.  It was an average work day.  I have no further updates to report.  I was glad to have a job.
bad,"I don't recommend working for this company. I've worked here for over 10 years, and I've been underpaid the entire time. The management is horrible, and the hours aren't great."
bad,"The opportunities to engage and work with the military from a contractors point was very rewarding however as a former military member, the lack of support purported in the guidelines of the company's policy is laughable. As an active guard member, you must be careful when performing you military obligations. The law requires the company to rehire you back but if the contract goes away, you can be left out in the cold which has happened to countless friends an military members that I have served with."
bad,"While this is by far the best group of employees I've ever worked with, the executive leadership is very flavor-of-the-day.  We've had excessive CEO turnover and have really underperformed."
bad,"SAIC's corporate culture may be a perk for executives, but can be burdensome to the typical employee.  Salaries are very low for the same job."
bad,"fine, intense deadlines, multi-tier upper management, worked here only through acquisition of previous company."
bad,Destroyed chemical weapons while employed. Was a shift supervisor and the job was rewarding. Primarily I made sure that operators were safe while destroying the chemical weapons.
bad,Ive worked for IT companies before and I have to say the amount of work you do vs the pay is completely out of wack. DO not start a career here. I will say if you are experienced and get a job OTHER than help desk or a general IT position they will compensate you well. You will learn nothing.
bad,"Good team and management to work with"
good,"High turnover, disorganized management. Constant organization restructure and the constant loom and doom of layoffs. No consistant policy guidelines. Poor training."
good,"Micromanage everything. No tools, no commitment, learned to that SAIC is not a company for growth. Good co-workers thou, need to do something about management."
good,"Simply put, they did not know how to manage a team. When contracts were available, they did not pursue them based on their own laurels."
good,This was one of the most highly stressful work situations I have ever been in. My schedule changed on a whim without reason. Management constantly degraded staff. Jobs were often threatened.
good,"Typical scrum/agile shop."
good,I'm a very hard worker & love to stay busy. At my job its all ways slow. There no room to move up. They aren't very helpful with helping me to drop off & pick up my boys from school. Management shows favoritism & they say they listen to try & fix problems but they always get over looked depending who you are.
good,Management has almost no technical under-pinning.  No strategic vision on systems development.
good,"SAIC was a stressful experience.  I felt overworked, and because we are issued laptops, there are expectations to work from home.  This creates a lack of work life balance."
good,"The communication from management is near zero. Weekly meetings to stay up to date with what is occurring does not exist on current assignment."
good,"SAIC was a good stepping stone into the computer science field, especially if you intend to do government work. If you have a good Service Line Team Leader, and a good project, it is very easy to be happy here."
good,"This company underbid a contract that I was on and waited until the last week before sending out offer letters. Then we found out why they cut my salary by 20% (other co-workers said the same).  Most of us had less than a week to decide to come aboard and take the cut or look elsewhere. Ouch!!"
good,"No loyalty to the employees for hard work. Lays offs were frequent. Production was high pace. Stressful environment. Good pay but no advancement. Contracts run out, your job is gone."
good,"Most of my comments are based off of the program manager that we had on the job, not the company. culture was horrible with long working days for week"
good,I work as a console operator my hours are awful (3pm-Midnight) everyday i struggle looking for parking even doe we have a garage my supervisor doesn't help me move forward in my career dead end job
good,"The company every years takes more and more benefits away from it's employees. It does very little to retain it's employees with the company. People are not motivated to continue work with the company. It's basically a large man power organization. Many of it's employee's skills need some work. With some effort, this company can be made better. However, the leadership does not give the impression that they care about employees."
good,"Great co-workers, poor management. Ethics issues...overall."
good,Not willing to direct the Customer towards set goals. Too worried about saving money at the cost of the Employees. All about appearance versus outcome.
good,When you need management to support you they tend to not do it. Some employees are allowed to do things others aren't. There are some employees out to sabotage your position and it's allowed as management would take things at face value rather than investigate to confirm what is said is the truth. One must bow down to seasoned employees to keep the peace and when you don't you're dealing with immature employees until they tire of the situation and go on to the next victim. The work itself can be rewarding it's the people you work with that cause the pressure and stress.
good,"Great company for entering level to Mid level employees. However if your looking for advancement or training opportunities you'll be disappointed. Compensation packages are competitive but only with other Government contract companies. Performance is not rewarded, so negotiate for your best compensation package upon initial hiring."
good,"I have had the chance to work with several of the larger defense contracting companies and they all have similar, and ever shrinking, benefits packages. They also offered little to no leadership or professional growth and development training."
good,"Cyber analyst"
good,"Integrate MRAP vehicle Comm system and learning Remedy system . "
good,It is a good place to work. Management is very good. Team work is ok. The company provides coffee. The company has a great culture and the drive to succeed.
good,"About average for DC area defense contractors. Immediate supervisor was a good manager, but very poor leader of people. ""I've got your back"" is not in this company's vocabulary or culture, (and i have worked many other places.) I'm in it for the paycheck, sorry to say.  That's why I'm here on this job board doing this writeup."
good,SAIC was 10 years ago a fabulous company to work for when they were privately owned by the employees. Like all greedy defense companies however they went public and the pay and benefits went south quickly. As the military draws down which they are beginning to do the prospects for SAIC and other defense companies is going to be sharp and dramatic. SAIC has a tendency to underbid contracts and the way they make up the difference is to reduce pay and eliminate benefits. The intelligent move would be to bypass the defense industry and concentrate primarely on other segments of the economy. SAIC is reknown for massive layoffs and terminations to underscore their bottom line.
good,"Review and validate all long distance bills for 24 clients. Review and approve or disapprove work requests and trouble tickets. Type tickets for clients that are out of the office. Research and provided updated information on all telecomunication instructions. Plan, review all building designs, and follow thru on all new installations, conversions, moves adds or changes to any clients telecommunications needs. install new equipment, and make sure the old is properly disposed of according to the law. "
good,SAIC transition from Dr Beyster's employee ownership model to a public company changed forever the fantastic incubator for technically-centric customer support.  The shift to a project management centric approach and away from technical excellence created a much less desirable environment.
good,"As the Information Assurance Subject Matter Expert, I conduct Certification and Accreditation activities daily."
good,"This company has changed a lot. It used to be a great company to work for not it is an ok company to work for, they have a lot of changes coming down the pike. There is no job security anymore and no desire to keep long term employees."
good,Talk to ppl everyday on the phone that had a problem or issue with payment. I learned that you can't please everybody. Management was Horrible. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help someone that needed help the most.
good,"It is a great company to work for but, to get advancement you require at least a friend in some form of a management position, or are willing to do something you are not comfortable doing!"
good,"I normally work 9-10 hours a day. When overcome with too much work, I don’t get any help from leaders to find additional experienced help. No bonuses for extra efforts."
good,Everything changed about the company when it became public. Lost a lot of its direction and focus on ethics and employees. They still cannot get a grasp on how to restructure management. It changes almost every year making employees report to different managers from different groups who they are not connected to. Does not leave a lot of hope for employee recognition or performance reviews. They do not do much for redeploying to a new internal position when you lose coverage.
good,Company continues to restructure itself at times not really focused on workers who are losing coverage and redeploying them to new opportunities. They also have cut back on employee benefits.
good,"SAIC has fabulous internal tools that are easy to access and provide you with everything you need to do your job at your desk or in your home or hotel room."
good,they cared about the money.. and not the employees  so what does it  mater that they don't like us.. our ceo went back to government. so what does that tell you
good,"SAIC is a government contractor. SAIC only seems to give ""cost of living raises"" and calls them real raises. The health benefits have a very high deductible and it's hard to meet that deductible for me and my wife. I have struggled financially due to the pay and high cost of the benefits."
good,FSFSC is a non profit organization that's vastly growing and is a good place to begin and end a career. Every job could be better but this job is making a community impact.
good,Because of high security the environment is somewhat difficult. Restrictions for on duty and off duty hours. Some teammates are exceedingly difficult to work with because of multi-cultural demands as would be expected working in federal programs.
good,"Proposal writing"
good,"They are not a bad company, but there is no advancement. All in all not a bad working environment."
good,"Working spreadsheets for accuracy. Various spreadsheets, data input, accountability, and leadership. Most management believe they are still in the military, but being married to a retired military I know how to adjust. Great co-workers. Dealing with no opportunity for advancement. Finding my own way to learn something new."
good,"This is a good company to get started in the consulting industry.  The small office I have worked in for the past 6 years does not have much upward mobility.  Other than the stagnation in my current position, I don't have too many negative things to say.  SAIC did change the Co. health insurance at the beginning of 2013 to an unaffordable, high deductible plan.  They blamed it on the ACA.  There was also a ton of traveling on short notice."
good,"SAIC was a great company when it was employee owned but now it is a lost company, pandering to Wall Street analysts. The company also does not invest in its employees, the training budget has been nonexistent for years."
good,Normal work day consists of installing linux and virtual machines on servers and laptops for vessel installations.
good,"I would have to discuss my impressions privately. I worked there until the project was cancelled, then the company had no desire to find placement. My 401k matched funds were returned to the company since the 5000 hours did not occur. They have incentive to not find placement. The manager did tell me I did the work of 5 guys, but they couldn't place me anywhere else in the company."
good,"I was a recruiting coordinator. There was no work to do, nothing to learn and no appreciation if you asked for more responsibility. Recruiters were not happy to have the help and many never reached out or answered emails. No chance to interact with management, they had no interest in the RCs at all."
good,"The benefits have decreased since 2012 and the communication from the top down is not as great as it could be. The opportunity to grow is slim. If you are good at your job, you may be pigeon-holed in that position regardless of your want or needs to grow into something more."
good,I held different roles at SAIC; first as a new D/PM for the DCI Special Security center support D/CIA/Office of Security; was later promoted to PM.  Then took a PM roles managing an overseas linguist program.  Both decentl jobs with minimal management oversight.  The sr. level management level expertise was missing.
good,"The job itself isn't awful, nor is the company, however upper management doesn't care about their employees and see them as replaceable pawns. They have the most backwards ways of running some projects, and don't have the workers' best interests in mind. Pay is decent if you're a higher level, but at entry level, it's definitely not enough to live off of with the cost of living."
good,"Work environment is relatively quiet, but few advancements, training and opportunities.  Very difficult to move out of the position you were hired to fill."
good,"Typical call center, except no privacy between you and other co-workers, you sit right next to and behind your co-workers as they're on the phone.  The Break times are odd and kind of rushed.  Things in the kitchen didn't work and were never repaired. Sometimes people brought in food for others and left it in the break rooms.  There were holiday parties. Working in a call center and repeating the same phrases over and over and over again, every day, begins to drive you crazy.  They keep the blinds closed in the room so even when it's sunny outside you can't see outside or see any sunlight -- it's a bit depressing."
good,"Great co workers, call center average. Management and Managers were great to work with on a daily basis. They have flexible hours with working time of 24/7."
good,All business feel with no sense of caring about the employee. Pay was cut more than 20 percent simply to get a contract vice rewarding those who do the most for the company and customer.
good,"Was hired on with a company that SAIC had bought out, and salary offer was cut by 12% so they could keep more overhead. Corporate managers were good, government customer was difficult and wanted clerical support rather than what job description had said (Senior Project Analyst). No opportunity for advancement. My experience was interesting but I believe also unique, would still recommend to others."
good,Job tasks were planed to accomplish a proof of concept and then to be used to modernize the remaining fleet of NSC boats for the US Coast Guard. It was a fast phased program with oversight from Home Land Security office of the US Government.
good,The company offers excellent benefits and flexible working hours. Most positions within the Shared Services Center are in an open office setting. But total job production is not based on entire job description.
good,"I worked for the company before and after it became a publicly traded company. As an employee owned company you felt vested in the company and was enjoyable to come to work. After a publicly traded company it became very ""corporate"" and the workers felt like numbers. Big executive pay and cheap labor seemed to be the policy. more competitive job offers at other places."
good,"Not bad, but not great. SAIC focuses on using at-home workers to keep overhead down, which is their focus: keeping overhead down to maximize share-holder profits. Naturally, this affect how workers are treated and the quality of the company's products."
good,Bad attitudes across the board - the benefits were good - there is no chance for advancement - the way to advance in this company is to leave and re-hire.
good,"Over all I had a nice experience. had good coworkers, they gave great Xmas parties, typical day was laid back. stress free atmosphere, could have interact with management a little more."
good,Re-alignment of the company makes it difficult to manage people and projects. Top-heavy management eroding away employee pay and benefits. It is not the same company as designed by its founder. typical public-traded company held hostage by shareholder expectations of high returns.
good,"worked with great people, travelled, and learned a lot.  They made sure I was taken care of.  The hardest part was travelling away from my family"
good,"Working at SAIC, you must be prepared for a challenge each day. Clients and customers expect strong service and completion of tasking by requested deadline. SAIC has many layers of management that sometimes makes it hard to know what direction to move towards. Everyone is helpful and supporting."
good,"Total lack of follow through for the managers."
good,"Worked for SAIC as a contractor, very demanding but co-workers great to work with."
good,"A good day at work at SAIC was when I was given an assignment and allowed to complete it on schedule using my experience and knowledge."
good,"Learned many programming language"
good,A typical work day was boring with hardly any tasking.  I did learn contracting and financial skills while working for SAIC.  Management seemed not interested in my tasking or what my skills were.  My co-workers were somewhat friendly.  The hardest part of the job was going to work knowing my skills were not going to be used and knowing I would not have anything to do.  There were not any enjoyable parts of my job.
good,"As long as the contract(s) you're working stay viable...your chance of job security is good (providing you do a good job, of course)."
good,If your looking for a job with advancement look else where this position is 100% temporary
good,"A typical workday is 13 hours of integrating or deintegrating MRAP vehicles. I hace great co-workers but not the best management team. The hardest part of the job is being there for long periods of time working around dust and sand. I learned and excelled in reconnaissance, communication, and satellite systems of these vehicles."
good,"No loyalty to employee, Multiple layoff in 3 years, no solid pay scale, contract work that rises and falls like the tides of the ocean. I could be layoof any day now."
good,"EMA/SAIC gave me the oppurtunity to learn about working with personnel that had no military experience and/or discipline. I had to overcome my inexperience of dealing with people that were whiners, lazy and had no work ethic."
good,"The hardest part is not being kept aware of lack of funding, abrupt notification that we would get laid off, had to find out from govt sponsor, not from company rep"
good,"It’s not remotely anything like the company i joined a couple of days ago. It went from a company with great benefits to one that doesn’t stand out. It used to have a collegiate work environment to a body shop. If they were to compare themselves to similar companies, ho hum"
good,SAIC offers good benefits and compensation.  Work/life balance was a little off balance due to the compressed project time schedule that we were up against.
good,"Many years ago I really liked this job but at the time there seemed to be some real confusion who was really in charge at the facility.  Military and civilian employees were mixed and they seemed to involve the care staff in their power struggle so it was difficult to follow instructions without being insubordinate to either the military or civilian manager."
good,Typical big chain defense contractor. Less involved with employees than most though. Middle management criteria for roles and bona fides lacks regiment.
good,I have truly learned alot professionally and academically at SAIC. I do seem to find it hard to remote work due to the company. I have a mentally ill child and a mother with numerous medical problems. Trying to get SAIC (my current and passed managers) to even consider remote working does not seem to be an option. I have short termed (1-2 days to about 2 months) telecommuted but that is about it.
good,Some meetings were productive but many were not useful. Work load was intense - learned better time management. Team environment was great but management failed to acknowledge the staff.
good,Typical DOD/Government contractor. Every contract is different. I was privileged to work on some really good ones and with good people. Other contracts were less than desirable.
good,SAIC is better than most government contractors that I have worked for.  They are fair and treat their employees well.  The group that i worked in had a very knowledgeable management staff.  They were open and honest about contracts that were in the works.
good,Enjoyed working in a cutting edge environment with great systems development assessment skills with many artifacts for different applications. Analysis of requirements using modeling tools.
good,Depends on the sector you hire into is what drives the work environment  you will have. Make sure to check the benefits as their accrued vacation has dwindled and their health insurance is very expensive.
good,Good company overall with productive staff and good culture.  Government contracts can be difficult - no raises and no room for advancement of career.
good,"They are an ok company to work for but not a good work/life balance. You have a job as long as there is a contract to work on or you are part of the ""click""."
good,Very busy. Must be able to shift priorities on urgent requests. Must be able to perform under pressure in order to meet government deadlines on a daily basis.
good,Exciting engineering work developing cutting edge systems. Development work and test facilities located in various parts of the US so significant travel required.
good,"They are contractors. They hire bodies to fill slots. There are a lot of talented people working there but they are all viewed as replaceable. They have no loyalty to any employees. "
good,Good place to work of you can manage to get security clearance. easy work for a government contractor.  good benefits and work environment. very difficult to get clearance. will go over your life with fine tooth comb.
good,"Employees are great and there is a great vibe around the office, but all of the management is very corporate and there is no employee support.  They do not work to help with advancement and don't communicate with people."
good,bonne ambiance au sein de l'équipe. entre aide entre les collègues
good,Large government contractor with lots of interesting work. Little to no advancement opportunities. Good work life balance.
good,"Since splitting the company is still establishing its culture and defining the type of company it wants to be.  The people who work there make it a good place to work and their talent result in a continual flow of new and somewhat interesting tasks.  There is a bit of a ""hero"" culture that relies very heavily on the strength of highly talented individuals and results in a perceived lack of fairness when it comes to compensation.  Leaning toward becoming a bureaucracy will certainly present challenges moving forward for SAIC to retain top talent and challenge the company to perform without its heros."
good,"Great place to work, supportive employees. Promote education and provide funding to attend school. I would recommend them to other other employees. Pay on time."
good,"It is challenging work with allot of diversity in the company in vast area of expertise.  Would like to have a much better insurance, 401K and leave increase"
good,"It was a sub-contractor position. I find my coworkers are friendly and helpful. The time is flexible and there was no micro-management. However, job security was not good, especially for contractors. And they may not allow their employee/manager to give you reference when the contract ended."
good,My coworkers are great to work for day in and day out. The only thing that is not all that great is the benefits and wages. The work and management that I work with directly are great. They keep me informed and keep me updated at all times.
good,"I've worked for the company for nearly 4 years, and the project that I was brought into was the Natural Gas boom in north central PA. While the perks were fantastic when we first started, they are god awful now. My section of the company has too many managers that manage other managers. In essence, they are almost never billable and soak up extremely way too much overhead. One thing that I have learned in my time there was that no matter how great quality or poor quality your work performed is, you are all treated the same way. We had some co-workers jeopardize large contracts over several repeated mistakes, and they weren't any repercussions. This was very frustrating for the people that had tremendous drive and work ethics. The company lost several valuable employees due to the fact that work wasn't rewarded through merit."
good,"I worked 12 hr days, 7 days a week.  the time that I was off, I would have to be available to work.  the only good things about he job was the amount of things that I learned, the people that I worked with, and the 7 days off.  the hardest part of the job was the 12 hr days.  they were long and hard."
good,Leidos... the company formally known as SAIC.  Used to be a special place to work and hopefully will be again...
good,"Business is declining since company split."
good,The work load was fairly easy.  Management is what made this job stressful as they were not in tune with the needs of the contract and the scope of the mission.
good,"Making travel arrangements, managing director and business unit mangers calendars, appointments.  Helping deployed employees with payroll issues, issuance of laptops, cell phones and corporate credit cards.  I processed expense reports and purchased office supplies using SAIC's purchasing software Ariba, processed purchased orders and checks to vendors.  My co-workers were very helpful and just good folks to work with.  The hardest part of my job was getting new employess into the SAIC system due to their lack of understanding and lack of relevant paperwork needed for the start of work.  Most of my day was enjoyable, I liked my job."
good,"PCS III gave me the opportunity to learn at a different level then other PC positions.  In this position we used a deeper level of tracking on a much larger Project.  I learned different ways of tracking cost, revenue and accruals.  This group had a more structured way were all PC's were following uniform rules of managing their projects.  Team work was made easier when everyone followed the same way of managing."
good,The company and people are great to work with. The products we worked on are the best on the market. If we only had someone to sell our products to I would still be working their.
good,"Not enough to do"
good,"Since the company is going through a major re-structuring phase (company split), there are uncertainties concerning job security and problems with internal communications between departments. Overall, the management seems to be dedicated to the company's mission and it can be a pleasant work experience."
good,"Busy job, I should act multitask and be prepared for all sudden changing in process of project, should help in other aspects in addition my direct responsibilities as per supervisor request.  "
good,Often there is a feeling that it's all about the contract and the employee is nothing but a number
good,I liked working here as it provided me with the much needed experience. I worked a short term contract with them that had no potential of being permanent. After working 3 months with them this job opened the door for bigger and greater things.
good,Average Company with average benefits
good,- Upper management constantly changes and often disconnected from personnel in their businees units.
good,Great group and personnel throughout; the culture of work in harmony in a teamwork setting has been appreciated.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing as a team player we are saving more lives as our military uses our products to fight the war on terrorism.
good,Contracting is difficult to comment on because the customer changes so frequently and funding varies by city and branch location. Co-workers were outstanding and the compensation was competitive.
good,"It is hard to write a review of SAIC since, even though it is one company, it acts as if it were a series of small businesses. Leadership is trying to promote 1 SAIC but the ""numbers"" requirements has each operation as well as divisions competing with each other. The people are top notch both professionally and personally. Some BUs are very good about professional development while others are not as good."
good,"SAIC as a whole is not a bad company to work for. Work and life balance have always been a hard thing for me to do and I find it even harder with this company than ever before. I find that the Job Security is not very secure as the contracts I've been on have been short. We are always hoping for longer ones, but they seem to few and far between."
good,"The company offers good pay and incentives. They have tons of resources available online ( which includes quite a few mandatory training ). They have extremely strict time charging policies; while this is not a bad thing, sometimes there is poor direction on what they would like done ( or preferred way of something being done ). Do not overestimate your worth, even someone with 15 years to the company and an OUTSTANDING performance record can be let go without a thought. One critical thing to remember ( Especially dealing with contracts as SAIC handles a lot of military contracts ) as an employee you are expendable and upper management will NOT put the time, effort, and the company's reputation to help out an employee or defend his actions even if it is the CORRECT course of action and follows the company's policy to the ""T"". If the customer is unsatisfied for whatever reason it can be your job on the line."
good,"Typcial day at SAIC is working about 10-11 hours and having to go through a lot of audits processes. Co-workers are very friendly and a joy to work with. Management is difficult to work for, some managers are very rude & talk down to their employees. There's a lot of micro-management at SAIC."
good,SAIC WAS a great place to work. It slowly changed and went to pot after going public.
good,management was poor and jobs not clearly described. was misinformed at interview and ended up walking into a job that i was unprepared to do
good,This position was a great learning opportunity and also empowered you to make strategic recommendations and decisions about the IT infrastructure and processes.
good,"Saic is s Defense Contractor.  In this business it's hard to have a long term career since you are always one RFP loss away from a New Prime Contractor. I changed position internally as often as I could, tenure  out grows the salary ceiling,  so always look for your next assignment."
good,"I'm an onsite contractor with SAIC so I'm not really tied in with the company on a day to day basis. "
good,I have worked at this same location for Engility and now SAIC for 4.5 years.  It is at a slow pace type work right now.  I did all the sewing for both Engility and SAIC as well as doing the building of consoles and benches.  I liked working for this company when we had steady work.
good,An okay company. Not much room for upward mobility. Very hard to move in to upward management. Not much in the way of employee development. Pay did not match ability and credentials.
good,"I enjoy protecting our troops with the job I do!"
good,Culture was good. A lot of young employees. They were pretty flexible with family issues. They allowed employees to work through lunch.  Management had some bias'. Ultimately it wasn't a good fit for me.
good,"My time at SAIC has been on a single contract. My take is that the culture largely depends on the contract one supports; the projects and priorities often touted on the corporate intranet don't always align with how the satellite offices operate. Rather, the office will - quite understandably - try to mirror initiatives that the government customer is concerned with."
good,"I am currently in a government contracting role at the customer site. So these dynamics do affect the work, work life balance, job security/advancement opportunities as it relates to the government contract. The ""contract"" affects how things are structured and executed. Management and Job culture is a variable that SAIC can control and there are a lot of missed opportunities here in terms of communication, transparency, and presence - meaning they tend to have an hands off approach when a hands on approach is needed in the areas mentioned above especially during contract recompetes."
good,"A typical day at SAIC includes running reports, downloading solicitations, submitting requests for proposals, providing bids to the government, and communication with customers to answer questions and/or problem-solving.  What I have learned is the need to support our troops by providing quick and accurate supplies and information."
good,SAIC had very poor management in the department I worked for. You could easily get your work done but there wasn't support from the management team. The staff was easy to work with.
good,"I have submitted my Reviews for SAIC twice.  The overall company itself is a great place to work when it is solely SAIC, but when Contracting with them, not so good."
good,"Government contracting job with good pay and benefits. But it was contracting, so when it's over, it's over. Laid off when contract got close to ending."
good,We worked 90 hr work weeks to get the job done and win the contract only to be told we were overpaid and not needed anymore once they won the contract
good,"There are many different business groups to become employed within, if you are clear about your career goals.  This company has many different areas that prospective employees might become hired."
good,"not a sweat shop, but during my time the opportunities for advancement were limited.  Culture shift from employee owned to public changed a lot of the culture to strictly bottom line. Killed a lot of creative ideas."
good,"I believe that as a whole, SAIC is a fine company. However, they have allowed things to happen between Leads/managers and the workers at the lower levels (I cannot speak on corporate). It seems that where I work for SAIC, race is a deciding factor for jobs."
good,"There is not much to say about this company.  Standard show up, do some work, get paid type of culture.  Did not have opportunities for advancement personally or professionally."
good,"There were opportunities that I was qualified for that my leadership didn't provide time to pursue prior to termination notice. As a previous manager in charge of a multi-million dollar System Engineering/Operations program, when I was informed that we didn't win a recompete, I instructed and guided my staff through a professional transition to new team and then I found new positions for my folks.  That's what a manager is supposed to do."
good,"I enjoy my job at SAIC, however with all Government Contractor there will always be ups and downs, its just part of it. Each project is very different and operates differently."
good,The place is great to work for. However for me  I was temp for several months with multiple promises of being made perm in the next month. This continues and the pay was mediocre compared to my previous office work. I hear that permanent pay is not much better with most starting in the high 30k category after a somewhat mandatory 6 month temp.
good,"Management is not ideal in the Charleston area, but my understanding is it is much better in the corporate office of McLean, Virginia. However, they do have a flexible schedule. Benefits are lacking in some areas, such as insurance and sick days, but they do have a lot of vacation days."
good,"A typical day would consist of checking for coordination emails, that set up meetings with cyber training range stake holders.  I learned a new aspect of cyber, from the infrastructure ide where it is built versus conducting intelligence analysis on people using it.  Co-workers were helpful if I asked, poor communication, original team kept to themselves.  Mission continues to be executed.  Hardest part was communicating with other contractors on the team. Most enjoyable part of the day and when I make progress on a task that has taken a long time to complete."
good,"SAIC was a wonderful place before they went public. When I left in 2012 they had degraded, though. Lots of typical corporate though processes had infiltrated the ranks of management to the detriment of the work environment. HR was difficult to navigate, benefits suffered, and I found myself surrounded by almost all inexperienced folks (read: cheap). I was told that ""some turnover is good"" and whenever I inquired to management about upward mobility I was put off. There are a lot of opportunities available there due to sheer company size, and like most places some branch offices/business units are better than others."
good,"Changing management landscape can pose challenges"
good,"Management for my particular job set was not very helpful. As soon as I was placed, management was hands off. I would still recommend this company"
good,"SAIC is a very good company. "
good,"A typical day for a security specialist starts out with a line of employees needing employee badges for various reasons. Once badges are ordered, computer audits take place and documented. After all systems have been audited, we handle any employee adverse reports. After lunch, we go and check on the other facilities (2) and see if they have whatever they need and also ensuring that everyone is abiding by the rules. The hardest part of my job is the fact that it is something different everyday. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that you helped someone out today.IIIII"
good,"A typical day at SAIC would be checking emails and responding to messages or requests for information, checking JPAS and ACAVS for clearance updates, meeting with program managers and staff to update clearance statuses, send VARs and prepare courier orders, prepare nomination packages for adjudicative review and clearance determinations.  The hardest part of this job was having too many contracts to manage with no support from management.  I enjoyed the work, my co-workers, and the managers, but needed an assistant to help with the workload."
good,Everything is ok unless you lose your contract. The company makes claims about helping employees find other work in those instances and it may work out for some but not for most. I wish they would be honest about it. The job is what you make if it and the luck of the draw in terms of the co-workers you get to work alongside.
good,"From 2007 - 2008 Task lead was in DC, and came down to the site once a month for ""vacation"" to see how things were going.  A bunch of old guys were running the show and were doing their ""thing"" and there was no communication with us younger folks.  Communication barrier and the ""team"" just fell apart.  This effected the project's success and I left the project as it was a bitter and sour environment."
good,The hours of the job are from 7:30 to 4 and the workload varies depending on the deployment status of the Marines.
good,"A large company, I think it depends on which office you are at and the people you are working with that will influence your judgement of the work environment."
good,"when government is dishing money out like crazy this is a great place to work, once that stops well no more job."
good,I work with great people and am challenged every day to use all my skills
good,"Independent work pace to complete assignments"
good,"Large company, lower paying, takes a long time to advance; stereotypical meat grinder contractor.  Decent job security.  Wide variations in different groups and teams."
good,"The people you work with are awesome and the environment is great, but they tack on more and more responsibility without compensating you for it.  "
good,It was a good company to first start off contracting with.  Opened my eyes to the government contracting world.
good,"The workload is consistent and diverse.  There is most likely at least one team if not a number of teams that any given person can comfortabley adapt to.  Team members are friendly, helpful, and supportive.  Local management is fair, helpful and resourceful.    "
good,Promotions based on personal relationships
good,SAIC does a poor job of staff redeployment when contracts are completed
good,"SAIC seeks to break new ground every day providing thrilling new technologies. I worked for them in San Antonio Tx within a highly diverse and eclectic group designing and modeling new cross over fashions and accessories...Never a dull moment. I learned that SAIC excels in color coordination. Coworkers were exceptional. I was taught every thing about material insouciance, deceptive color control and camouflage. The hardest part of the job was fine line analysis and color coordinating non material assets."
good,"I learned a lot while working for SAIC and advanced my troubleshooting and skill through SAIC, however, during my employment the company decided to unethically do away with time and a half overtime and just go to straight pay and while being deployed we lost our uplift for a total of a 30% loss in pay. At this rate working overtime in the states I can make the same amount of pay and being with the company I have not gotten a raise in 2 years though I have had excellent reviews because of unethical business being conducted in NYC. I like the hours stateside but my job is not available back home when I leave Afghanistan next month."
good,"I joined SAIC way back in January 2001, and I will take with me many fond memories of the trials, tribulations and accomplishments I’ve achieved here! I’ve grown both personally and professionally and I attribute much of my growth to the amazing people that I’ve worked with and the awesome opportunities that SAIC has provided me."
good,"Ability to remain with the firm based solely on bottom line, not longevity, dedication, and skill level."
good,"Most positions telecommute. This company has a ""consultant"" feel for full time employees."
good,"Since being at SAIC, I have moved around into different job areas. although, you tend to get use to doing a certain thing and become comfortable, a new experince is alway a welcome change. I have moved up in positions greater with higher expectations because of my ability to perform well. I have been given opportunities and have been able to accomplish any task put before me. Although my job title has not change, reasoning know, I held many positions at SAIC and succeeded. Management has been a very supportive role in my achievments and rewarded me for a job well done. The hardest part of the jobs have been being placed in jobs with little or no training. For instance, someone may go on travel suddenly and they choose me to fill that position. The most enjoyable part is getting to know a various jobs and many people in the company. I work well with others and have always fit right in with a new team. The benefits are excellent, but the job is not secure. I've seen many lay-off's since I've been here. I have made it thru all of them so far. I count my blessings. I am single and support myself, so I'm looking for something more dependable. My job tends to be what I wrap my life around. Dedication, that's me."
good,"Good workplace, decent benefits. Harder working in a satellite branch, didn't have the same resources. Positive workplace, diverse, easy to fit in and feel welcomed."
good,"Not to be counted on for long term. Uses employees to achieve short term goals. Once goals achieved laid off, when other companies would award bonuses."
good,"The company has standard benefits, standard hours and for some positions has longevity.  The work/life balance will vary by department and position and manager."
good,"Some really interesting people here at SAIC.  It is an old-fashioned, former government employee staffed firm.  So it is a top down sort of place.  But still, the work is interesting."
good,"Decent company to work for."
good,I enjoyed my 10 year tenure with SAIC and had planned on retiring from there.  I enjoyed working with the wonderful individuals I had grown to enjoy getting to know.
good,Performed work at government site and had very little interaction with SAIC and management or even employees at SAIC. Considered if I had been at corporate it could have been a good experience. The insurance was expensive for what you get on the government side.
good,"Been working for government contracting for years and in our area, its always who you know, who you're friends with, who will back you up.  Higher management usually have to balance between who's friends they are with and outside of work.  Other companies have been more professional in my opinion no matter who you're friends with."
good,"Reputable corporation with an excellent reputation in management consulting, providing opportunities in many arenas. Workplace culture is extremely supportive and collaborative."
good,"Leadership is engaged, positive and accessible."
good,Management was not in tune with employees. Rigid schedules long hours even when not needed to accomplish goals.  No room for advancement. Travel was nice.
good,"Great benifits if you can offord them, very slow pace work get boring from time to time. Doesn’t get to know your employers. Working with others who don’t care about you."
good,"As my first job out of college, it was not bad. I got to talk about career goals with my boss a lot and received adequate guidance from him. Unfortunately, from above him, there came almost no support."
good,Most of my work is Proprietary Information. But the most enjoyable part of my job was all of the traveling i did. I would prefer an out of country position if available.
good,Pleasant and friendly atmosphere. Opportunity for advancement with hands on approach by management. Hires from within before selecting from outside the company. Emphasis on advancing career thru education and on the job training.
good,SAIC provides the PEO IWS acquisition managers with a non-stop flow of status updates on IWS programs and projects.The focus is on providing Navy ships with ordnance on target.
good,"Typical professional services firm - juggling several jobs simultaneously, to include contract support, business development, etc.  Does promote from within, albeit sometimes the wrong individuals."
good,SAIC was not totally at fault for the shortcomings of the contract I was working.  The Civil Service leadership was overly aggressive and lacked understanding of what each employee's work day consisted of.
good,"The management I have on this contract tries its best but its the usual horrible benefits, bad work environment, and people being fired due to the government funding issues on the contract."
good,As a subcontractor for SAIC.  I was brought in with a 6 month to permanent agreement.  That never came to be and SAIC has no intent to make it permanent.
good,I believe that SAIC is a fairly typical large contracting company. It offers the nice benefits that come with working for large companies and has the pitfalls of working for a large company.
good,I worked there twice. Both positions did not offer any opportunity to advance. I suspect other business units may have been better than the two I worked in.
good,Monday thru Friday work hours with some overtime. Workplace environment was relaxed and there is opportunity to advance. lots of cool employees. Not much of a vacation package.
good,Company has good immediate working environment but the divisions sometimes ended up competing with each other for business.  This hindered them from winning business on occasion.  Corporate was not very supportive.
good,"Organization does not support or promote good employment compensations. "
good,"very good working enviroment, but the contracts are sketchy, biggest issue is the lack of job security. but very great working enviroment. management is really good to work with!!!"
good,Overall SAIC is a good place to work. The people are friendly and the work is easy. The hardest part of the job is staying busy when work gets slow. SAIC is a very friendly environment
good,"For a large corporation, business continuity was an afterthought. Management more interested in the bottom line than the perception of stability by employees."
good,I started my career with SAIC.  I learned a lot as it relates to cooperate behavior and learning how to interface with the customer.  I also learned soft skills at SAIC.
good,"As the team I was on no longer exists, I'm not sure how helpful I can be. It's a good company for those who are on the science side. Otherwise, it seemed underfunded and on a constant cycle of reorganization."
good,American corporate company who are not in touch with the UK laws or legislation - try to force practices on staff without discussion or communication.
good,"I did not like working for SAIC. They treated their employees as cattle and not humans. it was long work hours, with no chances of promotions! It wasn't a place for me."
good,"good company, decent benefits, they are a giant machine though - typical old school corporate. too embedded with the military and felt very government driven"
good,"The company is a large one and because of this you feel like a number sometimes, not a person. The immediate staff I worked with were great, but it was a stressful and long days."
good,This company operated pretty well and was transparent for the most part which is rare around the Beltway.  The processes at SAIC were pretty solid and they invested in the necessary systems to get the job done.
good,This company has an extremely unprofessional culture and it starts with management. Women are treated unfairly and the employees run the show instead of the managers. Men get away with whatever they want and women are punished immediately.
good,"Great supervision, always willing to work with your personal schedule.  Hiring process was painless and easy, job usually consists of Monday-Friday w/ holidays off.  "
good,"Yearly promotions and an excellent salary, I would have stayed forever but was laid off.  My work was engaging and the employees were all very dedicated."
good,Good working culture. Management is helping and supporting. They have work sites at various us locations.Provides decent hikes. I would recommend this company to all.
good,It's an interesting workplace to meet people doing innovative things.  Lots of modern technical skills and programs applied across commercial and federal contracts.
good,This was a sub-contract position. Worked at prime contractor site with numerous other sub-contractors. Fast pace of work impacted by numerous change-orders from Government client.
good,Decent place to work. Flexibility is very good. Extremely busy environment with very long hours depending on the time of year. Friendly co-workers. Lack of advancement.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"Company took great care of the team. Unfortunately, the company lost the contract to Lockheed Martin and I transitioned to LM. Good pay and benefits were appreciated."
good,Unable to make comment in this regard. I think this area should be re done so as not to make people come up with ridiculous commentary on something they would rather not comment on.
good,"As the company was in a contract switch over, I did not get enough time working with them to give an exact and proper review. The work I did get to accomplish was more or less the same as what I currently do, so no complaints."
good,Learning various electronic warfare systems and all the necessary intricate details and the revolving updates which had to be learned so you could present accurate information to the students
good,"If you expect to be recognized for working hard or to be able to advance, find a different company to work for.  You could be the best person at this company at the job you do, but they will not give you a raise or elevate you for your efforts."
good,"Cobbled together from several acquisitions with no real growth strategy.  The management came from defense contracting and thought utility, petro-chemical, and heavy civil would be similar. Naw, not close.  The company also changed from employee owned to publicly traded.  The culture completely changed."
good,I don't see how this is necessary. It's a corporation fighting for business in the contracting world. The company might try to find people jobs when a contract expires but locations vary.
good,"If an employee shows value to the company in their assigned tasks, opportunities for learning and advancement exist.  The culture is very metric driven in order to meet and and exceed performance expectations."
good,"I mean, the place is okay.  But it depends on what job you are on.  And who your boss is.  So, I cannot really say much on what it is like.  Or whatever."
good,Good Company to work for but I had another opportunity I could not pass on.  If you work for the company than you will not be disappointed.  Learned quite a deal about HBSS while working for the company for 6 months.
good,"Overall if you don't have some experience working with computers and have an IT background I would not recommend this job for you.  When interviewing for the job, I was told that I didn't need a background with computers or IT work.  Boy was that wrong.  If you aren't tech savvy do not apply to this job."
good,"Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside."
good,I was pretty busy most days. I did a lot of travel arrangements and expense reports. Everyone that I worked with was very nice and easy to get a long with.
good,"I have not here long enough to make an assessment."
good,As an intern I learned new things in programming and self discipline in project progression and goal achievement. The pay was well above other interns and my mentor was by far the best I have had.
good,Contract work leads to no job security and the employees seem always to be job scared. Employees not will to go to management due to fear of job loss.
good,Like many public defense companies. Changed significantly after the company went public and split. Lost much of it's charm and prestige.
good,"Quiet place to work for, slow moving, easy going stress free. Just not much activity going on. Very few orders to pull, mostly cleaning and finding things to do."
good,"You are just another number."
good,"The company provides great opportunities to individuals that lack experience.  With that being said, management does not always make decisions that are in the best interest of the company.  Individuals that lack experience are placed in positions that should be held by more qualified individuals. The lack of management experience is causing the company to suffer.  The company doesn't offer 401k and has high insurance plans. The benefit to the company is that is offered flex hours for work/ life balance."
good,have chance working with people all over the country remotely and flexibility of working from home; good collaboration among the teams;
good,"I work at one of the sub contraction locations of SAIC for the DoS. So, I really don't interact within the SAIC environment. However, every time I go to headquarters I always feel like it would be a nice and fun place to work at just because of how productive and kind the people are."
good,Employees enjoyed the time while company was privately held until it went public.  Company has done so many changes just so it could have a favorable IPO.
good,"Excellent company that excelled at treating it's employees well.  If you wanted specific training, they supported it.  Also have a wide variety of assignments.  However, if you found yourself off an engagement, then you may quickly find yourself in the unemployment line."
good,"This company is great as long as you are on a contract, but they will drop you within a couple of weeks if that contract falls through."
good,"As with most companies you must pursue your career objectives and work with leads and managers to reach your goals."
good,"When I initially transitioned from the Marine Corps, I was hired by a great company called Eagan, McAllister Associates, Inc. (EMA), which was later acquired by SAIC.  The acquisition had its fits and starts, but most of the EMA employees also transitoned to SAIC.  It became apparent, though, that SAIC corporate was more interested in the ""bottom line"" and not necessarily in maintaining/building an in-house resource of skilled, professional employees.  While the benefits and work/life balance are good, job security is practically nonexistence - if your contract is coming to an end, you get a 30-day notice and little assistance with finding other internal job opportunities."
good,Offer lots of free Certification prep courses. This really got me great reviews. I was able to master a lot of software. I was able to get my Oracle Certified Associate certification. Most of their positions require active Secret or Top Secret clearance. I could not advance in the company due to not having the clearance.  They were not willing to pay for me to get the clearance so I could not advance in the company.  I only had Public Trust Clearance.
good,"Enjoyed my job, but not the leadership/management. I have been at SAIC for 6 years, Not an easy place to advance in career path."
good,"SAIC has long been known as a ""shark tank"" of sorts.  In the early days of the company entrepreneurship was encouraged but at risk.  Failure or even subpar performance was not tolerated and those that couldn't make the grade quickly found themselves on the outside looking in."
good,Developed a good solid base of knowledge in the environmental consulting field. Difficult to move into a PM role with less than 10 years experience.
good,"SAIC is a decent company to work for. I strongly feel any job is what you make it. A typical day at SAIC consist of teleconferences, and working to accomplish daily task."
good,"Good pay to start with, honest job with room to grow and add to your resume and get your name out there with federal employers."
good,would rather not comment on record for this area. I am SAIC contractor supporting an agency that falls under the  Dept. of Homeland Security. SAIC could use some work on supporting their employees a bit better.
good,"They are ok, growth in the company is not that likely because the company is so big, management can do better for caring more about thier employees but hey its contact work, that is expected"
good,This job is rewarding in the sense that the end product in which we provide is useful and meaningful to a host of end users.
good,"Management and job compensation for the duties required were not as good as I thought they would be,  Long hours and no credit for work done was the norm as supervisors and managers seemed ill equipped for positions they were responsible for."
good,"Originally a profitable, people oriented company, SAIC (now two companies; Leidos and SAIC) management decided to go public and the climate immediately changed to profit over everything.  Fortunately we were relatively secluded and could concentrate on providing excellent management tools to the customer.  "
good,"This was a great company. However, the decision to go public and split in to two companies were ill advised, changed the culture of the company; removed the ""employee owned"" ethos; and lost its way. there is little upward mobility if you are not at the corporate headquarters and are in line management position."
good,"They're doing what they can, but it's not about the employees anymore, it's about staying afloat."
good,"Exciting, Trending, Security Focus"
good,Overall a good place to work.  The downturn in defense has effected the company as a whole. There is not a good tolerance for employees to be on overhead. A good contract with a year or more of time on it will keep you safe.
good,Position while with company wasn't one that allowed further growth. Schedule was night shift only and less flexibility.
good,the company was a good company to work for they also gave the employees a lot and made them feel that they were important to the company.
good,"A Program Executive leading a large $7B IDIQ, Systems and Software Engineering Support, Next Generation (SSES NexGen) program in the Aberdeen Proving Ground area in support of the Communications Electronic Command (CECOM)."
good,Working here is fun bout im driving 90 miles a day not what im looking forward too.
good,An average company that is profit driven.  Would recommend them to friends.
good,"The various contracts with the Air Force were for the most part part  of the same team.  The latest contract ended, and although I was extended for multiple months after the new contract was awarded, I am not working with many of the team members I have known for almost a decade.  the breakup of this team was very disappointing, and I would gladly work with any of my former colleagues.  While the work was sometimes extremely daunting, knowing you had a team that had your back, and knowing we had a customer that we all were proud to support, made the job very satisfying."
good,okay overall - The pay is good -- medical benefits have declined over the past year---management not so great
good,7 days a week 12 hour days is the normal day. Learned many skills dealing with electronics and RF. Tight knit team that feed from one another. Hardest part of the job is that you are out of the country in harms way away from the family for year at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer which happens to be Marine comes up to you and thanks you for your work. He then explains to you that they feel safe when they have our equipment protecting them.
good,Don't feel that the company compensation is consistent with the work thatyou do.
good,I enjoyed my time at SAIC and I learned a lot. This was my first HR position out of college. I was an entry level employee and after I mastered my job there weren't many internal opportunities within the Corporate Group which is why I was open to being recruited by ManTech for a Recruiter position.
good,"Prior to the launch of the IPO in 2007 SAIC was the  darling of the contractors within the defense contracting industry. As an Employee Owned company the employees of SAIC were the envy of the industry."
good,"Co-Workers- the employees at SAIC were overall very friendly and a pleasure to work with."
good,"I really came to enjoy working for this company.  Most things are pleasant, but get ready when it comes to trying to advance.  Good luck."
good,This was a great company when it was totally employee owned. Great bonuses and raises consistent with being compensated for doing outstanding work. Then it went public and got bogged down in red tape. A lawsuit over an ethical issue cost them half a billion dollars and resulted in the loss of what once was an excellent reputation. I don't believe it will ever recover.
good,Some colleagues were unfriendly and uncomfortable working with an outsider. They feared their inadequacies might be brought to light.
good,"SAIC is a good company however the recent changes within the company have posed some difficulties but with changes come new horizons to overcome. "
good,"Pretty good company that has a large presence in Huntsville."
good,I left the company before the contract was cancelled. The customer chose a new company with a much lower bid.
good,Plenty of room for growth. Great benefits.  Wonderful people.
good,"This was a contract position with a minimum time of 1 year, but the contract concluded early at 5mos with only a 2 week notice.  The job included records management and data entry.  It was a great work environment."
good,Depends on where you work within the company.  Ability to move around and work in different departments.
good,"Big company, with large amount of opportunities; but also comes with big company problems."
good,"I can't really give too many pros or cons, SAIC was my first company outside of the military, so it is hard to compare."
good,worked hard. good acknowledgement. no social life.typical working environment. nothing fun about it.
good,Typical government contracting juggernaut in the DC area.
good,"* Good financial compensation, but poor managerial skills"
good,"Enjoyed the work I did for the federal government,updated gov't forms. Gave security access to applications per clearnce requests"
good,I worked at the Liberty Center location prior to the Re-Org. I enjoyed the team I worked with and would work with them again at any time.
good,"I was at this company for 27 years in different capacities, so it is impossible to give an overall review, or to describe a typical day at work, co-workers, management, etc."
good,"Our entire IT department is being moved to Orlando, Florida. Some of the talented and fascinating people I have worked with have transferred there but many have left the company to avoid moving."
good,"Processed claims from service members that had moved, by recovering money from the moving companies and payed it back to the Government. Deposit checks to the Government account. Wrote rebuttal letters to the carriers. Use military laws on daily basis."
good,Design and system integration focus. Great people to work with however as projects near their end it can be difficult to find new projects.
good,"A typical day at work at SAIC was helping employees with timesheets, training and anything else that may arise. I assisted supervisors with administrative issues. Kept track of employees via rosters."
good,"Big company with many inherent efficiencies. However, individual employees can easily get lost in the process."
good,The company has a lot of contractors that bid against them. The have had problem in last couple of months winning contracts.
good,The program I worked with for over 13 years and one day they give me a 24 hrs notice to leave the job - I lost contract within 24 hrs and there was no sign of it form my management.
good,"SAIC has many different business units. These units operate individually, with no ties to the other units."
good,great people to work ; great hard working group of professionals and allowed me to really grow in my field. Would work with anyone of them 100 times over.
good,Not a bad place to work. If you look for solid hours that don’t change SAIC is the place. You go in do your job and go game. Work is hard and hot in the summer
good,Overall inline with market peers in terms of Direct and Indirect (corporate) advancement and positions. Culture is not well defined and programs to help internal promotion is lacking full engagement and visibility with Direct personnel.
good,"The company offered really good benefits, however they are the biggest company in the area and often underpay due to the lack of competion. The work culture is open and allows for others to grow"
good,"Communication is seemingly lacking between the employees and management, due to middle management stifling communication. Overall, SAIC seems to be an okay company overall."
good,A great place to work if you like working with the military on a contract.  If you ever want to leave and go to SAIC in VA that's an option as well.  Overall it was a well balanced place however the advancement rate wasn't to good.
good,They treated be good but they are very strict in how things are done. Since I was new they were good to make sure that I learned the skills needed to do my job.
good,"*Since becoming an employee, most of my newly acquired knowledge pertains to the particular environment and culture of the workplace."
good,"As an intern, it took SAIC about 3 to 5 weeks to actually give me work to do. I am still grateful to be hired and all, but I wish I could have done more in the company to be able to put that on my resume. After I complained to HR about not getting work, they finally switched me over to a different manager where I did some work for 4 weeks"
good,"Has a diverse group of employees with many ethnic backgrounds."
good,"A typical day at work kept you busy. Lots of e-mail to go through and Remedy tickets to look over. We had to pick up and transport our parts and supplies for our work projects from Logistics. After that we would inventory and record serial, part and government/corporate numbers."
good,"I was surprised when, at SAIC, when your job was completed or lost funding, the employee was required to find their next position within SAIC. If another position was not found, the employee was laid off. This was my first experience with that type of environment. I was rather taken aback when, through no fault of my own, my project lost its funding and I was laid off."
good,"Decent work place, some individuals are mico-managed while others are left to their own devices. Management at times appears frazzled by all the moving parts. Often times the customer that demands the loudest gets what they want despite the ramifications to productivity. A place where the process often kills productivity. Not the worst place to work, but needs improvement."
good,"Pay is ok, but benefits are too expensive. There is opportunity for growth but since only working in a contract with the US Government it is hard to network with people within SAIC."
good,"SAIC is a great company.  I loved working with the team that I had as everybody would lend a hand if something was needed.  "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the office camaraderie  among employees. Learned a lot about accuracy and speed. Management was often understanding and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when a printer was ""acting up"" and a briefing had to be printed and out the door asap."
good,"Great job, but the management was extremely hard to understand, and comply with sporadic changes in policy, it seemed as if they were trying to filter out the experience for much younger more educated, less experienced, and immature youth, the company went from a hands on production company to an educated software technical support corporation."
good,"It is a big company with lots of contracts, good benefits, and some good management. The work is challenging, as they keep you busy, with chances to learn new things."
good,"decent place to work but very male dominated, lots of retired military.  sort of a silo-type business model - not much interaction between offices.  good HR."
good,"Having 50-85% billable work and remaining 15% is administrative work."
good,"Overall working for SAIC was a personal challenge.  However, since my employment base was at the Department of Energy, my supervisors were Government employees.  I took advance of their additional education training by attending work sessions.  I assisted with providing managers with data to aid in their decision making. I met with my SAIC manager periodically..  At times the job became stressful due to time constraints and last minute Congressional requests."
good,"Work was a little different than I'm used to doing, but manageable. The manager over the position along with government employee, I give two thumbs down. A lot of favoritism at the position. The work itself was fairly easy, but the hardest part was the hours changing every week, so not able to plan anything with family. Most enjoyable was getting out early."
good,"Before i begin, I can only speak to my own experience so don’t take this as gospel."
good,"In my experience, nice team of employees working well together.  Good opportunities for Career Advancement.  Emphasis on professional development and growth."
good,"So many accomplishments since the company split - but old habits die hard.  Mid management resists fundamental changes needed to transform the leadership mindset and workplace culture.  Good news is it varies throughout the organization. If HR issues ever get resolved, SAIC will be an excellent place to work."
good,Management does not micromanage its employees. work 8 hour days repairing air conditioning equipment and other items. Hardest part of job was no job security.
good,"SAIC is a great company, although I have found it difficult to move up.  Micromanaging has become the norm, so it can be a little hectic."
good,Working for SAIC was not a bad experience. The King George Team was super friendly. It was the government leads at the place i worked that were horrible. The hated all SAIC employee's. Figured out i was payed 10k under contract when they told me i was over qualified.
good,SAIC hires a lot of veterans. Being able to work with people who have the same background is a great benefit. The benefits could be better but they are not too bad.
good,"A typical day at work involved me arriving at the office around 7:00 am and then I would spend some time checking emails and figuring out what I need to accomplish for the day.  I would usually be either conducting a site visit to collect above ground utility features or I would be editing and updating utility databases based on GPS data or markups by the on-site subject matter experts."
good,"I enjoyed my first 1 1/2 years at CSC, however with a change in management, it was a very stressful environment."
good,"Begain the day assigning work to techs, ensuring work is completed to standard."
good,I was able to get great business development experience and exposure to government and industry. It's a great place to work if you are new to industry and want experience with government contracting.
good,"not a strong feeling of job-security, always feel like you are on the chopping block, management controls with a feeling of ""just fall in line, or you could be next"""
good,"SAIC recently announced that it is splitting into two companies. As a result, there have been lay offs & instability. Once all of the changes are implemented and enough time has passed, I think the companies will be good. The people at SAIC are great, they are dedicated and skilled employees."
good,Managment leaves employees to complete work. Employees also decide the best shedule that fits
good,"I worked as both a deployed intelligence analyst, then as project lead on various software development initiatives."
good,SAIC was a good overal
good,"Science Applications International Corporation is an American company headquartered in Reston, Virginia that provides government services and information technology support."
good,"I was not there long enough to give a full evaluation.  When the contract was cut I was one of the first to go.  Since my management didn't like my style and I was one of the higher priced, I was a prime candidate to let go."
good,I liked the changes within the environment & technical process. It kept the job interesting & fast paced. There is room for improvement regarding management to employee face time though.
good,"I give SAIC a better than average rating for employers."
good,"The company was large, and had a significant number of active clients/contracts. There was moderate initial interest in developing commercial business which is where my job function resided. However, over time, it became evident that management was more engaged with maintaining and growing its government contract. Often different departments pit against each other while working through the required business development processes. The hardest part of my job was working to develop commercial business opportunities in the culture of government contracts. "
good,They are never moving up the part timers. When i full time position opens up they hire outside. The coworkers are nice. Managers will work with you when they can.
good,"Flexible work schedule, decent benefits, and pleasant people. However, there was a lack of exciting projects, which ultimately led me to look for work elsewhere."
good,High profile and cutting edge technology.  Employee placement is at the top of their list when programs come to an end I've seen this first hand.  I definitely recommend working for them.
good,"The job itself is pretty balanced. I have no problems with the duty. The real problem resides in how the company's management system is. If you have a manager that uses intimidation, shows favoritism and acts like you are a child, good luck having HR even look into it."
good,"As you consider a career at SAIC, you will find countless opportunities to contribute to solutions that are changing the world in real and measurable ways in our technical, engineering, intelligence, and enterprise IT business areas."
good,Needs improvement in work vs life balance benefits.  Very low compensation but decent medical benefits.  Very high job security is provided with the positions within this company.
good,"The job was a government contract position so I did not work within the SAIC environment, but within the government. There is nothing I can really say about working with in the SAIC company."
good,To get a position with this company you have to pass a extreme background check that takes a long time. Once you get approved its a good place to work. I worked for the DOD for the nurse advice line taking calls from military members and there family that had Tricare insurance.
good,Large company that loses sight of employees and their goals.  Contract work so if no contract no work.  Company says it will relocate you but I never was.
good,The people were great to work with. It was a healthy environment to be around also very professional. A very good work experience.
good,the job and the people were great. I was always trying to advance but there did not seem to be any room for advancement during my time as an employee.
good,"Very organized company, well thought-out processes from the get-go starting with onboarding to the day you decide to depart.    "
good,SAIC is a good company to work for. I worked the NIE program and feel that the management could of cared for it's people(employee a bit more).
good,Management does not seem to care about employees. Benefits have been stripped steadily in the last 5 years. Only insurance plan available is a high deductible plan with higher premiums than I was paying for an excellent plan when I was hired.
good,"Good company but Just went through a company re-organization prior to me getting hired on, I see some happy people and not so happy people.  for me...so far so good."
good,"Extremely professional place to work; the majority of the employees are self-starters who have a tendency to ""take ownership"" of the work.  The Company is a Government contractor.  The division I work in performs environmental work.  I am primarily a field person.  I typically perform oversight of drilling and monitoring well installation."
good,"Leidos was a split-off from SAIC, so the SAIC today is all commercial work rather than government contracts. There lots of jobs in different fields at this company."
good,"SAIC recently split into two companies. SAIC and Leidos. Like all Defense contracting companies, the companies were impacted by large defense cuts."
good,The engineers I've worked with are for the most part very talented.
good,"sorting mail"
good,The team I work with is a great bunch of people. We all know that it is the customer and the United States Navy we support. That focus is never forgotten.
good,Solid company to work for.  They lack the ability to compete salary wise but there are many jobs within the company to pick from.
good,"Protected and defended information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation as a System Matter Expert (SME)."
good,"Worked with MRAPs."
good,"I love my job at SAIC, I learned about networking, my co-workers became each other family. Hardest was saying when our contract end with LAUSD. Going a bay cruise for dinner."
good,My experience at SAIC was rewarding. I learned a lot and have nothing negative to report
good,"SAIC provides numerous opportunities for career growth and development through its contracts with various DoD clients. I worked with about 10 different tech writers over the 12 years there, and most were highly skilled professionals."
good,Management was not pro-active. If a process was broken it was very hard to get something changed. Accounting system was first rate yet did not utilize it to the fullest extent. Used shared services groups all over country. Was hard to find the right person to fix a problem or ask a question.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me doing anything varying from post integration inspection, including wiring metals & prototype parts to testing analyzing & diagnosing product design problems. I also implemented action plans to correct operation deficiencies in an effort to improve system performance. My setting was very diverse with friendly co-workers."
good,"It was an alright experience at SAIC. While I really enjoyed being around wonderful and nice people and nice perks including a company gym to work out, fun team games and flexible work schedule, I just found that it was not the right type of environment for my professional growth and success."
good,OK place to work; management needs to go by the rules not by who they like. Co workers were great and my job was easy.
good,"Flexible work hours, able to take applicable time off/leave. Leadership is focused on mission. Overall great place to work. Enjoyed working with many like minded individuals focused on accomplishing tasks."
good,"I really don't have a feel for the company yet.  Was with Engility which was bought and I kept my job/same work.  Nothing has changed, so my team is great!"
good,Good company to work for but never know when it may end because being a contractor is never guaranteed.  They have paid me well but I’ve also earned it.
good,Government customer base is lacking leadership and instead tries to micro manage contractors and technicians. Leadership lacks direction in most cases or changes directions daily.
good,"Promised education benefit, no longer a benefit.  Corporate is detached from customer site employees.  Said they had to “restructure” management and that we should be thankful we still had jobs and our limited benefits.  Limited promotion from within, basically when your lead moves on, you get their responsibilities plus your own, and you get to keep your current salary."
good,"love the job sorry the contract was terminated, it provided me with all I needed. what you want me to make up things, I stated it simple ok. what can you say about a position that one loves then get taken away from under our feet."
good,The positions weren't offered based on qualifications. Positions were offered to appease current employees which often meant moving qualified employees for unqualified employees.
good,"I actually enjoyed my time working at SAIC. However, SAIC experienced some Government compliance issues, and ended up laying off 3000 employees as a result of these issues."
good,"SAIC/Leidos is a big company which offers competitive benefits and relatively stable environment. Management is poor, which made work stressful. The company does not support much in class training however they do offer some online trainings."
good,Line leads (your boss) come and go due to getting government jobs or having jobs on base of their own. Each building on base treats contract employees differently. Contractors will always be treated like second class citizens on base. Some buildings treat them better than most. There are several buildings on base where contractors are treated like peasants.
good,"I know it's hard to claim, but there are few places that truly have that organic relationship between management and workers. SAIC happens to be one such place. At no time do the workers feel under appreciated. That being stated it should be pointed out that SAIC is in the same work category as Booze Allen, Harris, Lockheed Martin and other DOD contract companies. So if you don't care for uncertain futures or periodically searching for another place of employment, seems to happen every bid cycle. Avoid. However if none of that bothers you and you love the excitement of it all, SAIC is the place for you."
good,I enjoyed working for SAIC.  I was released from my contact with SAIC because of an anti-nepotism policy.  I always exceeded expectations in my performance as an employee.  SAIC is a great company to work for.
good,"Catch up with all team members on status"
good,"As a government/DoD Contractor one has to quickly adjust to being treated as a second class citizen.  Once this mental hurdle has passed, it becomes much easier to work with non-contractors as colleagues should you earn their respect."
good,"I have traveld different places in the world with this company, and I have learned so much about electronics."
good,"Work is well balanced so that a day isn't always overwhelming. In-building management does everything possible to ensure their employees are happy. The co-workers are great, which is the best part of the job. Obviously the work is the most difficult part but that varies day-to-day."
good,"Good Place to work. Smart People. Good Project. SAIC is a good company the benefits were really good until they changed the medical plan to nothing but high deductible plans. You accumulate 5.85 days of vacation every two weeks so if you want to take a vacation in January, you can't unless you have accumulated days from previous years. No real sense of employee loyalty when a contract ends, you have limited time to find a job within SAIC."
good,Having Vanguard as their financial advisor was excellent. Usually it is some knockoff company or just renamed by the company. Vanguard provided professional assistance for retirement. SAIC choose wisely on picking them.
good,"It is a very large corporation with very elaborate policies and rules. However, the corporate values and ethics are very sound. Most managers are respectful of work-life balance. The major downside is having to worry about redeployment when a contract ends."
good,- Salary is adequate
good,Employer is a good company to work for. They have excellent benefits and pay their employees well.
good,None- great company to work for. great environment. great people and option to grow. will work their again if got an opportunity. Nothing else to add..
good,"There was some pressure to always exceed our customers expectations."
good,"Good management that cares about its employees.  Many opportunities for career growth.  Sometimes, due to a large company size it makes it difficult to communicate with the higher ups."
good,"They have excellent benefits. easy work load, good balance between work and family life. best part of the day is satisfying the customer."
good,"Good culture, but it's being affected by the defense cuts. I've had good managers and my co-workers are nice, I'm only leaving because of my family."
good,It's a great place to work. The insurance is just awful. Other than the insurance it was a great place to work. The people are friendly and there was always something to do.
good,Fun place to work in - offers a plathera of computer skills in-house to hone your skills. Co-workers are wonderful and so easy to be with.
good,SAIC has an excellent compensation and benefit package. I have been blessed to be a part of this fine organization. I highly recommend SAIC as a career choice.
good,"SAIC really trusted me to do my job without having someone watch over my shoulder which I appreciated.  We were trained on specialized proposal tools which was good. "
good,"SAIC is generally a good company with very structured processes that make it very competitive in public sector bids.  "
good,"I guided a staff of 40 people in supporting government contracts at Hill AFB. Much of my time was used in writing proposals for additional contracts and recompeting contracts for which we were the incumbent. The co-workers were professional, educated and dedicated. "
good,"communication is poor, there is always an agenda. Laid off during the holidays after 27 years with the company , reason was job is no longer available"
good,"fast passed with micro managers, line work on military vehicle's. work as an industrial engineer for about ten weeks but was sent back to floor which I had saved them 500k on a kizan project."
good,It is a great company. Just depending on contract location. Get to meet a lot of new people in the field. Would love to transfer.
good,Very professional environment.  High expectations for quality and attention to detail.  Work based on contract financing so temporary is typical.
good,9 hr alternate work schedule
good,Great company but it seems like management rather point the finger that help figure out their responsibility and helping to make a great culture to work in.
good,Nice experience working here. Becoming to politically correct for me to continue.  Looking for a small company to work for. To many managers and not enough credit to the people who do the work.
good,I managed 12 buildings with 1000 bends full of parts that the mechanics needed to make production. I maintained all locations with no empty bends. But the management was never appreciative.
good,Not a bad place.  Could use more work life balance for people going to school full time and working full time. Management is great and is willing to help out when needed.
good,The business development department is pretty typical in size and structure for a large company. Management should ensure career growth is included in their individual goals set for each employee annually.
good,"I honestly felt as though I was discriminated against. "
good,work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.
good,Great contractor company to get your feet wet in. Poor management at 1602. Fun people to work around but upper management they all are friends and if your not in the CLICK you get walked on. It's hard to advance unless you know someone.
good,I learned alot while being with the company.  They really take care of their employees.
good,"SAIC is one of the top company to wrok for. They offer good benefits, 401k andflexibilty. I really enjoy working for SAIC for client Census."
good,"Enjoyed both positions at this company. Unfortunately, both positions ended. I enjoyed the people I worked with and was very sad to leave. I enjoyed the busyness of the office and the challenge of the documentation."
good,"I work in a tiny office where everyone there feels threatened by each other, except for one person. There is no teamwork there and mostly everyone, including the new guy of 2 weeks, are superficial towards each other. They need to learn how to work as a team and communicate more. Also, the company need to streamline their hiring processes to hire quality people, rather than the people that are just there simply to collect a paycheck, stay lazy and be disrespectful to senior employees. In addition, when they promote from within, they select sometimes people that are not qualified to deal with the power that goes with it. On the other hand, people at the main office are super-chill and are cohesive team players."
good,Good company.  No room for advancement in the department for which I worked - which is why I left.  Management does not care about their staff...to them you're just a number.
good,Not great or bad. Was fine. Where I worked they catered a free picnic once per that was nice. Was a pretty good place to work. Pretty willing to work with people to get them into positions they wanted.
good,Contracting work is pretty much the same.  Good company with no complaints.   Management was involved enough to help but not enough to impact mission.
good,"Overall, SAIC is a good place to work, but the work, but because you are typically position at a customer site, the work environment is largely dependent on the customer.  The work is interesting and fast-paced, and If you are above average, your job is secure for at least the length of the project on which you are working. They also work very hard to place you on a new project if your project ends or you are ""not a good fit"" for the project.  "
good,"Depending what you do and where you work within this company, it's great in terms of decent benefits, competitive salaries and work-life balance. Also dependent on this, you may or may not get a good manager who supports your work/team, provides real insight and guidance and is flexible. OR you may end up with someone who either doesn't know what they are doing and is a terrible micro-manager."
good,"I worked for Business Development in a small aesthetically pleasing office and enjoyed working in that environment because it was mostly relaxed with enough work to get done while learning more about SAIC."
good,Worked and supported same department for over 10 years and new CFO promoted her transfer in of less than 6 months to be my boss while I was off while my father was dying.  I found this unacceptable and resigned.  Until then I had enjoyed my position and the staff I supported.
good,"Good place. I never felt like I was going to punished for something I got wrong. As long as I was trying my hardest, everything seemed to work itself out."
good,"Over the last few years I was there, if you did not serve in the Marine Corps, you are looked down on as not knowing anything.  Most Upper Management personnel are former/retired Marines and they like to bring in other Marines to work for them."
good,I was employed by SAIC but was contracted out for eleven years to SIMS and JRDC contract did not have much to do with SAIC except for one or two times a year. It was an ok place to work the benefits could be better.
good,"The thing I enjoy most about working for SAIC is the ability to work with new Microsoft Windows technology. I've been able to develop considerable experience in the support of Windows IIS server on at least three different server platforms. I've been able to work with Microsoft SharePoint versions 2007, 2010 and 2013. I have also been able to build and support Microsoft Dynamics 4.0, 2011 and 2013 systems. I was able to work with Microsoft engineers to implement an automated deployment system for software that was developed in-house. This allowed us to have consistent software deployments and predictable states after deployment. This year I was able to build IIS web farms that allowed us to have a single share location to deploy software for applications that were configured on the farm. I also implemented a shared SSL store and shared IIS configuration among members. The biggest challenge was being able to keep up with the new technology that was being implemented."
good,"SAIC is a diverse company, and it depends where you are in the different areas in the country.  Different areas treat you differently.  A good group of people that I've met working at two different geographic locations."
good,The contract has been inconsistent due to budget but getting better.  Looking for a second part time job to cover all my expenses.
good,"Typical day:assisted with travel plans, reviewing reports, filing expense reports and setting up daily VTC conferences."
good,Great company to work for. Very motivated to succeed and make their customers happy in their product.
good,"I managed a team of lines Mechanics and Trainees. Ensured work is completed on time, safely and in good order. Assessed upcoming work load to ensure availability of staff. Liaising with the public & other interested or effected parties as required. I ensured safe-working practices."
good,"overall rating 4"
good,"Complex electro-mechanical CADD Designer performing on quick reaction projects. Prepares CADD generated engineering designs, and manufacturing drawing packages with associated lists of complex electronic chassis and components in accordance with contractual requirements to support Engineering, Manufacturing, and customer documentation of electro/mechanical equipment. Models are created in 3D using SOLIDWORKS. Design layouts and drawing packages are created in 2D using AutoCAD. Printed circuit boards (PCB) drawing packages created using SOLIDWORKS program CircuitWorks. File management using project data base management software (EPDM)."
good,SAIC is an enjoyable company to work for.
good,I work in an R&D branch of SAIC. R&D at SAIC is becoming smaller and smaller due to federal government current objectives. This leads to periods of feast and famine.
good,You do the same things everyday but I have learned alot of new things over the years that I have worked here.
good,"It is a fun place to work, however they layoff alot. They do not give much notice and there is no bench."
good,Company is always reorganizing so you don't always feel things are stable.   People are nice.  Benefits are expensive.  Senior leadership is out of touch with employee population
good,"I really enjoy where I work, who I work with and what I do.  Further, the SAIC supervisors that I work with (and I barely see them as I am at my work site and they are not), overall, are really nice people and are good first-line supervisors. But,..."
good,"Excellent HR and support staff who are punctual in assisting employees with administrative overhead common to all companies (badges, yearly training, computer account set-up, etc)."
good,"SAIC provides numerous opportunities for professional growth, holding a multitude of contracts with Defense and Government customers. Smart individuals can find projects that stimulate and utilize their skillset.  Colleagues are ethical and intelligent."
good,"Great Experience of Chinese culture and working overseas."
good,"Lots of opportunity to work cool project with lots of tech. Exposure to lots of project management. My management was only there to support me and to remove roadblocks"
good,"Outstanding Operations Management team, excellent corporate culture, and great benefits. Several opportunities to learn the Department of Defense side of contract work."
good,My review of SAIC is that it is a good company to work for as far as a fair salary with good benefits. SAIC seems to care about their employees. Management at my job is great and will do everything possible to make it an enjoyable working environment.
good,"I loved the work, loved the customer. There was no local management on my contract and I was harassed by 1 individual coworker pretty much from day one of my employment. They made the environment stressful and worked hard to get me out. I was wrongfully terminated. Tennessee is an At Will Employment state. Per an attorney, ""They can terminate you for wearing the wrong color sweater"". "
good,"I entered this company in an unusual manner.  They took over my contract with a National Laboratory.  I had no say in the matter.  However, I found the representatives to be very professional and helpful.  Their company policies were not out of the ordinary and I found it a pleasant experience in general."
good,Learning is encouraged.  Job development is encouraged to move forward with the company standards.  There are many opportunities to develop your skills like tuition reimbursement.
good,Very flexible work environment. Low stress. Very tight nit  almost family atmosphere among coworkers. Multiple events (cookouts) held during the year for employees appreciation.
good,"Atmosphere is dicey when Contracts get to their end. Only certain. Favorite,  employees know they will still be employed. There is a ""Group"" of Management that seem to be Untouchable."
good,"This is a great place to work but since they are subcontracted to the federal government, the hours are being cut down due to the government shutdown."
good,"Work expectation for senior staff was greater than anticipated.  Overtime was expected and routine.  Quality and professionalism of coworkers was very high, on average.  Quality of management was excellent."

good,"Company is a good company. Co-workers are pleasure to work with. Work environment is good. Benefits are pretty good, excellent health insurance plan. Bonus"
good,"Saic launched my contracting career. I felt the atmousphere to be a bit stifling, but it did provide practical experience I used in furthering my career"
good,The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy old job review for a company that may no longer even exist and would be outdated anyway so this is a great example of a really poor process.
good,I really enjoyed working there and everyone was great. Love to integrate MRAPS.  Management treated me good. Hate that the contract was running out and they had to lay off.
good,"Endless learning opportunities but poor management. I always feel overwhelmed with my workload. High turn-over and bad rep. have resulted."
good,"Employees were dedicated to the end results, and that made the job experience worth while.  I learned a great deal about myself, my weaknesses and my strengths as well as how to work and collaborate in a team. The most difficult part of my job was not being very technical, but  I learned what I needed in order to be an effective team member."
good,"Vacation and sick leave are all rolled up into a four (4)  week maximum, no matter how long you work there."
good,"The job itself was not bad. The work environment wasn't the best, sometimes felt hostile. I enjoyed the fast pace and the knowledge that I've gained but there are limited options for someone who is not looking for IT jobs."
good,I worked on several contracts while at SAIC and enjoyed working for the company. Many of the managers were flexible and supportive of the work/life balance.
good,"My position supported a military enterprise network in a deployed location.  During the Arab Spring when the local situation became a little uneasy the management team continued with their normal quarterly visit to the site, distributed a pamphlet with a number to call in the event we were not able to evacuate ourselves, and then left on the next flight out of country cutting their typical week long visit to an afternoon to distribute the pamphlet."
good,Flexible work environment is a benefit available for many. The company hires very talented people. There are opportunities to work with diverse industries.
good,"Les journées de travail se passent dans un environnement agréable, avec une bonne équipe. "
good,"Company culture in any company is hard to change especially when you are cyber security and trying to make decisions for best practices. I am paid to highlight security risks not, coddle to a bonus hunting mentality"
good,I had a wonderful time working on many different projects in countless different areas. I was given real respobsibility as an intern where my opinion was truly considered. I also had the opportunity to travel and work flexible hours when needed.
good,It's fantastic supporting our nation's military forces while utilizing my technical/logistics skills. Can't say enough about this team of professionals.
good,Good company that seems to look out for their employees. They actively pursued redeployment options for me when the contract I was working on expired. No experience dealing with HR but I hear good things.
good,"Overall, SAIC was a great company to work for and would recommend it to others. I was able to exercise my academic skills and learn to work with a variety of people."
good,"Depends on who you know, the job can be rewarding. The people are friendly and helpful. Its a great team to be apart of and most times is serious but professional environment."
good,Our group in Idaho Falls felt like a small business even though worldwide the company is huge.  I had the opportunity to travel and help engineers in Russia with chem-de-mil toys
good,I worked in the position as an IT. I like my work place because  I have worked in a professional and friendly environment. The problem is SAIC is not taking care of their employees well.
good,Good work life balance. Ability to support many programs and projects both internal to company and external. Several management and executive leadership courses.
good,Big company! Endless opportunities throughout the DoD space and mechanisms for finding the right place to apply your skills in support of the customer that's the best fit.

good,"Worked off-site full time."
good,SAIC is a good place to work.  They offer good benefits and treat people well.  The group of people that work for me are a great mix of talent.  Work environment is fun
good,"I enjoyed the opportunities afforded by this 40,000+ employee firm.  During my tenure, the company was employee-owned and focused more on employee satisfaction.  The company later went public and the focus shifted to company profitability."
good,"We work for a great account manager. Our PMs are true professionals. The teams are a great mix of former, retired military and non military individuals who compliment each other skills well."
good,Technical support took a daily attention to detail that I have retained and benefits me to this day.  Supporting multiple managers also taught me to accurately multi-task.
good,"Was once an excellent place to work.  Excellent benefits and culture.  However, after being purchased by a private equity firm, focus was more revenue based versus customer satisfaction.  Near the end, the allowed outsiders to influence and change the culture."
good,Good place to work but contract work only.  The return  feedback for your work is rewarding from the clients. Each individual plays a role in a much bigger picture than they realize when lives are saved.
good,The company was very flexible working with me. Good company options.My co-workers and human resources were very friendly. Management was also friendly.

good,Was her a very long time and enjoyed my time with the company.  Would recommend to any new college grad.  The hardest part of the job is 90% of their work is contracting with the US government.
good,"The teams and talent are adequate, but sometimes the government isn't always helpful in knowing what it wants or in how it takes suggestion."
good,"Most of the time spent working for this company was very busy. We had a diverse work group. Before this contract I had never seen these vehicles before, nor had I any idea as to how much what we did mattered. Our crew as it were consisted of a great management team, of which kept us informed as to any changes in the contract or way we did things."
good,"A typical day at work includes Active Directory functions such as unlocking account and password resets, along with McAfee recovery, general browser troubleshooting, mapping network drives, software pushes and installs, software troubleshooting, ActiveX and ActivClient installs for Hybrid Token programming, email encryption and VMWare troubleshooting to name a few. Fast paced and demanding environment, knowledge filled and a great learning experience."
good,Fun work place with supportive management Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.  Decent amount of growth development is available.  The most challenging position I've had in my long career.
good,"You work for whatever client you support, and at the end of the day it will depend on whether or not you like the work you are performing as well as the team that you are on."

good,My time at SAIC was short but introduced me to the geospatial environment with team building exercises and an excellent work environment.
good,SAIC is a good solid place to work.  The focus is always on delivering what is expected and constantly improving processes.
good,Worked for many great supervisors who seemed to care about their employees overall well being and took a keen interest on career growth.
good,Good place to work with Flexible working hours and supervisors that are willing to work with you in emergency situations.
good,The problem with DoD contracting is that sometimes the company loses the contract.
good,"•	Primary receptionist for a small office of 25 people.  Answered phones, welcomed and received guests, customers, and vendors. "
good,I had a very good experience with SAIC.  My husband is active duty military and SAIC was very accommodating.  They were willing to push my start date back so i would not have to leave my family early.
good,"Receive weapons for particular job, we serialize them and check them in and make sure weapon count sheet is correct and then we begin the process of breaking down the gun and checking the parts and making sure parts that are still good can be reused. Then we begin the de-burring and cleaning and recoating the parts and getting them ready to reassemble the guns, after they are reassembled we begin the pre fire testing to check the functionality of the weapons is correct and good. Then we will test fire all the weapons to complete the process and we will then clean the weapons and continue the process to check them in to supply and have the weapons shipped back out to the customer."
good,Working with highly skilled co-workers is challenging and educational.
good,company has had some struggles stabilizing after the split and re-organization.

good,Learn at lot from being in a war zone.  This company takes great care of their employees.
good,"My day consisted of purchasing large volumes of hardware material and processing the invoices for payment.  This was a government funded project and the team had a tight deadline for completing phases of the project.  "
good,Benefits lacking. Separation has been difficult. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working at this company.  They have competitive compensation, but their benefits have dropped drastically in the past several years."
good,Very little contact with upper or middle management.  Worked as contractor for Government.
good,"Since I started with the company,  I've enjoyed ever position that I've held as well as the people that I worked with."
good,"The company and demands are always changing. The challenges provide the opportunity to work with various individuals to meet schedule demands. A typical day consists a various shipments, a multitude of information to be input and managed within the database. The hardest part of my job is being one if the few with the computer skills needed across the board to meet customer demands.I enjoy the opportunies that allow me to learn more to adhance the skills I already have to meet increasing demands and the people that I have the chance to work with and meet."
good,"I was a contractor at SAIC working on a project with the FAMS in Reston, VA as a Systems Engineer. I was exposed to various technologies expanding my knowledge base. The client was great company and demanding. I loved working with them."
good,SAIC gives employees chances to develop their skills in different fields. The co-workers are very friendly and the managers are caring.
good,"The work at SAIC frequently changes due to the end and beginning of contracts.  This requires that you continue learning new skills.  It keeps the job fresh and exciting.  My management was always supportive.  When contracts end however, it is ""every man for himself"".  It becomes your responsibility to find a new job.  This is very frustrating.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed working for SAIC."
good,Retired US Army colonel.  Superior leadership and organizational skills.
good,Learned a lot from the business stand point of the company. It places good emphasis on the quality of service provided and corrects whatever shortcomings it has incurred.
good,"Developed Integrated Logistics Support Planning for a deployed Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform in a hostile environment."
good,A typical day at work is just that come in get what you need and get to work and go home. Learned different ways to achieve my goals for the day or week either on time or ahead of time. There are really good people to work for as far as management and co-workers. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep it being a government contract you never know when you'll be done. Its an easy place to work no really getting on you about how fast or slow your going pretty laid back and easy going.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with and train Soldiers.
good,"Worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week. Hardest part of job was incoming rounds. Most enjoyable part of job was see the smiles on the soldiers faces. Co-worker were like family.

good,"Good company, a few issues but over all a good place to work. d"
good,"A typical work day is fielding any where from 30 to 90 calls and working with end user to fix computer issues. Should issues be unable to to be fixed i would then determin where they should be sent. Also, i put together technical documentation for use on the internal help page for other techs to use. I also assist in training new techs to make sure they have a good solid ground on what is expected of them. When more time between calls happen i will then assist the email group in fixing issues that have been email in."
good,In 5 1/2 years there I built a brand new division from scratch to a $99 million per year business unit.
good,Original founders were scientists so the environment tends to be very analytical and scientific.  Teamwork is emphasized and working on cross functional matrixed teams is the norm.
good,"I had 12 years with this company and my direct line manager was a joy to work for. Upper management was adequate, but could have done a better job of sustaining current contracts and strategizing for continued and new business."
good,"Great environment to work with flexible time.  Typical work day is  from 8-5 with a cup of tea, headphones and lots of production.  Management interaction is moderate and co-worker are awesome."
good,"Nice company to work with, a lot of training, there is always something new to challenge and learn"
good,I have enjoyed my near 9years of employment with SAIC. Have met great people from all echelons within the company. The only reason I am leaving is currently ther eis no place within the company to go due to DoD budget cuts and furloughs
good,"SAIC is the company that ""pulls it all together"" for U.S. forces and allies. We help give warfighters an integrated picture of the battlespace and commanders greater capability to deploy a U.S. fighting force around the globe at any time."

I learned new skills for operating radars and understanding different areas that are required to operate, maintain and certified different radar simulation systems. "
good,"Excellent company."
good,Good company to work for. The pay is fair and the benefits are pretty decent. 
good,"SAIC puts ethics above anything else.  Since the company is an ISO 9001:2010 certified large government contractor, it takes its business very seriously.  The division for which I work has mostly entry level employees that are required to work very long hours, evenings and weekends.  The division does a very good job, within the limits set by the corporation, of rewarding its staff through above normal industry increases, bonuses, and division outings (baseball games, bowling, happy hours, etc).  Because most of the staff went the same universities, there is good comradery and friendliness around the office which makes for a pleasant work environment especially given the long hours.  However, because of recent economy and state of the federal budget, contracts have become more competitive and advancement has stalled."
good,"Enjoyed the work, company interested in developing employees"
good,"Main responsibility is to conduct CMMI process audits and ensure that programs are accurately following their defined plans, processes and procedures.  Lead process implementation for all new CMMI ML 3 programs by helping them tailor to business level assets.  Continue to work daily with programs to ensure continuous improvement and to foster an environment of quality.  I also work as a ISO 9001:2008 Site Quality Manager."
good,"This was my second time working for SAIC on the RCAS Contract. Worked very hard, but had a good time doing it.  Managers did the best they could to manage a difficult customer, who unfortunately were not the end users. Our end users loved us, but our government managers were not always as logical as we would have liked."
good,"• Designs chassis, chassis components, and mechanical parts for electromechanical packaging applications"
good,SAIC is an exciting place to work for. Co-workers are easy to work with. Management can be little difficult to work for but it depends on who is your manager.

good,I have been with SAIC for about 9 years. It has been a great experience and the company was particularly helpful transitioning from one contract to another.
good,"Working for a large company is a fastpace enviornment, you begin each day with a game plan of what you want to accomplish. Getting the B&P Budgets done, doing the IR&D budgets. Setting up charge numbers, updating the Headcount. So I enjoy the challenge of each day to see what it brings and how I need to rearrange my schedule."

good,"Wonderful company to work for. Great pay, Great benefits. Hours were good. Location was perfect. Higher ups needed a little more familiarity with the job of those that they were supervising."
good,Our small company was acquired by SAIC. It changed the overall culture of the company and the business. The changes were necessary but had significant negative impact.
good,Have always had the opportunity to work with an excellent team of people.
good,"I had a typical 9 hour work day with every other Friday off so that I would have 40 hours in two weeks. I learned how to work independently and search for process and procedure for clarity in doing my job as an administrator. I worked well with my co-workers. We interact together as team player. The hardest part of the job was by just starting as an admininstator, there was a lot of things to grasp onto. But with help from my peers,process and procedures, I learned everything well and started receving well done emails. The enjoyable part were meeting and talking to employee at my location and other locations as well as clients."
good,Great environment and great people! Wish it could have continued.
good,- Great work experience
good,SAIC has great pay and benefits and an inclusive and caring corporate culture. The hardest part of the job is working on site at government agencies.  SAIC invests in training employees but its hard to get promoted - the company doesn't make it clear what it takes to get promoted and is not transparent about promotion opportunities.
good,SAIC's culture varies largely based upon which group you work with. I was in a group that performed outlier duties not common with rest of company and was culturally very different.
good,Learned how to create Pivot Tables.  Many of the employees are great to work with. I did notice communication across departments struggled. All in all this was a positive work experience.
good,I have only been with the company for a short time so I can't give much information about the company.  I will say that I have been happy with everything fro the last 4 months.
good,SAIC offers opportunities to grow and be exposed to diverse  work opportunities. The company is engaged in very progressive activities that help in carrier growth.
good,"process reviews on an annual schedule, product reviews based on product delivery schedule, advised project managers on correctly following software processes in order to maintain compliance with contracts"
good,"Working at SAIC was great, people were great, office environment was inviting and comfortable."
good,"Company was supportive and interested in employees learning new skills and maintaining existing skills.  Company had excellent benefits from medical, dental, and vision plans, to 401k and employee stock purchase opportunities.  Hours could be extremely long and stressful."
good,"The flexible work schedule is good, the compensation is decent. The company depends on government  contracts which results in less security in employment"
good,"Super large company, and it feels like it.  Not too much to say other than that.  Had a good experience with the contract I was on.  Enjoyed the people and the mission."
good,Regular routine of morning scrums kept everyone up to date on all progress. informative. Good first contracting experience on a major program. Sparing was hardest part of the job.
good,"Just prior to 2000, San Diego County made the decision to outsource all IT functions.This was an extremely novel idea and had never been attempted on such a large government scale. In order to satisfy the outsource contract requirements, several technology service companies needed to partner together. SAIC was among these companies. SAIC assume my IT contract from San County and, eventually, offered me full employment. In early 2000's, California experienced growing fiscal turmoil. As funding from the state government to the local county government was curtailed, funding for my systems group, Public Safety, was also curtailed. Without funding, SAIC made the decision I was expendable, It is my understanding the SAIC job culture is once your project is ended, it is the employee's responsibility to apply for further employment at SAIC. At the time, there were no other open position available. Subsequently, I was laid off."
good,"Network and comraderies. departmental clicks, and toxic management principles. hardest part of the job was educating your manager on what we're doing."
good,"I enjoyed my time with SAIC and felt that I was quite adequately compensated, all in all. I had many advancement opportunities. I left the company because the contract ended, and the commute was awful. If there was an opportunity to go back with SAIC with a decent commute, I would not hesitate to make the transition."
good,"I come in early, work, go to lunch, work some more and then leave.  I learned about buying. some departments have good management, others don't. Hardest part is lower pay than many other companies."
good,SAIC was a company who held numerous different contracts meaning everyones work experience would be different.  It also required employees to quickly change focus.
good,Development of state of the art systems for various clients. Aggressive project timelines. Well supported and staffed team to successfully complete deliverables on schedule.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at SAIC and had the opportunity to work with many great people.  There are so many smart people working to solve hard problems here and that is inspiring.
good,"The work that was done at SAIC was very rewarding. A typical day at work was insuring that instructors received the necessary materials and paperwork necessary to do their training. I learned that what we did behind the scenes was very useful to people all over the USA. Management there were great people, I loved working with all of them. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work together with other people to get the job done."
good,"I am happy overall with the experience I have gained while working for saic. It was a great entry level position. They hold you to a very high standard, while paying as little as possible..."
good,"Company is offers standard pay, work life balance, benefits as other companies in this sector."
good,"Competent staff, serious about doing a good job. Efficient. It was a pleasure to work in an environment with values similar to mine. Managers did not seem to be as capable in their jobs as the technical people were in theirs. Also, there was no job security at all. When a project was done, so was the employee. Everyone had to stay aware of when their projects were coming to an end, and start sending out resumes. The business development staff was largely ineffective."
good,"Days consist of assisting different government personnel as needed. Learned different systems such as Remedy IT Systems. It's a typical work place where no one and nothing is perfect. Unfortunately, not much room to grow and expand."
good,"Be prepared for anything. This environment changes constantly. If you aren't up for being flexible, or you can't think out of the box. Then this would not be a good fit."
good,"Responded to phone calls or email message concerning fleet issues. Assisted in writing, editing and review of technical documentation off the ground replay systems used by the USNavy for support of the P3C and P8 ASW Aircraft.

good,"I've reviewed SAIC previously, not sure why Indeed is requiring me to review again. Please see previous review."
good,"Technically challenging work, good pay, tries to stay near industry upper range.  standard benefits package. Didn't feel micromanaged"
good,"40 hr  standard work week,  Overseas travel is required to support customer loactions.  The best part of this position is the customer and the mission I support."
good,Great culture and working environment.  Hire a diverse workforce and have steady supply of government contract work.
good,Pleasant company to work for. The job I was on was subcontracted under another company. It was the other contracting company that ruined the atmosphere for me.
good,SAIC is a good company to work for. Good benifits and they take care of the employess. IN Sept 2013 SAIC did a split and I became a part of LEIDOS it is a mirror image of SAIC and is a good comapny to work for as well.
good,The good thing about this company is that the management is mission oriented.  They tend to forget about the employees from time to time.
good,SAIC is a good company to work for. It has a good work and life balance.
good,"SAIC was a good company to work for, but to heavily dependent on government contracts."
good,The company started out good to work for but has slowly went down hill especially since the company split.
good,"Began working in a good location; unfortunately, contract ended. Reassigned to different job."
good,good working environment got NASA certifications while working there. Left for permanent position.
good,"Meetings, purchasing, planning for purchasing and following up on purchases takes up most of the day. I have learned more about the production process and product research and development. I like the company, however at my location, if you are not an engineer, you are not taken seriously as a professional. People tend to not be held accountable for their actions, or inactions; which negatively impacts the work environment and attitudes of other workers. I do love working with my co-workers and seeing the products that I buy turn into something amazing."
good,I would endorse SAIC as a solid company having worked for them twice.
good,"I love the working on projects that help our armed forces and the products that are produced by SAIC directly supports the military in a great way. This is the most enjoyable part of my job knowing that my work directly affects soldiers, sailors and Marines makes whatever I do that much better."
good,Busy preparing documents and PowerPoint presentations for Customer approvals.
good,Enjoyed the knowledge and professionalism of the team. Everyone was dedicated to the customer and exceeding their expectations.
good,"Enjoyed my time with SAIC, met many interesting and diverse people, learned many valuable things in the Microsoft suite over 10 years, exposure to many data base applications SAP,COMPASS, ORACLE, DELTEK/ ENTENSITY. Companies change over time and we often are chaned by them."
good,Company is good to work for and management structure is very flat which is nice. Communication is pretty good. Benefit package is the best. Team leads and managers don't always have the same rules when you can take vacation and what are normal work hours...just irritating.
good,A typical day at work?
good,"Overall, I like the idea of SAIC as an employer. Management talks a great game. In reality, however, I find the difficulty in advancing or pursuing development opportunities to be highly disappointing. We are viewed as a ""butts in seats"" contractor by many of our customers and competitors, and I cannot say that is an inaccurate perspective. That said, I have looked at competitors and have chosen to stay at SAIC for 10+ years. In this economy, it's difficult to find another company that can make a move worthwhile."
good,Work was fast-paced when required and created excellent team-building opportunities. Sometimes the employees were a bit ahead of what the customer should/would provide therefore not a lot of progress was made a times to improve the environment.
good,The company has good financial stability. It is a well run company with a good mixture of workforce diversity.
good,Upper management pressured me into believing I was not suitable for the position and 'moved' me to another department.
good,the best part are the co-workers. however this is a lot of micro managing and often functional areas do not work together.
good,This company is a good company overall to work for based upon it's ethics and training provided to enhance skills in a given position.
good,SAIC has a very broad range of business lines.  It is a primarily a federal government contractor.  They are not quite as innovative as they would lead you to believe.
good,Excellent management and technical coworkers.  Work environment was excellent.  I was allowed to decide what was needed and go do that with little interference.
good,"*Workday from 0730-16:30"
good,Very open environment and always allowing for teamwork. Allows work remotely if needed. Very much involvement with the community. Great management team.
good,Only been a part of SAIC for 1 month. I program in R. I don't know anything about SAIC really. Still mostly under Engility policy. This is an annoying step to get past in this process as it does not really apply to me
good,"SAIC is a typical government contractor.  For the most part, its a friendly place to work.  However, they consider your ideas as theirs.  So you want to be careful as to what you share in terms of business opportunities."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Not good for finding new coverage. They could invest more into training employees for new opportunities. The process for advanced clearance is flawed.  The process takes over 500 days.  I was at the final for a TS and they withdrew the application, only to start another TS process 6 months later."
good,"Glad to have worked at SAIC, but your life is all about the job. If you can easily tune out work while outside of work, then consider it, but you will always need to be tied to being available - but that's government work."
good,"The company itself was pretty good. The customer's site, less so. Lots of riff-raff going on with the other contractors, and some can do anything with impunity. I still haven't figured out how some of the people are not in jail, or at least fired. No complaints with SAIC, however, the people who worked for them were competent and good people."
good,"I worked for the company for 8 years. Worked 4 years on the Toyota Motor Sales contract  doing remote technical support for their employee base."
good,"great"
good,"I enjoy working at SAIC as ther is good collaboration, opportunities to learn, and plenty of work to do. I wish that the pay and benfits were a little better but the work/life balance makes up for it."
good,"Never boring. Always something new. Lots of TDY Travel over seas. Working with very knowledgeable people on a daily basic.  Opportunity to learn about many different telecommunication system such as Satellite communications, Microwave systems, Dc power, AC power system and many other vendor products."
good,"They are very open to ideas and change.  They are employee focused and work with you.  The Heath care benefits are not there, but they do try to make up for it with HSA contributions."
good,It’s a very nice facility to work at. My job requires long hours but very relaxed for the most part being on a standby status for most the time. Only time it gets hectic is when an emergency happens and then you have only 7 minutes to remedy the issue before lots of equipmet starts to fail.
good,Typical DoD contractor.  Take employment at this company if nothing better comes along.  Keep your office to a minimum and always be ready to leave at a moments notice.
good,"I had spent time in the intern program and that directly led to me getting an interview for this position.  It was an entry level position as a help desk administrator.  I learned a lot, I worked very hard, I had great managers, but the pay for a helpdesk admin is low anywhere you go, and so I evolved my career and left SAIC."
good,"The position was very demand at time and could get stressful meeting timetable.  Always learning something new on the job.  Slow time you could do training.  No growth within the position, but you know that going in as a contractor.  Stable company to work for.  Provide good benefit.  I like there retirement plan.  Position was eliminated due to SAP."
good,"very high paced and competitive work environment. Daily tasks usually come with short deadlines. Customer requirements are sometimes unclear. As a whole, you learn a lot very fast, not much time to relax at work."
good,"I enjoyed the job at SAIC/LEIDOS, The company had to let go of several contractors because of a cut in government funding to the contract and they were excellent in taking care of me and assisting me with finding a new job in the same field."
good,"I really enjoyed working at SAIC. I had a good benefits, before they split to SAIC and Leidos. They paid for some classed that I was taking at school."
good,Challenging technical work but the continuous organizational realignment is impacting employees in a negative way. The matrix organization is not well understood.
good,"Upper management very good.  Compensation excellent.  Coworkers, capable and intelligent, training excellent. Good and sense of fairness, teamwork exists among workers."
good,"SAIC is a great company to work for and offers basic benefits with very competitive pricing. However, my department was disbanded after a year and a half due to government funding and contract disagreements."
good,Great respectable company with good benefits; some departments not on board with general culture/opportunities.  Generally opportunities to advance but secretive on salaries to employees.
good,"Highly skilled and professional co-workers, collegial atmosphere, helpful and supportive. Pay is adequate. Health care costs increasing rapidly. Sufficient vacation/sick leave. No severance pay, no pension."
good,Workers often left on their own with no interaction from direct leadership. Kept in the dark when it comes to your contractual dates
good,It's an easy job but be prepared for boredom. You will spend alot of your day reading a book or whatnot which gets old fast.  if you want a mindless job its great but if you need to feel like you work for your paycheck then this is not the job for you.
good,"I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set."
good,I have worked here for four years and enjoy helping the training of our first responders in courses for terrorist attacks. You get to work in a unique environment.
good,"As subcontractors running a nurse advice line for the military, we have a clear and obviious objective, which management supports. Good manager, relaxed atmosphere."
good,"The location of work can vary based on the customer you support."
good,"SAIC provides an adequate job, but does not promote based on proven work ethic, ability, or qualifications.  Please understand that this is in relation to their contract work and NOT the administrative/corporate side of the company.  Overall, they are not a terrible company to work for.  They provide adequate benefits.  Nothing stellar about them.  The most enjoyable part, and by far the greatest perk, was the travel."
good,"I liked my job and the people that worked for me, but there was no opportunity for advancement and the salary was low in comparison to other positions within the company with equal experience base."
good,"Job hours worked well with having a family because of the flexibility.  I had standard M-F work hours, but had no problem taking time off as needed.  Co-workers worked together as a team for the most part.  The hardest part of the job was the volume of work, which could make it very stressful at times.  I learned a lot about how to better manage my time. Working conditions were very good and the office was a pleasant place to be."
good,"Daily routine consist of checking the queue for Incident Tickets that are assigned to each tech. Going to the user's location to troubleshoot the issue. If I can resolve the user's technical issue, then I will update and close the Incident ticket. "
good,"Typical workday averaged over the year 20% code/algorithm development, 20% documentation, 40% simulation/analysis, 10% research, 10% presentation"
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at SAIC, they were very flexible in allowing me the option of remote work, at a time when that was just beginning to be an acceptable practice in the workplace.  "
good,My time spent working for SAIC in Broomfield Colorado was wonderful.  I was able to develop better trouble shooting skills.  I enjoyed working with our United States Army Reserve.  We were able to assist in the daily operation of the security of our nation.
good,"SAIC was a good place to work and then the company split.  Leidos has become a company consumed with the bottom dollar (as it should be), but takes the path for improvement that makes no sense."
good,"Management kept changing their minds on direction of the company.  There was no real long-term plan for the next 5-10 years.   Guess that's why our division was sold to the lowest bidder??"
good,Very large company.  Has split in two recently.  Once was employee owned and employees were in a better situation.  Most everyone is very smart.
good,Govt contracting is not easy as every five years you have to win new contract. we are falling short of winning the new contract. we must look for jobs.
good,Got me a decent start to my career. People were nice and friendly.
good,The company split into SAIC and Leidos.  Each taking some employees and locations.  It was very good to work at SAIC/Leidos
good,"SAIC is a good company to work for, but as with all federal contractors, if the company loses the contract or needs to increase profits they cut staff."
good,"A typical day required updates to DNS, by logging into the routers, switches and PBXs to ensure the A and PTR records were entered into the Remedy Tickets over to DNS Engineers that maintained the Windows DNS records throughout the FEMA network.    "
good,SAIC is a good company to work for with opportunities to grow and mature in your career field.
good,"Great company to work for, but if there's no contract, you have no job (and there's not much more out here for our company).  Unless you are willing to re-locate, you have to find another company to work for."
good,The company overall is a great company if you have a management team you trust to look out for you
good,"Working with the Military to assist them with Intelligence, Surveillance and reconnaissance providing them near real time intelligence using aircraft and sensitive systems.  We worked 7 days a week, 14 to 16 hours a day with about two weeks off every six months.  I learned how to be more productive and lead in a more fluid manner.  My co-workers we are dedicated men and women serving SAIC and those who we were attempting to keep out of peril.  Staying sharp and vigilant were the hardest part of the job with weather conditions being challenging.  What kept me going was the fact that the information we provided possible saved lives or prevented harm from those who were giving their all."
good,"The business unit was supportive and had contracts for the Intelligence Community.  Worked on big constrcution project, long hours and stressful, but company compensated by providing out of cycle  pay raise.  Able to hire a great group of people for the team without senior management getting involved."
good,"Enjoyed working with SAIC, would still be working with the company but the contract came to an end."
good,Probably the best thing about SAIC is that the benefits start right away. Most weeks you only put in 40 hour. If you like a quiet work place and working by yourself then this is a good fit for you. Since you pretty much work by yourself there isn't really a bond between co-workers.
good,"Science Applications International Corporation, also known as SAIC, is an American defense company headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services and solutions."
good,"an easy to work for IT contracting company."
good,"A typical workday consists of 12 hours, from 8 to 8. rugged conditions, some days are extremely busy, others are very slow."
good,"My time at SAIC has been enjoyable. SAIC works hard to ensure that all employees adhere to their core Ethics and Standards focusing on customer relations. My days consist of reading through and answering emails from my customer and other contractors who have questions on the programs I work on as well as reviewing and commenting on requirements documents for the programs. Ensuring that all facets of the program are examined by me and knowing where different types of program philoshpies come from are important to staying on top of the everyday meetings and review boards. Managing my team of engineers is very enjoyable, I very much enjoy working with people and leading a team of highly qualified and junior engineers. Passing my knowledge down to the junior engineers is a very important part of ensuring that my team stays strong and allowing an outlet for the senior engineers to discuss with me their insight into program risks and mitigations as well as their overall knowledge is very important as well. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with customer demands as they sometimes change midway through some of the tasks. I have to adapt and ensure my team is aware of the change and what it means for them to be able to adapt and overcome the challenges. I have learned a lot about System Engineering multiple programs at a time and their nuances that they each have and how to ensure quality work for each task."
good,"SAIC has been a great place to work. I have been able to advance in a number of areas, pushing my expertise to new heights."
good,"With contracting it is always turbulant and uncertain. As for the company, there is room for improvement, but that could be said about any."
good,Strong company in the U.S. Government sector. Excellent management training program. Many opportunities for professional growth
good,Most of my work consists of maintenance and development of computer systems for our customers. Most of these systems are web based and written in a variety of dispciplines and languages. I have acquired a good number of IT skills at this firm. The coworkers and managers are generally very professional and knowledgable but management has too many duties and does not always look after the workers as well as they could. Developing new systems has been the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Great people, great role (contributing to the Navy's C4I capabilities), and a terrific task (documenting and implementing current to leading edge technologies) supporting Advanced Digital Network System."
good,"As the Summary spells out, The Program Management is Great."
good,"I am the first person in for the Security team in our office. My position handles the personnel and physical side of security. I am a liaison between subcontractors, SAIC employees and the government regarding visits and accesses required to perform. Create training, briefs and email notifications of security protocols. Also assist with escorting maintenance and facilities employees."
good,Love the team I work with we are able to support and help candidates.
good,I enjoyed the work environment to a degree. Team work was a good practice. Must co - workers were always within good spirits. Staying competitive was a must.
good,Good locale & Great Client. Work is most often interesting. Peak and valley work pace.
good,SAIC provided me with opportunities that were great. They truly believe in their employees.
good,A typical day at work?
good,Analyzing and billing government and commercial contracts to ensure they are in compliance with SAIC policies and FAR clauses
good,Management of the contract I was on left a lot to be desired. They underbid the contract then laid off most of the staff.
good,"Senior Systems Integration (SI) lead engineer for a National Customer in the Intelligence Community. The technical lead engineer for Geospatial Systems deployment planning and scheduling. Responsible for the testing, integration, fielding, and operations support of mission critical systems at multiple sites worldwide to optimize customer’s resources and manage risk."
good,"Enjoyed my stay at SAIC and would go back or recommend them to others. I thought this company exhibited and shared a good values system, and were largely hands off in the management which was nice. My manager was extremely nice and supportive, and she is an excellent human being who understands the balance between family and work life. I haven't had many managers of that calibre throughout my career. Coworkers were all nice people, helpful when needed and otherwise didn't seem to get in the way.The only negative thing I can think of is the lack of opportunities to be placed in another position when funding in a particular position comes to an end. All large corporations seem to share this problem, so it's certainly not SAIC specific. Given government cuts in many of the contracts, a large part of that is out of their control. So I give them a 4 stars overall."
good,A typical work day is consistent and often edgy depending on the client/customer. The SAIC environment is pleasant and challenge. There is opportunity to network and grow with some of the industry's most technical professionals.
good,"A day at SAIC is a day of hard work and its like a race to the finish, I have learned to be the best in producing by racing some of the other workers to see who can finish first. Managment is good and because I was a section lead on several projects I can say that giving my best encouraged others under me to give their best as well. The hardest part of my job is nothing once I am there I am ready to work. And the most enjoyable part of my job is the co-workers I've met and dealing them has made it all worth it. Great teamwork."
good,Large corporation with opportunity for employee growth within the company. Very high employee morale which reflects on the low amount of (non-economic) turnover.
good,"Good company to work with, just bad management of schedules and workload. Compensation was decent but advancement wasn't where I needed it to be for my current situation."
good,I really enjoyed the company and Sr. management.  The hardest part of the job was that we were a sub to the prime and lost our foothold.  Disappointing.  I really liked the new CEO and her all hands with everyone that wanted to dial in .... breathe of fresh air!
good,Fly into various cities and then help train canines.  Get to travel and see the country.  Relaxed work environment.  Work as a team with others.  Satisfaction in seeing results as they happen.
good,"It really depends on the contract you are working on. The contract that I was involved with was really good. There were a few issues with some promises made but the contract holder ended up with some problems. "
good,The only down side to a service provider is the client. Your client determines the stability of the job. Contracts with the government are very disruptive to the contributor. Most folks that succeed already have retired from one career and use these jobs to augment. Others choose to work in this environment hopeful the government will recognize their value and hire direct. Of all the contractors SAIC at least treats you like an employee and not a commodity where possible.
good,SAIC is a great Company to work for. No complaints at all. There is a good bit of instability in my current position but that is more the fault of the government client than SAIC.  SAIC and the management team have always been up front and honest while looking out for what is best for their team members.
good,"We delivered high quality reports to senior management to assist with their decision making."
good,SAIC is a good place to work. The people are smart and work collaboratively to accomplish goals. I would recommend this company. It is a great place to start/finish a career.
good,"I was only a contractor for 4 months, but in my time there everyone was friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  The site in San Diego is small, but most of the work was supporting remote or telecommuting employees."
good,Large Company with many options to grow. You can start out in governement and DOD contracting and decide to change and make your way in to the aerospace fields with out much fuss.
good,Enjoyed working with really smart people.  I worked in three sites for SAIC and each felt like a small company versus a big corporation.  Good management.
good,"Developing Systems, Applications (SAP) and Product testing for Global Combat Systems-Army (GCSS-A) for U.S. Army Aviation."
good,"A great company but surprising conservative and non-aggressive management for such a large company. Most of the employees have a strong loyalty to the company. Medical insurance cost is extremely low, even better than my federal program. The company treat their employees as an asset to be groomed and maintain,  rather than a throw away LOI. They provide online training and other training upon request. Unfortunately, the customers seem to be more of an issue than the company."
good,Great work/life balance.  The overall company seems to try to go through major changes quickly and doesn't seem to look far enough into the future.  Always a lot of changes and moving parts.  Overall great job.
good,"Once your in, your in. That's a fact. Pretty hard to get fired. Your experience, however, depends on location. Its the people that drive the atmosphere and the work experience. A toxic leader will destroy the comradery. An engaged and supporting boss will motivate you to innovate and excel."
good,SAIC provided a comfortable work environment at their home offices. Management encouraged growth and skill improvement. The hardest part of the job was impromptu travel and lack of training for new project requirements. The most rewarding part of the job was ever present opprtunity to grow your skills.
good,"As a gov't contractor, SAIC is limited by the same things all of them are. They try to balance compensaiton, time off, rewarding challenges in the work itself, and opportunity for individuals to simply ""work""."
good,"I worked remotely: I was on the west coast with a supervisor on the east coast.  Never met her. Communicated by email. "
good,Good company to work for with a productive work environment. Wish there would have been more job security / advancement.  Worked for the company for 10 years.
good,Empresa que te permite desarrollar nuevas habilidades y aplicar conocimientos adquiridos.
good,"very flexible working environment. many telecommute, and had a good balance between work and personal life. could be stressful at times having to meet firm deadlines for government submission of a proposal."
good,i was intern here and was able to learn a lot since I had no prior experience creating an app before. I had to learn agile development to meet the end goal of the summer: creating a working augmented reality. I coded and did 3D modeling for them.
good,"Work for many years with SAIC, as a matter of fact work for them twice, both times were very fair. Not much in way of upward mobility, but you don't get that kind of mobility in government contracts. You are there to do a job and that is what you do until you move on to the next one."
good,"Upper Management continually streamlined off the program and more work is piled onto remaining staff with little to no compensation."
good,"Good pay/benefits, poor job security...get an award one week for job performance and a pink slip the next week.  Enjoyed the job, people I was working with."
good,So far they have been every patient with me as a military retiree transitioning into the civilian workforce.  My co workers and management are great and are flexible with work hours and teleworking schedule.
good,"The people and culture are great, but there are not many places to advance as it is about numbers and very little about people.Once you are on a contract, you generally stay until there is growth in other areas. It is the nature of the IT world."
good,I worked as a telecommuter. I learned to work on my own and budget my time to complete projects. I was difficult sometimes dealing with a manager so far away that really didn't understand the job.
good,"As part of a team of designers and word processors, I helped to produce RFP/RFQs. Some projects required extensive work and overtime, with everyone pitching in to complete the best possible project."
good,Results of our mission end states are strongly recognized by our customers.  Able to operate and complete tasks on a timely manner  less supervisors exercising micromanagement activities.  Updated office automations and software upgrades made our daily input to data reports more efficient and on time.
good,"Contract work in government environment, required a secret clearance.  read and interpreted COBOL programming code to develop narrative instructional scripts.  Normal 8 to 5"
good,"Very good management, good work relationship between subordinates and employees, very good life and work balance, employees are allowed to work very independently without too much interference from supervisors. Job security was not that good because SAIC has to bid on jobs regularly to keep employees employed."
good,"I had a great time @ SAIC for over 20 years, I needed to change the focus of my career, I made the call to leave to find something new, looking away from the government sector, and more in the private sector. Working for government contracts is no longer what I am looking for in a professional career."
good,I really enjoy working at SAIC.  I love the culture. I love the people.  I love how everyone got along and everyone helped one another.  It was a place where you felt good coming to work.
good,I enjoyed working with the people I worked in my section and the ability  the company provided to learn new skills. I appreciated the ability to transfer within to the company for advancement.
good,Good engineering service company with a lot of ability to move around with in the company. Very professional working environment with skilled employees.
good,"When I was at SAIC it was a very good place to work. The dedication of the personnel at the firm was great. It was very fast paced, and expectations were high."
good,"Good experience"
good,"Some managers were easy to work for.  Some managers will listen and work with you to fix problems.  My work was with a number of Government contracts, using the FAR and other US Government regulations in support of GPS program.  I was able to save important test and save money for the USAF by knowing the FAR and NSA regulations.  As well preventing mistakes on bids on a Government contract."
good,"SAIC is a good company to work with that provides decent benefits. The one major issue I have with working here is repetitive nature and low pay. In addition to that, there isnt a whole lot of room to advance within the company."
good,I've enjoyed my tenure at SAIC and would remain if my contract wasn't up. I have a bit of difficulty explaining the culture as I work exclusively at a government site and the policies here are government-specific. I believe that other sites have substantially different policies.
good,"As an SAIC/Leidos emplyee, I worked on-site with the customer. The work environment was fantastic, but there was a lack of mentorship/human resources to support advancement within Leidos."
good,Large company - provided great training and a lot of opportunities with a lot of different locations. Pretty good benefits and very good vacation and sick days.
good,I enjoy working at SAIC.  The flex work schedule is perfect for my schedule at this time.  My co workers are top notch and pleasant to work with.  My only concern is that there is no advancement currently available for me personally.  This is why I am seeking other employment.
good,This is a very good company to work for.  The supervisors and employees are helpful and friendly.  The work atmosphere is relaxed and the workload is steady.
good,"Not the best benefits, but suitable for an introduction into the world of contract work."
good,"SAIC's online environment in the form of ISSAIC and it's sub-categories is a vast positive resource, providing contact with other SAIC employees and needed information about Policies, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures required to best support the clients,  day to day operations and business related distance learning."
good,"Working for SAIC is never a dull moment, many moving parts... this job could be very challenging and satisfying at the same time. "
good,"While SAIC offers fantastic benefits and good job security, they do not provide much opportunity (if any) for advancement.  They were also unwilling to pay for my PMP training and certification test, which most companies will cover as long as you stay with the company for a specified period (e.g. a year after the training/test).  A few of my peers (including my mentor) actually recommended I leave the company and come back to advance my career.  Over the last 8 years I've been promoted three times and am getting to the point where I may consider going back as my next promotion will require additional experience."
good,"SAIC is a good place to work.  Moving in the company is somewhat difficult.I have applied for various positions and have only moved twice.  Other than this issue, it's been a steady place to work."
good,"SAIC was a nice place to work, people were like Family. Everyone pulled together to get deadlines met within your department. It's like most big companies, you have ups and downs with employees/management; however, at the end of the day the job was done."
good,I enjoy working for the company with flexible hours and laid back environment. I was able to design and develop my applications with little or no interference unless I asked someone for their thoughts on a particular issue. My concern are the contracts are 1-3 years and it is possible to be unemployed overnight depending on the awarding of the contract you are working under.
good,A 9 to 5 type job with 25% travel. I like the monthly lunch & learn sessions with bright co-workers. Management speaks of and leads by example to proper ethics and contractual obligations.
good,"The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. "
good,"My experience with SAIC was similar to other military contractors that I've worked for. SAIC pays their employees well but not exceptionally well.  Just like other contracting companies in the area, SAIC uses engineers in management positions and this is not always the best idea.  I enjoy the kind of work in the contracting field and get along well with all the co-workers. The hardest part of working for SAIC was dealing with over management and false deadlines that come from the managers limited qualifications and self confidence. Its also easy to be taken advantage of at SAIC. Meaning if a person is willing to do tasks outside of their job description, then those tasks becomes expected of that person but they never receive additional compensation. This leads to good employees doing more and more work but not advancing in pay. "
good,Get to work with US military on a day to day basis and help make their lives safer while in harms way. leadership is open minding and will to listen to anyone on the team. On a daily basis you will learn something new. This job is always evolving to support the customer. The only down fall I see right now is that it is and contact job.
good,"Good company to work for. Fast past work environment, comfortable work environment, and great co workers. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping others and the hardest part of the job is babysitting employees when in a leadership position"
good,"I started as a Technical Writer, evolved into QA and then some management positions.  I even was allowed a brief opportunity to contribute as a mechanical assembler in Afghanistan."
good,I worked for SAIC over a nine year period. I enjoyed being able to use my education and training to help grow the business. The technical nature met with my desires to improve my knowledge in those areas as well as working with experts in the fields of study. As in any job it was the coworkers who made the experience as rewarding as it was.
good,"Everyday was different and I enjoyed the dynamics of the job.  I learned hands on international logistics. "
good,.Starting out was a challenge until you came up to speed on the various MILSATCOM systems. A very dynamic and fast paced environment lot of different and interesting places came my way.
good,"Planning all Combating Terrorism course both at SOCOM (Special Operations Command) and at JSOU (Joint Special Operations University) in the USA and also taking the course world wide."
good,"I was with SAIC for just a year as a contractor. I thought the place would be a good place to start for young college grads looking to get their start but I'm in mid-career so I did not see much future there. I will admit tough, that they are a good spring board into any level you are in your career but I had heard several times that salaries are low as compared to industry standards."
good,"It was a good job."
good,I am not in a position to rate at this time as my employment has been decreased substantially by the company.
good,Good pay.  Management could be better but overall not bad.  Much better than the unemployment line
good,"Opportunities for training, great mentorship, and teaching environment"
good,"SAIC is another government contractor that is well respected but has often been subjected to government investigations.  The compensation is not the greatest but it's above average.  The company prides itself over it's reputation and heritage (scientific), and majority of the staff are well educated and professional with the level of service they provide."
good,"Nice place to work, team environment. Pleasant cohesive teams work common project goals to completion, always maintaining a mission first attitude."
good,"nice to work for, good benefits and work environment. I learned a lot from its people and corporate culture."
good,"SAIC is a great company with a lot of great people to work with."
good,Excellent place to work at and the management was top notch.
good,During my 8 years of being employed with SAIC I've supported various contracts within the agency. While working those years if meet wonderful people and learned how to network and do knowledge management which was important for analyst.
good,Love my 7 years with SAIC and the ability to grow professionally both technical and as a program manager.  Do not agree with the split of the company and the lost for quality benefits.
good,Managed an team of Network engineers and grew business from 27 to 48 engineers.
good,Leidos is a great place to work and learn. They have allowed me to grow professionally and learn new skills that can benefit me in the future.
good,"Ability to learn in different areas, when there is an opening, to become a more well rounded employee."
good,"Awesome job.  Awesome project.  Awesome people.  Typical day was working at my desk/cubicle doing software development and extensive testing.  Management was always open, easy to talk to, and very helpful."
good,Organizationally flat which allows for concise communication between employee and management. Support from the team is excellent.
good,"We would use the Scrum and the software life cycle to manage the priorities of software development. When the priorities were in order I would work off my portion of the software that needed to be developed, maintained, or fixed.  I learned how to perform client/server communication using SSL sockets, program in multiple languages including C#, Java, and bash shell script, worked with windows, worked with linux, and develop my object-oriented skills and design patterns.  The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers and always being able to learn something new.  The hardest part was making a large variety of technologies both hardware and software to work together in the system with stringent security policies in place."
good,"A typical day at work would include a daily morning status meeting were goals and objectives for the day were discussed. Followed by an 8-12 hour shift working toward accomplishing these goals and output objectives."
good,I worked my way up in a matter of a year and a half.  Started as temp position and left as a field sales representative.
good,"Enjoyed working as a contractor for Federal Governent especially the Department of Defense - I am a veteran and like to keep close ties to that environment when I can. "
good,"This was a short contract, and a good company to work for. A good place to work."
good,I was a contractor so had no real insight into what or how the company was doing.  They paid on time and put me with a wonderful client - not much more a contractor can ask for!
good,Great company to work for.  Government contracting is very difficult to manage as it is based on customer views.
good,"My only complaint is the health insurance. They changed the plan this year, and it is terrible. I have greatly increased my knowledge as there is plenty of opportunities to move into other position."
good,"SAIC is a good company to work for but not great if you are outside the McLean or State of Virginia area.  Working in New Mexico for SAIC left you feeling more like the red headed stepchild.  No events were ever planned for us out there while the McLean office would get all of the employee appreciation events etc.  Work was ok, being subcontracted to the DOE but not able to take advantage of any DOE privileges reserved for the actual employees.  Benefits were okay, although things were better before the change this year to HSA."
good,I've worked with many contracting companies and  for a large govronment contractor this is one of the best.
good,SAIC employs a lot of very smart people.  However the culture is going through a significant change and it's hard to provide much more insight until the dust has settled.
good,"Flexible work schedule allows for good work and life balance. Contracts are not long term in the particular office I worked in. The work itself was interesting and provided some challenge. Management was great, honest, and forthcoming."
good,Great atmosphere to learn
good,"As a Maintenance Support Specialist, worked closely with vehicle maintenance supervisor and team leads as well as mechanics to assist with production and quality of work performed on vehicle. Worked with mechanics with troubleshooting and diagnostics of vehicle faults and deficiencies. Maintained database files for each piece of equipment."
good,"Within a month, I invoice between 100-150 invoices to government and commerical contractors. I have had alot of training on several skills. Co-workers were good team players. Hardest part of the job was deadlines. Most enjoyable was the flexibility and training opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of attending meetings, reviewing business proposals, entering information into eCPIC and following up on emails and speaking with Project Managers and review Exhibit 300's during Exhibit-300 season and also entering and/or correcting IT Dashboard information."
good,Overall this is a good company to work for. I worked with a good group of people from various backgrounds. I learned a lot while working for the company and gained experience in multiple areas of expertise.
good,"Many great years. Love the work. Too far from home. If you like to live in the middle of the desert, then the job is perfect. If you're a city boy like me, no good."
good,Working hrs 630a-330p. Great hours while still doing a 40 hr week. I was given guidance and training to learn and/or improve skills I had already acquired. Management team was supportive and helpful. Co-workers were a diverse group of individuals that worked well together and had the ability to produce quality work in a timely manner. There wasn't really anything too challenging in this position. I really enjoyed being a Quality Assurance Specialist for this company and felt I grew in my career while I was there.
good,"A typical week was comprised of 1-3 days traveling to jobsites. typical destinations included visiting Walmart stores around Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, Iowa City, and Minneapolis. The remaining days spent in the office in St. Paul answering RFI's, approving submittals, and answering phone calls from contractors with issues of differing scopes."
good,"SAIC was a very technical and skilled company. Work was mainly short-term programs that lasted for a few weeks to months. Once a program ended, it was up to the engineer to find his or her next support to keep a position. This was rather stressful especially for a new employee who did not understand contracting and the ropes of getting a new opportunity. After more than 3 years I found it to be best to look for more secure work."
good,"A day of installing, repairing and test elecronic communication equiptment in the millitary vehicals."
good,"Working with SAIC has been a great experience, as with any jobs it has its flaws, however the culture the company maintains gives the sense that you are not just an employee but a member of something larger and that hold syou accountable for that larger entity."
good,I really enjoyed my time at SAIC. Everyone got along and our tasked always was completed on time. The people there take pride into their work. Aiming to help our fellow men overseas that's in the war.
good,"Takes a lot to get in the door.  They want professionals with specific knowledge and talents.  Highly secure environment.  Job security is determined by contracts, however, not performance."
good,"As a company SAIC is great.  I was very happy working there.  The environment was laid back, and the pay was good.  Due to the type of work, there are a lot of veterans."
good,"I am telework for last few years, however, with our management help, we meet frequently every few months to socialize. The hardest of telework is not meet your co-worker and regular working life style."
good,"Competitive benefits and good work culture at SAIC.  Company provides financial resources for continuing education, employee referral program, and online courses for work related curriculum."
good,"This is my first taste in corporate environment and it was definitely a change to what I was used to prior to working with SAIC.  While the pay is decent, the healthcare plans could use some work in regards to annual deductibles that tends to be a bit high. "
good,"Good company, great benefits, just minimum opportunity to work remote. I will recommend employment with SAIC, the benefits are excellent."
good,"Really enjoying the treatment here. Cutting edge platforms and everyone is treated the same. Free coffee and soda, great gym too. Really dig the virtual reality goggles."
good,"Fun and challenging company to work for. Lots of intelligent people from many different fields such as Installer, Engineers, Technician and a couple of Scientist. Working there requires flexibility because of the many government contract."
good,"Professional company and one of the better contractors to work for. Management didn't provide much professional development but if you came to them with opportunities you were interested in they were happy to assist. Good pay, good benefits."
good,"Provided challenging opportunities to support customer missions using project management controls for managing projects.  Provided collaborative team environment, management supportive and encouraged collaborative work environment."
good,"SAIC allows you to work the job; flexible schedule, just get the job done. They also have a superior technical organization that supports business development.  First company I ever where the Solution Architects/SME's go out of their way to track you down to start developing a solution. Management is very approachable from your immediate supervisor to the CEO, which is very different than most companies of this size."
good,When I first started at SAIC it was an employee owned company and a lot of interesting work and opportunities. My first assignment started off as a 2-year assignment but ended up 11 years with a very interesting client. The company started changing when it went public. When the company split into SAIC and Leidos there was a lot of confusion. My project went to Leidos but I ended back at SAIC after 2.5 weeks where I had to start all over again (despite the fact that I had nearly 30 years time before).
good,"SAIC is a defense contractor. It was founded in San Diego. In 2013, SAIC renamed itself Leidos and spun off a new company named SAIC. The company appears to value an ethical culture."
good,"Enjoyed the work locations and employees, but supervisors seemed to discriminate among it's employees.  Supervisors had favorites and didn't promote or engage with people of color."
good,"On the job training .Company  willing to work with you if you need to take time off."
good,"Work with a group in Asset Management, the office was inviting and you could hear laughing and chatter in the halls. It was like a family environment, great team work. My boss was demanding but took the time to explain the task needed and always had time for you."
good,work was great in Kuwait with SAIC.   The only bad thing is that the contract ended after 5 years. Management was very nice and it was a great working environment.
good,Greenbelt office was a great work environment.  Employees are great and the program managers are awesome. Quiet place at times but it can get busy and motivating.
good,I have had great opportunties with SAIC and have worked on a vast amount of contracts that have broaden my horizons and have continued to gro and expand my areas of responsibilites.  I have always worked at customer sites and would like to continue to do so. I believe my resume speaks for itself in what a typical day looks like and no two days are ever the same.
good,"The job was fun but, there was no advancement unless you have a BS or higher (preferred).  You performed Government Acceptance Tests and installed as needed."
good,Best company Ive worked for. Would not of left if relocation wasn't necessary in my personal life. Commute was the killer in the end for me otherwise would of retired from them.
good,SAIC iss a typical contracting employer - a variety of cultures and personalities keep the atmosphere light.  The workload was never unbearable and appreciation was shown for most taskes performed.
good,They'll definitely low ball your compensation you by a lot. However the office I was in was all very friendly. Our manager and all my coworkers had a strong concept of work life balance.
good,"SAIC has a great culture and supportive of employees, employee families, and community.  Positive and progressive environment.  Positive management structure."
good,"The workplace was not very exciting on a day to day basis, but the impact of your work can be quite meaningful. Strong opportunity for upward mobility."
good,The daily job was challenging due to changes after the build was complete and we had to make shipping times. There was very little communication with the managers to the production floor about things happening within the production area. I preferred to be on the road with an assigned team working on vehicles at different bases.
good,SAIC was a very good employer.  They supported me/my team in our work with the Navy.  Provided great benefits.  Managers at SAIC conducted regular team meetings to keep us up to date with the company. Over all working with SAIC was great.  I hated to leave at the end of our contract.
good,I've been on a 3 1/2 year contract that was exclusively remote role. i was able to gain valuable experience with Office 365 and additional experience with Microsoft Exchange Server 2007-2013 that should benefit me moving forward.
good,"good place/company to work for. Benefits were really good. Just be careful what division your looking at and what contract they have, and how long those contracts last."
good,Each day's work was challenging. Company offered extensive training and opportunity to grow. Management was fair and offered challenges to improve placement within the company.
good,"Great colleagues and a great learning atmosphere. "
good,"A good company with reasonable benefit package"
good,"SAIC offered a flexible, rewarding work experience.  They were extremely supportive of all employees and worked hard to ensure their success.  They provided training opportunities and sought employee input often."
good,"The supervisors that are on site, and the team of people I work with are amazing!! Couldn't ask for a better group. The SAIC company could pay much better than they do and offer more PTO. 10 days a year, compared to other companies I have worked for, is definitely an area where improvements could be made. The salary is also not very competitive. I took this position to gain experience I needed to progress in my career."
good,"I enjoyed working for SAIC, would still be there if they had won the contract or had any openings locally. They treated their people well, and there was a communal commitment to the work to be done."
good,I work at a customer site and cannot comment much on SAIC facilities but the company does a good job of taking care of us even though we are not located in an SAIC facility.
good,Would recommend this employer to anyone even if you have no prior experience in this field. Everyone is willing to help you. Benefits are good. Pay is excellent.
good,"Working here was great.  I was able to witness some wonderful work performed for their clients.  Everyday was different, which is why I enjoyed the work I did!!"
good,"Great place to work, very motivational and dedicated to employees. Unfortunately I was let go from the company after defending my son who was being cyber-bullied on social media. I gave 100% to this company, even to the point of being hospitalized due to work injury. I could have sought out Workers Comp but never did as I liked where I worked and enjoyed my job. I was never even given a chance to hear my side of what occurred regarding the social media incident which was done on personal my time.  I was simply escorted out without being given a reason for being let go. Not a very professional way to treat a dedicated employee."
good,SAIC has changed a lot over the last decade but still a great place to work. The company has been very successful since the spit with the old SAIC/Leidos a few years ago.  Culture is changing but still closer to the old employee owned SAIC than Leidos. CEO is a great leader.
good,"SAIC/Leidos is a great company!  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people.  Working with wonderful, talented, hard-working HR professional is the best part of working at this company."
good,"I've been employed here for a year and i love it. The pay is good and the friendly working environment is awesome. They give  you a chance to travel and work, depending on the project."
good,I enjoyed working for SAIC as a Contractor with the United States Marine Corps. The hours were great. The benefits were adequate. Pay was great. Not good enough for SoCal life but there's not much you can do when it comes to contracting.
good,"SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions."
good,"Growing company that is a pleasure to work with.  Progressive management team with great vision."
good,"Great job for veterans. Military friendly company, with a job focus to better the lives of soldiers on active duty. Working on, fabricating, and upgrading military vehicles."
good,My supervisors over the 15 years I worked for this company were very nice. They supported me and want me to succeed in everything I do.
good,There is considerable diversity in work opportunities.  This company is especially suited for someone who doesn't need a manual for every task.
good,I enjoyed working there. Management was very supportive and placed value on their employees. Only negative is the pay is not that good. Health care packages were good but I couldn't really afford to have a dependent because that would weigh heavy on my check.
good,"SAIC is a good place to work but, I am on the travel side of it and did not like it as much as I thought. However it is a good job that pays well. Also it is very laid back as long as you get your job done nobody bothers you."
good,I enjoyed working for SAIC.  Co-workers are easy to get along with and there was a great deal that I learned from working on various projects over the last 8 years.
good,Great staff to support and company benefits; enjoyed 10 years before Divisions consolidated and downsizing occurred.
good,SAIC has been one of the leading DoD Contract and technology companies in the market. Great company to work for if you do not have a problem with relocation.
good,SAIC is a highly respected Defense Contractor in the DC area.  The experience and pay you receive here will be higher than other companies.
good,"Tough to rate this company since the work itself is extremely demanding in terms of hours and effort required. I refer to the disaster recovery unit of SAIC since this is the only division of the company I am familiar with. Very good pay and compensation, high level of respect shown to management before and during deployment. In would make this field and this company my future but the work opportunities are very limited."
good,"Management at both SAIC and LEIDOS have been very accommodating in allowing employees to work a schedule which does not interfere with family.  As a parent of a special needs child, this was an area of great concern when I accepted my position with SAIC and subsequently LEIDOS.  Telework and flex-time work hours allowed my to maintain my career and also be available to attend school meetings and medical appointment when necessary."
good,"From my office, I directed the Army's future combat systems research on human factors analysis on manned ground vehicles.  Interviewed potential human factors engineers for their expertise and willingness to provide support.  Attended meetings in and outside of the company.  Formed a coalitions with other engineers who were contracted to work with SAIC and Boeing."
good,It is a good place to work. I have alot of freedom there. They listen to my ideas. I like the people I work with.
good,"A day on the job is anything but typical with the many changes that come with maintaining inventories.  As the custodian over all metals that are stored in my department, tracking transactions in VIS to maintain accurate inventories yield minor mistakes that require correction.  Rotating cycle counts on inventories helps to minimize discrepancies.  I inspect and receive orders of metals for multiple projects that come in from outside vendors.  Once orders have been accounted for and inspected, they are received into VIS, packaged and shipped out using an 1149 document.  Those co-workers that I work with on a daily basis are both local and beyond the walls of the  warehouse.  In order to be productive and successful I communicate with an array of task managers, vendors and transportation personnel.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the hole supply chain in motion.  Each individual doing their part to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,"Exciting organization to work for, that fully understood and supported the individuals skill sets growth and maintenance.  Culture of organization knew that investing in the employee, results in greater dividends to the organization as a whole."
good,As a dedicated employee my teammates would describe me as easy to get along with but a hard worker who tries to help others excel as well.
good,"A typical work day is from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM depending on your job function. They pay overtime or extended work week on an as needed basis (as needed for job completion).  My project manager is a great man and I have enjoyed working for him the last five years. The one thing to remeber is that SAIC deals in alot of government projects. When the project is cancelled or budget cuts come around, they may not have another position available for you."
good,SAIC split into two companies in August 2013 the majority of all DOD contracts went to new company called Leidos. Leidos is a mirror image of SAIC. All the same benifits as SAIC. Overall the company is a good company to work for. As with any job you get some supervisors that you wonder how that got that position. It is what it is.
good,Great people to work for. They would help you however they could.
good,"The company could be engaging when you were on site at the client's location.  Generally you were left alone to deal directly with the client."
good,"The number of ""black ops"" projects was impressive.  Many retired military, connected to the pentagon, helped with contract acquisition."
good,Work primarily on OPNET applications to analyze network and application problems
good,"SAIC was a great company when it was employee owned. Since going public, there have been some growing pains. Even though the company is large, it used to have a small company feel. It has now gained a much more corporate feel. Worker moral was very low, but seems to be improving."
good,"I worked in Vicksburg, MS supporting USACE.  My Task Leader at the time was awesome.  OT was easy to get, but if you go for too much you'll be made salary.  Skill level advancements were not hard to get provided to worked for them."
good,"I really enjoy the people that I work with.  Our team members are experienced professionals that are always looking for efficient, customer-based solutions.  Good sources of info and always ready to help a fellow team-mate."
good,Collaborative Environment; Encourage and reward continuous education and certifications; Very professional staff and a very nice work environment; Encourage personal health by including a very nice exercise gym with trainer in the building.
good,"The contract lifestyle is insecure and impossible to move up within. SAIC is great if you can get the right fit and have a manager that will help you progress through your career. I didn't quit SAIC, I quit my manager and CEO who wouldn't move me to another contract that better suited my skill set. "
good,Exceptional focus on value and ethics.  SAIC has a great management team and exceptional opportunities for those who want to challenge themselves.
good,"I was given the opportunity to learn a new skill.  Management was flexible with WFH policy. Co-workers were professional and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was working with government customers."
good,"Contractors for Verizon were included with SAIC's purchase of SMC and as a result management was very hands off, which was good and, in some cases, bad.  However, very professional people to work with."
good,"Scitor Corporation has done a great job keeping their company flat. By the way they've developed their business sectors, they keep a small business feel although they are a large business.  This makes the employee feel like they count. They have a a great benefits package.  I'm a consultant and work off-site, and my management team has done a great job supporting me from that location."
good,SAIC has a good work culture. Everyone seems to get along and the benefits from the company are very nice. I have learned from my management the value of certifications and the direct relation to career progression they have in my work field.
good,I spend half of my time overseas and work a minimum of 84 hours per week.  It pays well but it can burn you out if you are not careful.  I have site lead at two of our locations OCONUS and have enjoyed the change in responsibilities and opportunities
good,I was a contractor with SAIC. I performed the work as directed by the Government Representative and kept SAIC informed of my duties. Great company to work for.
good,"I generally have only good things to say about the company.  Since going public, the environment has definitely changed from ""the big company with the small company feel"" to ""just another big company with a big company feel"", however, I have nothing but high praise for my immediate level supervisors/management who still have the original ""employee owned"" mentality, so it really depends on what part of the company you work for.  "
good,"The best part of working for SAIC has always been the co-workers. It's true, there has been a rare exception once in awhile, but by and large, the many people I have worked with here have been great. With Information Assurance, it is always a fast-paced adventure and you are always learning new things and it is no exception at SAIC. Perhaps the hardest part of the job is keeping pace with these changes, but it is inherent in this space. The pace of work can vary greatly and at the more intense times, the good-natured way in which most of the employees here are able to handle it makes it much easier to deal with. And when it's not, it's even better."
good,Very understanding on personnel issues. Kept us up to date on current tasks and responsibilities. Management was approachable.
good,A typical day at work is like any other office job. The best part about my job working at SAIC is the co-workers. Our working environment is very relaxed and I work with a group of very nice people.
good,"Work is varied depending on the needs of the company and customer. My time is divided between the functions of Quality, Safety, and Enviromental Compliance. My years of experience on the NDBC Contract with both SAIC and CSC have been beneficial to my growth and development as a professional. The people I work with are dedicated to doing a good job and understand the importance of the work they perform on behalf of the government. The most difficult aspect of my job is trying to adequately balance the time available beteen my three primary functions - some days I feel it is more than one person can manage. I enjoy being able to keep people safe and see them go home at the end of each day with all their fingers and toes to enjoy life with their families."
good,"Im the receptionist here, I like to greet the guests and make sure that they are allowed to access the building by checking their clearance level and/or making sure they reach the proper point of contact. Its pretty steady slow paced, the most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom."
good,"large company, not very personal."
good,SAIC is a fun and rewarding place to work. Certain career areas are prone to hire/rehire vs. long term stability. I learned agreat deal about advanced electronics from outstanding Engineers.
good,Enjoyed my time working with SAIC. They understand all work and no play drives employees away. They have company functions to give a little back to the employees.
good,"A typical day would involve receiving submittals/rfi's for processing; editing specifications, communicating with other staff in out of state offices. I learned two different software programs. One for editing specifications and the other for tracking submittals/rfi's. I enjoyed my co-workers. Most had a good sense of humor and were easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was making sure our projects were submitted in a timely manner. I most enjoyed the people I worked with and the satisfaction I gained when a project was submitted on time and accurate."
good,"Is a great company to work for, great benefits and people."
good,"SAIC is a great company to work for if you're not in corporate, which is experiencing downsizing. If you work on an interesting project with a good manager, the possibilities are endless. You are given a lot of lattitude to make decisions. The company doesn't have the same feel as it did when it was employee-owned, but there is still opportunity. This review pertains to San Diego only."
good,"I obtained valuable experience working at SAIC, wouldn't change any lesson learned. Management listened and were receptive to ideas and opinions. My co-workers were a joy to work with, the hardest part of the job was having to leave. I enjoyed most the team and the cohesiveness and values of staff and people that I worked with."
good,"The quarterly picnics were a lot of fun and terrific teambuilding events. Not only did employees have the opportunity to interact with each other, but they also were part of raising money for worthwhile local charities. This was an excellent idea for the employees."
good,"SAIC offers many opportunities to advance your career. I assisted in pricing, proposal preparation, and contract negotiations for all assigned contracts. I administered all contract types(firm fixed price, time and material, cost plus fixed fee, etc.), supported all program and division managers within and outside of the Business Unit (BU), prepared, revised, negotiated and coordinated Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA) and Teaming Agreements (TA) with the legal department for acceptable terms to SAIC. Courses were offered year round to assist you in your job as well."
good,My extensive background in Materials/Distribution & Production Planning & Inventory Control with Chemicals required for the military's POLCHEM contract allowed me to prosper in my position as Sr buyer at the inception of the contract and the attainment of the required service level stipulated under the terms.
good,"productive working environment.  great people,  benefits are great,  just re enrolled.  I'm happy to explore other areas within DG to continue to build my career"
good,"Work day varies.  SAIC has provided opportunities to learn many different skills.  However, they are not supporting of continuing education if pursuing something for another area of the company.  It must be directly job specific."
good,"SAIC has a plethora of opportunities.  However, I didn't like how they handle my contract.   We got laid off with no advance notice which left a bad taste."
good,"Great place for internship, helpful and they put you on multiple projects.  It really gets you out of your comfort zone but in a good way.  They will help you achieve your personal goals."
good,It was a very laid back but professional atmosphere were I was very comfortable working. the managers were open and well organized in  team goal orientation and accomplishment.
good,Since I have worked with SAIC; I have enjoyed working for this employer. They have challenged me more than any of my other employers. I recommend them
good,Overall supportive and good workplace culture.  Management encouraged advancement and made every effort for training and additional qualifications required for the job.
good,"SAIC is like many large business contractors, and every project and office location can vary.  I was fortunate to have an excellent project with outstanding and caring mentors who guided me and gave me opportunities for growth during my time there.  Only critical point would be that the structure is such that it is hard to leap forward quickly because of administrative policies.  However, the hiring of many former military officers as leaders in organizations, I found to be beneficial as they were focused on the mission as well as development of their people."
good,15 years with SAIC. I gained much real life experience in IT with SAIC at many levels. I was promoted from within from HD technician to site manager with the same client.
good,Good place to work for veterans and former law enforcement. They paid employees that were dependent on a government paycheck during the government shutdown.
good,"Everyday presents new challenges. Opportunity to work with lots of different people: in government, vendors. Providing service to customers and fulfilling their missions."
good,SAIC is a great services company. Friendly people and culture. Mostly working on projects related to the federal government as SAIC is a defense contractor.
good,"I was with SAIC for a about a 11 months. The only reason I left was I was recruited by another company with a 20% increase in salary. I would gladly work for SAIC again. Excellent people, both peers and management."
good,"Great people, organized with policies and procedures. Normal pay increases, but fair. No longer employee owned, which was when it was great!! For the most part a good company."
good,High morale and more than likely to jump at the opportunity to remove rejoin the crew at job fair. Meet good people who feared not being able to make you a member of the team.
good,"I can't give a definitive answer because I only worked for the company about four months, I worked remotely and did not interface personally with management often."
good,"Great place to work and the only reason I am moving on is due to a contract change. Working on a Government contract definitely had it’s ups and downs, mostly ups. Being a retired Marine I meet a lot of new people mostly prior enlist. They worked hard and made the job fun. One thing that’s hard though is when losing a contract and the company has to shut the program down. Lots of people were laid off, but SAIC does give you 30 days with pay to look for another job or find another job within the company with the help of their relocation program, although it has been hard for me to find a new job within the company. I would love to stay but I guess it’s just time for me to move on."
good,SAIC is a classic government contractor supporting all aspects and areas of government and military contract work.  It was exciting working there as we were involved with DARPA.
good,"Working on a Government contract definitely had it’s ups and downs, mostly ups. Being a retired Marine I meet a lot of new people mostly prior enlist. They worked hard and made the job fun.

I would love to stay but I guess it’s just time for me to move on."
good,"Good company overall. Standard benefits, standard holidays, 401k with a 3% match, all typical benefits. Not sure what the merger with Engility might bring."
good,"My day started 6:30 am, customers come in, make small talk and work on their computer and lift their spirit up.  Provided equipment and classes for the job."
good,SAIC was a great place to work.  The employees were dedicated to getting the job done.  Always on the cutting edge of technology.  I enjoyed working at SAIC
good,"My day at SAIC consisted of installing and updating Linux Systems. We had a lot of installing Virtual Machines, Kerberos for single sign on, and calculating the amount of storage needed on each partition."
good,"The SAIC team was top notch, great people to work with. Working in a government environment rather than a commercial was quite a change, very hard to get used to the government environment. But overall a very good experience , particularly with the SAIC team."
good,Worked with good people and learned more than my own job. The leadership allows you to excel and implement ideas to finish the task at hand. Working here is like working with family.
good,SAIC was a wonderful experience for me. In the two years that I worked for SAIC I had learned a lot about a manufacturing environment. They also had be trained as an electronics technician which I had never done before. Great starting job!
good,SAIC contracted very important with the government that has been instrumental in America's safety.  I was proud to be a part of that.  I also learned from mentor's the ins and outs of government contracting.
good,I really enjoy working for SAIC the only problem is that with the contract world you never know about your job. The hours are good and the people are great.
good,I enjoyed my time with SAIC; the work location was safe and secure; the only down side was it's contract work.  The pay was very fair and I enjoyed my employment.
good,"I enjoyed working at SAIC.  Co-workers eager to help.  Benefits are not the best. Workload was comparable to that of other companies."
good,Plenty of training opportunities for those willing to put in the time. Was a nice place to work but toward the end with the leidos and SAIC split it up it became a real pain.
good,Mission and leadership are very involved in making the company better while taking care of employees.  The jobs are varied and the company appears to move people around to support various missions to keep people within the company even as individual support contracts come and go.
good,"At SAIC I was empowered, given responsibility and held to standards. I was afforded chances to advance both technically and managerially. Managers above would listen to boots on the ground and adapt where/when appropriate."
good,"Overall SAIC is a very strong company with many knowledgeable and skilled people.  Working for a government agency contract I was surrounded by other people who were very intelligent and we worked as a team, often across contract boundaries to complete our mission or tasks.

The office I worked in was always evolving to meet the companies business needs.  It was a great fast paced office and always challenging.  I really loved working there.

This is a fast paced position and involves continuous multi-tasking skills with the responsibility of effecting large numbers of United States based aviation operators. My responsibilities include: research, coordination, interdependence and critical thinking. I am often in the center of disputes between industry and federal regulators. I thrived on resolving many of the conflicts by finding solutions agreeable to both the economic interest of industry while maintaining high safety margins as per the mission of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). My work resulted in numerous publications that directly impact how aircraft operate in the realm of navigation, communication, and surveillance in the United States and in oceanic and remote airspace. I created many new online products and caused a positive paradigm shift in the way applications for Operations Specifications are processed to be more efficient."

good,"great management, but very controlled work environment.  Little freedom to set or adjust your schedule. "
good,"A typical date at the customer site, was not overly stressful, but quite busy. "

People are well educated and good at their jobs and typically tend to stay at the company longer than other companies in this space.
good,SAIC has gone through many changes since I was employed.  At the time I was there the culture was supportive and good working environment.  Opportunity for career advancement was available.

good,I am not sure what is sensitive to the program I support.  I don't have much to do with the company but more do to with the military and government....
good,"Excellent company! SAIC offered me my first position after leaving the military.   Like many men and women severing their country, we turn to these federal contracting company for opportunities after leaving active duty.  SAIC hired me before I left active duty.  Can’t say enough about SAIC International, Inc.   Rated it 4-stars because the culture of the company has change with recent mergers."
good,"SAIC became known as Leidos as parts of the company were split off into a different entity. During the time I was under SAIC, the position was constantly busy with work never seeing an end. I would be at work by dawn and spend the next 8-10 hours analyzing data and verifying reports. The team I collaborated with did the best that they could to get the job done while having fun doing it. Looking back today, it feels that Leidos (formerly known as SAIC) was better with the SAIC name than it is with the Leidos name. The hardest part at the time was keeping up with the onslaught of work to be done but the most enjoyable part was when the team felt accomplished enough to go out to eat for lunch once or twice a month. It made the coworkers seem more like friends than just someone from the office or an acquaintance."
good,"I only worked there a short period due to office transition.  However, I enjoyed working there in previous position.  SAIC has generous benefits and I would recommend"
good,"You get what you put in to it. * hour days mostly, with occasional overtime required. Lots of different contracts so you have many chances to learn new things."

good,Great benefits and wonderful leadership. Enjoyed visits from managers taking us to lunch and spending the time to get to know us. Very forward looking company. Hands off management style.

good,"Though SAIC no longer has the contract with the government, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the company.  I would work for this company should the opportunity arise in the future."
good,"Enjoyed working for the NASA JSC customer."
good,"Take the good with the bad.  SAIC was good about letting their contractors have a bit of autonomy working onsite.  Trust was earned quickly and compensated appropriately.  The bad part about that is not being a ""squeaky wheel"" - sometimes appropriate attention to matters was not readily available.  On the whole, though, the good outweighed the bad.  As far as co-workers go, I've never worked with a better, more intelligent group of people!"
good,"Great place to work! However, the work location can be difficult at times. Getting on and off island is very limited. Also, the internet is very slow and expensive."
good,Good organization to work for. I have learned how to work in a big project environment
good,"The division I was in prior to the split was well run, friendly, and efficient. After the split I'm no longer with the company, so I can't say how it is now."

good,Very good company to work and learn new things.Get more opportunity   to grow
good,"Autonomy to get the job done."

good,It was very educational and I learned a lot about the corporate environment and how the computers connect to the Network and e-mail.
good,"Good place to work, it depends on what Job and program you are working on."
good,SAIC is a great place to work if you already have years of experience. I started working there as a rising senior in college and they gave me work for a already experienced programmer. I basically had to learn on my own and figure things out. The pay is good and your off on weekends so that's the good thing.
good,I've worked there more than ten years.It is great place to work there.
good,Company provides many opportunities for promotion. Many education opportunities and many personnel with expertise willing to share their knowledge.
good,Didn't have much interaction with people for the most part.  I worked in a NOC/shift work.
good,"Was welcomed with open arms back into a career I am very skilled at. My supervisor made sure that I was always adequately challenged and that I had the best assistance when needed. I have been able to greatly develop my VMWare skills while here I am sad to be leaving this company, but the contracting world is getting thin and I am more interested in settling down then I am about working in exotic locations."

My personal expertise with DCGS-A allows me to interface with PM-DCGS OIC, Army G2 representative and to be the conduit of user challenges to the Field Support Engineers in order to ensure challenges are addressed and resolved appropriately."
good,"Since joining the Armed Forces I've grown to become the type of person that believes in hard work, and doing things right.  Since a large part of our lives are at work I make it a point to work well with others so that they enjoy work.  A typical day at work is best described as organized chaos.  Since I work for the DOD and all these budget changes and restructuring are happening, you experience new challenges everyday.  Serving under the Special Operations Command I've had the pleasure of meeting some of the best individuals America has to offer.  I've learned leadership from them, and the importance of teamwork.  In fact, all of my military experience has developed these attributes and I'm looking for an opportunity to contribute what I have learned."

good,"SAIC is a great company to work for, very professional and cares about the customer as well as the employee."
good,I've had the great pleasure of working for SAIC all through my college years and beyond.  I have grown to appreciate the value of good service with my colleagues and customers.
good,"SAIC communicates wells with its employees.  They do not hide when contracts are about to end. Instead they tell the employees well in advance so they have time to look for other positions within the company.  They help employees find coverage on different tasks within the company, and if necessary outside the company.  There is not guarantee you will find another position but there are staff dedicated to help you with the transition."
good,"I would get to work everyday and check all of my emails and phone messages.  Print a report of the vendors that SAIC has orders out to, go through it and highlight the calls I needed to make.  Spent the rest of the day answering calls and making calls while updating the system notes about specific vendors.  If I had any free time I would file for about 30-60 mins. a day."
good,"The company is very informative with the employees of upcoming events and changes on the company website and email. The workplace very teamwork oriented and supported of other. The currculum of the company is health in sharing in family events and employee recogination.The program in place made you part of the company 401,stocks and advancement within the company opportunties for growth."

good,"I worked with people who are friendly, willing to help, and knowledgable in their field. I monitored/worked incoming tickets related to equipment performance and access. I monitored a small batch on the mainframe; made any call-outs needed in event of failed jobs."
good,"This company is great in terms of benefits. They really do take care of their employees. It isn't the most enjoyable work environment however, I don't get out of bed dreading the thought of going to the office, which is more than you could say for most jobs. In my area of the business, there is quite a bit of preference given to military experience, but that is to be expected due to the nature of the work (military contracting)."
good,Plenty of job training and experenced gained. I learned alot about kitting and logistics while working here.
good,"I loved working for this company. The benefits are great, the people are friendly and professional. If you ever had a problem all you had to do was call someone and it would be fixed in an expedient manner."

good,SAIC forms capable teams to tackle technical challanges of its clients while supporting its employees.
good,"My first employment after retiring from Navy. I've learned a lot about contracts and government agencies. They have not provided any professional training. Management does seem to care about their personnel, though with the company moving from employee owned to a publicly traded company personnel priorities has declined.somewhat."
good,Working for SAIC has allowed me to expand and grow my skills. SAIC is a company that cares for it's employees.
good,Kept busy processing invoices-mailing/Fed Ex's- prepared and sent out daily. Filing as required. Worked with approx. 15-20 great people in our A/R department. Most enjoyable part of job was interactions with my co-workers. Hardest part of job was the final days before our department work was transferred to another location and we were all given our notices of severance.
good,Learned a lot in this position and my experience with this company was positive.
good,Straight forward you always know where you stand and what you need to do.
good,"Company is VERY ethical. If a person did not know an answer, they would simply ask for help from others and weren't afraid to do so. (From a large corporation, this meant something to me.) The most difficult part about the job is the lack of training and resources to gain knowledge, but once you find the ""key to your success"" it was made a lot simpler."
good,"A typical day at work was to research and extract dams, ski lifts, gondolas, and cable cars. We used ArcGIS 10.0 to extract the desired features and also an in-house program to research."
good,A typical Day is 8 AM to 5 PM. Everyday is a learning day resolving customer Issues. The management is very hands-on and professional. My co-workers are team players and supportive.

good,"I started with SAIC after retiring from the militay and for my first job experience into the civilian sector, it was excellent!"
good,"Not a bad place to work. It is a large company and you can become ""just another number"" to them. But I do believe they care about their employees."
good,good company to work for. Did not work for the company long. New company got goverment contract.
good,"I was originally assigned as a Trainer for my home base of Eglin AFB in Niceville, FL. I ended up being at Biloxi's military base, which did not matter to me as I was just excited to have my first job out of college. I loved SAIC's San Diego (at the time) office, the people and location were great and once assigned to my base (Biloxi) the people were great to work with that were assigned with me. I loved working with the military hospital personnel. I had the opportunity to train from the new recruits in the hospital to the top brass."
good,"Work days were very busy, learned a great deal from management and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was what I learned while with SAIC."

good,"Overall I enjoyed working there. Great walking space outside and employee are provided two breaks a day, not including lunch. Very kind and friendly people."
good,"I have worked here for more than 10 years. SAIC has provided me with multiple opportunities to grow and expand my abilities.  As a defense contractor, job security can be tenuous at times."
good,"They say they want employees to get training and go to conferences but they do not make time available to them to attend.  Like other companies it is all about chargeable hours.  If you can get full chargeable hours to the contract and you can fit in training on your own time, they are all for it.  They will not pay for your training time unless you can get the customer to pay it."
good,"SAIC is a great company who cares about retaining its employees through training, opportunities for advancement, and fulfilling missions.  Apply today for a new career!"
good,SAIC Inc. has an environment of working together and solution motivated. Management allows staff to be creative which makes a productive workplace environment.

good,Culture that empowers all levels to make decisions and feel valued.  Great peers to work with and a collaborative environment.  Decision making at all levels allows for expedited forward progress.
good,"We had a reputation in our office as some of the best in the industry because typically people in our position handle at most 250 files but we routinely handled over 1000 each but we still kept it relaxed and fun."
good,I consider myself lucky to have worked with a great crew.  Although there were a number of challenges and some disputes that overall day to day work was enjoyable
good,"...it is a corporate environment; the related pitfalls go with it. It appeared to be a fair and easy company to work for, unfortunately at my BU, an individual in charge gooned up a prospective contract resulting in loss of jobs in my region."
good,"1. continous projects and talented work force"
good,"Always an interesting, productive, and customer focused ork environment. "
good,SAIC believes in mobility and provides great benefits to their employees.  They have a fun family orientated environment; anyone would enjoy it there.

good,Love the culture of our local SAIC office.  The people are friendly from the lowest intern to our site manager.  Everyone is approachable.
good,this is  a contractor position on the Newport Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC). Co-workers are great and helpful. The work on projects is unique and keep you interested. Once the contract is to end the management goes out of there way to find you more work.
good,"Scitor is a great company, with leadership being accessible and open about company goals and direction. Unfortunately, the once fantastic benefits that made Scitor the company of choice are dwindling. Still, if you're looking for a company that actually cares about their employees, Scitor is excellent."
good,"SAIC was a great company to work for!! I was able to be promoted twice in a very little time span."
good,"I loved that I could go in to my work and do my job without feeling as if there was someone constantly looking over my shoulder. One can get much more work accomplished when there is not as much micro-managing involved. It was known to us that if we ever needed management help, it was available to us. That is what was so know about SAIC. They trusted us to get our work done and if we did have a problem to go to them and discuss it. I learned that not all employees have the same ethics. I am a hard-driven, goal-oriented person; for that reason, I had to recognize that not all people have the same drive as I do. The hardest part of the job was learning to deal with others' lack of enthusiasm or motivation to get their job done in order so that I can get my job completed. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the field of technical writing and working with others such as the software engineers to assist them in making their job easier, too, which in turn made my job easier when writing the help manuals and other manuals for the aircraft and proponents I was responsible for."
good,Management makes work enjoyable.  The work is challenging and rewarding.  The environment is a great place to improve as an employee.
good,Maybe one of the better places I have worked for in the DOD contracting communities

good,"SAIC was an incredible company, particularly when they were an employee owned company. Job security became more of an issue after they became a publicly traded company in 2003-2004; however, still a great company."
good,Working on project timeline with others from other disciplines.  Doing my work with continual follow up. Urgency to get it right rather than just get it 'done'.  Hardest part of job is to 'shut it off' at 5pm and go home with clear mind and not think about it.
good,"SAIC is a good company to work for if you have a Degree background and have a solid career goal in mind.  However, if you are in the contracts division that career mind cannot be assured as to there is a lot of dependence on awaiting financing from customer sources."
good,"Provide network support to locations internationally.  This would include firewall, switch, and proxy support."
good,"Work day was primarily spent onboard a US Navy ship in the engineering spaces. Management was based in VA Beach, VA so we didn't see them much. I served on active duty with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting all of the equipment, tools, and procedures to the ship without any transportation. The job was enjoyable because of the sense of pride working with the US Navy."
good,Outstanding company with highly competitive benefits package. Would love to return to SAIC.
good,Great place to start your career. Very helpful and growth is encouraged.
good,SAIC is a great company. I have worked there for over thirteen years. They are a large government contractor based in McLean area. Would recommend it to anyone.
good,There are many areas to branch out of this company. My employer was very open to me learning other skills while working with the design team. Co-workers that I have worked with are very knowledgeable and friendly. The hardest about my job is the distance from home to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is just the people and the environment.
good,Supported 3D Modeling efforts for virtual targets.
good,I would go back and work for this company if the right opportunity presents itself.
good,Great company but there was never a clear mission statement. Often left to sit around doing nothing.
good,"good company to work for but depending on the project you work under, you could find yourself looking for work and selling yourself within the company. Good group of people to work for overall."
good,"The job was challenging, interesting, and a great opportunity to learn and travel throughout the city. Management was as expected for a software roll out with the high stress levels and giddiness when it works. Of course, then there is the frantic scramble when putting out fires but the team worked together."
good,Although I love SAIC I have found that great benefits were out weighed by the lack of promotion potential. The pay is excellent so go in with your top salary and be prepared to stay at the level for a while.
good,very laid back climate also learning something new through trouble shooting. very on your own type of climate must be motivated to finish jobs and always look to improve systems
good,Mentoring and advising Afghan National Police is a unique and pleasurable experience. Learning the culture and seeing how policing is done here have shown me the difference and the similarities in our profession.
good,Was a good company to work for but need to work harder on finding another position for employees at the end of a contract. I loved the fact my section was allowed to work 8 hour any time between 6 to 6. The hardest part of the job was getting a engineer to understand way what they say is going to work won't. and most of the time you would loss because they were the engineer and you wasn't.
good,Management is great. Doesn't pay as well as other similar job positions in other companies but the people and job culture make this a little more tolerable. Overall easy and laid back job as long as you are thorough and pay attention to detail. Everyone there is willing to help and train without a problem.
good,I do not know how it feels to work at the corporate office but being able to work with DoD everyday if an experience. I love coming into work everyday because I know everyday is going to be different.
good,Great place to work.  Management really cares about employees and is very informative.  Outstanding training program.  Fun people to work with.  Need more opportunities to promote within company.
good,"This is a government software/hardware contracting company. As a software engineer, you will be working as a contractor under another company and this can be a generally good experience. SAIC (or the company you work with) is pretty good at providing the resources you need in a timely manner. I have never had the need to work more than 40 hours in a week. There is a clear promotion schedule (at least on the technical side) and the pay is around market rate for the other local companies. You will trade a small amount of pay for job security (I have never seen anyone get fired or heard of any lay offs)."
good,The team-effort philosophy helps in all of the company's decision-making processes. The work environment aided in my decision to stay despite my shortcomings.
good,"Great manager but the company bid on a contract they were not ready to fill. Like most government contract companies, they are looking for bodies to fill a requirement that the government needs. If you don't mind changing companies every year or when the current company you work for doesn't get a renewal contract and you don't mind looking for another job then this is the life for you."
good,Cross trainins employees with another career field. Encourages a professional atmosphere. Discourages and discrimination against other employees. Allows for ideas to be shared.
good,"I very much enjoyed working at SAIC. The work environment is collaborative and productive, offering great freedom and flexibility. The management structure is very flat and micro-management is virtually non-existent."
good,"Good company to work for. Only complaint is the quality of the health insurance plan."
good,"Very successful company that I have found to look out for my best interest and would like to see my climb the ladder within the company.  They are always looking for bright, motivated and encourage advancement."
good,A good place to work that allows flexible start times and gives you a good work/life balance. Manager works with you for better opportunities. Yearly reviews are always a good time to talk to your manager about things that you notice that he might not.
good,My job entailed updating the telecommunications database with all changes in personnel at SAIC. I then re-allocated the long distance and local phone charges to the appropriate departments.  I also produced adhoc reports for department managers as requested.
good,Management and the people were great to work for. The employees were treated fairly and with respect. They worked on very cool projects. Great HR department. You could actually communicate with them
good,Well managed company that develops personnel and rewards performance.  Opportunities to move to other contracts or geographies.
good,The managers are dedicated to looking after the employees and supporting needs for change or adjustment based on the growing development of SAIC and its clients.
good,It was a contract job but the Management treated all staff very well with great benefits. It was a great environment to work and there was a great team work in accomplishing the tasks.Unfortunately the contract ended and we were laid off.
good,"A work day was always filled with something new. From preparing for a class to being out on the range. I learned a lot about self motivation and resiliency. Along with hosting classes I had my own personal duties consisting of ordering supplies, organizing my co workers schedules, accompanying the managers for meeting. My managers where very kind and had a vast knowledge base if I ever had any questions. There was nothing really to hard about working there. We worked as a team and someone was always able and willing to help the next person. I really enjoyed the fact that everyday was different and that we worked so closely with or customers."
good,"Co-workers are very knowledgeable and willing to help when it's needed. The things that I have learned here in only a year are unbelievable, like the many different projects that I have been able to work on and all of the new people that I have been able to meet."
good,Great place to work with a lot of opportunities worldwide.  Although the company has a long history it is technically a new company due to the recent split.  The company still has a new feel to it and is trying to find its personality.  Great for both new graduates and seasoned veterans.
good,My currently work location is on Redstone Arsenal. I am a part of the ITSS2 contract so I do not physically work at SAIC. I joined SAIC as part of a contract change. SAIC is a great company.
good,"A degree of independence/freedom in development."
good,"- typical day was working from 7:30am to 4:30pm.  Checked email first thing.  Went over all transportation requests for that day and double checked they were all on time and the unit had a representative as well.  Made sure all supporting equipment was on stand by and ready to go.  Update all transportation requests as they came through.  Provided professional guidance to the units who had questions and the best way to go about their transportation requests.  Update the Logistics manager daily with all requests."
good,"Like any government contracting company, if the funding on the project goes away you are out of a job.  I do feel SAIC does everything in their power to find you another position/project, but that doesn't always work out.. Other than that I highly recommend pursuing employment with SAIC"
good,My first long-term testing job. this test let me learn a lot of durability test tech
good,"After working for SAIC for 4+ years, I have nothing bad to say about this place.  I currently work from home, and still experience healthy raises and career growth"
good,I love the culture of SAIC. They are an open and honest company in a fast and changing business world. I wouldn't be leaving if i hadn't gotten layed off.
good,Learned to work hard and play hard. Learned that you need to stand up for yourself and for others. Hardest part of the job was trying to read the clients' minds. Most enjoyable part of job wqas creating quality products that wowed the client and stake holders.
good,"Working with SAIC, I was able to dedicate more time to schooling and furthering my education. My managers took interest in me and I was promoted within a year to a management position. The hours are flexible, and the workload is managable."
good,"A day at work was watching trucks load up with debris, and writing tickets. Meeting the drivers was nice, because they were from different parts of the country. It made it a nice working experience. To bad it came to an end. My supervisors were great to work for. Really nice people. The other people I worked with were really nice also. The hardest part of the job was when the weather didn't cooperate, but other than that it was an easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a lot of happy people that were happy to get that debris of there property. They were very happy we were there."
good,The people were very friendly yet professional; I enjoyed my short time with them.
good,"I worked with great people who fostered a good environment, provided great feedback on my work, and let me know to start looking for a new job with ample notice.  Not so good about finding people new work though... but my project, and team, were the tops."
good,I loved the job gov contract not extended end of work. Caller were awesome.as a vet i enjoyed speaking with and retire military personnel.i told all i can why ask this question if nit satisfied with lenght of answer
good,"As the old saying goes “they are good people”. I am going to say that the culture is great and there are many benefits to working for SAIC. There is pleanty of opportunities and if you’re motivated, you’ll make it."
good,"Worked with some great people and learned a lot of information in the process, Supervisors were humble and very helpful. I really enjoyed my time working for this company and would do it again if they would hire again."
good,Working in the warehouse in an office environment where you provide transportation guidance and documents for movement of tires and goods to military units globally.
good,"Was a contractor with SAIC. At the location, there were fun and smart people to work with. While there were ups and downs, co-workers and team leads helped each other when faced with difficult tasks."
good,My fellow associates were all very responsible and professional enough to make sure we accomplished all of our testing requirements. Everybody pitched in to assist wherever help was needed.
good,"Checking to make sure employees have proper PPE. Inspect vehicles for progression of work and any up coming inspections they may need. Inspect De-mod and Integration vehicles to ensure that they meet the standards for our work to be complete and specifications of the customer. We have full backing of our management staff but sometimes it seems the top likes to micromanage. My co-workers are part of the best part of my day. They all seem to get along and are professional in their work.  The hardest part of the job is knowing what our vehicles are for. But the best part of the job is knowing that our product has saved over 30,000 lives in over 12 years."
good,"Nine to five career working with the government, military structured, flexible management, good work life balance, great human resources."
good,"I generally open the office I arrive about 6:15 AM each morning and get the open order report ready for various co-workers, print out any orders that are coming from our activities storage facility. Complete intra-base transfers. Analyze stock hand, EDD of that stock, weather or not to do a ""special"" buy in order to maintain production levels before DLA gets well. Check in all special purchase to verify that certifications of material is in order. Maintain discrepancy records. ect.. The most enjoyable thing about my job is knowing that my job matters. I know when I inspect material that the material is good and true and won't be placed on any aircraft unless it is 100% certified to be of good quality."
good,"Enjoyed working for SAIC in Kentucky.  Small community and I was grateful for the opportunity.  A high tech company came in!"
good,"The position was extremely unique by virtue of the diversity of day-to-day experiences associated with the management of support contractors providing highly technical Cyber Warfare support to the US Air Force and specialized elements within the Department of Defense.  Position dictated proposal writing, creation of technical solutions, management of 35-person Cyber Branch, customer interface, collaboration across corporation, financial execution including profit/loss, business development, and human resources management/recruiting.  The best aspects of the job involved management of a highly technical, nascent mission area with some of the most technically astute Cyber Warfare engineers and operational support personnel in the US.  The most difficult aspect of the job was the 70 to 80 hour work weeks whenever proposals had to be written.   However, I am grateful for this opportunity to fully comprehend and execute all aspects of a commercial venture in a highly competitive environment."
good,I want to work somewhere that everyone gets alone and can have a laugh from time to time. Being able to be on a team were everyone has the same common goal and that's to get the job done. A place that you enjoy getting up and going to work because you enjoy the people you work with.  I think also a place that is willing to take care of their employee's and have trust.  I think strong Ethic's is very important in achieving that.
good,SAIC will reward those who bust their butts and be innovative.
good,Very good company to work. Good Benefits and a safe and professional working environment.
good,"Hired for one job did another, not their fault, gov't changes. Things where great until my manager left. The guys who replaced him shouldn't have been there and it was difficult after that."
good,Enjoy working there very much. Good people and straight forward and honest management.
good,Responsibilities defined in TO 6273 performing remedial
good,Great deal product review and app in same place.  SAIC is a great place to work.  I've been  a PM for to IDIQ  contracts and served at a Hiring Manager and Team Lead.
good,Great program engineers. Ability to progress through the ranks if determined to be someone better.Good benefits. Great working facilities. Tools provided for technicians.
good,"Great company to work for, from the management to the testers and the developers. All or most of the projects is government projects and it require clearance in most cases."
good,"Challenging tasks that bring out the best of a professinal. Learned a tremendous amount of insight from the standpoint of a large company, yet a small task. ."
good,"I was always respected while with SAIC, and was fortunate to become fully embedded with the cyber community, eventually becoming an instructor/mentor on the NTOC watch floor. I was persuaded to leave for a job where I could share my cyber experience broadly with the SIGINT community and help form partnerships across these diverse cultures. My move was for personal job satisfaction with this tremendous opportunity, versus any dissatisfaction with SAIC. I remain friends with this company and remain proudly part of the SAIC alumni."
good,I worked from home as a translator. My experience with SAIC was limited
good,"I loved the energy that was kept in our department, and everyone helped each other out. We were a team. I served at the senior management level and the people I worked around made my job easier. I served as the primary individual to help  out the government lead as well as his deputy. After I was finished doing my daily tasks I went around and offered my assistance to anyone else that needed it in my department."
good,"good company just hire when they need , fire when they do not need ."
good,"I just did contract work here. It's not Google, put you can get a good long-term career here. This would be an ideal job for someone right out of College to start a career and march up the ladder. The pay is great, the location in Huntsville AL is vary nice with world class shopping and restaurants within walking distance. I used to ride my MTB into the office and they have showers and a Gym right on the SAIC Campus."
good,"The branch of SAIC I worked for has been reorganized into Leidos.  I was in a contracted staff position in a Navy office.  My typical day was whatever the customer needed for that day.  I never worked in a corporate office in eight years, so I have no idea what the company is like in that setting."
good,"good environment. nice work. but temporary."
good,"SAIC is an excellent company to work for. Benefits are incredible and affordable. However, there are very little opportunities for advancement."
good,I have not worked at SAIC in 4 years. At the time it was a great company to work for but was being split into two different companies. Not sure how it is to work for SAIC now.
good,Billing department was a fast paced environment with quite a bit of overtime. I learned to multitask and prioritize based on deadlines and invoice income. I enjoyed the team environment and the managers feedback when requested.
good,"Overall, a good experience, but employees were not counseled on career path choices. Salary was below the norm for me. Benefits were different for different companies. Company 6 was formed paying lower salaries and fewer benefits than the established Company 1. Many Company 1 employees were transferred to Company 6, causing morale problems among Company 6 employees. I was transferred to another Division and was later returned to my former location to work on a major contract on which I was the SAIC member of a multi-company proposal team, while still belonging to the new Division while working for my former Division in Florida. My supervisor was in California. There was mistrust among the Divisions that affected my relationships with my former superiors and co-workers. My boss was too far from me to fairly evaluate my performance. I felt that I was in a box which would affect my career growth. I resigned to go to work for another company. Shortly after being employed by SAIC, I made Employee of the Month and was awarded several $1000 to $2000 bonuses during the first year. I single handedly wrote and won a Sole Source Contract. I was assigned a former SAIC Vice President to work for me on the project. He was an intelligent out-spoken person who sabotaged my study. I have reasons to believe that it was planned by SAIC upper management in conjunction with Mitre, a company that feared exposure that the study could have portrayed by the unbiased results sought by the Government."
good,SAIC is a productive workplace and environment that provides the opportunity to expand career opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with.
good,SAIC is a great place to work! The great part about working for SAIC is that you can choose your time to come into work anywhere from 0600 to 0900 and work an 8 hour day.
good,"SAIC has everything you look for in a job. From challenging tasks, to a great work environment SAIC has it all. Company as a whole is great to work for and very interactive with it employees."
good,"Worked with task holders to create and maintain project schedules using Microsoft Project, Milestones Pro, Word, Excel, and Power Point. Group fun parties helped break up the work."
good,"Mercantil Bank had a tool using the SAIC System, was Very good tool and had everything in the system to solve problems and to sell products in the best way."
good,SAIC treated me very well over the years.  They provide excellent chances to excel and move up in pay if the contract allows. The atmosphere is great. The Project Managers and Supervisors are great and act in a professional manner.
good,SAIC is a premier institution whose opportunities for employees is one of the best in industry.  The seasoned leadership and well resourced departments ensure a smooth career for competitive employees.
good,SAIC is a large company with resources that gives its employees the time and attention expected from a smaller company. I enjoy working for them very much.
good,"I worked for SAIC from 1996-2011, and worked with the best people who helped me in my career.  Opportunities were available to help me in a spiral development of career expansion."
good,"Our office had two employees running the day-to-day operations, so the shop was indeed cozy. The tempo fluctuated, as can be expected, but there was plenty of work to accomplish. My favorite part was interactions with our customers from various shops."
good,I enjoyed my time here with SAIC even though all the employees ended up being laid off after the contract was up. I loved the people I worked with and loved my schedule.

good,Was a great company to work for. I had an awesome boss who gave me guidance and let me pick up the ball and run with it. Pay was great and the benefits too. The culture was laid back and everyone did their job. I enjoyed coming to work every day because I had the best boss anyone could ask for. Best part of the job was I traveled every other week to meetings. Worst part was working sometimes really late but the salary made up for it.
good,"I worked in an outstanding work center with people that were at the top of their game.  Pay was good, not great, and there was a great work/life balsnce."
good,"SAIC is a huge company, but on the contract I was supporting, I had a very small, pretty tight-knit group. The team was supportive, and our Program Manager was extremely responsive to our needs. There are always non-negotiable issues on a contract, but we had it pretty good."
good,very good place to work company has your back if you lose a contract.  laid back but gets the job done.  I recommend people to work here.  I like it here.
good,"While working with SAIC I learned how to deal with different type of people from patient,impatient, ignorant,intelligent,humble boastful/prideful, thick accents to improper speaking individuals all in all I walked away better at communicating with people in general."
good,"Good company with good benefits. I would recommend SAIC to anyone and especially veterans who are looking for a contracting job. "
good,I work as a Systems Engineer at the County of Orange and SAIC is a subcontractor providing managed services to the county. I think SAIC is a great company to work for and the services they provide are the best in the business.

good,My internship experience at SAIC was excellent. I could not have asked for more. This was a great opportunity to jump start my career in the government contracting industry.
good,This company and position may be the best position I've ever held. The company is great and honest; at least in my experience. I would go back if they had a position in my area.
good,"I enjoy my job and have learned a lot about industrial security. The workplace culture is good and I work with a great team. Management is good, but I am looking for advancement."
good,"Amazing place. "
good,The job supports the mission of the Center for Domestic Preparedness; to train the emergency response community for any type of all hazards event.
good,"For me SAIC was always an enjoyable place to work. The employees were skilled, professional, loyal and helpful. I gained much knowledge in my years there. The company was always prompt to process travel claims and paid very well depending on your abilities. I liked the range of employee experience, junior partners eager to learn and experienced employees willing to tutor the junior ones."
good,"I fell into a full-time position with SAIC, one of the nation's foremost government contractors, through my illustration skills. I was able to work from home, had excellent bosses, and would have loved to have stayed on staff until I retired. Unfortunately, government contracts being finite things, my position was eliminated when the work ended, and no forthcoming similar work appeared. I still maintain a vestigial association with SAIC, and if freelance work becomes available, I could be called to action on a part-time basis."
good,"Good people who care about their employees at the local level.  Not so much at the corporate level.  Very little job security.  The company training is extensive as far as annual security training, ethics training, Information Assurance training, etc."

Management is very friendly and they are easy to get along with. They have always let me known what was expected of me and gave me supervisory roles within the organization so I can grow as an employee as well. The hardest part of my job is being away for months on end. What we do is very important overseas and there are people who count on me to keep our boys on the ground safe. It's a very satisfying job."

good,"A typical day at work entails arriving on time, greeting my fabulous coworkers (there are seven of us within a room, so we tend to operate like a family) and then preparing myself for the day. Management has great confidence in us and our abilities to perform our day to day activities. I would describe the style of management as democratic. My coworkers are highly competent and well versed in the area in which we work. They have been working together for decades. It is a highly secure position. I have been on board for almost two years and they have made me feel as though I've worked with them my entire working tenure. It is a very natural and caring environment where when one person needs assistance with anything, they need only to ask aloud and one or several of the seven will be at there side (of course, this is contingent upon the workload/activities being performed at the time). The most challenging part of my job is one of the most enjoyable parts of the job for me and that is when we get a sudden surge of work that must be completed all at once. I am performing multiple tasks simultaneously and deadlines are tight. The pressure drives me to a level of intense focus and once all tasks have been accomplished successfully, I am satisfied."
good,"Great supervisors and peers, work hard-play hard mentality"
good,"Good management. Surrounded by smart, capable, and helpful people. Everyone works for the product."

good,"Good company, enjoyed my time working there. Flexible work hours and decent pay. Didn't seem to be a structured way of defining a career path, however I would consider working with them again."
good,"Overall, SAIC is a great company.  They seemed to have cared about their employees.  However, the only downfall was when the contract was ending, they stated they would assist you with finding another position within the company and you end up doing more with finding a position than they do.  In other words, they don't really assist. Otherwise, they were pretty good."

The day at work was never typical, we would always be changing how things needed to be done based on our military customer needs and wants.  It kept things interesting and challenging.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the teamwork while working with other co-workers and military personnel.  It was a real team effort, everyone would help everyone else and bend over backwards to do so.  Was a family, not just co-workers."

good,The work itself is exciting and can be challenging; however the current management makes it difficult to work under an end of life contract

good,I get to have a different experience everyday while at SAIC. I have been exposed to new software programs used in remote computer support.
good,"There are two segregated work areas, Classified side for those with a security clearance, and Unclassified side for those without. These two sides work together on projects and mingle daily. The problem with this dynamic is that I believe it creates a bubble of unchecked/unchallenged gossip and sometimes unfair characterization of new employees because they know they can speak freely about the people who aren't cleared to access their side, and share opinions that will go unchallenged, and narratives form that cannot be corrected by the subject. I have been the target of this. I came on in a time where there was a ton of work they were behind on, and I took on every single project they allowed me to. I stressed for months but was super happy and felt like I was helping the team tremendously. I was pulled aside one day by two of my managers for taking too long of a lunch more than once (absolutely fair of them to do so on this point, I was working too much) but then was shocked to learn that both of them agreed that I was an 'egotistical monster' and that I needed to understand that this wasn't going to be a 'one-man studio'... I had no idea that anybody felt this way - I am a person of few words, and all I did was tell them 'yes' every time they asked if something could be done. I slowly started noticing how everybody looked at me from the Classified side, like I was a jerk or something, but everybody from the unclassified side that I work with was fine with me. I was the only unclassified new-hire that didn't get a pass to help the team set-up for the big event they were crunching"
good,"SAIC is a good company to work for. If funding for a current program is lost, they will try their best to find you a position within the company. Insurance options are not the best."
good,"SAIC was a good place to work, they just couldn't get it together as far as management goes. They knew what needed to be don't but would not do it or they wouldn't listen to those who knew what they were doing. this cause more problems than they will ever know or care to know."
good,"The people and the supervisor was very nice people to work with in this environment.  There was not any room for growth; you had the opportunity to learn different job, but no room for growth."

good,Great place to work and enjoyed the time I was there. There is good team of recruiters and my Sr. Director was an outstanding manager and communicator
good,"working for this company allows for us to travel to support America's war Fighter's. Most of us that work their are former military. Leadership denies the potential of subordinates to be promoted or give progression information so that subordinates may have future success at the company. The working atmosphere is that of a specialty teams, therefore one can be in the same position for decades or for as long as contracts are in effect."
good,Great people to work with.  I was contracted to a DOD contractor and worked mostly with Vets.  The training I received springboarded me to a better paying position.
good,Great company to work for when I was starting my career.  I had the opportunity to learn and develop my skill sets throughout numerous years.  Management took time to create time for feedback with all personnel.

good,"SAIC provides multiple career paths and locations. It is a career destination."
good,They pay better than most corporate structures around the area. And it's much more relaxed but everyone is willing to help out. It can get super busy. And there's positions constantly opening. Good company actually.
good,I honestly learned more about detail orientation with this organization than any other! We created checks and double checks to ensure that the budgets and forecasts were spot on
good,"They care about their employees, great benefits, flexible working environment, good work/life balance, ethical in business practices, good compensation."
good,A knowledgeable company to work for. The fact that everyone was afraid of getting laid off made it hard to trust anyone. The Data entry group. Worked together well together. Then some of us where asked to spy on others. That became difficult. We where close co workers.
good,SAIC had a great work/life balance.  My manager treated everyone fairly. The company was big on employee morale.  Great place to work!  I was sad to see this job end.
good,It's a priveledge to support the DOD and its efforts. Supply aircrafts with necessary parts to keep them in service and protecting our country.
good,There is growth potential within the SAIC organization in which they encourage.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside my colleagues and learning from each other.  We are definitly a team atomosphere.
good,"Liked the work, but no in depth training when Armed forces signed off on the Northrup Grumen AHLTA GUI Program."
good,In my two years with the company I cannot have any complains. Excellent benefits. Only downside is their jobs are contract based and by losing a contract I lost my job.
good,go to work in morning get my orders run cable troubleshoot problems and fix them

good,SAIC is a wonderful company with which to work. It is clear they only hire the most technically competent individuals and it is truly professionally reward to work with such colleagues.
good,"SAIC values it's employees that are high performers. They show this appreciation through large cash bonuses and company shares. Their health plans have a lot to be desired and the culture set by management is old school but they are aware of the conditions and are working to improve them to stay competitive and keep their talented employees. The hardest part is that they often don't utilize all of your skills because of ""swim lanes."" You are only supposed to do what's in your job description. So much so that the company ends up losing out on innovation."
good,My overrall experience with SAIC was great. I was transitioned into the company from a contract loss to another company and they made that process very smooth and easy. While working with SAIC I learned that management may not always be available to assist due to the nature of work I was in but my co-workers were very friendly and made me feel comfortable while working on the project. I was also impressed at how they were able to place me after I was laid off. The staff that were appointed to me in that time were outstanding with getting back to me with leads and also temp. positions. I would love to work for the company again in the near future.
good,"Definitely a great place to work. Clearly resembles ""the other"" major contracting companies in the area. The people make the company what it is today.."
good,Typical day is to review work tickets and complete tickets as accurately as possible and timely as possible. Also need to answer calls and complete tickets that needed customer action.
good,"SAIC is innovative, fair to employees and competitive in the government space. This is a contract company, so job security is lacking, but if you do good work, and you're willing to move after a contract, then they'll take care of you."
good,"During the govt shutdown in Jan 2019, SAIC was one of a few companies that really stepped up to help their employees sustain. In addition, they pay extremely well and as long as you get your work done, there is no micromanagement, unless your subject to your clients. Overall, great company that is trying to get rid of their 'old boys club' culture. People who work here have been employees for over 20+ years and you can see why they stayed...because the company trusts in their people."
good,Many opportunities to do many different tasks and improve your skills. Great chance for advancement. I’m currently still a part of this organization and I’m looking for opportunities that might be out there for future opportunities.
good,I enjoy the people who are always wanting to learn more ande give more.  I appreciate that management is looking out for my best interest and helping me to succeed.

good,"As a DoD primary contractor, SAIC developed, managed, operated key components of the U.S. military. Being part of this post 9/11 was very rewarded and I enjoyed the experience throughout my tenure with SAIC"

good,"Deadline-driven, exacting work."
good,"Working with SAIC was a privilege for me when I was employed."
good,A typical day was pulling files to process for imaging. Was always busy which made the day go fast. After worked with most imaging was then trained on indexing and some medical coding to include x-rays which I found was challenging yet a great and welcomed opportunity. The hardest part was medical coding. The most enjoyable part was the team and always staying busy.
good,I enjoyed the education they gave me in supply chain and the opportunities in kitting management. A typical day at work was assisting the aircraft mechanics in obtaining the parts they needed to repair the planes.  I helped format and fill new kits to ensure the mechanics had the parts they needed in a single convenient package to complete their jobs.
good,"The work environment where I was employed was amazing, the tone was great along with the personnel, the only downfall was the pay was not that great."
good,"It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off."
good,"Great work environment, co-workers were great. Mgm't is there for you. The only downside is this is contract work, so job security goes from contract to contract. Would work there again."
good,I was able to walk into a great paying job doing the same GIS tasks and further my professional career. I will never regret my decision to join SAIC.
good,Very relaxed work environment as long as day to day tasks are being completed.  Benefits and compensation are very competitive.  Co-works always willing to lend a hand in completing tasks as needed.

good,"The location of work can vary based on the customer you support."
good,SAIC is a fabulous company with a bright future.  They have recently split from their parent company in order to increase Govt. contract opportunities.  I greatly respect their management and work philosophy.
good,"Great place to work.  Great management, environment, facilities, people, conditions.  Allows you to grow and develop personally and professionally."
good,After joining FAA I ave learned a lot that I can say I have grown up as an individual as well as Professional. My team was really helpful and I am glad that I got a very good team to work with.

good,"SAIC was a great company to learn the ins and outs of transportation logistics from outside of the military angle."
good,"Set up administration security cameras"
good,"When I was offered a job with SAIC I jumped at the chance to work with them.  The company has a great reputation an is very solid.  In October of 2013 SAIC split into two companies.  The new company is LEIDOS.  That is who I am currently working for.  They have had their problems with the transition.  But, the people are good folks.  I expect them to do very well in the future."
good,"Great company, only downfall is the Job security and Advancement is not great because they primarily do government contract work that is not always steady"
good,"Hardest part was keeping up with the changes but done!"
good,SAIC is filled with high energy and smart professionals.  I found the work assignments challenging and interesting.
good,"Every day had a challenge and something new to learn about the product and the company. The management was very lay back, they try to accomadate each employee to their specific needs. "
good,"Nice company to work for, They take care of their people, provide help and support for employees"
good,"The work place was very good, working for and supporting the DoD AFMES at Walter Reed Campus, Rockville, Maryland."

My co-workers are very driven Quality Engineers ensuring that company standards are being followed."
good,"just your basic pc/network tech job. Spent most of the day troubleshooting end user problems, and installing/maintaining software."
good,This was my first position in the IT industry and I learned a lot! My experience at SAIC taught me a lot of things. The people there were simply amazing!
good,Never the same work plenty to learn and room to grow. Pay is competitive as are benefits. Like most large firms SAIC is very fragmented with is specialty divisions. Divisions do not like to work on projects outside of subject discipline.
good,"As an intern I was able to work on several projects, construction documents for military hangers and facilities, design conceptualizing for a laboratory in the form of a fully staged city, submittals for a state government building and landscaping and design concepts for a developer's site to maximize the use of land available."
good,"I have learned much over the past 6 years working for SAIC. Excellent management and co-workers, great environment to work in."
good,"Even though I was a temp employee with them, I felt like part of the family."
good,I learned to manage my time and be productive. I enjoy traveling and meet new people. Nice work place and culture. Long time away from family and friends.
good,I work in a very professional and structured working environment. Everyone in my company is helpful and wants me to succeed as a new employee. I am appreciative of them.
good,"9/80 work schedule is a bonus. Lots of available training. Fast paced environment but getting the job done is the priority. Workplace culture is pretty good, seems to have changed a little bit over the years. Lack of guidance in certain critical areas is a downfall."
good,Creates a sense of belonging because you own shares of the company. Participation and innovation are positive aspects of the company and makes you do better every day.
good,"Advanced clearance level, provided opportunity to move into different positions, left because contract ended with dod. Helped to relocate and easy to talk with hire up."
good,Great company to work for. Everyone is really nice and laid back. Flexible working hours. It would have been nice if work were more stable and constant but that is contracting.
good,Working hours are fair. They allow flex time. I have learned how to write work proposals and fine new business. Management is very fair and caring. Workplace culture is great with emphasis on ethics. Hardest part of the job is my manager is in San Diego and I work in Norfolk. Most enjoyable part is I work independently and SAIC has the confidence in me.
good,"I can think of some negative situations, but as a whole I have to say that SAIC changed my life.  I went from a temp toting boxes to a Vice President.  There were multiple people who saw potential in me and invested in me. I am forever grateful."
good,Working here really opened my eyes to the types of technology available in the industry.  There is a great opportunity to learn so many different technologies.  I even got some insight into how the business actually works and that will likely prepare me for future opportunities.
good,I enjoyed doing DOD work enough to want to go back on with DOD again. The people were fun to work with and the pay was decent for a helpdesk role. Only reason I left was because no roles came up in networking at the time and wanted to get more into that to use my experience and certification knowledge more.
good,"Did not work for SAIC directly. Work was at customer facility. Had one SAIC supervisor on site. There was no company culture to speak. "
good,Very good working environment with needed tools and equipment.  Needs to have management with more experience in there assigned projects.  Very desirable place to work.
good,"Great Team Cohesion, Learned form my co-workers. Coming from different walks of life and having different skillsets. From using a multi-meter to soldering."
good,Saic has a great professional environment nobody holds anybody's hand every body is accountable for their own actions the work schedule is one the best things here I have paid day of as well as a flex schedule
good,I only worked for SAIC for a little under two years.  My reason for leaving had nothing to do with the company.  I enjoyed working with each and every one I met from SAIC including the management.
good,"SAIC allows employees in certain positions to work remotely, which I love.  I have significant responsibilities regarding development of requirements, specifications, and other procurement documents.  However, the company doesn’t spend a lot of concern about employees feeling like they are a part of the company unless they work in the SAIC facility."
good,It is a great place to work with great benefits.The company will work with you to relocate you into a new job or career if or when the contract ends. Very relaxed enviroment.
good,I help to train most of the new Analyst and Incident Handlers that came on board. During the on-boarding process we had to merge the Northrop Grumman and the SAIC way to find a good working process for our team. That was fun.
good,Working with the U.S. Army is always a challenge.  Every 2 years new leadership comes in and changes everything to their liking.  Making it difficult to get software up and running
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at SAIC. If afforded the opportunity I would return. They have a great benefit plan, good employee improvement and advancement. The contract structure is sound and the policies are solid."
good,"fast paced, technical. contracts can be short term or long term. Company does a great job retaining you in contract changes or stoppages.  Usually transferred to a new contract, even in a different sector."
good,"Good company that offers flexible work schedule. Typical contract type work where job security is at the whim of the contract winds. But, SAIC does try to keep talent by finding other positions within the company should a contract loss occur."
good,"SAIC took care of their workers, provided promotion opportunities, SAIC was in touch with cooperate culture. I really loved that the company had a diverse group of people to work with."
good,"Great company before going public, perfect example of a well run employee owned company at the time. Suggest if you find an employee owned company go there, usually have the best culture."
good,"SAIC seemed to respect the employees and did what they could to assist, the leave accrual  is better than most, they seemed to understand work balance and family time."
good,Company is attentive to employee needs.  Great additional self-paced training opportunities.  Wish they would pick an annual evaluation program/process and stick with it.
good,"I can honestly say that I have liked pretty much every year I worked for SAIC, sure some situations and people can make a small moment stressful, or tough, but what job/career doesn't."
good,Had many benefits but was only temporary. Had many different ways to do work and created a safe environment to do my work in a timely manor. Loved working here and would recommended it to all my friends coming from college.
good,I enjoyed my time there. The position I was in was part-time and unfortunately did not have any real growth opportunities.  They were honest about that fact and paid well.  The management was excellent and I had no problems with any employees or rules.
good,"Work was exciting and management provided a hands off approach which worked well for the role. That being said if you ever needed help with anything you could always find someone. Management would check in every once and a while to make sure work was being done correctly."
good,This was a temporary position. I enjoyed working with the technical and Marine Corps personnel. I would gladly return to this company in any position supporting the military.
good,My only complaint is regarding working in IT in general; software SMEs are generally arrogant and don't recognize the importance and contractual obligation of documentation.

The next phase was to test and validate these systems as well as educate the soldiers on this. Phase 3 is where we would conduct our field tests with the soldiers in complete control of the equipment but we were there for support when needed. The final phase was removing the installed equipment and get ready for the next install. I liked my position at SAIC because every few months there was a change of pace and shifted gears, keeping work interesting. There was always something to learn.

I learned the contracting life, the systems introduced to the Army as well as the process that goes into NIE."

I documented performance measurements to increase personal productivity.  Sometimes I was asked to update older drawings.  I tried to learn how some of the drawings worked.

good,"Scitor Corporation is a contracting company that typically performs as a government contractor lending assistance to the government in its pursuit of defense systems, satellites, and weaponry. The company is mainly comprised of a very intelligent and highly capable work force. To become a Scitorain, one must be introduced by a Scitorian - sending your resume to Scitor is fruitless. Scitor does this in an effort to select only top notch, high quality employees. Most Scitorians are very educated - most with Masters degrees, many with Phd's. Scitor salary and benefits are typically better than most companies. Management at Scitor has developed a culture of ""hands-off"" in terms of dictating how employees should perform their jobs, in fact Scitorians are very encouraged to develop new niches in an effort to capture more business. At Scitor it's all about keeping the customer happy, and the customer is the U.S. Government. Fair and reasonable - one of the company's core values, and Scitor is highly respected by the goovernment for always doing the right thing in a fair and reasonable manner."

good,"SAIC is a great place to work.  I learned a lot in my procurement role, mind you, there is a lot to be learned in that field because it is constantly changing.  The hardest part is keeping up with all of the changes, and a massive workload.  Plus, the fast pace at which you need to work through it.  You need to learn and move fast to stay above water but, if you're organized the system works."

During my employment, I had a hand in inventory management, network and software security and management, Windows 2003/2008R2 and RHEL hands-on experience, Active Directory work and help desk. I learned a lot from SAIC/Leidos, probably most importantly was how contracting business worked for the government. My co-workers were helpful and very friendly, and my supervisor would often take us out to lunch and other activities. They were also very intelligent in their fields, my short stay wasn't enough to pick their minds completely (and I ask A LOT of questions). The hardest part of the job was adapting to office life and the corporate structure - this had been my first experience in such an environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning opportunities as an intern. I was truly blessed to be a part of an outstanding team that let me get involved in as many projects as I could."
good,"SAIC has been one of the best companies I have worked for because of the high number of really smart, dedicated people.

good,SAIC provides unique work experience with challenging and awarding opportunities. The company takes pride in their personnel and work that they provide to their customers.
good,"When I first started at SAIC, they offered a one time stock investment at a discounted rate up to $2000 worth of stock. I took full advantage of the investment and the stocks split several times prior to my separation from SAIC. Even after separating, I was able to keep the stocks and allow them to split and appreciate in value until I sold them a couple years ago to put a down payment on a home."

good,I really enjoyed working for this company. the culture was awesome.  The management. really made me feel like part of the team from my first day on the job.
good,"Every day was a challenge, interesting in the government contract world.  With that said it is a contract world, no money awarded, no hours or pay.  In the past I was under overhead, with changes made this year, if you are not on direct work, hours get cut.  The hardest part of the job, was that you never knew if you have a job the next day. The best part of the job was learning to use new systems within the corporation that allowed me to be trained online or in person in a classroom situation."
good,I have been with the company a year now and am so happy I made the move. The managers and staff are encouraging and supportive and you feel genuinely valued. Great company!

good,My management team was fantastic and continually worked with me to transfer during relocation due to my spouse's job. They were always willing to answer questions and assist with every locations' unique needs.
good,It has many facets and different areas to learn different fields of technology. You would normally start by learning manufacturing or about computer chips and how they are made. There is always new technologies to learn about or help someone with a vast field of knowledge about new products being produced to help research. It has its ups and downs based on what projects are going on and whether it is something you love to research or not as interesting as it seemed at the start. The company has a huge list of knowledgeable people to help and get help from in different areas of expertise so it seems almost limitless based on what is happening at the time.
good,"SAIC is an excellent company, well managed and well run. Collaboration is nearly always with client personnel rather than SAIC employees.  When my project lost its funding the company provided a month of paid bench-time while both they and I attempted to find another position."
good,Govt contract eventually ended.  Good people.  Decent location.  Good pay. Small cubicals.  Shuttle to and from Metro was very helpful because I didn't have to fight rush hour traffic.
good,"Over 90% of SAIC's business is in the Department of Defense contract realm.  The specific contract I worked on was new business.  The team on which I worked was wonderful!  We had fun every day.  The only reason I left was because the contract could not match the offer I received from a ""civilian"" company.  This was through no fault of SAIC.  The contract position I was in could simply not pay me that much."

good,go to the job site and get with the mechanics and see how I could help them out in their daily jobs / what I learned was that until you follow in the footsteps of some of the workers and see just how the job is done that you find out that the job you thought should be easy / you find out that it is more difficult than it looks / the hardest part was not being able to help the mechanic to stream line the process due to restrictions or other factors that would keep it the way it was / the most enjoyable part was when you could make a difference in the way the job was done and save time and money / had full support of the management /
good,"Starting out can be a bit rocky; much like many companies these days, you initially start off as a contract/temporary worker. However, it's not too difficult to prove your worth, which can be said of nearly ANY job. As a full-time employee, SAIC takes great care in ensuring you will have a place to work if for some reason your position gets modified or cut off, and will actively work with you in trying to find new placement. Overall, SAIC is an excellent company to work for, and is a good way to get your foot in the door if you're seeking government-based work, depending on which position you manage to get into."
good,"SAIC is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. They pay well, have good benefits, and opportunity for advancement.  A typical work day includes review of my teams workload from the previous day, assigning my team their workload for the current day.  Train any technician in any area that they may need assistance.  Management is top notch and has an open door policy.  The culture is that of high standard but still fun."
good,Love being able to work remotely. I enjoy working for the company. It is very relaxed and laid back. Management is great. They understand personal issues and each is treated case by case.
good,SAIC is a military contractor that takes care of its workers.  They pay for your expertise and work with both the military and the employee to get the best productivity.  The management always looks out for opportunities for the employees to better their positions.
good,"Work management is very supportive and mobility in company seems to be reachable. Also, I like the employees a very family oriented. SAIC is amazing!!"
good,I learned a lot with the short time I was with the company. The best part about this company was the employees. I do miss the work environment plus the location is amazing and convenient.
good,"Depending on position, availability to work from home and flexible schedules.  Wide variety of position possibilities. Excellent potential for advancement."
good,Typical day is reviewing job orders and collaborating with clients and hiring managers on market trends and candidate pool. Creating job responsibilities and requirements.
good,The company is great place to work and learn. There are many opportunities to grow and learn. The only issue that I had with the company is that the insurances is geared so that the bulk of the cost fall on young people starting families. This is one reason that we considered leaving.
good,SAIC is a relatively large company in my program office.  The only gripe that I would state is that the HR is not extremely helpful when dealing with their employees.  Instead of typed emails they're much more likely to send a PDF which does not always assist.
good,"This job was Gov't  contract work, so your job is always on the line, I learned so much at this job, as I was just a material handler but I wore many hats, wherever needed I was there."
good,Scitor is a great place to work. The culture is what set the company apart. The co-workers were a joy to work with.
good,"SAIC has been one of the best places I have worked, the military friendly culture is great. The management make this a great place too be and stay, none better. They are friendly and listen to what you have to say if you have any questions. Coworkers are great as well, most having served in the military. Everyone works towards the same goal of successfully testing and getting soldiers to successfully field new equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees and the work done with the soldiers."
good,"SAIC is a employee focused company"
good,Couldn't work for a better Regional Manager!  I love working for a purpose and having the leadership that is encouraging and family oriented is a bonus.
good,"The job is an excellent place to work on skills and recieve OTJ for new services and hosted applications. The work is a contract job at Fort Bragg, NC. Every three years the contract is rebid on. The job security is a huge factor."
good,"The only reason advancement was negatively scored is due to our employment with SAIC residing under a Government Contract.  The prices are firm fixed in the beginning resulting in little/no room for advancement/promotion.  This was not a fault of SAIC, just a disadvantage of working as a Government Contractor."
good,"This was my first job experience since retiring from the Air Force.  Contract IT can be a vicious experience (if your not careful), but SAIC made it very rewarding.  The company itself is a very professional company that REALLY takes care of its employees.

Management is solid, if you know your job they give you the jobs and allow you to do it. Only time they step in is if you have a question, or need support. Hardest part of my job is working with other maintenance sites where they might not have the same work attitude as our site. Enjoyable part of the job is the management and customers really show their appreciation. Unfortunately this job has technicians and one supervisor and a manager. If you are there for 10 yrs, your still only a technician. No room for growth, and once you learn the job, there really isn't any big surprises you encounter. I look for more challenges."
