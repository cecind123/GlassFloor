bad,"This was the worst place I have EVER worked. Management is bias, rude, Will single you out and treat you terrible with zero training. If you have a family member that is higher up in this company you get treated like gold even though you don’t do your job. If you do your job and do it well then management seems to take prey and bully on certain prey for no reason. I have addressed this this to management and HR. Deaf ears. Absolutely have never been so mistreated or singled out by being a stellar employee. Absolutely a disgrace.talks with HR about this and nothing was done."
bad,"Don't care about employees at all. bad company to work with, no advancement."
bad,"No job will ever tell me that my family is less important than their company. Management and ownership are rude, greedy, and disrespectful. Anytime my old department needed anything to make our jobs easier we couldn't get it because it ""wasn't in the budget""! The ""backbone of the company"" couldn't not get supplies we needed. That's pretty pathetic."
bad,The worst company to work for. The good ol boys club.Managers are worthless. The pay is bad. They want you to work for peanuts. They don't care about your family will work you to death for little pay.
bad,Not worth $7.25 an hour..People there are grouchy..management is not helpful and they shive their weight around..They will never pick a temp for permanent position
bad,the management staff is very unprofessional and they have no customer service help at all and the employees talk about each other like dirt and the management team is just as bad.
bad,"The only time I ever heard from my manager was when I was being written up for something.  Literally, xxxxxx never responded to any of my emails or phone calls, but I got written up for not responding right away to one of xxxxxx's emails.  Each Regional Manager has about 60 people under them, which is way too many to start with, so good luck with setting up some type of career path with your manager.  Under each manager are a couple of  ""mentors"".  If you don't get along with the mentor assigned to you, you're screwed......because that mentor has way too much power. If you're a gossip queen, you'll fit right in & probably get promoted immediately.  If not, sorry about your luck.  The pay plan is a joke so good luck trying to make any money."
bad,"Worked security and honestly you work with some great people except for the main security guard, he’s arrogant and one of the worst people I have ever met. Management doesn’t help what so ever and they expect you to do everything, even though you get paid exceptionally low. No advancement either unless you’re employed inside."
bad,"Very horrible place to work lack of management. Very cutthroat job the general manager is the absolute worst person to ever run the place.  The management plays favorites there’s no  career advancement at all. The pay is terrible considering the high cost of living in Austin Texas. There’s temp workers making more money in full-time employees.  Just the overall morale there is absolutely terrible everyone feels get there to watch over their shoulder for the fear of being fired. So in short no job security,  horrible pay, lack of management, no career advancement, no employee respect,  terrible place to work."
bad,"bad company to work with, no advancement. "
bad,"Was at KAR for 8 years. After 8 years I was told my job was being eliminated in 9 days. When 9 days was up was not giving 1 penny of severance package after being told my job was being eliminated through no fault of my own.  Promotions are not merit based and are not based on seniority. They are based on political alliances in the company and the hiring managers instincts vs logic.  Again, logic, fairness, time with the company and pass performances are not factors in promotion with this company."
bad,"One of the worst company i have ever worked for. Too much nepotism. Bad territory management, no future growth options. They will set you up for failure. Auction process is interesting but this company has way to many issues internally. Employees quitting right and left. No proper training, so sink or swim. I do not recommend anybody to join this company, in any territory nationally."
bad,"I'm not sure what management is like at other Adesa sites, but in Airdrie it is the most inept I have ever experienced. They talk the talk, but they do not walk the walk. Safety is a joke and working conditions are pathetic. There are only two things they worry about and that is the sale and the dealers, staff is secondary at least if you are paid hourly. Sales and office staff are the cream of the crop and the yard people are nothing. It would be interesting to see office and sales and managers set up the sale on their own without the peasants in the yard, it wouldn't happen. It is a great place if you only work part time and want a job where you can come and go as you please but I would not recommend full time to anyone. Low pay and no appreciation."
bad,This job was through a temp agency and we were laid off without notice.  We were called at home and told to come and gather our personal affects.  This was my first time working for a temp agency not sure if this is how is works
bad,"Doesn't work with work schedule. Work more than 8hrs a day. Barely no time off. Work rain ,sleet, or snow. Needs to pay more money for the work plus conditions."
bad,Don’t accept a job here they will hire you then tell you the job was no longer available. This is after you gave notice and now your unemployed nice company.
bad,"I worked for 3 years at the Mercer, Pa location.   What  I can tell you is this,  do not waste your time. This is a very bad place , run by very bad people."
bad,"Poor management, worst training, actually had to leave due to stress created in the work place. Constant belittling by mananagement. No communication. Poor ethics."
bad,This place sucks -5 degree weather expect you outside all day walking in a footfall field lot for minuim wage...a temp makes much as a three year employee this is the worst job in life!!!! Run
bad,"Lack of/ no training, management was unhelpful. Thrown into job without proper resources. Had to rely on people who started 3-4 months before me for help. Systems used constantly crashed in the middle of working. Extremely ineffiencent overall."
bad,"The management at the top of TradeRev is horrible and out for themselves.  Lie, cheat, and steal to cover their butts.  TradeRev could be a great tool if the people at the top understood how car guys thought."
bad,"Upper management does not care about their employees.  They would sell you down the river for a nickel,  The company has no morals or ethics.  If you want to work for someone who will fire a good employee to shut them up for pointing out se*ual harassment, work for KAR"
bad,My manager sat in her office with the lights off and door closed most days.  Never gave us any feedback and always avoided you and every question that you asked. I have never seen a management/leadership style quite like hers. Her lack of managing the team was obvious and caused many problems amongst team members.  It was a call center and everyone would yell at you if you talked on the phone to loud. Very bad experience and would not recommend working there.
bad,I was lied to in tge begining i have over 20 years experience in locksmithing and they started me with 13 per hour when i was told 20 per hour management is bad they want you to manage and take calls and schedule the buisiness and you have to get new accounts for them everday or you will get fired your better off opening your own buisiness.it was busy when i first started but they lost a big account so i was working from full time to part time billion dollar company that cant pay and insurance is horrible its obama care stay away!!
bad,"Worst company ever.  If you are not on salary or have a nice cozy desk job, you will work your butt off and get crapped on constantly for very little money.  They do not care at all for the hourly wages employees.  Best thing to do to teach them all a lesson is if all the hourly wages employees went on strike and let them do the work and realize that hey....Maybe we should be paying our staff better because they do more work than the desk jockies."
bad,Work environment is horrible. Claims to be drug free but questionable. Management has gone down hill and is not open door.
bad,Bad management and just another job that wants u to do everyone else's job for less money and just bad work place all in all
bad,"This company uses and abuses the minimum wage. The benefits are available but, but by the time he hears him you be lucky to have 50 bucks in your paycheck. Don't waste your time!!!"
bad,"Bad pay, no raises, no team players, slave labor. Long hours in all climates short lunches. Management just sits around playing on personal phones, never helps with questions or concerns you may have"
bad,"As a previous review stated, IT is a joke at Adesa. I work at the corporate office and they are constantly tasking me with things they know nothing about. "
bad,"If you are in IT, and you are considering this company (ADESA or KAR), think again. Leadership in IT is non-technical and has no respect for their engineers or working knowledge of running a highly specialized technical team. I have worked at this company for 5 years and it has gotten exponentially worse over my time there. The non-technical management expects at least 45 hours per week from their engineers (Network, Server, Storage, etc.), but will not blink an eye or compensate us if we work 60 hours each per week consistently for months on end. They provide no real benefits and their salaries are lower than anyone else in the market."
bad,"Same as for Adesa since it is a ""sister company"". One of the worst employers ever."
bad,"It's all in quantity at this place !! Being one of the oldest people in the department, the younger ""girls"" had their clicks and attitudes, and were not much help. Training was pretty much"" thrown in and do it"" and the demand for outrageous amounts of invoices processed was ridiculous.  The stress level was unreal, and the management was too busy taking breaks to notice much,  I understand why they pay was ""do-able"" because all of the garbage you have to put up with."
bad,"HR was just wiped out in 2012, 2013 leaves the leftovers stressed out. If you fail to get the dance right or offer ways to improve....you should start looking right away for another job."
bad,Adesa was not a good place to work because it was only 10 hours a week and $7.00 an hour and was to far
bad,The very last priority of this company is its employees. Declining business lacks abilty to build.
bad,Worse company to work for!!!!! Unreliable in so many ways it hurts my head to think about it!!!!! Managers who rather not bother with their responsibilities. Poor and unsafe work environment for your health. I have been their for a year and 3 months now and still have not been offered and full time postion nor benefits. I have never been so disappointed and discusted with such a company in all my years of working. I stay because I have a beautiful five year old boy I have and would do anything for.
bad,"The pay at KAR is pretty low for hourly employees, it vastly improves with Salaried positions especially in sales. Management is horrible, watch your back."
bad,"Managers are the worst, If you are among the favorite you get overtime, if not, even you are a full time employee. Manager accept gifts and food from employees."
bad,The management sucks here they really need to improve and this area and the pay really need to increase for the work that they require you to do. Holidays and all u have to work
bad,What you make it not terrible but alot of work not enough money. I think we certainly should get paid starting with more money. There's alot of hype in the beginning but the money doesn't equate to the amount of work you do.
bad,The person who was suppose to train me for the job was setting me up for failure.  I was let go after 3 days even though I did everything I was asked to do. I don't feel bad since it was a chance for me to find a way better job which I love.
bad,"I tried to work with the company. I tried with all my might with even trying to get a position that paid more they took some one that didnt work there as long as i did, I would even try for a better pay raise they didnt care the company rather have more money for people that work less than ones that work out in the weather. Managments didnt care of who you were or where you were if you were working out side basicly your nothing but sh***** so i found a company that paid way much more willing to work with me unlike this company!!!"
bad,Managers don't appreciate the workers. They work you to death. Not worth working there.  Managers take advantage and they take the credit of all the work you've done.
bad,"poor working conditions , very stressful,  terrible management, very demanding for low pay.  Expects you to perform duties that they won't do. The worst place I have ever worked in my life.  But they have a great time off package"
bad,"Came to work for them when they bought the previous  company DataScan whom I had been with for 10 awesome years.  Management misled us as to the changes that were to come. When they began assigning me work that resulted in a 50% reduction in my income I refused and was fired."
bad,"I worked in vehicle check in for almost 2 years & every day was the same thing. Scan & check vin # on car, put in options,  print labels. Management says ""It's not about the money, if you love your job"" & ""that we should thank god that we have a job"". Management only cares about the customers & not the employees. It should be both.They like to mess with your hours. They never tell you good job or try harder next time. They always told you that your mistakes cost the company thousands of $."
bad,"working at ADESA is very plain. nothing special nothing great you getting a caryou find the parking spot you park the car in the spot repeat for hours n hours for a few hundred carsthe pay is minimumthe days are few or more if you're lucky call it a lunch money or gas money job. Find something better and permanent os at all possible. "
bad,"Worst teratment of employees that I have seen in 35 years of working.Company steals from employees by taking hours from you during the week and inform you on thurs or friday that you will work saturday wiyhout overtime .Very busy Auction.Emphasis on quantity not Quality.Write CRs outdoors in thunder and lightning storms , blizzards hailstorms and freezing temps,and expect accuracy.Managers stand guard like correction officers so no one leaves before he says so."
bad,If you are a yes man or woman especially to the GM this is the place for you!! Keep your head down and bow to the GM and you will go far!!
bad,"Mgmt. has favorites, you won't go anywhere unless you are part of the clique.  Titles mgr., parties with certain members of her team -- Country Thunder get aways with chosen direct report (same ones every year) during normal buis. hrs.  Allowed to schedule time off with favored employee while other employees carry the weight.  Also, schedules team events at strip club. VP and director level promote this behavior "
bad,Will never recommend anyone to work here ....there is no flexibility whatsoever!!! No perks...but OPERATIONS director comes in and out whenever she wants...MICROMANAGING 1000%.... Everyone in my department  finance left shortly after I left definitely thwy need new managers and new director that know manager skills !
bad,The management is horrible. Some of employees are lazy. Management has their favorite employees. I left  due to stress. Ended up in the hospital due to it.
bad,"over worked employees, bad management, no holidays off, forced employees to work weekends with the threat of being fired, didn't allow employees to work a second job, work environment was dangerous with harmful chemicals"
bad,"New management made it a fear culture. Must be a favorite to advance. Must wear a fake happy face or you are not a team player.  Was great, not anymore"
bad,"Pay is dismal, all outside work work in non runners, basically repo cars, some have human excrement, cars look like they have gone thru a war. They tell you about ppe if you want to be protected buy your own. I've never seen any company provided. There are days I can't imagine what I was exposed to. After being a ""valued employee "" got a whole 14cent raise. At our location if you want to advance be a good old boy,but that takes years. Advancement has nothing to do with prior education or training. If I wasn't within walking distance to work I'd be elsewhere."
bad,"Nice time working at this place take ID call in guests to residents u have to observe and walk, stand , talk , friendly,  make sure your uniform clean"
bad,"Working as Customer Connection was good, however the team was childish, back stabbing and talked behind your back. I have never worked with a company that the manager was located in a different state and only came to the office for 3-4 days a month IF THAT.  Management listened to their""favorites""instead of taking to you first. If you don't kiss butt your not going anywhere! Don't trust anyone!!"
bad,"If you are looking for a place to work that provides poor pay, little respect, zero job security, a place that has no problem with discrimination, and no room for advancement this very well may be the place for you. For the most part everything is run through corporate, a bunch of people who have no clue how the actual auction works or the value of the people that work there."
bad,Once you hit 40 watch out.  They like to hire people in their 20's so they can pay them less.  Directors are the the worst managers.  They have no people skills. Don't work for this company!
bad,"decent money for detailing work,management and co workers suck, very hard tedious work.forced to drive for auctions at loss of money.days often cut short"
bad,"Their culture is that of Fun, Honest, Accountable, and Brave. The management doesn't want honest, and are not held accountable for anything they do. If it wasn't done right, then they will blame. Managers are not competent in their role."
bad,"Management puts alot of emphasis on social.time outside of work and engages in unprofessional behavior.  FAVORITISM runs rapid throughout the ops floor.  Director level managers and above that have been around for years, foster a negative work environment and talk badly about employee(s) and clientele.  There is no work, life, balance unless you are one of the chosen few."
bad,"The hiring process takes so long, HR is so unprofessional. There’s no training, no management support& no communication between departments. The management people should be working @ a gas station. No one has the balls to make changes. The whole company is a joke."
bad,"Oh sure, you can show up for work and get paid. But the managerial culture is primitive and backwards. They routinely send people to do dangerous jobs that they are not trained for and don't get paid for. It can take years to get the promised raise that goes along with the added responsibility and risk. Additionally they take very poor care of the cars in their care. The detail shops and the lot crews and even shady dealers do a fair amount of damage to the cars along the way, and it often leads to operational complications that require extra manpower to resolve."
bad,"If your looking for a long term career this is not the place. FHAB is the core values of this company."
bad,"Took this job cuz I thought it'd be easy-ish money. So wasn't. There's way too much time spent driving, the appointments and where they have you drive make no sense, was told I'd have a small territory but ended up driving sometimes 80 miles round trip for one appointment which would have been Ok but it is during the peak commute time so took like 2 hours to go one way. Management isn't totally upfront about what you'll be making, benefits are bad, medical is useless (high deductible plans). People drop out of this job like crazy, few people stay, they are always hiring. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting home. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude, lessees and their dirty vehicle. Typical day at work is trying to get as many inspections done as you can, which means you can't really take the time you should to thoroughly check out each car otherwise you won't make your daily quota nor your commission. It's a lot harder of a job than they make it out to be.. Can't recommend."
bad,"Bad manager. Guards are asked to do garbage and other non security related duties. Impossible to do the number of rounds of patrol required, unless you go very fast, way above the speed limit. Don't care about employees safety."
bad,"They are technologically about 15-20 years behind Manheim (their largest competitor) and they don't care. I was a Sales Manager there and my desktop computer still had a 3 and a 1/2 inch floppy drive THAT STILL WORKED! You will receive 50 emails a day, but your drive has no room, so have to delete 50 emails a day<--this is a royal pain! They still use Blackberrys!!! And the managers DO NOT CARE if technology is hindering your performance! On my first day I was handed a Gateway notebook from about the year 2000. I gave it back to them and said, ""I'll just use my own."" I was laughing so hard when I walked away. "
bad,"The employees are fun to work with ,It's an easy Job ,It's to travel to the objective are easily obtainable.  We have the best possible supervisor."
bad,"Management  has no idea what there doing including VP and up.lets raise the bar 30% and see if anyone makes money. Before Adesa inquired Openlane it was hands down the best company I have ever worked for. CEO Cared about his employees, pay was great couldn't ask for a better company to work for. Good job Adesa way to crash and burn."
bad,"I'm only writing this to save other people from wasting their time. It's supposed to be an entry-level position that would open doors for you to move on. Unfortunately, the manager is an egotistical narcissist that does not want to see people advance. Total waste of time especially for the pay!"
bad,"Worked here for 3 months, they waited 3 months for me to come into that job (was in school) moved to vegas (from CA) and hated it so much I left.  your just a number"
bad,"the management (aside from 1 or 2 people) is old and dried up. ITs everyman for himself here. regardless what they say, there is no Team effort here!!"
bad,"Hard place to get to, and a never ending fight to climb the ""corporate ladder"". Not the ideal place to expand a career, especially in the vehicle industry."
bad,"The manager is given freedom to do whatever he wants including not working.  The upper management has no consideration for others.  I worked long hours with no help from manager.  Manager delegated all his responsibilitues to others which added to the pressure.  When you complained about unethical practices to HR, they did nothing.  Retaliation ran rampt."
bad,"Where to start ,"" Do as I say not as I do ."" Create rules just to break them as long as you dont get in trouble if so, "" Why did you go against the rules "" MGMT.  Unless your in bed with them good luck getting ahead ."
bad,"Bad company to work for Bad pay rates, bad management, no support system offered. Only positive thing I can say is that the benefits package is great!"
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job? Interacting with staff from other companies within KAR such as PAR and CarBuyCo. The hardest part was dealing with managers and HR. Long hours with no appreciation or recognition."
bad,"This is a very hard place to work for, you can come to work"
bad,"It is rude and unprofessional not to respond either one way or the other regarding a persons application.  I put time and effort into my application with hopes of a job.  "
bad,"If you are in IT, and you are considering this company (ADESA or KAR), think again. Leadership in IT is non-technical and has no respect for their engineers or working knowledge of running a highly specialized technical team. I have worked at this company for 5 years and it has gotten exponentially worse over my time there. The non-technical management expects at least 45 hours per week from their engineers (Network, Server, Storage, etc.), but will not blink an eye or compensate us if we work 60 hours each per week consistently for months on end. They provide no real benefits and their salaries are lower than anyone else in the market. "
bad,Employees are very self centered and don't care much for the new person.
bad,"poor management "
bad,no set schedule.  some days you will only work 4 hours and some you will work 12 hours.  recent company buyout so there is no job security.  no communication between management and employees.  poor working conditions. minimum wage job pays too little for expectations
bad,You bust my your butt for no recognition I have a degree and someone with no education was picked for a promotion who didn't go a single hour of overtime while the rest of us did I can't even begin to say how much this place sucks
bad,"WAS a good place to work for until Adesa took over.  then no raises & increased amount of work expected.  Administration did NOT care, thus way to many ATTITUDES allowed to exist."
bad,This place pay rate is pretty bad takes forever to advance in the company if Im not mistaken they show a little favortism in certain positions. I come to work everyday on time and work overtime if asked but the hours of not knowing when to get off hurts other plans outside of work.
bad,"working there was horrible, HR manager was the worst and then no HR department.  Mangers do not care and they fire for no reason.  Avoid this company please"
bad,"Security guard will be told $10.00 to $13.00 an hour based on experience,  actual $12.00 or under. Very high turn over and most of the time under staffed for the duties covered. "
bad,no interaction between management and workers....job title does not entail what you really have to do....everyone thinks they are in charge and  can be very intiminating at times.you drive some cars that should not be driven....lead driver vans are old and unsafe.schedules are great and you can pick your shift as you wish.
bad,Company is horrendous. You are just a number. They will throw you to the wolves when they can. Management is not to be trusted any any location as you see from previous reviews.  Be careful when applying.
bad,"save yourself headaches and time, go somewhere else."
bad,"This company is in constant flux. Benefits are not forthcoming. Merit based promotion/benefits are not forthcoming. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. They give 2% raises when given a promotion at any level. They do not take care of their people. I have enjoyed my position here, however. I love working with people and helping them achieve their goals. I keep an open door policy, build relationships and trust, even if this means I am not financially compensated for the level of work I do for them."
bad,TradeRev is a cluster and a mess. Adesa and its partner are at war with each other over control and sales staff are in the middle. The software works only part time. Mangers do not return phone  calls let alone address issues. DO NOT leave your job to take this on! You will be left on your own with no support !!!
bad,"Few hours, Have to work in stormy weather in winter months, Great co-workers, Hardest part of job is snow clearing with shovel, most enjoyable is driving high end cars"
bad,management need more experience with other ethnic backgrounds. the site has a lot of experience if you want to learn more about variety of cars. i give this job a 3 out of 10
bad,Most of the work is with used car dealers who are attempting to purchase inventory and often don't have the line of credit to do it.  Created a lot of work with follow up.
bad,"Typical day; start your phone, punch in , get you schedule downloaded (both on your phone & G1/tablet), go out and follow the schedule, possibly call lessees if you have to, inspect cars & complete dealer floor plan audits. This was an awesome job up until about 5 months ago when they introduced their new routing/scheduling system , STARS. STARS is one of the most inefficient systems you will use & there is no accountability . They used to use a call center , while flawed, you could still reach out to someone if there were issues a and get response/change. The other issue with stars is that they want you to follow their route, no exceptions, even when it tells you to go to dealer A, then to dealer B, then back to A, which in the past , would never happen. If you listen to the RMs, they tell you it's all about the SLA being due, but that would mean it's scheduling the SLA until the last minute it's due, right ? The RM I had talked in circles and the policy he would tell you one day, would be different the next. Before STARS, we could make our own hours, you could knock out all the cars in your area quickly and make some decent money. I went from driving about 1500-1700 miles a month before STARS to over 2000 a month with STARS . They do have an awesome benefits package and do pay mileage/ vehicle reimbursement .   It was interesting watching the culture change once STARS was introduced to corporate taking the side of STARS and not listening at all to the FRs anymore."
bad,Showing your employees that you appreciate their hard work goes a lot further than just saying it. Happy employees are productive employees. Employer needs to make assistance programs more readily available to employees.
bad,Favoritism of employees is a big problem.  If you are not a favorite you definitely get treated very different.  No opportunity to learn from mistakes.
bad,"I had high hopes when I took a position here, but my hopes faded quickly. I watched time and again as my colleagues with great ideas and potential were battered and belittled. After a few short months, it started to become obvious that people with drive and ideas are not valued here. There are a few that survive here, and a number of people who are in pockets where they enjoy the work. However, most want out of this place. Frustration is high. There is great opportunity, but the people with the right mindset and skills move on or are driven out."
bad,Enjoyed job but little or no room for advancement. Regular changes in pay schedules and plans with no notification of employees. Little or no feedback on job performance.
bad,Some departments workload is 10 times as much as other departments.  Some office employees complain all day and smoke cigarettes.  That's basically their day.  Not much respect given to those who actually do work.
bad,"Been working at this place for 2 years.  The people I work next to are great but the people who work around us really suck.  It seems like the lazy people get all the promotions and the hard working people quit because of it.  Instead of management lighting a fire under the lazy persons butt, they just give the workload to the other people and if they cant perform, they get in trouble instead of the slacker.  A lot of shaddy, lying, back stabbing goes on here and after 2 years of dealing with this garbage, I'm ready to move on.  The pay stinks and last year everyone besides the managers got a 2 percent raise.  Do the math, it doesn't even cover cost of living expenses. If you want a promotion, good luck because 9 times out of 10 they hire outside people and bring them in instead of giving the promotion to someone whos put in the time and effort to get it.  If your too good at your job, they do everything they can to keep you there. The training is a joke, they give you a computer and let you figure it out on your own.  The general manager at the Grimes location is a great guy but clueless about the people who work under him and the bs ""work"" they provide.  Little does he know they just hurt the company more than help it and get paid huge to do little.  KAR does these, so called, pride audits.  Basically someone whos never done your job and has no clue how the auction works grades you on your performance, its stupid.  If you want a career, look somewhere else but if you just need a job until you find something better then apply. The one upside to being a CR writer aka. vehicle"
bad,"Don't ever work here.  You will be bullied if you don't get along with the right enployees.  You upset one manager you've upset all of them.  Very highschool mentality.  Backstabbing, drama, gossip galore!  They will also expext you to do 4 people's jobs for the same money.  Avoid at all costs.  Retail is better."
bad,"Chauffeur pour les encans ,mercredi matin de 8:00 a 12:00."
bad,"I was a manager of detail and mechanic shops.the detail shops are pretty much sweat shops where employees are expected to meet impossible demands and deadlines. There were times where myself as a manager would have to work 60 plus hours straight without sleep or being able to go home due to cars arriving late, over scheduling by sales staff, employee call offs etc. there were times I would have to cover 4 or 5 other employees jobs and still try to do my own job.  Upper management is aware of problems in the shops but does not care, does not return emails or phone calls  requesting additional help or notifying them of equipment break downs or any other problems you encounter. The worst part of the job was the condition of the cars we had to detail and finding people willing to do that kind of work. The best part of the job was i was paid a decent salary but with the hours I had to put in, having to work while i was sick because I had no back up to cover for me and the vacation time I lost because I was not able to take time off (paid time off is use it or lose it and is not carried over from one year to the next) it wasn't worth sacrificing my health and dedicating my life to. When i took the time to calculate what i was actually making per hour with all the time I had to put in the money really wasn't that great."
bad,"CEO needs to take a long hard look at some of the members of upper management within corporate. Those guys should leave local management alone and let them do their jobs. Most of the auctions GM's do a fine job running their auction and have done so long before they brought in Regional Sales Managers. They dont need Regional Sales Managers, its an unnecessary layer with a high salary. Some corporate managers run short on integrity. It is catching up with the company, they better turn the vessel around and quick. They treat their employees like do do."
bad,"Although the pay and benefits are decent. Management is a JOKE along with who they chose to put in “higher” positions. They don’t care about you and you are replaceable. You’re a number to them. They are sneaky and go behind your back and play high school games. There is no maturity. Don’t waste your time. If you can go to work, do your job and go home. Then great. Don’t plan on making friends or going to ANYONE for help. If you love micromanagement and call centers then this is the place for you. The Mesa AZ location has horrible employees. Do more searching before settling with this nightmare. Your position is never promised."
bad,The management was on of the worst I have ever worked under. They did not care about the employees. They played a lot of favoritism when it comes to career growth and only cared about the politics of big corporate business
bad,Management is poor and displays favoritism to employees. Management also created a hostile work environment and was unapproachable due to mood swings. Don't expect to get to know this company as it relies on email to inform you of any changes of direction. Morale very low. Transporters and buyers were great. PTO is plenty and you'll want to use it to get away from the environment there. Medical insurance not the best and neither is the vision.
bad,"Days in the PWI office are long, work is tedious, but not difficult. Management is trying, but is severely short handed, misplaced and lacking direction. The new president has his work ahead cut out for him. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee events & meals."
bad,"For company that loves to promote internal growth and advancement, they sure love to lead current employees on, providing little to no updates on internal applications, only to hire external candidates."
bad,Company in transition. The pay is good and the benefits are average to slightly above average. Most leadership in the IT department have recently been replaced with former Interactive Intelligence\Genesys people. While the vision doesn't appear to be a bad one the new leadership has struggled to communicate to existing staff. They have hired a significant number of former Interactive people and there is a definite clique atmosphere that has formed.
bad,I really dont have anything to say about this company except it is a fast pace and competetive company and there is no growth there. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"Average 60 hour work week is expected, no respect for personal life. Management makes very poor decisions and has no concern for employees. Below average compensation and limited room for advancement. Currently pushing the idea that nontechnical individuals are better for IT."
bad,"I started out at Adesa as an auction driver, which was surprisingly pleasant. Not enough hours though and the pay was minimum. I was then moved up to a condition report writer and that's when everything went down hill. The management was HORRIBLE and I couldn't understand why someone who didn't know our job was supposed to be watching over our work. It felt like I was in high school all over again with all the employees talking smack behind each others back and what not. I was relieved when I got a job offer from a different company. I couldn't get away from that place fast enough!"
bad,"It always starts at the top of an organization...and KAR Auction Services is no different.  The training at the Administration Offices went beyond poor.  Several of the Managers, including the General Manager work from home quite frequently, while we are left to ""manage"" on our own. The General Manager and Vice President and female managers are normally not available for the staff or even the customers.  The Regional Vice President is definitely working hard everyday to promote himself to Senior Management @ Corporate.  I'm not certain the Corporate HR Team really knows what HR is about...seriously."
bad,"Benefits were good, especially PTO (23 days not including holidays). Overall environment was not conducive in fostering young women in the workplace. Men in management outweighed women in management by 5:1 in my department. Male managers were very cliquey and there was the atmosphere of a “boy’s club.” Managers will say they will provide training to develop you but never follow through on their word, even when prompted with multiple reminders."
bad,"Office Manager was very lacking, and unorganized.  Training for the position was very incomplete.  Office staff and management were very petty.  If you like working in a very fast paced environment with minimal (at best) training with co workers who only co-exist then you should be ok."
bad,"Always looking for new people to hire and the work is easy to learn/do. "
bad,"This company is an okay company to work for, i would not recommend it to any of my friends. You do get a lot of over-time pay if you chose, but other than that, its a dead end job."
bad,"The Benefits are the greatest part of this place. You gain time off a month after employment. There is no moving up though and you have to suck up hard to even try to get anywhere. You are never appreciated for the extra things you do. The manager never checks in with us and only cares if anything involves him or the company itself, "
bad,"To much work to do in a single day with unrealistic expectations."
bad,"PROS:"
bad,"It was for me a very independent and fun work"
bad,"Job is ok, but management is poor. He rarely gives instructions or informs new things to one directly. Sometimes he would deny what he had said. You just have to laugh!"
bad,"Way to repetitive, and no way to change otherwise or motivate. "
bad,"There is a lot of variability between groups.  Depending on the group you work in, you may have a flexible work schedule.  Not all groups have flexible work weeks.  There are a lot of great people that work there, but that is also changing as the culture was good but not it's about ""just get your work done and don't ask questions""."
bad,"Handled several accounts for a variety of retail, financial and rental car companies. Good opportunity to develop software computer skills."
bad,"Provided technical assistance to managers and potential employees using Vurv  software. "
bad,"This was my first position after I graduated, and I couldn't have had a better experience."
bad, Served and acted as a mediator between French Speaking Canadians and their leasing companies through the process of returning a leased car.
bad,While this company has the leadership to surpass expectations that leadership is constantly second guessed by individuals that surpassed them through contacts rather than merit.
bad,"PROS:"
good,"My first day was good; everyone was nice to me and everyone wanted to help me. I would ask questions and they would get answered right away. 2 months later everything started to change. Lazy workers didn't get  in trouble. If I stopped for a second I would get yelled at but the lazy worker. I tried talking to the manager about it and he never did anything about it. Poor management was clearly there. They wonder why people keep quitting. Schedule was never the same. Manager said what time to come in and what time we got off. Lunches were was supposed to be 1 hour, but he would always say 30 mins."
good,"Do your job, keep your mouth shut.  Do not think you can make friends there because there are no friends at work. If you know how to do your job then do it, but there is no good advancement."
good,"lacking in the training department but most of it personal experience"
good,"Operations level managers are outstanding............disconnect between the Carmel Indiana Upper Management and onsite General Management.   GM's lack integrity and ability......VP of ""Continuous Improvement"" appears to follow the failed GE model."
good,The branch manager doesn't have a clue what he is doing. There is no job security and no room for advancement. They don't appreciate the employees and don't understand the value of positive feedback.
good,Boys club management.  retaliation if question management.  poor review process. burn out rate is set to be very high.
good,"Too many clicks.  Best not to share anything of yourself, because there will be someone who doesn't like you for that very reason.  And going to a supervisor about the noise is pointless, because then they ridicule you in letting everyone else know you complained.  Supervisor came up through the ranks, but still acts juvenile like the rest of the group connecting still with the clicks.  Treats you differently if you are a temp as well."
good,"Fast paced."
good,"The work is monotonous and rarely changes beyond the weekly cycle. Most of the work on the lot can be learned in a single day. Proficiency in the field, of course, takes time.  "
good,"Enjoyed time here at ADESA, but life and circumstances are called for change. Things have changed in the last two years. some changes were worth it, some were pointless. Management is poor, we have had numerous new GM's and the work ethic is poor."
good,"Poor Management team, lack of leadership in most department, no teamwork, everyone complains, leadership doesn't take ownership of its own mistakes, always quick to point the finger at the employee's"
good,"Check buildings, patrol the lot for trespassers, check in/receive vehicles, check out the vehicles, do reports on accidents or other incidents, prevent keys from stolen and kept up to date logs."
good,"I was heavily micromanaged in my area. I seemed to be the only one as I asked other team members had they been receiving the same treatment. I did my work, I had results but yet I was treated unfairly."
good,Very hard work sometimes long hours pay is not the best I personally don't think the pay is worth the work. they have got more strict with being on time cell phones .
good,"On Tuesday mornings, each person drives about 15 cars through their auction lane for bidding."
good,I have worked their for three month hired as a contractor. In that three months they were able to decide when to start the project.
good,"fast paced, get dirty, work in all type of weather, have you walking in the rain all day"
good,"transporting vehicles in a safe and timely manner throughout the day was enjoyable, relaxing work environment"
good,"A typical work day would include a very pleasant routine of transporting crews to car dealers to transport cars to and from the ADESA lot. The management was very poor in many factors, mostly decision making and handling issues within the workplace.. Nothing was hard or difficult about the job and I really enjoyed being around alot of the people there."
good,"this was a typical day at work, sometimes i needed more hours and coudn't get it."
good,"First they put people in groups to assign job to that group."
good,"The company relies too much on old ways and standards, and makes it hard to adapt to new technologies."
good,"KAR/ADESA is a good place to work. The work was fun and the creative team is really good. It would have been nice to have had a ""heads-up"" that they would be letting us go. other than that, it was a good job."
good,Relación cordial con todos los compañeros de la empresa. El gerente (nuevo) con excelentes propuestas para mejora de la empresa.
good,"I worked well over my 40 hour per week salary. So there was no work/life balance. GM was aware and did nothing to help change it. Everything was about the GM's favorite managers, if you weren't one of them well life was awful. My pay was good until we lost so many accounts that there was no way that I would be able to reach my goals and receive the bonus. I did however advance very quickly with the company. Management sucks as the location and the CEO of KAR holdings is an arrogant pencil pusher who has no idea about the auction industry and what it takes to make the dealers and employees happy!! I had to Lay off one of my employees who was very good at her job because my GM didn't care for her. Better part is that the GM made her come in with her 4 year old son after her she had left for the weekend! "
good,"Good place to work in general, although was very hard to get into the good ole boy group on a daily basis. Adverse conditions & limited access to some vehicles-focus on numbers & inspection count versus accurate assessments without worrying about numbers. No warnings to advise of possible firing although always worked after hours upon request-even though some others did not,bottom line no trustworthy support from management based on job type & conditions including requirements & Unrealistic expectations on a daily basis."
good,"AutoVIN used to be a great company to work for.  Work/life balance was great. Compensation was great.  Morale throughout the company was great.  Now that senior management has forced a flawed scheduling system (Stars) onto the field reps, all of the good things about the company have changed.  Pay is down, due to less work being completed.  Most of us are driving more miles than before, and adding excessive wear and tear to our vehicles, while the vehicle and mileage reimbursements haven't increased.  Complaints about the flaws in the system seem to be falling on deaf ears, because we are being told that everything is getting better, but those of us who actually do the work are not seeing any improvements."
good,Typically there were certain tasks which needed to be done and I worked on the ones that became mine somewhat by default because certain employees preferred doing other tasks and claimed them as their own.  Some of my tasks I performed helped another employee be freed up to work on more complicated and detailed tasks.  I felt there were other things I could have learned given the opportunity and repetition.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I felt I was making a helpful impact on other's work.  The hardest part of the job was that I had no previous experience in the car business and I found it difficult to be accepted in that atmosphere.
good,"For what they sell, they are a good company.  Not good at taking care of their employees.  Benefits have gotten too expensive to afford on the minimal salary.  Annual salary increases are nearly nonexistent and are a small fraction of the amount of the increase in the cost of our benefits."
good,"Work in the yard in the London Ontario branch for 6 months,, people in the office were great to work with but in the yard it was a very unhappy place to be, always the same 2 people arguing and talking about each other which caused others to be miserable and the yard was poorly managed with no direction or support,, only way i would go back is if 3 out of the 5 people in the yard were not working there,,"
good,"work was busy, constant driving, minimial management. pay plan is to irregular. constantly cutting pay for milage, it doesnt cover your fuel or maintence costs"
good,"Learned valuable information & laws including DMV verifications, laws and restrictions."
good,The company means well but in certain situations there was a lack of training. You were asked to take on the job of others who failed to do the job adequately and given only minimal training.
good,"lots of travel, poor mileage compensation. long hours and very technical work cycle. Lots of staff keeping u aware of policy changes and they keep the customer and lease turn ins or inspections handle quickly and keep dealers happy!"
good,"Being that this is a job that is largely based on volume, when work is slow, you really feel it. The day tends to drag on if the volume isn't there. You work outside in all kinds of weather so if your are against that then this isn't the job for you. Productivity is key here so you have to always keep that in mind at all times. Management can be a bit sloppy and incompetent at times, tot he point where it makes you question how people got their positions in the first place. Raises are very dismal. A bright spot to the job, if any, is the fact that you occasionally get to see some very nice automobiles."
good,"As security at adesa auto auctions we were submanaged by multiple areas of management never doing what we tasked to do and having all the work everyone else was ""too busy"" too do."
good,"Since being purchased by Adesa, the culture at Openlane has been suffering a slow death. Sales goals are raised to impossibly high levels monthly and your ability to help your customers is diminished monthly. A lot of the higher management has left over the last year and, with Multi-listing Platforms coming out this year, the company is only going to struggle more."
good,"Sometimes forced to use PTO if weather is SOE bad"
good,"Loader Operator, Management did not listen to issue with unsafe equipment and that not up to OSHA Code. Would have been a good place to work for if they would have kept their equipment up to OSHA code and not have to operate under unsafe conditions."
good,Decent company to work for. EBTA is the main focus for leadership. Many different businesses within parent company that function differently and many times are given the same directions for executing business models even if they don’t work.
good,I have been at this company for 5 years with no incentive or pay increase. I applied for a position within the company I am well qualified for and was turned down because of where I live
good,This is a part-time job that I do on Thursday and Friday evenings and Saturday 7am to 3pm. Sort automobiles that have been received form transporters into designated staging areas so van crews can more efficiently move them into the inspection building for inspection.
good,Good training with a semi flexible schedule. Pay does not compensate very well for the level of work or your previous experience. Raises are minimal and scarce.
good,"worked alone on every shift, berfited a short 5 mins not much team work at all, sad to say but true. post up in a office foro 8 hours watching grounds and cctv."
good,Typical day is to come in and wait for a job.  Sometimes you delver a vehicle and sometimes go in a van and pick up. Sometimes the cars you pick up can be not in good mechanical shape but you can refuse to drive them.
good,"Work place was very unorganized and management wasn't very knowledgeable of their own job. Differences were made between customers and manager. Customers were great to work with, but management wasn't."
good,Nothing really negative to say about the company. It was ok working there. The benefits were pretty good and office people were really good to work with.
good,"Very strict environment and same type of work each week"
good,"ADESA is a good place to work, i learned a lot about cars in that place. management can be better but they do what they can, they just need to learn hot to treat people better, but is fine. my co-workers were the best, they helped me when i needed to and i helped them too. the hardest part of the job was the disorganization they had on that place."
good,good product offering and work environment. Hardest part was breaking dealers of old habits of buying cars.
good,Management is okay at best.
good,Seeking right kind of job that could become a career
good,"At AutoVIN I learned and gained a lot of knowledge in various areas. I've learned to deal with hard and stressful situations, multitask in daily tasks and work independently."
good,The personnel at KAR auction services were an amazing group of people  but when the new manager over the department came in he instantly started getting rid of people who could have taken over his job.
good,Working outside side inspecting vehicles at an auction looking for body damage on vehicles that have come  to be resold. Fast pace and commissioned position.
good,fast paced and stressful.  been in this industry for 25 years and this is typical.  upper management was great. benefits are wonderful.  loved my job and would continue to work at kar in a different sister company.
good,Must be able to multitask on a daily basis. Working late is a usual. A lot of work incentives and employee recognition's. Training is available in every position as well as cross training.
good,If your a looking for a place to not grow in the company then I recommend this job. I worked here for a year and didn't see any growth which is one of the main reasons I left.
good,"It a good place to gain skills and knowledge."
good,"Loved the job at first, but new management changed the focus to numbers above all else.  Frustrating to try to keep up with their constant changes to job requirements. Annoying to read emails from CEO touting profitability while they reduce our reimbursement programs."
good,"Good place to start to learn about auto finance.You can learn the auto dealerships needs and expectations ,how the market can effect the dealers growth."
good,"Great opportunity to meet all different types of people. You are traveling all over the state  so you see different parts that you may not have seen before. You do have to pay for your gas. You run into lender issues and a lot of other warranty companies,  so therefore very important for the company to partner with lenders."
good,"Inspected cars before they go to auction"
good,"I loved working for this company. They are active in adding on more work but not compensating their employees. they are famous for mandatory overtime. I would work 50-60 hour a week and still be far behind, no one to help. Team leads who were lazy. Management too busy to assist as well."
good,"After arriving to dealership I would conduct physical inventory check of onsite collateral, verification of dealer compliance to Manufacturers’ facility or operational standards, collect monies due and report audit results to customers at the conclusion of each audit."
good,"Very simple job, nothing complicated about it. Very hot in the summer and cold in the winter, working outside can be tough."
good,"As cars were delivered to Adesa, they are split up between the reps by their case load. We would check our cases for new arrivals daily. Once they come in we needed to send them to service and have them inspected. If there are any cars that are damaged, we send them up for repairs so they can be ready for the auction which happens weekly."
good,"preparing cars for weekly auction"
good,worked as a field rep for 9 years. Did exactly what any job description for Autovin field rep says; provided audit and inspection services within aftermarket automotive industry.
good,"During my time with the company, my management was always willing to help me when needed. They were also more than willing to work with my on scheduling to allow time to go to school."
good,"Adesa auction has provided me with an excellent opportunity for employment 2 or 3 hours a week, a little extra money and time in a workplace. The culture at Adesa is relaxed and fun, with theme days meant to draw the dealers in. However, I often felt untrained and unsupported. There is no way to know if this is the nature of the clerk job or just poor management at this specific auction, but I believe I could have performed better and enjoyed the job far more with better communication."
good,"The position I had there was multiple of things to remember and to do and I feel like i was been pressured all the time to do things faster my trainer kept making me feel like i was not progressing fast enough.  "
good,I've been with KAR for about 2 years. There has been a bit of turnover where I am. The President of the company seems to be concerned with the employees so that's nice. I feel like the benefits should be better for a company this size but what can you do. Politics play a huge part in where you go in this company.
good,"This place is an okay place to work if you just need supplemental income or a bridge job. The days can be long but the work is fairly easy and you get a lot of breaks which can make the days go by faster. One thing I'd suggest to future employees, keep personal life separate from work life."
good,"Very big disconnect between Corporate and real world operations. Minimal advancement opportunities and real number quotas of the actual number of employees that can ""exceed expectations""."
good,"yegar y checar mi hora de entrada , recibir turno y empesar mi rondin del dia ,checar entrada del personal y vehiculos ,"
good,"Managed and grew Ohio franchised dealerships, independent car dealers, banks and lease companies; activated over 150 accounts. Build and maintain relationships, negotiate prices between buyers and consigners."
good,The Company was not honest when they hired me. I applied for a different job than the one they gave me.
good,"Nice place to work, good culture, decent pay, close to home."
good,"Moved the cars that were driven off of the trucks to parking places. "
good,Work environment was good and friendly. Only tough part was the success of the particular division I worked in. Very difficult place to find the value
good,"Workload often overwhelming but your days passed with flying colors. Great people to work with. If you excel at multitasking and handling stressful situations, this job is for you."
good,It is a good company to work for.  Demands are hiring and sometimes required to do 15+ hours days. Your are compensated well for those extra hours.
good,I got along with everybody Im a hard worker and good benefit. I would show up to work early alot of times.I would help out with customers and employees.
good,"Leadership beats you down, does not recognize accomplishments; but continues to point out what needs to be done."
good,This place has nothing balanced. Literally the definition of to many Indians not enough cheifs. Upstairs sucks and they will fire you for no reason. Benefits are the only nice thing here
good,It was very laid back but it was very unorganized it was when it came to the auction there was always blame place on other who did there job but they also had bad management
good,everything is over the phone and via internet dont be fooled by the pay glad I left
good,"This has not been challenging or a place to get promoted within.  It does not appreciate the level of work we put in and our contributions, I only heard negative feedback barely heard positive feedback.   They have some room to improve!"
good,"Working for KAR has a lot of corporate perks (at least at the corporate location), however there is not a lot of communication regarding performance, job descriptions, etc."
good,"They don""t pressure you, but expect you to carry your weight.Stay out of office politics and mind your business. Anybody can be a target if there is a problem with your manager. You will be talked about whether your friendly or not. Cutthroat individual though."
good,"I've held 3 positions working for this company over the last 9 yrs, The last position was the most challenging and that was a good thing. It always kept me thinking but it also kept me out of the elements. I really liked working for this company as I'm a huge car person. I leaned the in's and outs of the company and picked up some computer skills as well. Co-workers are all cool as they get it when you say too many chiefs and not enough indians or I love the do as I say not as I do attitude. Hardest part of the job is doing one thing for too long. The best part of the job is doing the job and being greatful that you have one. Talking with co-workers about random BS keeps things interesting. Someone off the streets can come in and make the same ammount of money as someone who has been working there for 16+ yrs and when the person says something about it the mgnt says we can only give out 4% or no percent raises this time of year. Then you watc the company dump loads of $$$ into other dumb stuff"
good,"It was a great job, good work environment and fast paced. I set the action cars up on line and drove the auction. it was fun and easy. its an outside job so sometimes it isn't the best job ever, but it is decent."
good,"Support all departments with month end, collections, payable, title transfers, and reconditioning.Perform HR duties to compliance.Reconcile bank accounts and daily cash."
good,Management was Not professional. Double standers for others.Did not get breaks especially on auction days. Stayed late on auction days sometime until 10pm.
good,"A typical day working at Kar was horrible.   It is MANDATORY that you are logged in to your phone all day unless you have special permission otherwise and you have to tally EVERY single thing you do.   I learned how to not get so angry about small things and I became a lot more tolerant of others' actions.  The management was typically nice but they were underhanded and low just like the rest of the company.  There was such a chain of command that you had to follow that it was ridiculous.   First you had to go to your Account Specialist, then Senior Specialist then Senior Account Manager and then Client Team Manager.   If you have a bank on the phone asking to speak with someone who has more authority than you do and then you ask the specific people to take the call and they won't take it from you...What kind of impression is that making on the subordinates?   The hardest part of the job was remembering to tally every single thing you do (every email you send, every phone call you take) and the majority of the people at the job were horrible.  The most enjoyable part was that mostly overtime was an option so if you wanted to come in on Saturday or come in early/stay late then that was always an option.   Also, lunches could be anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour which was nice depending on your day."
good,"Its overall a good place to work. Good location, good building, horrible parking situation, good people, relaxed environment."
good,"HR really corporative and understanding managers.                                                    "
good,"In many ways there has been micromanagement in unnecessary areas and lack of communication and management in others. Great company to work for, but departments need analyzed."
good,"This is a great opportunity for someone looking to supplement their income. It's not anything that you're going to be making a killing off from, but when you figure it's like $20/hour ($100/day for a five hour day), it's not too bad. "
good,"Loved driving the cars. The pay is not the greatest but man, them cars were shore fun to drive. The customers were pretty easy to communicate with too."
good,the staff is great and very productive workplace to be at. very work oriented place. enjoy working there for the last 15 years
good,"Nothing bad to say about KAR. Like most software organizations going through a digital transformation, expect ups and downs on the work-life balance. And expect to constaintly learn"
good,I would spend the day preparing everything for the upcoming sale. From moving cars to scanning them in to the system. I enjoyed being around the cars and learning more about them.
good,It's a great place to work. Management needs to have an active role in the branch and not lock themselves in the office all day. Branch is always busy and sometimes feels it's understaffed.
good,One thing that I am not so fond of is that they tend not to recognize your competencies and align you for the right position that would allow you to be more productive and efficient for both yourself and the company. Some managers will rather go with a favorite for a task or position rather than someone who can see it through and own the process.
good,"Day(s) at KAR - AFC is usually blueprinted to be productive and complete; In touch with dealers, keeping accounts and inventory positive week to week,"
good,It was a good place to work and the people were great. I had to find better opportunities elsewhere in order to advance in the work field. But overall a good experience.
good,"self paced and relaxing environment positive environment with some management and coworkers,professional and healthy work place and great.Fun environment."
good,"IAA in Indianapolis is horrible .The management was horrible in Indiana! They had good check in guys when I was there. But also that was because of me. I had to train anyone who went into the drop. We had to clean cars with blood in it,which is not allowed.  We also had to start wrecked hybrids so rusty could make extra money on them. I got injured due to their negligence. But my employees were fantastic and the pay wasn't bad. We always had to stay over 99% of the time. So as long as you don't mind doing stuff your not supposed to do and hate your family this is the perfect job for you."
good,"freindly, courteous, & helpful co-workers.  good work enviroment.  adequate breaks & lunches.  management is positive."
good,Great employer if you enjoy the automotive industry. Benefits after three months. Competitive salary. Head office is at King and Spadina.
good,Good Team of people - HR is off site and makes it difficult to hire and train staff .....      Small Management team.........................
good,Good Company.Work is steady and pay is fine. Managers are ok
good,"On all 3 sale days, during the week, the days go by really fast that it doesn't seem like a regular work day."
good,i've learned how to clean cars in a fast paced assembly line type style
good,"A typical workday for me is that I always give 100%, where I can help our dealers with whatever they need, when then came into town. I have learned so much about car auctions and different types of cars. The hardest part of any new job is the learning curve after that its a piece of cake. The best part of any job is learning about the company you are working for and helping people."
good,"As an outside employee, the workday would typically start out with employees getting the required gear and then heading to their specific work location. Management is okay for the most part but it could use a little better communication."
good,It has two shifts. First shift is 7:30 to 4 and second shift is 3:30 to 11 u clean cars in different sections and you clean cars boats trucks suv rv motorcycle
good,"the workplace was relaxed and allowed me to set my own hours, I really enjoy vehicles so it was interesting to see so many different kinds."
good,"fun place to work"
good,"It's  good if you are only looking for casual employment. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with. Management   is concerned with employee happiness, but there is very little room for advancement, and there are no medical, dental etc.benefits if working casual."
good,"Never worked a full time job, and it was different. Good or bad is up to you. "
good,Good place to work. Co workers are great. Company has been down sizing. Not a good situation to be in not knowing if you will be the next to be laid off. Over all a good place to work
good,"While coworkers were amicable and friendly, the nature of the work was largely independent, incredibly repetitive, and overall unfulfilling. The independent work largely prohibited the formation of any bond beyond spending 9 hours in the same wing together. Departments across the board experienced fairly low turnover, especially in mid-management, leaving entry-level employees stuck for long periods of time without upper positions available for career growth."
good,"Call on accounts"
good,It is an interesting business and I really enjoy working with the dealers.
good,"I work in the element , the heat, rain , and snow. Which has become tolerable. I do have a great working relationship with my supervisor as well my co-workers. However there is not much room for growth and the pay does not fit the responsibilities I maintain. The hardest part is not being offered more money in the time that I have been there. I have learned that I can succeed at anything , even under strenuous conditions."
good,"Adesa auto action is a very big company that haves differnce auto action in the state. Many differnce dealership go an buy cars,RV,boat,and bikes."
good,Inspecting car is a good job to do. I have to make sure to do a good job with customers cars and make them happy with the job we do. I would eecommend this job.
good,"Just one bad thing ~ SALARY!!! (not paid well)"
good,This a good company to work for that gives decent opportunity for advancement. It is a fun fast paced atmosphere that encourages a positive work environment.
good,"Great leader ship great place to work, great benefits overall great experience."
good,"At KAR (Adesa) it was an extremely hard place to move up in.  Regardless of your skillset, it was a very friendship growth pattern.  There were many unhappy employees, and it created a bad attitude throughout the building."
good,Working for Adesa Vancouver had its ups and downs . I did learn on working on automotive Inspections and mechanical . most enjoyable on the job was some of my co workers . They made the job fun . The bad part was moral on management . They make it harder on the job and did not make it any fun for the outside workers . Management always say the customer always come but there was one person said customers do not come first . The employees do . Take care of your employees and they will take care of your customers .
good,"A typical day involved coming in and getting right to work. Sitting down at my own desk, putting on my headphones and start coding if there were any pending tasks from the day before. Otherwise, we would have a morning meeting and would setup the workload for the day or week."
good,It's a great call center learning experience. They are willing to cross train into other departments if an associate is interested.
good,Good company to work for. Great managment. Highly recommended however salaries are not great but stable.  Very transparent when it comes to any opportunities within the group
good,"The company is progressive for it's market. They stay involved in employee satisfaction and work/life balance. "
good,"KAR is an automotive industry, very fast pace environment, various of job opportunity in different departments.  People are great to work with and great learning experience."
good,I enjoy the freedom this job provides and variety of the various tasks I have to complete on any given day.  Management is aware of the limitations of the job and will adjust your schedule accordingly.  Good Place to work!
good,Learned a lot and enjoyed working there but priorities were not always aligned and politics got in the way of projects being successful. Seems to have figured some of that out since then.
good,"Very independent atmosphere. Never met my boss face to face. Do your work and work at your own pace. Day to day is get a selection of assignments in the morning, and accomplish them throughout the day depending on your area you cover. Typically 6-8 lease returns and or independent dealership inventory audits."
good,"Relatively a large company, which was nice. Learned a lot about vehicle auction process. Pay is a little low, but decent benefits. Little to no opportunity for advancements, however."
good,"I managed all the hardware and software at the Cicero Sites.  This included management of all PCs (WIN7 - upgrade 2014) as well as Phone systems (Nortel/Avaya).  Telecommunications experience daily dealings.  I learned many new network related items, involving installing (solely) Juniper switches, with hardware replacements, as well as Nortel server monitoring and adjustments.  Coding of Servers for printing and faxing and scanning.  The hardest part of the job was the constant buy in from individual end users receiving the support my job entailed directly.  I was very good with this balance though.  I loved the freedom of Learning while on the job.  The people I worked with were excellent.  Management was understanding.  I would work for them again if not already employed and helping/supporting another company."
good,"Locations change daily, the benefits far outweigh the travel involved with employment. The personal perks are very helpful in life and career."
good,"Good work"
good,"My typical day at work includes a lot of customer service and dealing with the customers hands on. What I've learned at ADSEA is collections, to take in payments, floor plan, to be Microsoft proficient."
good,I learned everything I know about procurement from ADESA. The people were great to work with.  Management not so much.
good,"Days were mainly spent answering phone calls and writing emails. I learned a lot about the transportation business, trucking companies, and major experience in customer service. Management was good in terms of the people but direction lacked and things were constantly changing. I enjoyed working for OPENLANE and enjoyed going to work. The worst part of the job was dealing with irate customers or driver but even that was not that bad. Was able to learn how to calm people down without losing my cool."
good,Please see my resume to see everything I did. My job duties varied from day to day.
good,"KAR has good intentions and is on the path to becoming a great company. Unfortunately, they do not have leaders who know how to lead or even motivate. KAR needs fresh perspective and leaders who are willing to challenge AND make decisions. Too many of the current staff don't do this and are stifling the progress of this organization."
good,This is a good company i worked for and developed great relationships that i still keep in touch with until today. One thing i did not really like was not being to really advance within the company.
good,Great environment! Fast paced fair pay. Difficult to advance. Hours are great. Good stock options and 401k. Management is fair but budgets are heavy and difficult to obtain.
good,We drive cars to and from business. We also drive the cars through the car auction. This is a very relax job and is perfect for retirees trying to make a little extra money or something to do.
good,"Fun!! "
good,"A great place to work, with very supportive management, extensive training, and weekends off. A lot of traveling throughout your territory, but you plan your day and follow your plan."
good,Work day is from 8 - 5. Auction day is on Wednesday morning and is a lot of fun to watch the cars being bid on and sold. The rest of the week is spent getting ready for the next sale
good,pretty cool place to work with friendly and family oriented management. had a pretty nice little cafeteria and served steaks quite often. they are a little backwards thinking as far as thc is concerned but other than that not a bad place to set-up a career with the benefit options they offer.
good,Very fast paced aggressive culture. Lots of good ol fashion hard work.  Great coworkers and customers.  Tough to balance home life and work life sometimes.  Very Competitive.
good,"Great benefits, good coworkers, but was just purchased by another company.  Salaries were cut drastically across the board.  Otherwise good company."
good,The only thing that i would have to say bad about this job is that if you are concerned about getting sun burned than this is not the place you want to be. this job requires a lot of hours maintaining vehicles clean and up to standards for auctions and therefore we spend a lot of the day outside in the parking lots and in the sun. working here i definitely left here a couple shades darker than when i first started my job there.
good,"Routinely inspected all points of entry ensuring maximum security, maintained log of visitors and created identification badges. Assisted in conducting fire drills noting any security, safety or fire hazards. Monitored for any irregularities during patrol and prepared incident reports. Provided escort services to guests and employees. Maintain Security Officer Certification and SORA License. Patrolled the facility and served as a general security presence and visible deterrent to crime and rule infractions. Patrolled industrial and commercial premises to prevent and detect signs of intrusion and ensure security of doors, windows and gates."
good,"Very organized place to work.  Good people, location was far for me, but it was worth it.  Hours were okay, I got to work independently."
good,"In 2006 the economy was still doing fairly good, and when people would lease a car it would come up for a lease end inspection which is where I came into the picture. An appointment would be made and I would either go to a home, work or dealership to perform the inspection. This was a highly customer service oriented job, requiring one to be calm and rational when the customer would be loudly concerned with how much some damage or mileage over the agreement would cost. Ultimately, through the guidance of my co-workers and management team I was personally able to avoid any major confrontations. I learned a great deal more about the value of cars which adds to the knowledge I already had as a mechanic helping to round out my experience. The hardest part was seeing that I was as flexible as possible to accommodate the customer, although that became easier as I did the job. The most enjoyable part of my time with the company was using computers and being around so many incredible vehicles, plus meeting some famous and sometimes just nice individuals."
good,I enjoy the time driver old school car from the 1800s and able to visionally see the change in car from then to now. I even learned how to driver a six speed
good,Not respected the resources well enough.   Never felt comfortable about the decision making process.  Internal politics was one of the reason why I felt that way.
good,"A typical day at KAR includes working mostly autonomously.  While I was provided opportunities for leadership training, full leadership roles are difficult to come by.  The company is currently shifting to an Agile framework, which makes it difficult as a non-technical staff person to determine where you fit.  Management has typically been very supportive in my desire to grow.  Workplace culture is currently shifting, however  It used to feel like family, but now feels like ""the machine"".  The most difficult part of the job was having the role understood by other business units.  The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to various site, building relationships with leaders across the company.  I also enjoyed the flexibility with remote work options."
good,"I have been at KAR for 4 years and have seen several team members get promoted with similar credentials and backgrounds but different skin color.  It seems that if you are not white, you have some extra hoops to jump through to get ahead.  Our white counterparts, just need to meet the bare minimum requirements."
good,"A typical day was fast pace, multitasking, problem solving, patient, customer oriented, innovative, quick thinking, task oriented, team building and coaching."
good,Able to work among different teams and get a better understanding of what different departments do that affect your job.
good,"Very small staff, so felt like a family environment. Others in facility would hop in and help to ensure great customer service."
good,"love the people and environment, had no problem doing what i was there for and management was awesome at communicating duties."
good,The company itself is a great place to work and the employee's are great.  The only down side is that they pay below market.
good,Fast paced work environment.  Great co-workers and managers.
good,hardest part of the day was sitting for hr.s with nothing todo
good,"Was cleaning, washing , and driving cars."
good,"Fast pace, lots of people, car auction. Great to meet new people and also to see the same people at the auctions every week."
good,"I worked at Adesa Reno as a driver until July 2019. I left because I became financially burdened due to a family members health. I needed something that paid better in order to handle the mounting bills. "
good,In my role at KAR I am a field inspector and really enjoy it. Just make sure you dont mind driving your own vehicle a lot of miles. Otherwise ok. Just no big pay increase since start otherwise great place to work.
good,"Picked up and delivered cars from various locations. On sale days I worked as a check in clerk, where I would call in the V.I.N. numbers and the make and model of the vehicles."
good,"Calling on current accounts while looking for potential new business. Building relationships, Educating Customers on Current and New Products available to help them build their business.  Working in Outside Sales you create your own schedule, and work at your own pace created your own competition within yourself."
good,"ambiente sano y productivo mucho trabajo y cerca de la casa, muchos beneficio como el seguro medico y el trato del jefe hacia el trabajador es muy bueno"
good,drive stage cars ready for ship out find locate check vin's driving the latest cars and trucks enduring the cold it very fun job if you love driving
good,"I love my job, but there is no possibility to move up which is unfortunate"
good,This is a Great company to work for and people in this company are very helpful not political culture people come to your help when needed.
good,I enjoy my work at Adesa although the working conditions can be challenging.  This comment relates only to the environment in that my job requires I work on the computer in an open garage type facility that gets very cold in the winter.  It is sometimes difficult to work the mouse/keyboard as my hands get extremely cold.
good,A typical day at work is busy and productive.
good,"One of the best companies I have ever worked for. I was upset when I left due to some medical issues I had. If I ever have the chance to be able to work for this company I would love to go back to work for them. They care about their employees, and do a lot for their workers."
good,"I love working with Kar Auction Services, they have treated me very well and I would stay until retirement if i could.  But may need to relocate so that is not an option"
good,Good friendly yet professional culture. Strong sense of belonging to the whole is eveident. Using technology to advance and maintain company business.
good,"Im new to the company. Our company was a merge from Inviso to KARS!! So far so good. No complaints.  I am a fiels Rep so most of my day is filled with inspecting car, gate release and inventory. By the way I love inventory. The one thing i  know I am definitely good at."
good,"Having the opportunity as a Transportation Manager helped me grow not only in this field but as a person as well.  I now have the confidence to always stay on task with my workers and work.  Having this responsibility helped me realize what I am capable of and able to handle many tasks at once without feeling the pressure.    A typical day at work was meeting deadlines, dispatching deliveries and pick up, scheduling, customer service when needed, handling the petty cash and keeping track of it, and managing workers.  The enjoyment of this opportunity comes from the environment itself. The satisfaction of deadlines being met and the staff always being on task with duties."
good,"I truly learned a lot about the Automotive business working here. Wholesale, Retail, Dealers licensing, etc are all great life building characteristics..."
good,Fun bunch of people. Very accomodating with time off requests. There are always people who will not be the best to work anywhere with but overall from yard crew to management they are social & great to work with.
good,"I love working at Adesa. The people there are incredible and there is so much room for upward movement, and they have a great benefits package. I would highly recommend working there."
good,"Great company, love to work there. Friendly staff and helpful leadership. It means a lot to work for a company that cares and KAR definitely does -- when it comes to their employees."
good,"Great place to work. Great friends, fair pay with room for advancement and growth, equality and positive outlooks. The only reason I left was an across the board lay-off"
good,"Our work day used to carry the regular shift with proper refreshment brakes, providing enough opportunities to learn not only work culture but also the life values."
good,"A typically day would be calling for titles and collections, correcting rejected titles, recieving and releasing titles. office manager is great to work for. You actually do more than the job requires."
good,"Excellent management, working hours and team approach."
good,"Fast pace and lots of deadlines, I've learned that word of mouth circulating through out the facility is sometimes a major issue when trying to accomplish tasks due to constantly having to address rumors. Management at Adesa, in most cases, is cover your butt at all times which sometime creates an atmosphere of not helping other departments in fear of being pulled into issues that are present in that department. Like any place there are great people working there and not so great people, that being the case dealing with all of the different personalities is the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part is the support and flexibility that you get from upper management the accomplish your common goals."
good,"Datascan is a wonderful company to work for. They provide great benefits and endorse family values. I travel to car dealerships and perform a collateral audit for multiple banks. I work out of my home and use a computer to download my audit each morning. I get to work with other auditors from time to time on larger dealerships and someone will be the lead auditor, but we all rotate the role. The hardest part would be working outside in all weather types while checking the vin on all of the cars. The most enjoyable thing is the freedom to work independently."
good,"Working for KAR Auction Services as a field representative is a truly unique opportunity. However, there is little to no opportunity for advancement and pay increases."
good,"It is definitely a fast paced and ever changing place to work. There are many different departments to work in and wonderful, caring people to work with and learn from."
good,"Work is a juggling act. "
good,"Driving all kinds of motor vehicles in the lot. "
good,"The CEO is absolutely amazing!  The culture is great! They actually have ""FUN"" as one of their mission statements."
good,"It's exciting to be part of a company that is delivering winning solutions to customers and growing like crazy. People are encouraged to innovate and we steadily adopt new technologies that help us move faster and improve the experience of those using our solutions. The company is willing to invest in new technologies where it makes sense.The work is fast paced combined with a high level of attention to detail."
good,Co-workers was awesome. Management was great.  I loved my job until we were all laid off at the same time.
good,"We were laid off in March with 200 others it just absolutely sucked BIG TIME bc our team loved working with cars and our boss was cool. My only complaint was simple...I am no longer there. And we wanted to stay with the company. And now I smoke pot a lot every day  and zone out  to forget about everything . Forget about sobriety. Lost my job and I learned how to sell and profit more than a half a million dollars from being high all day since April."
good,"I am having a great experience at Adesa. I love all the people I work with and the fast paced, detailed environment. It can be stressful with all the multi tasking but it is fun."
good,"Good benefits, competitive pay, and managers who actually want you to succeed. They have programs in place to help with career development and managers seem to take pleasure in seeing their people advance in the company."
good,"It's a great and easy job. The only thing that bothers me is the pay, I can barely pay bills because of the hours we are required to work, but overall the people are fun to work with."
good,"Positive and goal oriented work environment. The Company encourages growth for all team members of all levels. Daily task were to address client concerns and provide resolutions. We communicated with Auctions, Recovery Agents, Transporters, and our clients all across the nation. Everyone has a task to complete on a daily basis, and teams work together to ensure we are exceeding our clients expectations."
good,"Overall good place to work."
good,"KAR (AFC) was a great place to work. The pay was great, but the management was very inconsistent. The training program needs a lot of work, and HR is very slow to respond to needs."
good,Although I enjoy very much working for KAR  and is a great company I am looking for new opportunities and to be located in the Hamilton county vicinity.
good,"Estar bien con los compañeros a si se trabaja mejor,aprendi de todo,con los compañeros bien,"
good,An ever changing company with long term growth expectations. Multiple weekly auctions leave zero time for boredom. Upper management positions tend to be short term depending on the current market status. Competitive and exciting would be the best descriptive terms for this company.
good,"No todos los días hacíamos lo mismo: un día te tocaba hacer trabajo de oficina (papeleos, llamadas telefónicas para organizar algún evento...), y otros te ibas a la Oficina de Turismo a atender a los turístas. Era un trabajo dinámico, nunca sabías dónde te iba a tocar estar hasta que llegabas a trabajar y repartían las tareas."
good,"This is a great company to work for as far as benefits and paid time off. Compensation could be better, but its often overlooked because of the great benefits."
good,West Virginia is a tough market for any types of sales. Low population and not the best economic climate for sales. Workplace culture was good. Most people buying vehicles did not have enough money to purchase ancillary products.
good,Excellent company to work where they truly care about their employees.  You will never get lost in the shuffle and you are treated like family.  Superb training with opportunity for advancement
good,Fun job as a driver if you like cars and driving.  Great co-workers that are friendly and helpful.  Great flexibility for retirees.  Good positive attitude by management and workers.
good,"Very good company to work for. Management looks out for employees. General Manager was very friendly and open. Fun, fast paced environment that offered a position that makes you feel good about what you do."
good,"Good company, with good work culture."
good,"Responds to inquries recieved through phone, answering calls and filling out consumers applications in a office and call center environment. The hardest part was assisting unrudley consumers. The most enjoyable part was making the consumer happy."
good,I learned about the auto auction business and its many complexities. The working conditions were something to be desired but I persevered.
good,"thsi company is amazing; their take on work life balance and opprotunities on educating their employees is overwhelming"
good,"great place of employment, friendly co workers, fast paced job"
good,"Openlane was a great place to work with alot of opportunity for advancement within the company. The company was purchased by ADESA right before i left and there were already alot of changes happening. Healthcare was great before the new ownership, company was great, and you couldnt have had better management before the purchase of the company"
good,"Excellent VP of Internal Audit.  Strong teamwork and comraderie. Opportunity to grow through experience and professional education. "
good,Work here the job was enjoyable worked with and met people from all walks to life from salesmen to car carrier driver.  This made the job very interesting.  Learned quite a bit about the car industry and finance.
good,"I enjoyed my time here, I feel like I was really able to polish my skills and increase my value as an employee. The people are great and the technology is outstanding."
good,"Only left because I had to move out of state for family. Very difficult decision considering the family atmosphere I had at work. 25 years in Automotive and I can honestly say that ADESA Las Vegas is the only place that I looked forward to getting up and going to work Mon-Fri. Management knows the true meaning of work life balance and you can leave work at work and enjoy your life outside of work. Yes, it's high paced but it is actually a fun high pace. Upper management and the management team are customer focused but you are the main priority. Do the job, ask for help when needed and perform how you want to be performed."
good,a lovely place to work & meet new people great opportunity to expand. What I enjoy most is meeting new people and being able to see the newest vehicles.
good,"Not a difficult job, but attention to detail is needed. Working with other vehicle companies to ensure lease end inspections are scheduled. Scheduling and using logistics to set up transport for vehicles."
good,excellent culture and management.  IT is constantly being challenged and supported to excel.
good,Good company going thru growing pains. Good training for right employee.
good,"interesting business; great atmosphere on sale day."
good,KAR Auction Services is the best company I've ever worked for. I've been here almost 5 years and currently in a supervisory position. KAR offers plenty of training and career coaching. They always work to promote from within.
good,"Excellent Company to work for.  Great chance for advancement.  The Company provides excellent training in a great atmosphere.  I learned a great deal about sales, customer service, and setting and reaching goals."
good,"Adesa Lexington has some of the best people I have ever worked with.  While the job could be fast-paced and somewhat stressful at times (especially the day of the auctions), it was a really fun place to work and everyone helped each other.  If not for the need to be more available for an ailing family member, I would still be there."
good,"The Controllers I worked under in the San Antonio location gave me opportunities to learn and grow as an accountant."
good,A great and rewarding place to work. A bit fast pace and heavy work load but enjoyable. Was able to work while listening to audiobooks and music. Would recommend this company highly.
good,"work days are busy, but also very relaxed at some moments, I've learned a great deal about the leasing program, and a lot of pros and cons to leasing a vehicle. Management is very supportive, and always provides feedback to employees, and keeps us updated on all company policies. Sometimes the workload may seem like a lot, but we get through it as a team. I love being a part of KAR."
good,"Great to work here, managers do not micro manage and allow you to complete your work in a stress free environment. Benefits are pretty good and opportunity for advancement is great."
good,Its a great place to work at. Good benefits and personnel. The company also likes showing appreciation towards their employees.
good,"This company runs like a well-oiled machine. The staff are all happy and mainly long-term, management teams are well trained and knowledgeable about people practices. Everyone employed there knows their job and does it well, and with a positive attitude! This is an auto auction and the energy is high on Sale Days, it is exciting for everyone there. Best Employer Award."
good,Fun and energetic work environment; Fantastic management and customers; fast paced on auction days but relaxed and steady busy the other days; great coworkers
good,Management at this company is very good. They work with you if you have issues and give you an opportunity to move up the ladder in the company. I think the management at this company is excellent
good,"Nice place to work, free gym, nice break room food, nice parking, ping pong table in break room, brand new work area, new chairs to sit in, great lighting"
good,"My day's at the auction consisted of always going the extra mile to keep our customers happy. Meeting new customers was almost a weelky thing that kept the work load big and days go faster. "
good,Loved working in this fast paced environment. The management team was great. Love walking clients through different parts of our website. Was a very fulfilling job.
good,"Check emails and cell phone for daily schedule in the morning."
good,"Fine place to work, great culture, good management, great benefits. Company truly cares about its employees, has aggressive advancement potential. Extensive travel"
good,"Even on its worst days, like sale day when you have a bunch to do, its still the best. Management focuses on team players. Everyone has a job , and everyones job is important. In the summer, they provide water and in the winter they provide hand and feet warmers. Being in anywhere where you are working with the cars your exposed to the elements. Its easy , a little too easy. You rank up based on performance and you get raises as you rank up. As long as you show up and do your job , youll have no issues."
good,"Great opportunities to grow within the company, great managers that collaborate with each other and different departments. The hardest part of the job is being able to stay focused due to the fast pace."
good,"It is a great place if you want to get in shape, you will be walking all day, bending some and stretching some as well."
good,i loved helping customer with any question or concerns they had. It was always fun on auction days! We had customer all over the place and we got very busy
good,The management was amazing and probably my favorite part of this company.  Lots of opportunity for advancement and very family friendly.  Participating in the auction was very fun and challenging at the same time.
good,Some of the people you work with are good others have problems getting along with other people. Some employees even say the place is racist against black people and white people. The only way to move up in the company is if you know somebody and you kiss up.
good,I have worked part time at Adesa for almost 4 years since retiring from the City of Calgary and can honestly say I have really enjoyed it. All the people are great from supervisors to co-workers and the work environment makes it enjoyable to come in to each day. The only reason I’m looking for another job is recently there has been a slow down and I find I’m not getting enough hours.
good,"amazing place of business. meeting a lot of new people, learning experience about cars. Very fun and welcoming environment, learning experience. The hardest part of the job would be to keep up with the pace of things."
good,"Office staff and yard staff all great people, teamwork at its best ....  they all make you very welcome, thorough on the job training ... great online / ongoing training too 👍"
good,the immediate supervisors actually care about the employees and the vehicles on the lot its very fast paced and a very fun environment to be in i enjoyed getting up every day and going to work the old downside is the summer heat in arizona.

good,"Was taught how to operate transportation for ADESA KAR Auctions,"
good,I worked at Adesa Houston for about 2 years before being offered a job closer to home for better pay.  Its a great place to work and have nothing bad to say about it.
good,The workplace was very laid back but at the same time fast- paced. I always had something to do. I was able to learn a lot more about how the auctions worked.
good,I enjoy working ther. Adesa helps everyone to  achieve  there goals.  Making sure that you’re safe with all the car moment.  The management is very plainly and carrying .
good,Kar is best place where you will have work life balance. I grew as an Architect here by integrating with different systems. It is also very fun place to work and they have a friendly environment.
good,I enjoyed my job here very much I liked the freedom I had.  I liked having many different task to do everyday. I like the way I was allowed to make my own ways to do my job.
good,"I loved it, close to home. Had to leave because of problems with a VA doctor, throughout ADESA treated me completely fair and square. Like most jobs at times it got to be quite crazy but it was fun. I love driving and if I can get back I would in a heartbeat whether it be full or part time."
good,adesa is a relaxed work place that's fast paced and at times fun. summer time its hot outside and can be inside and winter its the opposite but they have bay warmers and in winter time sometimes you can have a little fun with a little snowball fight in the bays.
good,"great company, good people, good management, good hours, interesting work, great customers, the hardest part of the job is the communication between employees, there is a lot of paperwork and things tend to get lost"
good,"Enjoyed every day I went to work.  Great company to work for and took good care of all their employees.  I only retired because all of my family lives in Texas and I had been located in Framingham, Massachusetts for 25 years and wanted to come back home to Texas to be with my family."
good,This is an awesome company to work for. I have no complaints other then I wish they had different hours of operation. This is a well rounded company and is an awesome career choice.
good,"There is nothing I enjoy more than working on cars.  If you are a ""car guy"", this place will be a piece of cake for you, although great power comes with great responsibility."
good,"I worked for OPENLANE/CarsArrive.  The environment, staff, managment was outstanding.  It was a place where management really took the time to know about its staff. It was fun, yet a sense of accountability. I enjoyed the quarterly business updates provided by the executive stafff."
good,"It was a good working environment. I enjoyed working I would still work there if I had not moved state. It was not hard working there at all. My co-coworkers were great, very helpful. I enjoyed that I was able to work and have fun doing so."
good,"Very fast paced work environment. "
good,"Productive and fun workplace."
good,Not to much calls coming thou but you will be doing a lot of outbound calling.the pay was great.
good,"I delivered cars and picked them up."
good,I wish I could have stayed longer. Management had great people skills and brought out the best in thier employees. The job atmosphere was so comfortable that at times it felt as though I was'nt even working.
good,"Very high caliber management as well as colleagues.  Company provided great benefits, competitive pay and annual performance bonus."
good,"fast paced job always something to do"
