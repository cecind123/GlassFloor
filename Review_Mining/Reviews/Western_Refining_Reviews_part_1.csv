rating,review
bad,Not an employee focused company at all. Like every business high value placed on making a profit but employees are consistently under valued. What a shame.
bad,"If you care about your family, stay away from this company. They will work you and use your skills to their advantage.  Do not expect a raise. The management team is a joke."
bad,This place has been taken to court and has been found to violate over one hundred labor laws and you would think they learned from it . They want you to sit around for free while waiting for a load they always look for reason to try and write you up and management  does not take any accountability
bad,Its a very hostile work enviroment. My manager screams in my face on a daily basis. The schedules arent consistent and you hardly get a day off. Employees aren't forced to show up on time
bad,have to have a fast work paced have a friendly customer services greet every customers that walks into the store also have to do your stock keep the store clean also the keep the gas pump area clean
bad,You dont recommend convenient stores as a career choice.  Who wants to deal with everyone else's bad day?  This was a temporary job while I was in school.
bad,"day to day functions of the job are fun but dealing with corporate is the hardest part of the job, corporate can make you feel that you are worth nothing, no advancement based on what you know but who you know, I've learned to just not say anything when it comes to higher managers out of fear of being fired"
bad,Constant general managers being changed. One person tells you you're doing a great job and another comes in and saysits horrible. The pay is not worth the stress you get there.
bad,"Come in at 8 AM; Pull all tickets and intanks, code each ticket ; internal movement or sell/purchase. Some tickets took priority over other such as the DFAS they had some governmental steps they were processed first. Scan coded tickets to Inventory then start pricing sale tickts. When completed turn over to management for approval prior to entering into system. If approved I would enter into system then take to my Billing Analyst and she would bill the ticket for me. You know alll about the separation of duties, LOL. Then pull tickets for other system and start pricing them, some days there could be 5 others 11 hard to get an exact number on them. Repeat process as for above tickets. Pull report to enter for Marketing to do there forcasting from, again turn over to a different supervisor for verification. Tuesday was meeting day (3) and log completion and print out. When my analyst was done billing I would go by her desk every day and pick up the billed tickets to file in my monthly folder. So when Inventory came looking for a ticket, I would have it handy."
bad,"Terrible Management and dangerous work environment, there is usually only one cashier at a time I am a female and was left working the evenings  and night alone while the manager scheduled himself along with assistant manager, cashier and maintenance in the morning. Even after several occasions homeless and drug addicts came in to steal and harassing me. Even after police reports. Nothing was done."
bad,"Maintenance is the worst treated in the company. Manager doesn't take care of southern crew. Driving trucks that are unsafe. Pay scale is messed up, very low wages."
bad,"You will be on elimination mode, fail a customer service, secret shopper and you are done. Upper management give tantrums and is well know for that. there is favoritism to get promoted. In the end its all about the profits for the investors."
bad,"the maneger  the transportation needs to take classes how to treat the employee ,the company may not know what happiness in transportation ,every week that you work you steal money unfairly"
bad,"I do not  feel this company is about anything but corporate politics.  "
bad,"I worked for Western Refining for 5 years, from day one it was the most stressful job I ever had, nobody stayed for more than a month it seemed like, I saw people get fired for the dumbest reasons imaginable, (i.e. a 12 year employee was fired for accidentally giving a refill to someone they thought was an employee [which the policy states is fine] only to later be fired because that person had been fired a few days before, which this employee had no way of knowing)"
bad,"would not recommend anyone for this company, they seem to have a buddy system in place. I learned a lot from the field foreman and the other crafts men."
bad,Theses stores need new store managers. They treated there employees unfairly. I would rather be jobless them to work for that company again. Unless your a kiss  butt to the store manager or to the assistant manager your not going to be treated fairly.
bad,This company you work alone for some hours and bad things can and did happen.
bad,I provided a courteous and understanding customer service.  I abided by up holding my NM Liquor License and Food Handler Permit Card. I utilized cash register and credit card machine for purchases of food and material items. I restocked items and food on shelves and the cooler.
bad,District Managers are biased.  This employer is a great place for individuals that have no desire for advancement.  Company does not stand behind their employees.
bad,come in and do my work mostly get a call from manager about mistakes on till reports and be told that if it keeps happening I would be fired that was almost an every day thing .
bad,"Horrible management, HR was a joke, favoritism, nepotism, all the above, pay was good and benefits were great other than that Western Refining needs to be investigated for there nepotism and favortism"
bad,"cashier while keeping the station clean and sanitary. while not busy clean sweep and de-ice outside lot. cashier everything from lottery tickets, to money orders and phone cards, to regular purchases."
bad,"The management team is uninspiring and in fact insulting.  Most co-workers were wonderful, however, expressed unhappiness with their jobs but had been there through many acquisitions and changes."
bad,"Poor middle management, Bad hostile working conditions, wasn't ALWAYS THAT WAY JUST THE LAST 6 TO 7 YEARS.  I worked there for almost 20 years and was only making 12.00 an hour."
bad,"Great company to work for. Enjoyed the great benefits, company was sold and new owners are Tesoro. Great work environment, donated to many local charities,"
bad,"Working at Giant was well a mixed bag. I loved my coworkers and bosses, but the hours were horrible they shift around one week to the next. The pay was way too low, and there were times that we would be yelled at for following company policy."
good,Was a good place to work. I enjoyed meeting a lot of new people. I had fun doing my job duties. Communication was on point with the first manager that i had started under.
good,I answered the phones in a call center setting to take orders for fuel and lubricants. I then input the orders into the computer for the warehouse to prepare. I also assisted in special probe accounts. I learned how to take muliple phone calls and get through them quickly. I did not work with management very closely. The co-workers I had had been employed there for long periods of time and did not a like a new comer that could answer more calls then them in a day so this was difficult. The hardest part of the job was that it could be very boring with no challenges.
good,"Western Refining was not all terrible, until we got a new manager, and a new DM. The hours got harder to work with, the employees were great, but management is always in the office and never around to help the front even if we get really busy."
good,"its an ok place for short term but don't stay longer then needed."
good,"The management in the Firebird department does not support its employees but allows other staff from different department dictate what the Firebird staff is and is not allowed to do. If these rules are broken, staff will then be written up. "
good,Work 8 months straight with no time off. I had to quit my job to get some time off. My manager was a first time manager not sure if he had any supervisor experience at all.
good,Would not return to work for this company .My hard work to be a good driver was not appreciated. But I guess I can't judge people that don't know me as a person.
good,"We have a very friendly work environment, everyone cares for everyone like a family. The manager does their best to work with you when it comes to needing time off."
good,"Western Refining is a great company. The benefits are some of the best you'll find. Pay is good for most job positions. There is room for advancement if you have a degree. "
good,"A great job with a big glitch.  Management continually state they are there to help employees succeed, but when told of roadblocks, nothing is done.  A large percentage of people hired as fuel delivery drivers are fired.  Beware."
good,It is a face paced environment where I learned to manage a team to meet our daily tasks. Hardest part of the job is being put down by your manager on a daily basis.
good,"While working for Giant I worked with many great people and met a great many more in various fields of work. The work can be physically demanding but overall it was enjoyable. The customers were enjoyable to met and build a regular customer base, that moved with me from store to store depending on which store i worked at."
good,typical day would be about customer service and assigning tasks to employees as per their strengths to ensure timeliness and over satisfaction of job performance.
good,There is always something to get accomplished and the timing is short. The management team is supportive of the efforts of each employee. The hardest part of the job was getting buy in on directions for priorities of work flow as everyone needed their part completed first. The enjoyable part of the job was some of the employees and how they make you feel.
good,good place to start company is adaminte that it want to mostly promote or hire its own employees for higher level positions from within but i was only there temporaily
good,Come in do counting get on register start cleaning.The store went from being a team workplace to everyone wanting to do their own stuff and not help their co-worker. Management was not the bust of teaching. Most of the time you had to learn on your own and if it was wrong you got in trouble.I was happy when my shift was over.
good,Awesome store manager. very poor district manager. Overall the job is very fast paced. Loved my job very much until wrongfully terminated. (in my opinion)
good,"Minimum wage, flexible hours, good co-workers, understanding managers. Easy to learn system. they pay for your tabc and food handlers. Repetitive schedule."
good,"Typical night was full of alcohol sales and cleaning."
good,"Company offers great benefits. Required to get work completed with little support from other team members or management."
good,"Decent if your looking for easy tasks, my management was more involved  than other jobs, DM was good, work atmosphere was good until a company reset happened"
good,Selling alcohol to people does come with a lot of responsibilities. There is stress involved constantly when you have to decide if a person is inebriated.
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful. The shift before mine would never do the duties assigned to them, so my shift would have to do them. I learned that I could never rely on my co-workers and that if something needed to be done, I would have to do it myself. Management wasn't the best, they didn't treat the employees with respect and would just sit in the office playing on their phones during the whole shift. The workplace culture was very unorganized and messy. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with the management and having to do twice the workload because of the previous shift. The most enjoyable part would have to be getting to meet new people and getting to talk with all my customers."
good,"Same thing, everyday so if that is what you are looking for give it a shot. They have a bad rep of once you quit you can never work there again. If it is a store that sells alcohol you will have to attend a 6 hour class."
good,I worked at giant specifically for western refining and got along great with my co-workers and managers i only worked nights so i cant really say how the customers are.
good,"Working at a gas station is not fun. If you are ever in one and see the clerk without enthusiasm, it is because of the way it is run and the rude customers they deal with."
good,"pay could be higher, the management could higher new employees rather than family members. other than that its a fun job to do temporarily rather for a decade or more."
good,"Long hours and not very good pay it wasn't the best environment to work in, especially in a town with a lot of crimes. They would always have me come in because everyone kept quitting. The turnover rate was high. They would rather call in other employer then have the manager or assistant manager work"
good,"Working for this company has been a great opportunity, as my first corporate job I have seen how it is to work in the oil field and how unpredictable it could be."
good,"Work as a sales associate at one of their convenience stores is simple and straight forward doing sales of items, stocking and store cleaning pretty basic stuff. They also expect you to do various miscellaneous stuff not normally associated to a clerk such as basic maintenance of equipment if possible, yard work such as weed removal, power washing of lot, painting of parking lot lines and basically anything you can physically do related to the store and its appearance as if to save on hiring specialists. Schedules are not set and vary per week which may result in inconsistent hours and work days so makes scheduling stuff outside work hard and problematic without advance notice. Initial hiring for shift seems to heavily influence chance of advancement when comparing a morning worker to a graveyard worker with a morning having better opportunities. Graveyard shift is also highly desirable, but no incentive pay wise or so are given compared to other day time shifts."
good,answered as many inbound calls as possible regarding billing questions and account upgrades.  the schedule was great and lots of overtime was available.
good,great team work but the attitude of manager was horrible . the supervisor was awesome and always willing to help with customers and problems that might have occurred.
good,"I arrived at work at 5:30am and I reviewed the graveyard shift's work and then I began the paperwork for the day before. After all the paperwork was complete, I went to the bank to make the deposit. Returning from the bank, I caught up on all data entry that was required by the company. I trained my employees to accept merchandise from the vendors and overlooked the work of the cashiers. Throughout the week I kept up with the appearance of the store and the inventory. I was also in charge of hiring and firing of all my store employees."
good,Working for Western Refining was a fun and exciting place to work. Meeting all the new and different people made going to work absolutely fun and exciting.
good,"Work in itself as stocking, customer service, and inventory work is great. Therefore, on the other hand, Management in the company can use some improvement on many levels. Co-workers are great and easy to get along with. Every employee is very upbeat and does great on checking identification for age restricted products."
good,Just a Place to work. The Customers were the Highlight. Scheduling did not allow much time to do grocery/cigarette orders or stocking due to customer volume. Hard to perform duties when large quantity of customers are always in the store.
good,"Great weekly pay, swift/fast-paced environment. Poor management skills, poor employer-employee confidentiality, poor leadership-management skills.Night shift is the hardest shift to work due to overlooked accomplishments and great expectations. Workplace culture is diverse. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customer-employee relationships, monthly rewards for candy upselling, and the exercise (based on how hard you are willing to work each shift.)"
good,"Basic job. The pay doesn't equal the workload. It's dangerous to work at gas stations. Most times security is not available. If you chose to defend yourself, you may be fire."
good,"It is a small to medium sizes company with a lot of management at the top. The culture is very intimidating and the ability to move up in the company was difficult. "
good,Customers are wonderful. However no room to advance. They are willing to hire but not promote nor give raises. The politics of are not equal at all. Great place for young adults. Fun fast pace place
good,"The job is fun, fast pace, and you get to know alot of important guest. I use to love this job but the upper part of the corparation switched hands.it did not change for the better"
good,It was  a good place to work but the new District manager was hard to work for. The hardest part of my job was dealing whit the district manager. I enjoy working with customers.
good,"Love the coworkers were awesome "
good,"Cheveron is a decent place to work. The tasks are easy and you're productive the majority of the time. Though dealing with the alcoholic  customers can be quite a challenge. regardless working for this company has taught me quite a bit in the last year and a half. Such operating a cash register and money management, over all cheveron isn't a terrible place to work."
good,Expect alot from employees corporate will back the managers 100% no matter what typical day is any day at work work hard and you will advance of not managers will complain
good,"Busy day starting at 5am. Daily paperwork, checked in venders, reconciled prior business day, balanced invoices, responded to corporate emails, ordering using build-to books, daily inventory, highest level given for customer service, employee management, etc. etc., etc."
good,"I absolutely enjoy working at GIANT. Even the most stressful days are quite joyous. I excel at face-to-face interaction with clients, vendors and fellow co-workers. Management and supervisory staff are understanding and accommodating; not to mention overall good people."
good,Western refining was i think the best job i could have for one reason we worked grave yards so basically the only thing we did was restock the store clean and help the very lil people who did come in. there was no night supervisor only two workers so we were in charge of each other and making sure there was a 50 / 50 partnership thatwe had to maintain in order to get everything done.
good,Managment never answers their phones during emergency. Employees did what they wanted and never got in trouble as long as they were friends with the managers. Manager was quick to find reasons to fire people if they didn't like the person.
good,"It was an okay job. When I was hired was promised a promotion when it became avaialble, however that never happened. Had great coworkers who helped me grow and taught me many things."
good,well run operation filled with many knowledgeable people.  Interesting work environment with new things to learn every day. Working hours a bit unusual but not onerous hours.
good,Exceptional company. close to home. disapprove of cutting hair for drug screen. unnecessary! 2 fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch.
good,"I was only at this job for a very short time but I LOVED it.  The customers were amazing, my co workers were incredible, and the management was always will to help out and assist where needed."
good,"it was a fun job, free fountain refills n coffee, i enjoyed meeting new people such as Travelers and Fellow Employees, the Hardest part was keeping up with the fast pace work flow of constant customers"
good,"It's fairly high stress and not a lot of work/life balance, but the pay is good and the management staff is supportive. 12 hour work days (especially nights, where you work pretty much alone) can drag by unless something comes up, then you are hit by the high stress of trying to keep everything moving."
good,"It was a good place to work , I was able to meet different people do to it being located in a tourist town . medical benefits was good , pay was fair for the time and place"
good,"Team atmosphere, supportive and enriching. Challenging and always demanding. Sense of ownership and pride. Great team that worked well with one another and encouraged each others advancements."
good,Great work and customer interaction. Low compensation but good hours. Ability for home life and set schedules.
good,Western Refining was an amazing place to work out. Most of the people are incredible and truly wish to see everyone succeed. A definite team sense. I was sorry to see them sold and my position be moved to another state.
good,I liked this job because you constantly had something to be doing and you can continually learn new things just about every day. There was always something that came up that needed attention and solving.
good,Western Refining/ Giant is an awesome place to work. You have a great chance to progress and walk up the ladder to success. Employee's are trained well and are extremely polite.
good,"I loved this job, loved the people i came in contact every day, but in the end it came down to management. Poor management, i was there for over a year and went thru 3 managers and 2 assistant managers."
good,Warehouse Manager is a great guy to work for. Benefits and compensation are above average. Not a whole lot of room for advancement due to economical times in Oil and gas industry.
good,"The job was amazing. You got to meet so many different customers and the management was perfect. I worked as an assistant manager and I loved my time there. After my transfer to the High Desert I lost my job within 2 weeks due to ""different policies"" even though I was still working for the same company. I basically lost my job over a misunderstanding. When I plead my case to HR and provided evidence of their mistake I was told that I was ""non rehireable"". Very unfair system when it comes to mistakes. I had never been written up, never missed a day of work, and was praised by my colleagues. Watch your back here."
good,"Fast paced. Dispatch is complicated. Lots of safety rules. Not much privacy at work. Pay is what you make of it. More work you do, the more pay you get."
good,"The environment seemed to favor men and valued them as the good ole boys club that takes care of their own.  As a woman, I felt passed over and ignored."
good,"Duties varied from daily filing, billing, research outstanding invoices and complete monthly close out for billing. I worked with other personnel to research and closeout outstanding invoices. "
good,Busy but comfortable workplace with lots of locals can be fast pace at times of the day but calms down at night most people are friendly and make the day pleasant
good,"Working at burger king was a busy place. Knowing that it is on the route to monument valley, you have five to ten tour buses each day stopping by, which also made time go by faster."
good,"no comment-unworkable conditions, supervisor goes against all corporate-state-federal laws"
good,"Met a lot of new people, and got to smile all the time! Loved this job!!"
good,"I really loved working at Western Refining in Aztec, everyone worked as a team and supported each other in a way that most companies do not. The team leaders were a part of the team and not just segregated as management."
good,"I enjoyed working at this place, I worked graveyard, so that I could go to college during the day. I worked there for a little over a year. I stocked the fridges every night, cleaned the whole store, and took care of the customers that came into the store."
good,The store location of where I was working for Giant was a busy store there was never a moment to sit down and that's the reason I liked working there there was always something to do and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers.
good,Most requested days off will be approved and Management insures your work schedule does not interrupt other life responsibilities. Hourly wage could be better due to the amount of traffic the store sees and the amount of given responsibilities.
good,"Western was a great place to work.  It was unfortunate that many of the employees lost their positions when Western was acquired by Tesoro, out of San Antonio, but that is big business, the new owners had to do what was necessary to make and keep the company valuable and profitable.  I'll definitely miss working there."
good,"Good place to work for although corporate only focuses on the bad things. There's chance for advancement, you are provided with proper training most of the time"
good,did not know this was a contracted location. would have been nice to know that before accepting the job. Manger was great. Steve would always go out of his way to help.
good,"This company loves greasy, gun slingin, animal shootin, dip spittin, good ol boys...oil anyone? Management has favorites and it's super obvious, because the favorites are sub par employees. Few opportunities to advance and if a position does come available, they'll most likely hire outside the company. The healthcare is awesome and cheap, the bonus structure is sweet and the 401k match is unlike any other, pay is average."
good,"I worked at night and was able to unpack and shelf all the merchandise. I learned customer service skills and the ability to use a cash register. Management would attend to the details of the buisness, as my coworker and I would handle the customers and the inventory shelfing. The hardest part of the job was the morning shift change, to make sure the all the stock has been completely shelved and completed. The enjoyable part was that we always completed the stocking on time and with great accuracy."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I've known the manager for many years and was happy to have worked for her. I was the graveyard shifts cashier in the neighborhood I grew up."
good,"I began my career at Western Refining as an summer intern. After my internship was over, I was offered a full time position and gladly accepted. Western regularly promoted from within and I would recommend working there to anyone."
good,this is a very good place to work before they were inquired by Tesoro. This is a good group of AP analyst that knows how to do their jobs and does a very good job at it. Have weekly meetings with my team to look over all invoices that are not paid and see if anyone needs my assistance. Good work balance.
good,I can't say much i worked there for only two months. what i can say is it is a close fit family and support is given when you need it. Incidents are dealt with in a timely manner and there are support networks for extreme cases which happen from time to time in the convenience store setting.
good,"WNR was a high energy, fast paced work environment. Needed to be on top of your game because anything could happen at any given time of the day. At least twice a week lunch was provided for us."
good,"Western Refining was great. The company trusted its employees and did not micromanage. This was possible due to hiring great people."
good,it was alright can't complain.. liked the job just was not able to advance as much as I'd like. the manger sucked hours were good I enjoyed my job working here
good,"I have been here in overnights for over a year. I wanted to transfer to another store in a near by area, and everyone was very helpful in getting this done, So I was able to relocate."
good,"Enjoyable place to work. "
good,"Talk to my vendors about their invoices so I may pay the, getting reading for my check run on Wednesdays. All my my co- workers worked as a team and help each other at close of the month."
good,Great job to work with people and ensure that customer's needs are met.
good,Typical day at work very busy the way i like it. What I learned the installation of fire system reading blue print and more. Management real good to work for had no problems. Co-workers real good people all around great team work could not ask for better.The most enjoyable part of the job the experience and traveling out town.
good,"A job filled with customer service, around the clock work. I personally worked all shifts at one time or another. I started as a sales associate and worked my way up to asst manager.  In training for management I learned so much, went to training classes. I actually had some personal growth with-in this training. It helped me in ways that I did not recognize at the time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied customers. I had to make them happy them all I could, so they would return ,most customers did. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting appreciated, knowing that I made a real difference in my job, and the customers as well."
good,"Western Refining is an excellent company to work for.  As a large corporation, they offer excellent opportunities for advancement and generally recruit from within.  I started working there straight out of college and it was a great experience."
good,"Focus was on the customers, gotta be a hard worker and quick learner. Benefits are great. I enjoyed working with coworkers and my manager."
good,"I was hired not long after I started the interview, and after working there for a few months I came to be more open and communicative. My co-workers and bosses were helpful and work-oriented. Training was consistent, as well as the work to be done. There were few lulls, due to the location being by a highway. I did enjoy working there, and the manager there was consistent."
good,"Consistent work environment amongst stores, easy to work with management staff. Easy advancement and consistent leadership, corporate culture is very conducive to a work-life balance."
good,"typical work day- 12-13hrs dispatch changing workflow every hour pre-trip truck and go load your truck for my first stop. safety was the main key, loved my co-workers they could always make me laugh. the most enjoyable was the pay and good equipment."
good,"Fast paced. Learned about different personalities. Able to juggle multiple tasks. Got along very well with internal and external customers. I enjoyed troubleshooting, able to help out my staff when needed."
good,"Cleanliness is important in this job atmosphere. I have learned to adapt to changes in how things are run. I also learned how to be more assertive with what I want as an employee. Management is empathetic toward all the coworkers lifestyles and needs. The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude customers. The best part of this job is I never get bored, I always have something to do."
good,"I would recommend them as a place to work, and enjoyed my time here. There is an expectation of putting in many hours and getting results, but it is a family atmosphere and great people to work with."
good,Nice company to be apart of. The shifts are easy and there is always something for you to do. Customer service is key and being a team player is important.
good,"I work 12 hour swing shifts, making first rounds, check pumps, tank levels, pipeline pressures and flow, checked the steam boiler and checked on loading rack to make sure nothing was leaking and drivers were wearing proper PPE and maintaining all safety requirements. "
good,This was a very customer friendly company. I was able to resolve issues and implement new office procedures while working at Pest Masters
good,A typical day at work includes assisting a great team who is always appreciative of your hard work. Management is always available to provide feedback and listen to you.
good,"I had a graet time while I worked there. I wish I didn't have to stop my employment there, I would definetly recomend working for them."
good,Everyone is friendly and hard working. People take pride in their work and work well together. Work climate is professional and intense. People are willing to put in the extra effort to get the job done.
good,"Fast Paced Environment, "
good,"During the work days was very fast pace working environment and it was very educational about cash handling skills. It involved constant restocking and customer communication interaction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who would steal alcohol from the store and there was nothing we could do about it due to complications through the company. All we could do was call the non emergency number and give them a description of the person, the direction they took off in and the type of vehicle they were driving. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing a professional work relationship with some of the customers that eventually became regulars at the store."
good,"el ambiente de trabajo en la gasolinera de Giant es muy agradable ,los compañeros son un grupo de trabajo , hay responsabilidad ,respeto,honestidad .."
good,"Was busy but fun, Very People Friendly, Co-Workers were hard workers, Getting to meet new people everyday and seeing the regulars. I learned to deal with different problems that came with customers."
good,"great job for anyone,i love it just want to do more with a  company an now is not a great time I would like to move up an teach guys to drive or more"
good,"This place shut down, which is why I left. The pay was great, the people were great. The overtime could get a little crazy, but I had no children at the time, so I didn't mind it."
good,"while working at western refining for 3 years i liked it so much i had an awesome work area, enjoyed my work and fellow employees and customers, but i didn't agree to my boss she never answered her phone calls when we had to miss work due to emergency, as for me i had to call in during a night shift i tired calling and texted my boss more than 10 times that night and no respond, i also called the assistant manager she always answered but told me to call her  first and i explain my situation about getting in contact with her.and the assistant manager told me to get a hold of another employee to work for you.so i did and that employee didn't show up, the next day i got discharge for no show, and i had proof to show but the manager didn't want it and the assistant t told her she gave me permission to miss work. i left the work place and 3 months later the manager got fired for not answering her phone to an important situation that occurred during night shift."
good,what I liked about working at GIANT western refining is the experience i got there.Working well others and having them train me in a professional way.
good,"On a typical day I deal with a vast variety of different job aspects, from scheduling, to OT management, policy review and writing, CBA compliance, and managing the facility caretakers. I have learned a great deal from working at Western Refining. My manager is excellent at teaching and explaining. I get along great with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the CBA because a lot of the employees dont understand it."
good,"At Western Refining I felt like my ideas and contributions mattered.  I had a supervisor who was supportive, led by example, promoted personal and business growth and assisted anytime he could."
good,"Enjoyed working at this location and was very happy with the compensation."
good,"Busy and very challenging, allowed learning curve to learn business. Enjoyed suggestions in open meetings, and very pleasurable to even able to have open meetings."
good,This company was a great company to work for.  Some people are worried about job security due to the acquisition.  Landing a job at Tesoro without relocating would be a plus.
good,Overall my last 2 years with western refining was a pleasant experience
good,This was a great job! Company values their employees and show it. Truly dedicated to their safety program and provide all the tools to perform job properly. Encourage employees to advance and provides necessary training to enhance positions. Should have stayed....
