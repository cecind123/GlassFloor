rating,review
bad,Management not good very snooty and unprofessional ! Did not like working there very call center environment would rather have short calls then actually help customers all about metrics! Micro manage to know what screens you are on creepy!
bad,Leave your ideas and creativity at home. Don’t challenge unskilled Senior Managers with old world insurance experience who know nothing about digital.
bad,They lie about everything with job assignment never told it was a contact until I was there I left full time job for a contract and job was not what I thought and they do not care about person either
bad,"I was hired as an analyst at a novice salary even though I had years of experience. I accepted the pay. Then  several months into the job, Management told me my job was to be project manager for transitioning from an old system to a new system. This was dictated to me without any increase in pay or training.  I never was a project manager for any task and was minimally successful in getting the job done.  I take pride in my work but left the company feeling I had failed."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations. Its who you know to get advancements. Watch your back, feedback on performance is poor and infrequent. High pressure environment."
bad,There are too many instances of managerial reprocussions to respond. I am only writing enought to get through this survey. If you want to be at the whim of someone else... go for it.
bad,"Worked for them as a contractor.  Management had hired for the wrong kind of position from the start.  Management gave no direction for the first month of working there.  The culture perpetuates doing as little work as possible without getting fired, while still looking good enough not to get replaced by outsourcing firm.  There is a great deal of siloing here, every department has little fiefdoms where everyone will be happy to start a corporate war over literally nothing.  uppermanagement has no idea what is going on in the company and there is easily over 10 years of tech debt ( I saw tons of windows NT boxes and unix systems from the late 90's)."
bad,No leads assistance even though when hiring they indicated that leads were regularly supplied.  The software and website was outdated and often turned clients away.
bad,"If you value getting paid for your work, don't work here.  I worked and sold products and never got paid, instead I ended up paying them because apparently they covered 0% of my health insurance."
bad,"This was one of the worst companies I worked for. The  systems were so dated that people made mistakes regularly. We are talking conducting interviews with clients on a word document, copying and pasting to pdf and sending to India. If one small error was wrong it messed up the system. All the systems were like this. "
bad,"The managers did not care.  All the nubees had to pay for everything. No private desk, no phone, had to pay to use. No real support. They pressured you ever day.  Not a pleasant place."
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"If they don't like you they will find a way to fire you, even if they lie and say you have to be written up before your terminated. You cannot be fired if your on probation for one incident and then have a different incident. The team I was on offered 16 hours of training while being forced to learn the systems on your own. Don't be fooled by their tactics. Nothing but lies and back stabbing here I would not recommend them to anyone."
bad,"The company has let me and my family down. The change from Met Life to MassMutual was a nightmare, no way the company prepared well. The underwriting department was so bad, I know that you need to fix your underwriting department. The hardest part of the job was to get new business issued. i am sorry, but getting business issued was like 4 months to get a decision. i have 39 years in the business and never seen so many people afraid to make a decision."
bad,Many people said it felt like a family owned company. I think that was before but now its all about the numbers.  Also they do not want you to have any personality on the phone when it comes to call monitoring.
bad,Insurance company with a very good rating this was a great sales opportunity.  company has a excellent reputation and is one of the biggest insurance  suppliers
bad,Just as all insurance agencies it was a scam. I will never recommend becoming an insurance agent unless it is part time work. All practices a backed by lies.
bad,"This company does not help to market it's product to consumers. They leave you to figure it out on your own and the pay, even for commission base is the worst."
bad,Financial services is a tough environment to work. Unless you already have an established group of people to work with it's very hard to be successful.
bad,I joined the Raleigh office that was affiliated with Greensboro.  They were undergoing major management issues upon arrival.  It was a hodgepodge of people coming and going and or organization or support from mid/upper management.
bad,Company does not care about employees and the work environment is very stressful.  Co workers are very immature and disruptive to fellow co workers around them.
bad,"It was great for the first year. My contract was terminated without informing me, my clients received poorly drafted letters with wrong information. No support from support staff and yet they charge for office space and use of printers."
bad,They don't care about their employees at all. No raises terrible insurance. The department I worked in the assistant Vice President was involved with an employee and there was a ton of favoritism.
bad,I can't recommend this is a terrible place to try to work the health insurance is bad  and they don't care about their employees. They lie about owning your own business
bad,Too much micro managing. Had to continually provide the same information over and over.  Enjoyed most of my co-workers.  The company did provide activities that were fun. The hardest part of the job was answering to management who were not as knowledgeable as they should have been to be effective.
bad,Very engaging company to work for. Very diverse group of employees. Good benefits and decent pay. A positive and professional company to work for.
bad,"not a good place to work, gets worse with time, no work life balance, too much work and too few people. Management doesn't care about you."
bad,fun company but the one in chicago does not really work with you and your market they make you work within the market they find for you and it is a very uncomfortable which is not good for your work and home life mix.
bad,"Work place was full of high energy management.  All about the sales dollars, and income was straight commission.  Felt a little misled, felt like they where telling me one thing but I was getting something else.  Management lacked details and organizational skills."
bad,Basically you're trying to find candidates who will work for basically nothing the first five years of the job. The recent college graduate is their target to sell life insurance policies to family and friends.
bad,"The environment is sales rep against sales rep, no true team.  Lots of hidden charges for everything you use including a $50 charge for coffee, whether or not your drink coffee is irrevelant."
bad,"The place is a joke and management is even worse. The General Agent is completely disconnected and the Assistant GA is frustrated because he can't hit his numbers. Nobody's hitting any production because management has no plan. It's not a fun place to work, some of the staff are really rude. The General Agent seems to like his contract, but can't lead. He needs to stick with the sales side and get out of management."
bad,The management staff were very misleading as to what the job would entail. The typical job day would call for an employee to call and aggressively attempt to make people buy insurance products they may not have needed.
bad,That was the worst place to work.  The culture was not desirable.
bad,"Worked on the field digital team supporting their agent/broker portal.  A typical day was working through an endless stream of website content change requests with unrealistic service levels.  They had daily huddles to review who had the most or least capacity for assigning more work.  It was a weird one-off excel process they had been using for years and wasn’t a good indication of your level of capacity.  They relied on this to their own determent and I noticed people would inflate the time it takes to complete assigned tasks to make it appear they were busier than they were.  Legacy employees were never scrutinized because they did more project work and could pad their capacity numbers and appear busier.  New hires typically had more production work.  If a new hire had low capacity they were written up and would have their entire work queue scrutinized to see if they were fudging their capacity numbers.  If their capacity was low, they were assigned a lot more work requests.  If you put too many work requests in progress to reflect what you were working on for the weekly capacity you were written up.  If you annotated the title of your work request to reflect the updated status of the requests you were written up.  "
bad,"A good Company headed nose-down to destruction. Constant change/ to No management in this facility. No job security, No job advancement, poor salary increases- if any. Irresponsible leadership with no values, favoritism plays a big part from Director of Operations, among others in up management."
bad,don't work there unless you don't want to make any money for the first 5 months unless you have already had a lot of experience in the field and already have a client base
bad,"They flat out lie about compensation (100% commission). They say you can make $60 in your first year - forget about it. It's more like $35k. It's possible to make $60k if you have help from someone inside. Second-year isn't much better, but you have to make more or your out. I made it three years, missed my goal by a couple of contracts and I was done. They send me a bill for $685 for rent on my cubical."
bad,"The company was fun but they laid us all off in June 2019. They moved to Springfield Ma. The management was horrible, there were no written job procedures for your position, you learned as you went."
bad,Work environment sucks! Job sucked!  Compensation sucks! Renting you work cubicle is rediculous at $300 / month!  I would not recommend unless you are a masochist :-(
bad,"The hiring process took forever after which the the position as advertised was changed. I accepted the offer letter still because all of my other offers had fallen through. "
bad,Management is only interested in the numbers and needs to keep signing up new agents to make quota. They promise anything and just keep having a high turn over. Management plays favorites with support staff.
bad,"Highly unethical, poor management, predatory practices, a selling job and nothing more, work work work until people hang up on you, no benefits, no salary, just commission"
bad,Straight commission job. No base pay. High turn over due to no income and occur business expenses. One needs to be highly connected and active in close network community.
bad,"MassMutual was a good place to work for when raising my children. Depending on your manager you were supported as a working parent. Unfortunately the companies prides themselves for working mothers but they do not require all managers to manage in this manner. Everything is left up to management discretion. Once you reach the age of 40 and have over 20 years of service, you know you time is limited. If you area happens to be hit with layoffs, those are the first to go."
bad,"Awful place to work, gets worse with time, no work life balance, micromanaging with a very high fear based style of managing but this may depends on your manager.   Depending on the manager but my manager has absolute dishonesty with no support with very high retaliation to any attempt for fairness.   Do not come here if you have a choice."
bad,This employer is not designed for all culture and social status.  In order for MassMutual to be a great place to work you have to have a republican background.
bad,"Each MM office is independantly owned. My office was merged with another. Everything was by the book and to the minute for everyone, well unless you were liked very well then you had a sliding scale. Several people from the old company were either fired or outcasted by the new company. Sadly, management cares more about themselves. Employees are NOT treated equally."
bad,Hard work is not the key to success in this large company. The company is always looking to reduce salaries. This is often done by eliminating experienced people. Also much of the IT department has been replaced by cheaper outsourced contractors from other countries.
bad,"If you work in the corporate world long enough, you will either witness or become involved in a situation in which you will face adverse consequences for refusing to cross an ethical boundary. ""Human"" Resources does not act based on ethics; they will do whatever is necessary to protect their morally compromised VPs, Directors and managers. What this ensures, is that the behaviors repeat, get reinforced and become worse over time; those who participate in aiding such behaviors (because they, to quote one, ""go with the authority"") get rewarded. The remaining who have a conscience know the environment they're in but have had to learn how to navigate a culture of fear. Ironically, those whose titles indicate they should know better (best, actually!) are the worst offenders. Beware the interviewer who ends an interview with ""There's no backstabbing here."" He's the keeper of the biggest knife and hides it better than anyone."
bad,"I worked at MassMutual for 6 years in customer service and other roles. From the very beginning leadership was cold and disconnected and only looked at numbers and average handle time being the biggest push in that call center. As CSR, you are controlled and told when to go to the restroom and lunch break. It was the longest 2.5 years of my career. I worked hard enough to join another team and things seemed promising when once again the numbers were the driving factor, and besides my efforts to prove that I was an asset, I was denied a raise several times due to there were many changes [called the MM Way and ""True Case management""] where new radical ways of doing work was affecting the way we worked. I spoke to HR come to find out I wasn't the only associate who had concerns of the new workflow affecting our production. When we spoke up, management did not listen because they were too concerned their precious Underwriters would leave. We can't have that."
bad,"Management was a joke, getting any form of help was a disaster waste of time. Training was terrible and non informative, you waste 2 months on things the reps don't even ask, there's pages and pages of information you need to provide in minutes considering you don't know where to find it, they throw you into the sharks with no help. 0/10"
bad,My office was recently taken over by Capstone Partners.  They are of no assistance to our office.  They have invested no time or money into developing us as advisors.  They are corporate bullies who show no regard for an advisor's level of expertise.
bad,"Not ideal position for me.  Though I enjoyed working with my clients, there was the issues within the organization that demanded changes in order to correct management deficiencies."
bad,I came to Massmutual through the merger. The transition was not smooth. We saw no one from upper management that had an interest in us. It takes extremely long for policies to get issued. You pay them to use  the office .
bad,NONE This company had some political issues with their GM assistant GM and compliance
bad,In the last few years many things have changed to way we work and the employee rating system is a huge change.  Forced rankings makes it difficult to be a leader.  I worked the last three years in the IT division where there was a lot of bullying so staff were fearful to be open and honest due to retaliation.
bad,"This is a pyramid scheme that exacts heavy deductions from lower-level producers.  Unless you are well connected, don't even bother working with them."
bad,"During my tenure at Mass Mutual Greater Long Island, I was treated very poorly. My manager and the staff barely acknowledged me while I worked there. I received little to no support. I don’t know if it was because of my ethnic background, but I sure hope not."
bad,"Management wasn't very strong...no guidance & then if you messed something up - the ax came down. "
bad,"Takes several years to build up your career in this business. It's basically selling life insurance. Good training, but don't expect to make any money right away. Have a back up job!"
bad,"Due to the work environment, I found MassMutual to be an extremely stressful and unhealthy place to work. Also, management would not listen to employees ideas and suggestions until it was too late."
bad,"Once MassMutual embraced the mutual culture and encourage high performance teams. New management makes is difficult to move up, especially for women. Massive layoffs leaves those still standing wondering on a daily basis ""I'm I getting the axe today?"" I've watched the backstabbing and abusive managers thrive while those with vision and creative ideas either stepped over or laid off. This is a great culture for those willing to do anything to get ahead. Not the place for the kind, ethical or loyal."
bad,was promised a book of business and was denied that opportunity.
bad,They do not care about employees at all. Only the bottom dollar.
bad,"Worst experience of my 20+ year career.  Would not recommend MM to anyone, comp and benefits are good, but culture is horrible."
bad,"If what they say they try to do was reality, it would be an awesome place to work, but, in reality, they have folks that have grown to management based on I don't know what, certainly not managing people. "
bad,Profit driven. Question products value. Good for some but only 6% retemtion. Top level performers only acknowledged. OK benfits but no Worl Life Balance
bad,Management doesn't have a clue how to motivate or educate new hires to the industry. They give you some rudimentary info and throw you out on the street to sell.
bad,"I was brought on to Mass Mutual as the Director of Recruiting and given no direction. I still hit the ground running and one day after only two months of working there I was told that I was being let go. When I asked why they said ""what ever you want to say"" I asked again, what do I say to my wife when she asks me? Again, ""whatever you want, we'll back you up on it"". When I asked if I could qualify for unemployment they said yes as the position was being eliminated (yet someone else was in it within a month or two) and that I could claim unemployment and they wouldn't fight it. When I asked what to tell them why I was laid off or let go, again ""whatever you want to say"". They had no systems in place to train or ensure people hit the ground running. They also hit me out of the blue with this instead of saying ahead of time, let's have weekly meetings and discuss how you're doing and ways we can help you, etc. I respect the GA and his wife but am disappointed in my short stint there as I am someone who learns quick and they really seemed as if they didn't want me to succeed."
bad,Great income opportunity for the right person but not for me.  Saw many examples of people having sold policies to friends and family just to keep working there.  Introduction of the Fiduciary Rule made it very hard to get started in the business - small accounts became too much of a liability.
bad,"Mass mutual of greater houston was in the process of creating not one division but two.  In the process of creating their internship program, the company decided to relocate & split their internship into two sectors.  At the end of the day, due to the split of the company, myself and another intern were not fully aware of who to go to in certain cases.  Many times, the office was closed or was not open upon set times that we were given.  No communication between the two divisions led to miss communication with the head of the devisions and intern program head.  One point in time, we were given tasks that were not related to Massmutual, but related to a different retail (halloween costume store)?  All interns felt that we were not being utilized to our full potential."
bad,"No no no no no no nono no   dont do it ...."
bad,I do not recommend unless you are a cut throat personality that thrives on competition. I suggest you have financial background before taking an opportunity there or at least have a book to purchase to learn.
bad,"The job description is very misleading.. Once trained after six months or more at a snail's pace, you are thrust into a methodical dirty white collar new age sweatshop of mundane,  extremely repetitive and at times banal cookie-cutter rubber stamping of orders front archaic insurance guys many of whom lack the intellect and perseverance to get a Series 7."
bad,"Great training, hard to make it work. No salary. Direct management is great. Beautiful office. Training is very good for sure and management is open to helping at any time. If you can go without an income for a year, it's okay but with a family to support, it is really difficult."
bad,"The management is full of drama, they don’t really care to help you even if you ask. You will only get promoted if someone likes you, many people are promoted just because of relationships not off of skill."
bad,"It felt like a pyramid scheme.  They want you to get 250 people closest to you and they will try to get their business, take majority of the commission, and forget about you."
bad,"The material I was working on was not only super outdated, but It was mindless work that could have been done by anybody and could simply be taken out of the company completely if their weren't so cheap in regards to updating their software."
bad,Spent the majority of my day on the computer looking at accounts and handling any escalated customer calls. The workplace culture is not very professional or politically correct. The owners definately had their favorite employees and those people didn't have to work as hard or follow the same rules. They did not give merit raises or cost of living increases and the bonus for non-sales employees was low for the industry.
bad,Mass Mutual is a great company but you are managed by a local independent Manager and the one in Orlando was horrible.  Plus you will never own your book of business.
bad,Just as the title says. Not the job it was made out to be. Do your due diligence and check into them before accepting the job.
bad,Funny this is being posted almost a year to the day they eliminated the whole team and outsourced.
bad,"The office itself is nice, they have a decent budget to buy a lot of snacks and keep you supplied with office junk, but the managers are very hands off and snobby. They definitely play favorites, and do not care about you at all, just your numbers, and they do not let you forget that. The pay is okay for the work, the calls gets hectic but that’s most call centers, don’t expect the higher ups to take you seriously or listen to concerns. It’s a good job temporarily."
bad,"The experience was valuable only that it led me to a finer understanding of the human element, finance, and salesmanship.  Overall this office of Mass Mutual was poorly run and tried to get youth in the door to exploit their relationships and then let them walk with next to zero training or leadership."
bad,"To many pointless meetings, Technology fees to agent, underwriting time line to long, maintain that your paid a supplement as you build your business NOT  TRUE ! (if so amount is never disclosed) your contract never states the total supplemental amount you'll receive and your contract does not state what your actual commission are. When a new program is introduced for your new skill set you are charged for that new program. You'll have several training programs that you are mandated to learn. You will pay rent on your cubical, office, technology fees. You'll work about 1-6 months before you receive one penny, but you will have received 6 bills to you that you will pay the company."
bad,Developing and maintaining relationships is critical to one's success at MassMutual and at times it can be difficult to earn trust and respect of long-term employees.  The environment is challenging and full of opportunities to learn and grow but can be harsh and comes at the expense of work life balance.
bad,"The acquisition of MPCG was less than stellar - unfortunately, in blending teams, it was made clear that advancements are provided primarily to those in Springfield/Enfield. The atmosphere was challenging at best and leadership was not interested in providing a sound path for development; the culture was an ""us/them"" environment that provided little opportunities for advancement. We were also told those from MPCG ""made a lot more"" than legacy MM, so many of us didn't receive a raise between 2016-2017 (even cost of living increase). We move on..."
bad,"The company told me I would be trained. I was not. They just wanted me to bring potential clients to MassMutual. I have to ""natural market""."
bad,"The company offers decent benefits and you would think the salary is good but for the stress that the position comes with, it's not. You are definitely over worked and under payed and you're basically under a microscope. They tell you it's easy to transfer to other departments but it's not. You have to wait a full year and when they interview you the look at everything. If you were ever on probation the previous year you won't be considered for a promotion. Management plays favorites and they fire people left and right. I went is with a big training class and by the time they fired me without warning there were only 2 people left from my class. I would not recommend this job to anyone that suffers from anxiety or high stress levels."
bad,Was let down with this opportunity as I felt I received little to no guidance on what to do or where to go. Very self sufficient occupation with high reliance on relationships/connections to moderately affluent people.
bad,"This company expects you to drop your whole lifestyle to begin working for them. They give you 1 week of in-person training, then throw you out to find your own clients and business. Will never recommend anyone to work for them. COMMISSION PAY ONLY!"
bad,"Be very careful"
bad,"High pressure, very disorganized.  Felt like a pump and dump kind Insurance Office.  Training could be better!  Great Company, but unfortunately not a great office!"
bad,"This is a commission sales job that sounds like it would offer more. But it doesn't even offer decent  benefits. The company has an agency system and each agency runs itself...sort of...meaning training is varied depending on who you get when you get them. Turn over is really high at the agencies. Most people come and go before you know their names, even office staff and management. I've been with the company 4 years and only know a few people as I'm leaving. "
bad,"Management locally was far below what is required to succeed. No mentor, no success. Would not recommend this industry for those who are recently graduated or in their 20’s."
bad,Must have external networking connections to be successful. While I was there they were attempting to build up programs on a commissioned based job with very little training and guidance.
bad,Lack of leadership and poor training. The management is only concerned about themselves. The products are excellent and I was confident selling them to clients.
bad,Was a very poorly designed agency that did not set their associates up for success. Training was poor and workplace culture had drama. They were also very unclear on how we were being compensated despite being asked multiple times.
bad,"MM acquired the retirement division of The Hartford in 2013. No incentive to stay. Many unknowns in transition. Mostly autonomous territory management. Towards leaving in 2018, management would infer that my territory might be eliminated. Had many loyal adviser relationships for repeat business. Assisted too many FA's in start up plans for no compensation and unfortunately no future commissionable business. No loyalty. Products were priced a little out of market averages.  Many of my TPA relationships complimented by skills and knowledge above peer group."
bad,"not a good work culture or environment, high turnover.  Even though you are licensed in insurance and/or investments the office is small and little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"I have been working in the Retirement Services division at MassMutual for six years and the climate has only become worse after each year. When an employee changes position, leaves the company or is terminated, they are rarely replaced. Instead the rest of that employee's team has to take on the extra work. Also, there have been few promotions or increase in salaries for those that remain. Therefore, there is no incentive to put in more work or effort and most of the recognition awards have no dollar value. Managers are now treated as project specialists and rarely have contact with those employees that report directly to them. Also, the health benefits leave much to be desired."
bad,"Prospect for clients everyday"
bad,"Worked in the call center. It was very stressful and the procedures were always changing, many times at the last minute without much notice. Many of these procedures are also outdated and were being implemented by people who had no idea what they are doing. If you had to use the restroom any time other than your assigned 15 minute break in the morning/afternoon, you would be penalized on your ""adherence"" to your schedule. If you got a call a couple minutes before your scheduled break time and you end up having to take your break a few minutes late because you did your job and helped someone, you will be penalized. You will be judged on Quality Assurance with ridiculous expectations. Customers can be extremely rude and insulting. You are treated like a robot, not a human being."
bad,I only worked for Mass Mutual for 3 months before I decided to pursue other opportunities.  I do not feel that it would be appropriate for me to give a higher rating.
bad,"If you are right out of college and want the experience and workload of 65+ hour weeks, than this may fit, otherwise 40 hours does not exist. If you are wanting a company that has a lot of money and the ability to train, this may also be a good fit."
bad,"MassMutual is one of the nation’s largest life insurance providers, and a highly reputable one at that. The company earns top financial strength scores, meaning you can trust it to pay out on your policy when the time comes. In terms of service, customers rank it among other big names in the business, like Guardian, Principal Financial, and New York Life."
bad,"MassMutual is a good company based on training, friendly, fun, travel. It’s not all the times they respect their words. When you need to modify policies, it’s very difficult to do so."
bad,"MassMutual is probably only considered a good company to work for due to the good healthcare and flexible hours. Other than that it’s the type of work space that will drain all of your energy. The managers openly display favoritism and the pay inequalities are shocking. My pay was a fraction of my peers, presumably because of my race and gender. When it came time for annual review and pay increases, there was always rave review on the quality of my work but a “but” would surely follow to try and justify why I wasn’t worthy of getting a substantial pay increase. Meanwhile, my workload was forever increasing and I was often asked to mentor and train new staff. The experience in short was mentally exhausting and discouraging.  I wouldn't wish it anyone."
bad,"I was told this place was a good one to work at but it is not. No support, terrible training, and they throw you to the wolves to figure things out on your own. You are not taught enough about investments (which participants ask about) so you sound like an idiot not having any idea what they're talking about. Co-workers are lazy and don't do the job right, then you are expected to clean up their mess. Half of the managers in the call center don't do anything, one has never even taken a call in her life and doesn't know the systems we use.  You can change your schedule every quarter based on your metrics which include your handle time, but to do the job right it sometimes takes longer. They care more about quantity than quality. There is so much wrong with how this call center is run. If you don't mind having to apologize all the time for constant processing or other reps mistakes, then this place is perfect for you. It gets draining to have no support from upper management and see people get away with being lazy while you're getting yelled at for taking the time to do it right."
bad,"In my opinion, this is not a company for new inexperienced financial professionals because the training, management nor office culture is prepared for this type of individual. There is no mentoring or joint work system already in place. The training and accountability is virtually non existent. Everyone is busy running there own business. You really have to find your own way, and the lack of training of the companies processes  and programs make it really difficult. I had to rely on one person, who had never actually done the job. That person was great and did everything available to assist and is the only reason I stayed long past my instincts to leave. 100% commission"
bad,There is new senior management at MassMutual which is bringing the company to a place I don't want to be at.  The workplace culture is very bad as there is no respect for employees.  The only enjoyable part of the job is the people that work for me.  They are a great team and I appreciate all their efforts.
bad,They tell you whatever you want to hear in the interview. Then when you begin working you realize this job is very difficult. They want you to sell to your friends and family. No efficient training. No leads. The Senior advisors have huge egos.
bad,"going into work wasn't fun, I've had jobs where I would like getting up and going to work not here...just didn't feel like part of the team."
bad,very cut competitive environment. don't trust any one in the business co workers or management. Just do your job and go home
bad,Phoenix office has lots of people who should not be in management
bad,Sales job. Responsible for finding your own clients and selling them life and disability insurance.
bad,"The work environment focus is on hitting your numbers. There are no set hours. All leads are self generated. A typical day should include some of the following:"
bad,Decent pay and hours. For the type of work the pay should be higher. Constantly putting out fires on the phone from clients and agents. Learned a great deal about the products seeing how I had no knowledge at all prior to this position.
bad,"It was hard working here. I only stayed for the pay. The work was easy for me. Data entry,  spreadsheets,  presentations, and event management.  They like to close offices without telling anyone.  One division had the building locked when they came into work and told no one they had all lost their jobs, since they would be closing the office.  I myself was told that Monday my position would be eliminated on that Friday.  No explanation offered no severance nothing.  I found out later they got rid of me for a temp since it would save them money since I was about to get a bigger benefits package. I got married while I was there,  no one said Congratulations offered lunch, to do a party,  or even give me the day off! They were all to involved in themselves and ""making the sale."" I've never met a shallower group of people.  They deserved each other!"
bad,"My time at MassMutual was miserable.  My immediate team was fine, great team.  Management was useless.  Did not listen to employee issues, no growth, employees who should have long been let go were not.  I would not recommend MM to anyone."
bad,"The opportunities were probably there. Was having trouble communicating with local management, which eventually led to separation."
bad,They always were great as working with you when you had family situations that would take you away from work. There was more time spent on after work actives.
bad,Very flexible with your schedule.  Every day I had a different routine. Miss the people. Everyone seemed genuinely friendly. They were all stressed during work hours.
bad,This company bought out the company I was previously working for and was a dramatic difference in the way business was done. It was not a good match for the firm I worked for and I left soon after.
bad,"I quit for more money and a shorter commute. I don't regret that decision."
bad,Expectations were high and the pay was solely commissioned based so morale was based on job performance. My manager delegated training to junior associates instead of training us personally. I learned how to talk to clients and received most of my help from senior agents as they were involved in sales meetings. Difficult getting used to making 200+ phone calls a week with the expectation of setting 15+ appointments a week. Staff was quite friendly and the agents tried to boost each others morale.
bad,"Trainer was so bad that the Warwick office met with us and ""retrained"" us which was a joke since our trainer who was so poor was the one to retrain us. After 6 months 80% of our training class was gone.  My Manager was still trying to pass FINRA and unable to answer job questions we had, leading to us underperforming."
bad,"Provided customer service to internal customers by preparing policies for mailing to clients"
bad,The CEO has a great vision of the future but the rest of the leadership is stuck in the past. Start and invest in many things but do not know how to incubate to success.  Very frustrating.
bad,I don.t want t write anything here about the company I worked for. Managemant has changed since I left. I won't go back though. In do not plan on telling you anything more.
bad,"White Boards, bad upper management, no understanding of what your job is and what time off  you have,"
bad,"Very busy and interesting job. Co-workers are fantastic to work with, but managers are not.  They are not supportive, are too political, do not give due credit and micromanage everything. Hard work is recognized by teammates, but that is far as it goes. Managers will stab you behind your back and take credit for your work. Cheap Company does not reward hard work or loyalty. Workload was rewarding and job enjoyable when manager not in office. Only work here if you have to and you dont want to have a life."
bad,I was at Mass Mutual for 6 months with no prior experience in the insurance industry. Mass did not train me for a single day of the first six months and does not cover any of the expenses in getting licensed. You do not recieve any sort of leads from the company to help you get you're business running and you cannot rely on the local and district office for support. I wish the experience was better because when it comes to products they do have the best!
bad,"Training on the corporate level is excellent. However, the General Agency in Houston is not a great place if you are new to the industry. You are assigned to a sales manager in a random fashion, with no regard to how a new person should be mentored. In my case my sales manager had never sold the insurance products we offered and did not know how to run illustrations. Unfortunately the General Agent was aware of this and saw no reason to improve training. We had a stream of young recent graduates that ran through the agency for the year and a half that I was there. Basically after they had sold 5 policies to friends and family they were gone. As a past sales manager for 20 years I saw this as an appalling waste of talent, time and resources. I can't speak for other agencies in other cities. This was my experience in Houston."
bad,MassMutual overtly values diversity and inclusion but the culture is extremely challenging for people of color.   The pay is competitive and work schedules and locations are flexible.
bad,"Mass Mutual took over Metlife which I worked for Metlife over 10 years and then Mass Mutual laid everyone off that were employed by Metlife after one year with Mass Mutual so I do not have a good repor to give of that company.  Metlife did give me an incredible severance package which     "
bad,"Job was not accurately described during interview process"
bad,I was an employee of MetLife who was moved to MassMutual as a result of the sale of MetLife Preferred Client Group. Company did not communicate effectively regarding how the acquisition would effect the former MetLife employees.  Morale among the former MetLife employees was low.
bad,"Massmutual use to be a great place to work.  They are now outsourcing and there is no knowledgeable employees there.  They expect the employees left to work to make up for the outsourcing lack of knowledge.  They are laying off the SME's and outsourcing, but when things go South it is the MM employees who are called upon to fix even if you know nothing about a system, etc.  Morale is like and never ending funeral"
bad,"To cut to the chase, this is a customer service position in which you are tethered to your seat with a headset connected to you at all times. The company tried to cover up the fact that this is simplistic customer service job where you assist clients with mundane tasks such as login assistance. No room for upward movement since they have a hard enough time keeping their employees."
bad,"- No starting salary"
bad,The position simply did not match my skill set.  I am mid level career and the churn and burn mentality of these positions is similar to a glorified pyramid scheme.  You are expected to take fully licensed senior financial advisors on joint appointments who poach your contacts for future sales fully knowing the attrition rate on new hires is through the roof.  It is a scam.  They will raid your book of contacts without compensating you for the windfall of commissions they receive in the future.  Be careful!
bad,"Be prepared to not receive any kind of compensation for 3 months. They have strict underwriting guidelines, so expect to have any applications to take a long time to get approved."
bad,"The office I worked for has been shut down. "
bad,This takes an individual who is determined to sell him or herself to their network. The ability to generate clients from your own network is a must. Plan to work 6 to 7 days a week with little to no pay for an extended period of time.
bad,Proprietary product push is unreasonable. Whats best for the company is not always best for the client. The business model is the issue here.
bad,"Not a good time to be in the Retirement Services Division unless you want to do mindless work and be lead by a leadership team that values bttom line over people, even though they tout themselves as a mutual company."
bad,"21+ years with the company. On the whole, I really enjoyed working at MML. I was always learning, given opportunites to challenge my self with new positions, a great experience. My co-workers were the best and teamwork was the norm. We focused on delivering exceptional service."
bad,"if you are experienced and have a book of business this can be a great company. if you dont...look elsewhere. "
bad,Need new technology and better product pricing.  Management keeps changing. They are improving but will take some time.  RMs are overworked and looking at other opportunities
bad,"There are some very talented, friendly, and knowledgeable people at Mass Mutual. Unfortunately, Upper management consistently makes decisions that burn out even the hardest of workers."
bad,Coordinated and lead CAB reviews for all IT changes within the enterprise.  Designed and implemented new change management tool and application HP Service Manager.
bad,"It has everything I could ask for except the how to get started part. Building a book of business using your ""project 200"" feels slimy and unprofessional. They're not very clear on how to prospect for clients despite saying they have the tech and a list of warm leads to follow. Not forthcoming on how to find new business. Its almost like they expect you to already know how to do everything. Training is unpaid and self paced/taught. Online training through videos. No real incentive to complete training, as it takes time away from money making activities. Weak execution of the 12 week year. Crash course on how to use internal systems. No shadowing. A real fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kind of place."
bad,Did special projects to look for new clients. Worked in Aurora when I was young out of high school. I worked for my friend's dad company during the summer.
bad,"The company could be a great place to work.  However, lower level supervisors/managers are power hungry and will do anything to get ahead, even if that means lying on their direct reports. HR is there to protect the company at all costs and allow the backlash when issues are brought up about management."
bad,This company had terrible upper management and equally terrible treatment of all departments.  High turn-over and staff-wide frustration with upper management.
bad,As an intern didn't really much nor was i challenged. I personally believe it was the individual i was assigned to intern for and shadow.
bad,I loved my job and felt I was good at it. I enjoyed working with the staff and agents/brokers to get their cases approved so that their clients could be covered by life insurace. I left along with several co-workers due to poor leadership.
bad,"Company is not interested in jumping into the 21st century technology-wise. They are too focused on the advisors selling insurance and not on the customer. "
bad,I only pick up trash put in bag how to clewan a place vacum is the hardest in this
bad,"I enjoyed the vast majority of the time I worked for MassMutual.  I'm sure it will improve, but current management seems to have lost its way. Morale is low and the IT management team is inexperienced which leads to wasted time, frustration and plenty of goodbyes. In time, I'm sure it will be a great place to work again."
bad,"You will make money if you are 100% dedicated with not much of free time, and consistently moving forward."
bad,"You sit on the phone all day that is micro managed down to the second, that is a typical call center environment.  Very professional atmosphere with average managers.  Nothing unusual about this position."
bad,Normal steady job. Lot of paper work and pretty boring if u ask me.
bad,The group is mostly production oriented.  I was not comfortable in the degree of knowledge regarding current changes in the industry and the overall lack of concern for the client.
bad,No structure. Great company to work for. You have to hard your first year or you will not make it. Great place to get experience in the industry. Follow your leads and make calls every day.
bad,"Mass Mutual is generally a solid company, but  this job was not for me. I have worked for other companies in the financial and insurance industry that I felt were a better fit."
bad,"MassMutual Carolinas has great management and training.  However, if you are not joining an established team, it is a VERY difficult career.  When I started this role a year ago, there was no base salary not even for training.  I have made very little money in the year I have been with this organization despite working very hard and consistently to get people in my pipeline."
bad,MassMutual bought out the broker dealer department from MetLife and then 1 year later told us that they are closing the doors in Charlotte. MassMutual's home office is in Springfield mass. they seem to think that Charlotte does everything wrong while we trained them since finding out that we are no longer working for them.
bad,Constant Turnover. Grossly over-sold earning potential for beginning advisors by management that preaches freedom but truly micromanages all aspects of your day to day activities.
bad,ok I don't know why I have to write about it when I am not that comfortable talking about my employer so I rather just write this stuff down and let it go unnoticed.
bad,"MassMutual has started an oursourcing trend. I fear for the future of the company because I have seen a decline in the quality of work as a result. The company was once an excellent employer. They claim to value people, but I have seen the contrary in recent years."
bad,Requires wealthy warm market of couples. Without a warm market to start you will not meet sales goals. Cases and commissions take months to close so do not expect to get paid for a while.
bad,"very poor management in a place where little progress is made.  No training, unrealistic workload, no gratitude, senior management has noted that employees can expect nothing."
bad,Good place to intern. No structure to the internship. Would not recommend but did learn some things on my own.
bad,"Poorly trained staff, aggressive management. Abrasive corporate culture, no opportunity for advancement"
bad,Great culture in the actual company but not a good environment to work in.
bad,"Was hired for a newly job position that was not thought out or planned."
bad,no team atmosphere in rochester office.  I would have become an agent at Mass except that they never developed my skills even when I discussed my  desires with management.
bad,an organization I wouldn't want to return too. The culture there is one of intimidation and concern only for managing upward.
bad,"high turnover and cut throat, 100% commission. Not enough training."
bad,"MassMutual is a nice company to work for , I personal just think I was not making the kind of money I want to makes , MassMutual has a lot of information that can be helpful to someone in the Insurance world ."
bad,Amazing management and training.  100% commission is a killer.  Typical day is prospecting and cold calling.  Professional dress.  No base pay.  Savings account drains fast.  80% of all new starts are gone within 12 months
good,I wasn't really happy with this company because it was a sink or swim. There was never any training and they expected you to just hope on the horse and go. High pressure sales is all that it is.
good,"a typical day is busy, full of meetings and problem solving.  The new way of the company is challenging and difficult to see managements goals.. The best part of the job is helping customers"
good,"Help Contract all new agents perusing a career in financial industry."
good,"This is a not a good place to work, if you are trying to make a living of more than $30k in your first year. If you hiring manager tells you differently, they are not being 100% truthful with you. Its possible to make more money, but I never met anyone who has.  "
good,"This is a company where it is certainly more about who you know than what you know. Favortism is the driver of position selection, performance ratings, raises, and bonuses. Your actual performance is irrelevant."
good,Loved the people I worked with.  Benefits were great.  Pay was not great.  MassMutual would have annual layoffs so job security is not great.  Management is trying to save money and increasing an already heavy workload.  Can be rewarding but the security is not the best.
good,Very busy day.  Management could work better in helping problems solved. Company will work with you about leaving early.  Majority of people work with are pleasant.
good,"Reviewed trust documents to determine, manage and control department’s risk."
good,Interned at the company but did not do much there. Many of the agents didn't realize that there were interns.
good,This company is investing in major technology which will result in more layoffs. They pay well and the benefits are good but everyone is very scared about their job right now.
good,I learned a lot working for this organization as a financial advisor. It was one of the hardest roles I have ever had and definitely have to be able to learn on the spot
good,Commissioned sales position where you are incentivized to sell proprietary & non-proprietary products whether or not they were in the best interest of the consumer
good,"The Intermountain West agency is under extremely poor management at the highest levels, including poor training, high overrides, and general lack of concern for the underlings."
good,"Providence lost it's General Agency status as a result of lack of production and agent retention."
good,"Company has great offerings for its clients, however the support and payment structure is more suited for experienced reps within the industry.  There was a huge push for results by all associates using a cold call system.  The cold calls were just that ""Cold"" and were from areas within the city that didn't necessarily meet the type of clients they were trying to associate themselves with."
good,You have to be on your game for this company. Starting off is hard and they say you have to be there for over 3 years to see results. You pay for your own office space which gets very expensive quickly especially when you are waiting for income to arrive.
good,MassMutual focuses on customers and clients in a positive and focused manner.  Many different changes within the market place drive changes within the various organizations.   Great learning experience working within MM.
good,"Pros: Casual workplace, good location, and work-life balance are decent."
good,"Flexible work hours, empowered teams, management takes time to respond or make decisions, lack of collaboration at the top level. teams work well together but at times will get bogged down between management politics and chaos. Re-org every 2 years and a new canvas of leadership every 2 years. Lack of stability and fear of unknown."
good,"Mass Mutual has a huge focus on life insurance, and bases the vast majority of compensation on your life sales. If you don't have easy access to high net worth clients who can pour 10k/year into a whole life product, look elsewhere."
good,"This type of job is not for everyone when you start it is a lot of cold calling, long hours, little pay because of the commission based system. If you can last a couple years it gets better because its a business built off residuals."
good,"Very hard, but can be very lucrative.  100% commission structure. Management provides a lot of training.  Provides training for variety of financial planning/insurance services."
good,MassMutual is a growing company with great opportunities. Patience is needed as management adjusts to the new financial services environment and responds to the new DOL rules and compliance requirement.
good,A good company that has gone through some difficult times which has resulted in some poor management decisions and a difficult work atmosphere.
good,"I was an intern through their rotational program. The program allowed me to see different parts of the company.I intern in their technology department, recruiting, and compliance,."
good,"The financial services industry is one which is very difficult to be successful in, especially if you are a recent college grad. You need some kind of a financial pillow that you can invest in your business/practice for it to be possible in my opinion."
good,"Must earn your keep.  No one gives you a thing, no support from Mass with respect to marketing your business. The local agency is good concerning training."
good,"There were vast and extensive amount of different types of document to handle, but there was only about three weeks to digest and get familiar with them.  Make the staffs big tensions and exhaused."
good,"Just like any other Insurance and investment company, this is a commission only career with stipulations on how you are to run your business and grow client base. Like any other insurance companies they have you make a list of your family, friends and neighbors that I have already bled through with others agencies rather than making a game plan of how you and who you want to market and the best strategies to grow that market. The turnover ratio is huge for agents in this industry. In my opinion its because they have you target family, friends and neighbors and once you have bled through them there is nobody else to market to. Agents are not trained on how to grow their client base."
good,I was hired on in a tumultuous time with a high rollover in employees and management. The culture was lacking in formal training which went against a majority of my background and own experiences. The opportunities were great and it may have been a better position at a later time after management moves had time to solidify strategies.
good,"MM is very top heavy... a ton of Supervisors, Managers, Directors, Associate VPs, Assistant VPs, VPs, Sr. VPs, and EVP... then the corporate VP... that is all i have to say."
good,The management lacked in field training. The company itself is a great company with solid products but the local office did it a disservice. They were more worried about recruiting than developing the advisors that currently worked there.
good,Stressful work enviroment that they ended up moving to MA and AZ. t was very disappointing they made it seem that it was an opportunity  for growth but only in MA and AZ..
good,"great managers and training, when it comes to corp and valuing each employee they dont take that time just like every other corp. my manager while i was there was very awesome and did appreciate all team members"
good,"SAP"
good,A good job for those looking to establish themselves in a call center environment. Opportunities for growth and development may be hard to come by depending upon department.
good,"MassMutual needs improvement when it comes to work culture and environment. Due to recent instability, the overall social feel lacks positivity, which is unfortunate."
good,"I worked at MassMutual for 10 years. Overall the company has a supportive culture, however when they need to reduce budget they will heartlessly cut large numbers of workers. Some departments are awesome to work in, some treat you like children."
good,"In general your manager defines your work experience but financial pressures forces layoffs and outsourcing.  Disproportional compensation between staff level, middle management and executive management."
good,"Unfortunately, I found that MassMutual is lead by a lot of self-important managers that took pleasure in the failure of their staff.   Clear direction was often lacking, and there were always a ton of meetings to talk about the meetings."
good,Handling client calls. Running reports and analyzing data. Attend meetings to increase efficiencies. Love working with my clients. Enjoy helping them and developing great working relationships.
good,Working at MassMutual was a very prototypical corporate environment. The bulk of the day was taking care of your daily tasks sitting behind a monitor in a cubical. Unfortunately my hiring manager was let go as apart of round of layoffs last year and the new one was remote on the East Coast. It was very tough afterwards obtaining direction and proper resources. The hardest part of the day was the mundane routine.
good,"There's a tension between some of senior leadership's desire to transform the company into an innovation-focused enterprise, and a culture that rewards caution, consensus, and penalizes 'failure'."
good,"Very difficult job. There is a lack of training. You are expected to just learn on the fly and just to figure it out. They are all nice people and seemingly the senior advisers are very successful. However, they don't seem to care if you succeed, or fail. They don't even notice if you don't come into the office. Must be 100% independent and have some money in the bank to comfortably give this company a try with 100% commission. Not a bad opportunity, but not a great job. It appears to have high-turnover which is also an industry standard. If your not passionate about Finance and Insurance. It would be wise to avoid this in order to be happy."
good,"The people and management are great, unfortunately you must have a great network in order for you to succeed. The pay is unstable and in order for you to maintain your lifestyle, I kept my second job to ensure that all of my bills were to get paid."
good,"This was a temporary assignment to clean Mass Mutual database, input updated Client information into the company database, calculated low death benefits, in doing so, I was taught to round of the dollar amount the nearest whole dollar amount, turns out I was being taught wrong, The person I was assigned to taught me wrong and all my work in calculated low death turned out wrong, When I explained that to my Supervisor he did nothing to correct the matter instead I was let go."
good,"In 10 years, have had 12 different managers.  "
good,"At first Mass Mutual Pacific seemed like it provided a great platform to acquire wealth.  However, I ended up getting suckered in and quickly realized they were selling me a dream."
good,Company is growing too fast and has little regard for the people that they employ.  Management has little insight into the day to day struggles and needs of the employees.  High numbers of contractors in PM and IT support positions.
good,"I am a Senior Computer Operator with extensive experience as a team member running a large data center. This also included running a remote data center located in London England. I have experience with Mainframe, Unix, Windows, report writing and Incident communication. My team supported MassMutual's IT infrastructure including Hardware and all applications. Our duties included batch monitoring and maintenance, hardware support, level one and level two support. My team also provided vendor support for hardware issues."
good,There really isn't any where to go in my position and MassMutual doesn't help with career advancement.  Too top heavy with too much management.
good,"This job is best suited for a season veteran with a book of clients that they are bring over. Otherwise it is definitely an uphill battle, with little to no training, and very minor help provided to new associates. Overall the experience was moderate because if you want to succeed you definitely have to learn quick or drown. and I was fortunate enough to learn quickly and have a fast start. Unfortunately 95% of the people that started with me were not as lucky and were forced out of the bushiness rather quickly."
good,"I don't know how this company makes money with their liberal employee policies. They pay project managers six figure salaries to work 6 hours a day or remotely or from home. The employees take such advantage of ""work from home"" it is incredible. Go to any mall, restaurant, or bar on a Friday afternoon and you will see all of them ""working from home"". It's unbelievable."
good,"Only positive, aggressive sales reps need apply. This job is not for everyone. You need to love to talk to people and work to get paid. No cushy salary here, you are on straight commission after 6 months. As in most Insurance related businesses, expect your employer to ask you to sell to your family and friends to get started (don't do it, you will regret it.)"
good,"Must hit quotas for massmutual"
good,"I learned a lot about the actual field of financial advising. On the other hand, interns had to cold call often, using a lot of their time working on those skills instead of going on meetings with senior advisers to get hands-on experience. I found it useful to obtain my insurance license and gain knowledge about the field, but the internship lacked experience in relationship-building and seeing how policies are presented and suggestions are performed."
good,"Unstable management, regular reorgs, and lack of remote working opportunities make this a difficult place for flexibility and career development. Choose wisely."
good,"For the most part, MassMutual was a good place to work.  Overtime and weekends were NOT available.  Lots of benefits being in the Home Office - Cafe', Credit Union, Store etc.  Uncertain future due to Reductions in Force."
good,"Lower pay than used to be. "
good,Goals changed frequently. Constantly Monitored. Office in my city was eventually closed down. Benefits plan and 401(k) plan was excellent. Offered a pension plan and retirement health insurance plan.
good,"As an intern you learn a lot from experienced financial experts, however, I only interned here and the lack of connections can count against you as that is the primary method of compensation."
good,The main problem with the retirement services division of MassMutual is one department does not know what the other is doing. Everyone has their own process yet none of the processes flow together. This causes a lot of frustration
good,"A typical sales environment. There is a lack of infrastructure and a lot of ""out of the blue"" surprises. Charlotte North Carolina management team worries about their bottom line and pretends to offer one-on-one support or true sales training. Take caution when researching this company. But they have a strong Whole Life product."
good,"There's nothing really wrong with MassMutual, but the culture is a bit ""old school"". The benefits are great, so there are a ton of people just sticking around waiting to retire. In general, the culture just lacks energy and people are scared to rock the boat."
good,"Regardless of how you view the world of financial service, you must accept that this is a sales job and as a financial advisor, rep, or simply life insurance agent, you are a salesman. Your income will depend on your willingness to call on an endless number of individuals and businesses to continue to build and develop a business. "
good,Good pay and benefits. Trying to build a collaborative culture with varying degrees of success. A lot of emphasis on outsourcing with not a great deal of support for continuing education and growth of existing  employees.
good,"Learned alot while in training in bank. Enjoyed the banking atmosphere alot. Met great people. Bank also had great sales incentives."
good,Firm with over 160 years of experience helping people build strong financial futures. A mutual company owned by policyowners making decisions with their long-term interests in mind. Their success is reflected in financial strength and have paid dividends to eligible participating policyowners since the 1860s.
good,"There is a lot of he said she said here. Management doesn't' listen to their directs, they pass them off on others because they are to busy and then wonder why employees ""don't get it"". 12-15 hour works days."
good,"I worked here as a contracted employee.  I enjoyed working there and being part of a team.  However it is very difficult to get hired as a full time employee there, at least in I.T.  I appreciate the opportunity that I was given while I was there."
good,Good company to work for. Great co workers. Middle management not so great. Lot of groups to be involved in. Lot of training and mentoring opportunities.
good,"Typical day consists of High Call Volume of participants requesting withdrawals, loans and more withdrawals from their retirement account  I would assume that most people want to save for retirement and not continuously remove money from the account. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with people calling all day every day expecting you to resolve the reason for calling within that one phone call."
good,"Due to staffing issues, the focus of the job I was to do changed drastically.  The original focus was to be the cleanup of the IT Asset inventory database and the definition of processes for IT Asset Management.  The staffing issues required that the IT Procurement function be augmented due to the extreme backlog.  The contract that I was hired for was abruptly terminated and the functional unit I was assigned to was dismantled."
good,Management does not share what is on their mind with the employees even in the town hall meetings diff picture is given than what comes out few weeks or months later. They tried to fill the gap but there are still so many layers between managers and the regular employees
good,Started out in sales... was promoted after setting records in first year. Turned out not to be all that glamorous...left for another opportunity
good,"The interview process was very similar to any other job interview I have had.  The company overall was a good company to work for, however it did not fit my needs in life."
good,Feel like they are trying to pivot too quickly and too much. Efforts to improve technology seem to trip up business and vice Versa. Hope the best but need to remember the people that got you into the Fortune 100
good,MassMutual was focused on quality productions while maintaining a solid work / life balance.  Management worked hand in hand with clients and the team to ensure the project goals were being met and everyone involved had an opportunity to contribute to the process.  Clients and Management always encouraged creativity and learning new things.
good,Our agents and brokers dropped like flies after the new owners took over. There was no longer the upbeat and positive atmosphere we all enjoyed before the take over.
good,"Mass Mutual constantly has high turnover, they are constantly going through company reorganizations and laying off great employees just so they don't have to pay a salary, The company will continue these traits until leadership realizes they need to create a plan beneficial to both the stakeholders and employees of the company"
good,"It was a great group of people, but there wasn't a lot of direction in terms of how to get clients.  You are made to rely very heavily on natural market with few leads."
good,"I like the people in Mass Mutual.  Most are nice and helpful.  There are few (2 old women) who has a wrong sense of entitlement.  "
good,"Work is fine and self directed as I brought over my own book of business. However, I was unprepared for the amount of time it involved between signing up a policy and getting it through underwriting."
good,"Training opportunities and job shadowing exist, however collaboration is near nonexistent, as is advancement opportunities.  There is a lack of ownership in job responsibilities.  Too much gossip and negativity.  There is a small percentage of people focused on continuous improvement and collaboration, however, we are in the minority.  Many good people have left to work for different companies.  Too much office politics and not enough budget to finance the continuous improvement projects and ideas."
good,performance based- timed- high high stress environment.  Appreciated training for series 6 but the multiple systems required to access even basic information for clients were difficult and often malfunctioning.  Since everything was timed and performance based on time and results- the anxiety and stress were too high.
good,"I processed applications, followed up on exams, client services.  I learned new business procedures.  Stress free environment.  Most enjoyable part was working for the 5 agents as their assistant."
good,Extremely fast paced do not apply if  you not able to withstand the pressure. Difficult agents.  Employees are monitored extremely.   Must be professional at all times
good,"Great for getting training and getting started in insurance business, but be prepared for low commission/compensation until you can grow your book of business. Must truly be ready to hit the pavement until you have enough clients to be able to live of commission only salary. Great people, good manager, but it's a sales position and it's insurance so be prepared financially, it you are just starting in the business as I was"
good,"A sales mill, nothing more.  Eat what you kill.  Generate your own business.  You have clients and connections?  Go to town and make a residual fortune.  You don't?  It's a tough go."
good,"The company has great management, that definitely knows what to focus on to motivate candidates to continue their individual journeys as financial professionals. However, the overall work-life balance and compensation is entirely up to the individual as its the same throughout the profession."
good,A typical day at work involved going to morning meetings for continued education in the financial services industry. This is a more independent working environment. The hardest part of the job was getting enough clients to generate the commission I desired. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible hours and schedule.
good,Life insurance company with excellent products and services to sell to assist clients in establishing and maintaining a broad base of financial security.
good,"MassMutual is a friendly culture to work in. The environment is collaborative and politics are minimal (although exists a in every organization). Many operational functions are outsourced, which makes it difficult to find answers and determine roles and responsibilities."
good,You never know when you are going to be paid on deals. Many promises non kept. Very hard to get questions answered. Agent charges change without notice.
good,Competitive workplace without the support needed to learn complex concepts for new employees. Corporate culture tense due to constant changes and layoffs.
good,Hard work and loyalty were rewarded with unnecessary layoffs and cutbacks.  Management layer needs a complete overhaul if the company wants to redeem their credibility.
good,MM is undergoing major changes internally in hopes of achieving expenses efficiencies and a larger market share.  MM is a very strong/solid company.
good,Typical day includes interviewing various employees to capture and record information for analysis to improve process. Prepares documentation and analysis of employee comments and action plan to provide effective resolution. Meets with management to discuss possible action plan to resolve issues and coordinating and conducts training classes on policy interpretation and proper procedures. Acts as a liaison between employee and management to address various situations as needed to foster a team culture corporate wide.
good,"I processed documents for New Business, Life Insurance for high end clients. The pace was always frantic and I felt as if I was a robot working under very stressful conditions until a predesignated about was completed.  Didn't matter the hours it took."
good,"The hardest part of the job was to make appointments and sell."
good,"Loved my coworkers, Management not so much.  Managers made decision about you job but don't know the work and not will to back you up."
good,"All The day consists of is making phone calls to set up meetings, then going to said meetings to try and sell Life, Disability and fixed annuities. Day in Day out, all the same."
good,My position there was only temporary. There was no room or growth or advancement within the company.
good,"Okay place to work. Operated switch board, and awaited further instructions from agents on requested pre-sales and sales proposals. Provided clerical support to office mgr and client service reps.. Learned what was important to individuals of various age groups when inquiring about life insurance and how to target those areas.."
good,"A typical day at work depends on how much you put into it. It can either be full of productive meetings and ""money-making"" activity or fluff."
good,A lot meetings that taught you the same thing over and over. After training you were pretty much on your own. Commute was 2 hours and they promised me that they would re locate me. After awhile I knew they were lying to me. Management tried to brainwash you. 
good,"What amazes me is that this company makes money.   They have a strong political group within management that makes decisions in their own interest.  The work from home policies are amazing.  How can a project manager be effective working from home 3 days a week?  Not to mention, any Friday, go to any mall, bar or restaurant in the afternoon and you will see MassMutual employees ""working from home"".  I guess answering emails on the blackberry is the definition of working from home.  Some people do this and get paid well, others work their butts off in no-win situations and get shown the door.  Other than that, it is a good place to be I guess."
good,"Fast paced working enviroment, under new management, freindly staff, hardest part of the job, not enough hours in the day, most enjoyable part of the day,the amount of cases approved in one day."
good,"Supporting various tax applications I got to understand the taxing process from a number of various angles. Corporate tax, premium tax, unemployment tax, state tax, 1099's, etc. Each of my co-workers had different specialties that came together with each of our positions. Although there were some structure to what we had to do each day a good portion of it meant there times when we were called upon to take of problems or situations that were not planned for. What I found most enjoyable was to identify the problem and research and determine what the problem was and how to fix it."
good,this was a great place to work. fun environment and very kind people. good internship experience. nothing bad to say here. Flexible work hours and good stuff
good,"I truly enjoy my work.  The opportunities given have been greatly appreciated.  Very proud of the services we provide for individuals, families and business owners."
good,"You will provide financial services, mainly insurance, but also investments if you are licensed, to leads that you generate for yourself. People who manage their time like a small business owner will have a greater chance to be successful."
good,"Mass Mutual Greater Philadelphia was beneficially experience because it helped me learn certain aspects of the financial industry that had remained unknown to me. After 10 months, I felt that it wasn't something that I could see myself doing long term and decided to leave."
good,"Corporately, the company is pretty good, but individual employees need a louder voice. There are still traces of covert racism that exist and need to be discussed and changes need to be made toward true respect of every one."
good,Good 2 yr experience. Met quite a few great people at the company. Good manager I worked for and great team that helped others. Nothing more to tell..
good,"very meh. decent salary, boring projects, management doesn't care about their directs and won't advocate anyone under them to advance. Non-existent office culture. Go here if you want to take it easy."
good,"Can be stable, but many talented people rotate in and out due to bureaucracy. Some are old fashioned and prohibit working from home. Also, life companies go up and down due to the market and may have frequent lay offs."
good,"MassMutual is a strong company though has driven its company to focus on its financials at the expense of the people who make the financials happen, create customer loyalty, and grow the company.  I have watched the company culture decline in the last 15 years."
good,I have had a good experience at this financial firm. I have met great and intelligent people during my time here so far and have built long-lasting relationships with some of my peers.
good,"It was more of a positive experience than a negative one working for MassMutual. The company eventually left the Memphis market leaving me without a job. However, I enjoyed working for the company and my former boss."
good,The typical day would be to learn your products and cold call. Very little training for what I believe is very important for families and individuals. I feel that is where this could of been better. You are first to call on your family and friends and then go after whomever. No real system there on how to do it and many people left. I spoke to one agent there and he said he has seen too much as they are hiring and seeing sticks around.
good,I had the pleasure to work here for over 20 years.   Flexible work schedule.    They only care about productivity and target a certain individual if they don't like you.
good,It was an ok place to work for. If you make friends an go to the seminars you can do really well. People are willing to help you and arent rude about it. Overall a frendly place to work.
good,Lack of salary not great for those with family to support.  Great training program.  Flexible scheduling.  Loved the idea of helping people secure their financial future.
good,Was told the position would transfer from contract to full-time within the first few months. Then was told they never actually intended to hire full-time for my position. A complete bait & switch.
good,"Each office runs differently, so you need to make sure you like the people in the office you will be working out of. It can be a great place to work, but it has to be a good fit for you."
good,"These experiences have taught me how to formulate solutions to issues, and lead and interconnect with people from different backgrounds. They also helped me manage my time efficient and shaped me into a good team player, leader and individual. I’m a highly disciplined, self-starter, and I grew the ability to execute assignments independently."
good,"Last minute requests to work with little to no notice. Throughout my time there, I was asked at the beginning of the month about shifts for upcoming events, but they were few and far between. Temps were hired, but would do little to help out. It was always difficul to find a manager if you needed one - I spent over half an hour walking around the building looking for someone when we needed one immediately."
good,Great place to start a insurance career for independent representatives.  Training was required only 1 day per week which allowed for great flexibility in the work schedule.
good,"Career advancement lacking, pay did not match market competitors and health benefits are awful. Too many layers of management - too many cooks in the kitchen."
good,"If it wasn't for my manager, would be the best place I ever worked. But because of the manager, I'll never go back. Very nice people and environment all around except for the manager I had"
good,"The advisors here want you to succeed, and will take more time from their days to educate you on what they did to succeed. They threw me into the role of a financial advisor and ultimately, the position did not seem to fit what I wanted. If youre up to sell yourself 24/7, for potential future reward, this is a good job for you."
good,Very hard to recruit for 100% commission jobs.  The work ethic in Memphis is poor and no one out of college wants 100% commission.  The Owner was never there
good,"portfolio building and clientele retention through conducting seminars and phone calls"
good,"It is extremely difficult to come into the field they specialize in when you have no experience. If you know what your'e doing, then it's a great company to work for. You can do well with them if you have a big book of business."
good,"Worked virtually, flexible schedule. Recruited potential sales agents for life insurance. Used multiple systems to locate agents. Worked closely with management team."
good,"A typical day is that you have the option to go to work either at 7:30 a.m. or any time after until 9 a.m. This is excellent if you have children.  You can get a cup of coffee or breakfast.  The managers do not mind if you go to the cafeteria.  If you need a break, you can go down to the mini mall, relax for a few minutes and then go back to work.  Work can be very busy depending in what department you work.  Management is great.  I did enjoy working at the company at one time.   I liked that they have a credit union, a store, and nice cafeteria.  The vacation time is awesome.  I learned a lot about customer service, dealing with banks, and how to reconcile accounts.  The company has integrity and it is an honest company.  It was a second family to me. Unfortunately, they have too many lay off."
good,"Mass Mutual was a nice company to work for, but the commute was outrageous. After time went by, I wanted to take a different career path.  The people who worked there were great."
good,"I find MassMutual to be a good place to work, but their plan to relocate to springfield is causing me to look elsewhere.  The benefits they offer could be better, but they give you plenty of vacation time and competitive pay"
good,"i learn a lot on how to persuade and insist on people, write professional emails and letters, provide information about the company and its benefits. And also post jobs."
good,A decent place to work if you can afford to work off of commission. The culture is very macho and bro-like. You will make very little money initially while building your book of business.
good,MassMutual had a productive workplace environment with many learning and growth opportunities. Lunch & Learns once a week helped refresh important concepts and skills.
good,"Lots of support and training, and promotes team work with fellow sales agents. Overall, it was a positive place to work but not recommended for new-grads or beginners in the industry as  new sales person would need to work more than 40 hours per week in the beginning to earn a decent living. Salary is commission-based."
good,"Difficult to discern how performance is measured.  Feedback, either positive or negative, is infrequent.  If your vertical has a successful leader, you are likely to have autonomy and funding for your work."
good,Can be rocky due to constant changes and layoffs but most of the workers are good people and helpful. Very willing to answer questions and bring along young employees.
good,"Mass Mutual is a great Whole life company, unfortunately they do not understand the brokerage business. I worked with a bunch of great people, if you're looking for a Solid career insurance company to work for this would be a great fit."
good,"There is plenty of opportunity within the model that is offered within Mass Mutual in developing a practice within the franchise.  With a strong emphasis on insurance solutions, there is also strong collaboration and commitment to overall financial planning to incorporate needs facing other disciplines within the realm of wealth management, including platforms and additional resources through the broker/dealer relationship and affiliated organizations."
good,I worked at massmutual for approximately 6 months. They had a good training program and offered flexible options in terms of schedules. I left the company because that type of job did not fit my personality.
good,"nice place to work most of the managers do not micromanage but, there are a few who want you to sign out tor breaks.  They are very good at training but there computer systems are old."
good,"Very easy over night job that had regular check ups on offices, closets and cubicles. Making sure the building was clear at night when it needed to be because no one was able to be there."
good,The training was good and the interview process explained the position very clearly. I knew my expectations and there were not any surprises after I accepted the position.
good,Very busy place to work.  24/7/365 call center.  Nice people to work with.  Management cares about its employees.  I would recommend to anyone who likes a fast paced environment.
good,"Many of the people who worked for me were very fearful that their jobs would be eliminated at any time. I was disappointed in the way information was disseminated to my subordinates and how many of them did not believe in the company values or goals."
good,When I was approached to consider another job with another company it took months before I finally decided to leave.  It has been some time since I worked there so I cannot be specific.  I liked working there and had to commute over an hour to get there and never thought twice about it
good,"The retirement savings and high deductible plan are excellent. Offers $500/ yr Live Well incentives for keeping stress under control, eating healthily, exercising, etc. Lots of resources to help you perform well in your role IF you know where to find it. Need to dig for these among endless intranet tools and forms. The tech is horrendous with upgrades delaying for YEARS. Very little honest communication from senior execs rendering direct management struggling to maintain consistent communications to employees. Most direct managers are a pleasure to work with and genuinely want employees to thrive. Diversity nonexistent. Good intentions to improve processes and communication (ex. Lean Six training) with no follow-through. MANY are related (siblings, parents, even spouses) so watch who you choose to discuss with whom. Widespread, unexpected layoffs in 2016. Operational budget continues to decrease."
good,"MassMutual, the Northern New England Agency has been a wonderful place to work. The fast pace and excitement of my esponsibilities have kept me on my toes and challenged every day.  I have met incredible people working here and created friendships that will last a lifetime."
good,Wasn't there long enough to get a feel for the company post acquisition. Wish I could offer more in this review but I'm not in a position to offer anything impactful.
good,"This part time jobs good for the time being to get started and familiar with the working fields. But its was not what I was looking for, but I had familiar faces while working with co workers during this part time job. So it wasn't difficult for to get comfortable with new people or co workers"
good,This is a typical insurance commission based job.  You have to do everything for yourself and also pay for it.  This job is only a fit for a select few people.  Good luck.
good,"Systems Administration- maintain operations of all windows servers, focus on all aspects of Windows admin. Using VMWare build and modify servers according to Client specifications."
good,"Located in a great location.  (Rookwood Exchange) We have a fancy building with a gym, rooftop terrace, our very own beer tap in our office, a private patio and canvas painting done by our children and grandchildren."
good,I was in frontline management and the operations areas were quite lean therefore a little difficult to spend time on more value added customer service focused efforts while still getting the day to day work done.
good,Insurance group servicing the Dallas / Fort Worth area.  Great training ground for new college grads that want a career in insurance.
good,"I worked in the Life Insurance Call Center Division, answering inbound calls from customers and agents. Management is all about the numbers. I enjoyed working with my (team) co-workers, and learning  from each other. The hardest part of the job was initiating death claims."
good,This company has awesome training. The issue was the old platform of financial services. There isn't enough support and guidance though. You're a plug in.
good,A great place to work. Open to new ideas and thoughts from employees. Opportunities for growth. Employees needs taken into consideration
good,"MassMutual is working hard to improve operations and customer service.  It is a big change for a company that has done things the same way for decades.  The focus on the customer is excellent and there are some great people working hard to change the culture.  The old legacy systems are difficult to work with but more importantly, the old legacy thinking is holding back the progress."
good,Good place to work.  Enjoyed receiving a bonus every year I worked there.  Would recommend it as a place to work.  Has great amenities.
good,"Helped develop customized wealth management plans for individuals, families and businesses while understanding client situations, goals, and investment period. I focused on analyzing client finances and consulting future plans for investments during certain market conditions."
good,"commission, hard work, high earning potential. good for fresh out of college or good salesmen. will require a lot of patience and unpaid hard work in order to set up a good business for yourself"
good,A typical day at work is attending meetings and collaborating with other intelligent professionals.  The hardest part of my day is when I need to communicate bad news.  The most enjoyable part of my day is to go home.
good,I started with Mass Mutual after being laid off from a job that I had for ten years. I wanted to try to be my own boss and start my own business. They did provide good training and the support staff was great. I wished they would provide a mentor for new agents who are in career transition.
good,It allowed me to grow as a professional as well as a person. My days were long but I learned a lot through the General Agent and other staff. The training for a new adviser is very good and the leadership was good in most parts. They try and help you succeed if you were one of there favorites in the office. But it still was the good ol boy network so if they didn't see your growth fast they left you high and dry.
good,"Good company to work for.  Your awarded and recognize for your hard work, which is a plus."
good,"Provided administrative support for various department/division heads: Assistant General Counsel, Real Estate Section Head, and four Real Estate and Securities Attorneys."
good,Would verify if clients had medical and dental insurance &  what kind of coverage they had.  archives medical & dental records.
good,The MassMutual division I was in handled short/long term disability polices.  We were underwriting large groups of employee's and handling the sales support for the representatives.
good,"Great as far as servicing employment needs however, communication is strickly too main stream not enough employee-employer communication."
good,A typical day at work is a very busy one. Each day your met with new challenges to over come and learn from. I have learned a lot about Life and disability Insurance products and how they work.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see agents excel and do well in their careers.  You feel a great sense of accomplishment to know that you played a very small role in their success.
good,It was hard to hire new people and watch them struggle because of the lack of training.
good,"Call to confirm medical, dental and workers compensation claims. Hospital verification of medical procedures covered and dental procedures covered. Process and pay claims. Pay workers compensation claims."
good,"MassMutual is a great company but, I needed a base salary rather than working on commission only."
good,"Very few people make it in this industry - I wasn't one of them. If you want to sell life insurance independently without a base income, then Mass Mutual is a great company to do that with. It was not for me."
good,This job is centered around bringing in new clients and being able to sell them products. There is no salary here so be sure you can bring people in for the long-run. The company has a great product line and good compensation for producers but that doesn't mean anything unless you can produce. If you're new to the business look for good mentors that will give hands-on experience.
good,It is nice company. Provides good facilities and work balance. People are very good to work with them. they need to improve their technologies to upgrade.
good,Great work life balance at MassMutual. Management needs to listen how changes impact employees and empower individuals to make choices for their professional growth.
good,"I worked in IT at MassMutual for 2 years. In that time hundreds of individuals were layed off and people were in contracted positions (no benefits, less pay, etc.) for two + years. Instead of hiring them full-time, they kept them on as contractors to avoid paying extra. The morale throughout the company is lacking but it is especially bad in IT where even the most experienced professionals worry about  losing their jobs."
good,MassMutual allows their advisors the freedom to work with whatever carrier best fits their client.  The management is supportive and they mean well. The opportunity to succeed is here if you are willing to work for it.
good,"great work life balance, wfh home option, very relaxed environment. Lot of work going on the digital platform development and Data center. It is a nice comoany to work for specially if you are looking to work in Agile environment."
good,I liked being in management and help the new agents learn about qualified retirement plans to sell to business owners.  By educating them about qualified plans they were able to go and make larger insurance and investment sales.
good,Employment experience varies depending on the division you're in. Methods for supporting strategic direction not always clear. Invest money in efforts but don't always follow through. My division not as aware of employees skills and accomplishments - reduces ability to advance. A wide variety of employee benefits outside of the standard.
good,Great work/life balance. Terrible benefits package (expensive and doesn't cover much). Compensation is on the lower end of what competitors offer. CEO/Senior Leadership know what direction they need to be headed in but middle/lower management can't seem to always execute.
good,Company has great benefits.  You can move up or into another position within the company.  Do a good job and you can move faster.  Culture is a conservative culture.  Depending on the role you are in the work life balance is good.
good,"Good place to work, nice campus.  Generally, a good place to work.  Lots of restructuring and reorganization.  Might not be as strong in the market place as in the past."
good,I worked at Mass Mutual Temporarily as a consultant to assist with the acquisition the Retirement Business from the Hartford. During that period the assignment was fast pace with very little direction from Manager who also was a consultant. I had to quickly learn to navigate the key areas in a relatively short period of time which was a challenge.
good,"I started here out of college. It was a great culture and environment. I made lots of friends there, enjoyed the job and had a very good experience there."
good,A highly political organization.  Syracuse office had a poor reputation based on management and drug abuse.  MassMutual has difficulty competing in the current financial services marketplace because of its poor products.  Currently under several class action law suits for fraudulent products.
good,"The company staff lacked work ethic-they didn't pay my commission over two months due to internal staff change and gave me run around, which was very frustrating."
good,"Overall, this job, like every job has its ups and downs. A lot of over promises under deliver. Compensation was not very good for the amount of work and responsibilities came to you on a daily bases. Best thing was the advantage we got when it came to our kids."
good,"Great job security if you're good at sales.  All commission.  Very flexible schedule - no one's on top of you or making sure that you're working, but you will not earn a dime if you can't sell."
good,"Manager is excellent, cares about staff, work/life balance, team -oriented, team focus and overall experience is rewarding thus far. Typical day is dealing with clients externally. Very frustrating however when client work against you rather than work with you, makes the relationship you are trying to build very difficult."
good,"Great vacation package, team atmosphere, management very involved and wants the best for employees overall. Lower pay than most insurance companies in the area."
good,"MassMutual is a good place to start your career if you live in the Western Mass or Northern Connecticut area.  Initially you have room for growth, but as time goes on the opportunities for advancement are limited.  They have a very good benefits package, with exception of their health plan, which is a high deductible plan.  The culture there has become much more like a stock company then a mutual company over the past few years.  High workloads, insufficient staff in many parts of the organization and a new policy called MassMutual Way have impacted morale negatively.  Easy commutes to either of their main offices, many education opportunities, strong commitment to diversity and lots of opportunities for working women."
good,High pressured environment but opportunity to make alot of money! Very nice place to wok
good,"MassMutual Southern CA agency is a great place to work. The people are engaging, the work is rewarding and the training is top-notch. "
good,I work at my own pace. I am building my own practice. Management helps give ideas and different marketing strategies. The hardest part of my job is finding new people to talk to. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that you have made a difference in a family's life and have helped them plan a little bit for their future.
good,Working there was nice. The people were great but it's a compensation based job so you get as much as you work. Must have great work ethic and the drive to succeed.
good,The management team at the Miami office were very helpful to my growth as a young professional and life insurance agent. They had great training methods.
good,"Progressive"
good,Great place to work if you are an up and coming intern or someone new to IT. I would recommend it to anyone looking for contract work. Good vibe and benefits.
good,Manager for this assignment was phenomenal.  It was an area of work life balance.  The culture was a strategic team environment.  The environment was awesome.
good,"Home off is in Springfield, MA and for those employees there is a terrific campus, lots of opportunity to grow and advance.There are a lot of employee business groups, support of diversity, care for community and a strong desire to help the customer."
good,A financially strong company that provides many different work opportunities and solid benefits.  The management team encourages staff to feel empowered to make decisions in driving daily assignments.
good,"In need of management changes, strategy changes, and certain areas are behind in technology.  Newer groups/tactics have been developed, but not deployed or available throughout all organizations to help assist. "
good,"At times the floor can be stressful but not as crazy as the stock market. I cannot speak for all departments but my department is not that bad on a day to day basis, of course work will always be work, but it is a good place."
good,Working for MassMutual providing me with a new knowledge of sales.  The senior advisors worked closely with me to ensure my success. The training programs they had designed greatly improved my probability of gaining new clients.
good,"This was a part-time position.  My typical day was to meet and greet clients as they exited the elevator to meet with brokers and receive deliveries.  I managed the switchboard and did a small amount of data entry for my supervisor.  It was a fun environment that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Unfortunately the company changed hands and there were a number of lay offs.  I was one of them.  That was the hardest part, being walked out the door without opportunity to say goodby to anyone.  It was no one's fault, just one of those things."
good,Large company with excellent room for advancement. Excellent benefits packages. Unlimited income potential and career growth. Extremely diverse employer.
good,"Being a mutual company allows MM to have its heart in the right place; with its customers, since they own the company."
good,This position has a lot of potential for a hard worker. Flexible hours and great experience can be attained. Also a great chance to be trained and work with a mentor.
good,It is a great place to learn about life insurance and disability insurance. You get a complete and weekly education once you get to be a career agent. You learn from the best financial advisors of the company and stay up to date with the insurance industry.
good,I enjoy the work/life balance this job allows me to have. It's a good place to start your career in sales. You learn a lot and gain a lot of experience in sales depending on your coach/manager.
good,"You have the full control of your job and life, the compensation is good enough, the manager was so polite and skillful. The location is very good."
good,"-Extensive training that assists in your growth as a business owner"
good,"Worked there for 23 years and thought I would retire there, however, due to a reorganization, I was job eliminated. Most enjoyable were the people."
good,"Typical broker dealer.  Benefits they offer aren't great, all high deductible health care plans.  Compensation is typical.  Work/life balance is exceptional, though.  Management was great."
good,"I had the skillsets, qualifications, attitude. Nobody gave me the opportunity even though I networked with a lot of folks. I would've liked to work with this Company for many years. For not getting hired I had to move out of state."
good,"It's hard to rate this job because it is a self starter company.  Walking in you have no leads, only the people you know, and you must find your own clients that way or through recommendations.  The position is commissions only so you have no financial security until you've established business over time.  The company provides lots of resources to help you obtain your insurance licenses, and how to be a better sales person.  Everyone is very friendly.  Just not a place you can walk into and not expect to give yourself 150% every day to make it successfully."
good,"Training classes early morning, cold calling and case design for the rest of the day. You typically go on meeting's twice a week to have a approach talk and find the clients wants and needs for their financial future."
good,A typical day at work is answering a high volume of calls all day. \There is no way that you can ever be perfect in this position. Quality is continuously changing and marking points off for things that are not in the quality handbook. Culture is okay. The hardest part of the job is lack of support from peers and management. There is no enjoyable part of the job. Have fun staying on the phone for 20 minutes trying to help people log into their accounts.
good,I am a personal assistant for a few agents. There are days that there are not of enough time to complete all paperwork needed which makes for a lot of stress. My employers are extremely flexible when I need to adjust my schedule. Not enough pay and no benefits.
good,Great benefits but 100% commission job. If you do not have a great natural market here in the Portland Area it will be extremely difficult for you to get clients. It was a great work environment.
good,"Volunteer work for health services, the duties requested did not intale getting familiar with company in a whole. I learned how to obtain vital signs."
good,"I began as the mail clerk and due to my desire to stay busy and learn, I was promoted to policyowner service in my seventh week of employment."
good,"During a week, we have daily meeting in the morning and every Wednesday we have wholesalers visits and share with the group different new products and best practices"
good,Looking for new obstacles. I need new challenges and things to keep me focused. I have always wanted to get into an industry where  there is always opportunity for advicement/
good,Wrote life and health insurance.  I would meet with different types of clients to see how I can help them with a safe and secure financial future
good,This is a strictly commission position.  If you don't have a large pool of potential customers already you will have a hard time.  Management will not help.  They are there to find as many guys like me to sell so they can make money.
good,"Job was stressful with a lack of work life balance. Role was ill defined and could cover a multitude of items that were out of scope and employee control. "
good,"The staff here work hard to drive results to meet deadlines to deliver to internal and external customers. "
good,"Working here was a good experience but the lack of a social environment led to little innovation, team collaboration and advancement within the department."
good,They offer several classroom training options.  Not enough real life training examples.  They don't provide leads for new associates and that can make it difficult for young agents starting out to build a significant business and make money.
good,"A typical day for me would be fast paste and very upbeat and i would be working with many team members, i learned how to multi task in many places. The management was bad could have done better they would talk about people. The hardest part about working there was seeing managers talk about employess in a bad manner and be unprofessional. My favorite part was serving customers at the event."
good,This is far superior to other insurance venders in the financial industry.
good,"They have a gift shop, Starbucks, food court cafeteria, full gym, barber, medical clinic that see you at no cost, credit union, post office, beauty salon, dry cleaner and masseuse. Food trucks come during the year nd indie farms market. A lot going on."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Flex time, work from home. Extremely busy schedule filled with phone calls, production, e-mails, boards, meetings, huddles etc."
good,"The management is good"
good,"MassMutual has a very supportive management. It is a high energy, high intensity sales environment. It can be hard to survive in a 100% commission scenario, however. I truly enjoyed working with all of my colleagues there."
good,Get in early and take calls. At the end of the day be put on the spot to come in earlier the next day to take calls all day.
good,Your work environment depends on the agent you work for. Assistants are employed by the agent and not the corporate office. Benefits available only if the agent offers it. Home Office support is not the best when needing information for clients. Unwillingness of older agents to step into the technology age.
good,"Massmutual is a good company , some management needs to be looked at , don’t always have the job security feeling , seems like every couple of years they lay off so not sure where you stand.  Health benefits very expensive and not to many options, besides that good company with good morals ."
good,"The company does some things well and other things poorly. They offer on-site cafeteria, coffee shop, and small shop. There are other services available such as a salon, dry cleaning, farmers market, and regular visits from outside vendors. These provide convenience. There are business resource groups (formerly employee resource groups) for various aspects of diversity and inclusion efforts."
good,"While this job can be incredibly rewarding, this is not the best career path to begin right out of college. It simply relied on knowing a mature market that is seemingly out of reach to a younger person."
good,"My overall experience with MassMutual has been great! Networking is easy, people are friendly. They have great programs to join while in the company. Not to mention that they have everything you could ever want in the building such as huge cafeteria that you can get almost anything to eat in. Dry cleaning, store, hair dresser, barber, car insurance, credit union, any postal needs, etc. Not to mention education. Very pro education. Co-workers are great and so were the customers that I was able to help."
good,"MassMutual is an outstanding firm.  I was a captive agent able only to sell MassMutual products.  If a client does not care for NIKE shoes, you need to able to offer REEBOKS.  I had no such luxury,"
good,The need for insurance agents is not growing.  Why deal with a insurance agent when you can buy insurance online.
good,"Mass Mutual was my first job in financial services. They treated me well.  It was a different type of sales job. I just never felt comfortable speaking to clients about their Money. It was a 100% commission  job, and with family "
good,Lack of coordination amongst business units.  Current expansion to Boston is increasing cost base during a time of focussing on efficiency.  This seems inconsistent.
good,Like many companies there is a lot of politics that get in the way of good decisions. Company culture is moving forward by listening to the millennial group.
good,Started this career later in life. Being  an NewYorker in Houston posed a few obstacle. People were nice. Just wasn't a fit.   I enjoy a more collaborative work environment.
good,"They are few teams but manager takes everything even though its all commission based. If I don't provide customer information to their manager, they forced their team members to get them."
good,"It was a good company to work for, unfortunately, my General Agent is more concerned with his bottom line rather than building a positive and productive environment so that he and his agents  has a better chance to succeed."
good,Overall this is a sales position. One will get what they put into it. There is no base salary 100% commission based. If one makes their marks then it is very lucrative if not then..... Good training and experience.
good,As a compliance supervisor the job required me to supervise all admitted applications for accuracy and make sure they were compliant with all applicable federal and state laws before submiting them to our head quaters for processing.
good,"Great opportunity to learn"
good,"My feeling is that the office staff relied upon their experience so much that they had a difficult time relating that to new associates. I relate it to asking a former batting champ for hitting tips, and that person not being willing to give you the advice you asked for due to the fact that one day you might become a good hitter and people would praise your style, not his.  Financial services industry in general is difficult to break into, but it can be done with the proper"
good,"This was a fun place to work in the past. Lately, the culture has moved to the ""all work and no play"" mentality. Picnics and get-togethers are a thing of the past. Unless you do your job plus your boss' job, you will not be considered for a new position. There are no ""Promotions"" unless you are a manager or VP going up to ""Senior"" VP."
good,Enjoyed interaction with individuals at various levels and areas. Had ability to take classes to increase learnings. Decent benefits with a number of amenities on site.
good,MassMutual Carolinas has positioned itself where they have a smaller family oriented day-to-day environment backed with a full suite of products and services from one of the worlds largest insurance companies.  They provide the necessary resources to build successful advisory based practices.
good,"Depending on Leadership, an agent can end up staying a producer or be considered for other leadership positions. Favoritism and politics is factored heavily as the system operates on an Agency System and not a Managerial based system."
good,"When I began at MassMutual I was on a team of 25 actuaries and two support staff. That support staff was an Admin Assistant and a Marketing Communications Consultant. Having an actuarial manager that did not believe in the value-add of marketing was challenging to work with. However, corporate MassMutual is excellent and drives a stable successful company, they are in the midst of a culture change and should have been informed that culture change is not for all employees and needs to be walked out rather than suddenly sprung on employees. Especially in legacy organizations such as financial services or insurance. The new Boston office is going to be very nice."
good,"A good professional company to work for.  Offers excellent benefits and flexible work hours, inclusive, and is a good place for working mothers. They are very flexible on work schedules as well."
good,"The tests are not easy, you have to be a licensed insurance agent in order to fill out the applications for clients, this test is easier than the financial test but both require a lot of study.  Typically, this is the hardest part of the job, the rest was administrative.  I would have to contact outside entities and get license renewal info and sometimes that was a minor annoyance."
good,Line of business I supported was stressful and resistant to change. The executive leadership team was overly conservative with micromanaging tendencies
good,pleasant place to work good benefits salary is lacking behind industry standards . have high expectations but they dont always give you the tools needed to get the job done.
good,MassMutual was good to work for but it was time to expand my job prospects and move in a different direction. Why do i need to fill this out i no longer work for the company.
good,I've worked many different leaders within the company and many are willing to support you in your growth and development goals. Great place to work for.
good,Overall decent company but very political iwhere leadership stands and they feel their employees should be the same. Its kind of weird to hear your CEO state who and who not to vote for.
good,"The company does some things well and other things poorly. They offer on-site cafeteria, coffee shop, and small shop. There are other services available such as a salon, dry cleaning, farmers market, and regular visits from outside vendors. These provide convenience. There are business resource groups (formerly employee resource groups) for various aspects of diversity and inclusion efforts."
good,"Enjoyed working at MassMutual very much! Managers cared about about employees and tried to provide tools needed to do a good job. "
good,Your schedule--Your responisibility  Yiou set your own pace. education is provided.   You and you alone are the master of your destiny.Management willing to assist in your career development.
good,This is a fast paced environment and we worked a lot on the computer and called agents and agencies. My peers were nice people and we all worked together.
good,"Good company. Strong training. Adequate office support. Joint work encouraged. Entrepreneurial mindset needed. Hunter mentality needed. Must have great prospecting ability,"
good,Help customers with their insurance needs.  Constant challenges keeps the job entertaining.  Continuous training helps to ensure employees are current with all regulations.
good,Growth and diversified company meeting challenges and changes in a growing and changing market place.  Aging home office leaders that needed new faces and new ideas which has happened since my departure from the company.
good,The company has a working standard which included work life balance to a certain extent but after getting new manager in the department it disappeared and went against all of the companies values and the manager was poor at best.  I enjoyed my time there for the most part and put forth a great effort and gave them my all.  It is a manager who makes the company and therefore would not recommend it to anyone else unless the management team changed.
good,The people that work at MassMutual are knowledgeable and friendly.  They are very centered on following company procedures.  Great company to work for.
good,I was interested in learning to be a financial advisor without having to sell immediately to family members until I was comfortable with my own knowledge . I was told I would learn through shared clients and grow my business. I was blatantly lied to and pushed to sell to family members within 2 weeks of getting my series licenses.
good,"great place to work if you have an extensive social network 25 to 34, 100k plus, love insurance and annuities ect.  Not the job for me.  No base salary"
good,Excellent and collaborative work environment. excellent products. Management was first class and the proximity to my home was a big plus. Would work for company again.
good,"Great experience on team.  Some leadership with great industry experience.    Challenging to get started and may need some start up capital.   High ceiling, but this industry has a low success rate."
good,Mass Mutual Greater Philadelphia is great company with plenty of resources and support for anyone seeking a career in financial services. Just be ready to work hard and to devote a lot of time to the business.
good,"this is a good company to work for, as long as you keep up your learning and get your tasks completed to its final destination. With this company, if you say your going to do something, get it done."
good,It was a great sales experience with excellent training. My day began with reading emails and coming up to speed with any changes that would affect my productivity. Next I would review my prospects for the day and week. Call and make appointments. Get out of the office to talk clients. The most enjoyable part of my day was selling a client a product that would improve their life and add value.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to work cross teams (not silos) to deliver work products.  This allowed most employees to have many experiences within the financial report and investment accounting areas.
good,"While working as a records clerk, then eventually a customer service representative, I learned the ins and outs about life insurance. I wanted to become an insurance underwriter as a result."
good,This company has a great history with local ties.  The company is diversified with room to grow.  Ability to move around the country for other opportunities.
good,"Learned new things like how to handle pressure when you are near to deadline, work from home. This was a nice place to improve skills in Unix/Linux system Engineer that makes me confident."
good,"Although I do like working at MassMutual, I have found that the salary range is not on par with industry competitors.  Although I had a great experience with management, I found the overall company morale low."
good,When I worked at the Commonwealth Financial Group it was an exciting time.  We had several new program rollouts that I was responsible for and the Management Team worked efficiently together for the good of the Agency.
good,"- supportive working environment "
good,Mass Mutual promotes an entrepreneurial environment where your potential is unlimited.  The hardest part of the job is constantly finding new clients and getting started.
good,"I learned something new every day about the insurance industry (process, products, etc.).  Enjoyed working with brokers and still have a great deal of respect for former colleagues"
good,Management clearly establishes steps to achieve success. Mentors are readily available and always able to provide assistance and guidance throughout the entire career sampling progam. On-board training and Contract A schooling were very valuable and helpful.
good,I think MassMutual is a great company to work for. There are lots of opportunities for growth and development if the individual wants to do so.
good,"I officially worked for MassMutual until I was contracted out. The employee benefits were excellent but it seems like they were clearing house of workers who were soon to be retired. Made me kind of weary of job security if I were to stay there that long. But overall, I enjoyed it there and they are very diverse and acknowledge akk groups of people."
good,"Good company, small not much room for growth.  Managed employees at the front desk as well as coordinated group rooms.  Checked in guests, answered phones & emails, also inspected meeting rooms."
good,"I worked 11+ years, starting in the Service Center and moving to Quality Assurance. it was at Mass Mutual that I learned the insurance business - from servicing active policies, through the claims process. An excellent place to learn the business."
good,"Normally, all employees work their duties as assigned. The ambient seems nice, most of the time. Regular days Monday to Friday 8:00am to 6:00pm. Business is out on holidays."
good,My role gave me the opportunity to learn a variety of skills and develop in areas which I had not had experience in before.
good,"This is a great company to get experience at, they offer ample paid time off and a decent retirement plan. However, the salary is not even close to competitive."
good,"You get what you work for, plain and simple.  There is a lot of freedom in what you want to accomplish because you are your own boss.  The hardest part of the job for me is finding prospects to meet.  You need to be getting in front of 12-15 people a week in order to survive.  Everyone is really nice and I loved the work environment but the job is sink or swim."
good,"This is a results-oriented general agency where the top producers are very successful. An Agency where staff, management, and producers work together to fulfill the needs of the clients."
good,"A typical day includes prospecting or name gathering for future clients, making calls to set up appointments, running appointments, networking, writing and delivering business."
good,"•	Executed test cases in Quality center."
good,Excellent work enviroment professional and customer oriented.
good,Mass Mutual needs to step up their process front to enhance their customer support.
good,"Working for Spectrum Financial Group was a lot of fun.  It was a positive work environment and encouraging place to work.  A typical day would be to meet with my manager and go over my goals for the day as well as talk about my past and current activity.  I learned the Insurance industry is a tough but yet rewarding.  You get to make a positive advancement in another persons life.  Not only for one client but for his/her family.  Management was easy to deal with because of all the encouragement and support you get.  The hardest part of the job is the rejection.  Knowing this is a good product because not only do you believe in it, you also have used the products.  You have to get a thicker skin and realize it is not personal.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you had just made a difference in another persons life."
good,"Financially stable insurer. Founded in 1851, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company is an American mutual life insurance company with 1800 offices and 13 million clients worldwide."
good,This was a great place to start my professional career.  The people were nice and knowledgeable about insurance and investment products.
good,"A typical day involves management of several teams who implement new technology capabilities for Field offices, directing the teams' activities, and driving necessary decisions relative to scope, as well as cost/benefit parameters.  This level of management also requires consideration of Home Office processes that need to be changed in order to maximize efficiency gains of the new technology.  The goal is to implement the new technology well ahead of competitors, to achieve market and financial advantage."
good,This was an environment where I worked with many people and personalities.
good,Massmutual is a solid insurance company with great founding values.  The industry is not for everyone.
good,Very good company with interesting technology and management challenges.
good,"A typical day can evolve many task such as reviewing claim files, applications,processing payments, reviewing claim forms, returning calls, answering calls attending meetings just to name a few."
good,Work at MassMutual for about 12 years. That pretty much sums it up. The environment is challenging and the people are good to work with.
good,Sandler Sales Training
good,"During a typical day I would monitor my email (all day) and address any and all problems that were sent my way. While completing any requests via email I would also take incoming calls from both agents and underwriters regarding a client's policy or pending policy. If an underwriter had a problem while trying to obtain information about a client for the possible policy I would then assist that underwriter until problem was solved and the information was received. In addition to my other daily duties I would also share information with other brokerages in the express purpose of making sure the client had all possible packages available for their choosing. The hardest part was getting through my three week training period. I so badly wanted to live up to expectations and then when I passed those three weeks, I wanted to exceed them. I personally enjoy learning new things, working with new people, and exceeding expectations."
good,A typical day would involve prospecting and reviewing potential clients. I would reevaluate client's current financial course of action and come up with possible improvements. Everybody that I worked with was extremely friendly and helpful. Made some friends for life. Hardest part of job is coping with the ups and downs.
good,"Coworkers are very supportive, and definitely there is family feel.  I would still be working there if I was not working on an outdated system, which is being sunsetted."
good,"MM strives for an inclusive and diverse company culture that tries to balance being employee and customer-centric. I only worked there as a temp for a few months and quickly learned that there is a divide between employees and temp workers. It would be a great company to get your foot in the door for a full time position but the good positions tend to go to internal applicants. Not enough good opportunities are offered to external applicants unless you have a connection in the company and even then, the best opportunities are hard to land."
good,"Lots of meeting,  Fun and tight project timelines and some of the manager and pretty good. if you are good at what you do you will be fine in this company."
good,Leadership do take the time to listen to concerns and attempt to make changes for quality of life and efficiency. I learned how to better work with a team and how to collaborate in a professional setting.
good,"A typical 9 hr day for a business analyst starts with attending scheduled meetings with business SME's and stakeholders, documentation, review meetings to complete requirements. I gained lot of knowledge about various insurance products and several initiatives across MassMutual."
good,"MassMutual is a great company and it really has a lot to offer.  However, your job is only as great as the person you report to.  After 6 months working for the best manager I've ever had she was promoted.  They brought in someone with almost no experience managing people and he was a micromanager.  He was so abrasive he made members of my staff cry."
good,"I felt the team and management was present with all the resources available to grow, and move forward in your career. On-site training as well as plenty of certification to gain additional knowledge as well."
good,"Mass Mutual Center is excellent for multicultural work experiences."
good,This is a COMMISSION ONLY JOB but the people help you succeed but lots of work for no pay...if your not pulling down big numbers after 6 months get out...but for those wanting to try life and LICENSED there's no better environment to learn
good,I enjoyed my time there and learned a great deal.  I was able to work independently as well as with a team and was able streamline many functions.  The people that I worked with were very professional and fun to work with.  The company did have many onsite facilities which made it very convenient to get things done without having to leave the building.
good,I think indeed is a great job search tool. I love how you can upload your own resume or have the option to create a basic one. There are alot if jobs to choose from.
good,A typical day for me is gathering the information and applications from clients and inputting them on to the computer for them to get reviewed. I also prepare the portfolios for my supervisor and make sure everything is in order.
good,"No matter how hardworking you are, only the success counts.  Nobody pays for your effort and we have to pay all expenses ourselves."
good,"MM is in the process of adjusting its culture from more traditional, fear based leadership to a more inclusive, innovative and reward driven leadership."
good,"Product lines significantly strong, excellent support staff with lots of experience, marketing strong."
good,"For almost a year, compensation, employee internal connections and roles of who to go to for questions/case design and concerns were very difficult. Many changes some more difficult than others. "
good,Over all a good place to work in Western Mass. Great vacation time and benefits.  The people are enjoyable to work with.  I would recommend working here.
good,"it is CRAZY busy at the start of the season up until Christmas so be ready!! it is a fun and fast paced environment. a typical work day is either opening, coming mid-day, or coming at 5pm. you start out in one section like skate rental and switch through other sections like holding the door, sweeping, and then the ice."
good,"great place to learn the Life, Disablility Insurance and Long Term Care Insurannce business and  how it benefits clients."
good,"You're on your own; no matter how much it may seem like you're not. They're nice people, but they're actors. Actors are generally likable people, though. With that being said, their training is extensive and overall powerful. If it's for you, go for it. But think about what you're passionate about, is all I ask."
good,"MassMutual is a fantastic place to not only begin but also to maintain a great career. However, the at times it was very difficult  to understand the job tasks we were communicated."
good,"The company offer really good compensation plan. However, you are require to be really good in sales and have the drive to help others succeed financially.  I like the flexible schedule and you can really make lots of money depending on how much effort you want to put in. Overall, a decent company to work for."
good,"Mass Mutual has good benefits. The job is always changing, given the opportunities to learn new things. Given the opportunity to grow in my position and no day is the same."
good,"MassMutual is an overall good company. I have been here for 22 years. My experience for the last 22 years has had its ups and downs like any other company, but it has been good. Due to layoffs, after 22 years of service, my department is being moved to Japan and we will have to find work."
good,Reputable company.  Job stability if you are in the Springfield MA area near the headquarters.  Company is trying to be more progressive.  Benefits are solid.
good,"It has been over 15 years since I have worked at MassMutual but have been in touch with many of my co-workers since then.  My former department was large, but people worked as a team and respected each other.  We worked hard, but got a lot accomplished."
good,The employees at Mass Mutual are all very professional and wonderful to work with. The work life balance varies by job function but the remote working flexibility is beneficial.
good,"Working for MassMutual is extremely tough.  I have been in the sales industry my entire life, but selling Life Insurance and the other products offered by MassMutual is the most difficult sales position I've ever held.  Most people do not wish to speak about these types of products as it brings an unwelcome fear to their lives."
good,"this place will harden your skin. must be a self-starter. the worst thing that will happen here is you will find out what you're made of, and thats never a bad thing. challenges-a-plenty. can be very rewarding or very punishing based on the type of day you're having."
good,This was a great entry level job. I enjoyed my time there for the most part. My direct manger was absolutely great! Not a fan of the top heavy culture and the big wigs being inconsiderate to entry level employees.
good,I’m just sing new contract. I’m trying to make this business going strong. I just want to gain more experiences. I hope this job is last long. I still need to feed my 2 sons. I am wishing myself good luck.
good,"If you are looking to take a position at MassMutual, you will need a list of at least 200 people that are willing to sit down with you to discuss their financial future.  There are no leads and it is highly recommended that you run joint appointments.  If you don't have people that want to buy from you in the beginning, it will be difficult to survive in this industry."
good,"If you want to work hard, you can make a good living in years to come. Very difficult to start off but if you put in the time, it will pay off. Be a sponge your first three years and don't stop prospecting."
good,"It was an absolute pleasure to be part of a team that was innovative at MassMutual.  We paved the way and created history by developing, piloting a brand new product and distribution."
good,The management style was really loose and laid back.  Got along with all of my co-workers. Everyone was really nice overall. Didnt have a great sense of job security
good,"Did time sheets, payroll, accounts payable, kept calendar for General Agent, type contracts for new agent hire.  Typed licenses for PA and other states."
good,"I was part of a start up.  During this time I learned a great deal about sales and marketing that has grown me tremendously.  A typical day would be working through various problems to help build a stronger sales and operational program.  This was accomplished through collaborative meetings, problem solving, analytics, critical thinking and implementation."
good,"MM was in transition while I was contracted there. It was a valuable experience, but their impending restructure meant that they were hesitant to hire permanent employees. The end of my contracted time meant the end of my opportunity. I would apply again if I found myself available to work."
good,"I learned a lot about financial services including, but not limited to: life insurance, disability insurance, fixed and variable annuities, long-term care insurance, investments, and group benefits, including 401k/403b retirement plans."
good,It's a good place for learning and experience. But not much room for advancement or growth opportunities.  Wonderful crew of people who work there many of whom are positive individuals including the financial advisors.
good,"The constant restructuring and reorganization seem counter productive.  I understand that you need to keep up with changes but, they seem to restructure so much that employees don't have the stability they need to be productive."
good,great people and flexible schedule. Management can be questionable.  Most enjoyable part of job is helping managers to stay on their game!  Plenty of training available.
good,Great company with opportunities to advance in the financial services industry.  Awesome 401k platform to work with.  Life products and LTC are the best in the business.  Freedom to work with other carriers and not be captive.
good,"Big company older technology management always changing policies keeping to a lot of manual processes and procedures, need to update their architecture"
good,"Great while I worked in their office, but once I went mobile I had to pick up work from other places such as with IWG. My partners there were appointed with other companies such as Metlife, but we found that the most ethical and rewarding plans were through Allianz. MassMutual is great because they are a very old and recognized institution, but nobody can compare with Allianz rate of return and taxation eliminated Universal Indexed plans."
good,"The customer service center is extremely busy, with a face paced, multi platform knowledge base required. Everyday is a learning experience. Great employees, tough environment."
good,As a MassMutual Financial Advisor I was able to focus on my passion which is helping families with Special Needs. I was even able to obtain my Chartered Special Needs Consultant Designation.
good,"I really like the company and the people, but I do not enjoy the daily activity. If you are getting into the financial services field they have a great toolbox and you will be able to take care of your clients better than most other places."
good,overall a good company to work for.  great job work/life balance. opportunity to take training and opportunities for advancement
good,"Fast paced environment with a diverse work load. From banking transfers to administrative functions, this role wears many hats.Ugency is always high with limited opportunity to reprioritize. Front line training for agents and clients for new account setup and asset transfers. Sales liaison to multiple departments across organization."
good,"First job out of collage didn't know the job was commission based. Learned alot of useful things about how to sale life insurance, just useful skills on how to sale stuff using the Sandler training. Its not about pushing the product down the clients throat but just talking to them and being a trustful reliable person and talk sense to them about the products and services we have to offer. The staff in the office seen I was a hard worker always calling to set appointments up with potential clients. Putting everything on the calendar which I was sharing with my manager and another coworker."
good,You can make a lot of income but since the salary is commission based it is very hard to have steady income. Management depends on the office you join. Not always great.
good,"MassMutual is a good company with good benefits. There is a lot of opportunity. There are many different levels of employment, the key is finding the right spot where you fit."
good,"I was in a few different departments while there."
good,Loved working with the people and their computers.  Waited over 2 years for a 40 cent raise.
good,A typical day would start with the team huddling. This will help prepare for the work day.  Management is involved with our day to day work.  I could monitor my time and this allowed me to be productive.  The hardest part of the job was the downsizing of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing projects and helping others to accomplish their projects.
good,I love my work here and the company has given me growth oppurtunities.  The company is great in providing flexibility of schedule.
good,Conduct research on various insurance related issues
good,was able to offer any company and product to help my clients achieve their financial goals
good,"Overall I feel that MassMutual really does value their employees, compensates them fairly, offers well above average benefits, and is generally just a nice place to work."
good,"The cafteteria food was pretty good, although a little expensive. Most people are very friendly, although some of the old times are incredibly miserable"
good,Good company to work for with flexibility. Management was helpful. Difficult making a steady income stream due to commission only. Office is very professional.
good,"I learned every day, I ran all the operations daily. I supervised 16 employees. I organized events, training's, cocktails, travels. I made all the cycle of recruiting process."
good,Mass Mutual provided me with many great opportunities and challenging work assignments.  In addition it was always a pleasure to work on teams with people who wanted to collaborate and be helpful. The company has a great sense of purpose with the products they offer and it felt great to be a part of this.
good,Relaxed environment position relocated out of Charlotte market. Enjoyed firm. Unfortunate firm took monies from Massachusetts to relocate entire job force out of Charlotte market.
good,Great place to work.  I enjoyed the people and learned much about how data can be used to drive decision-making.  the Compliance and Ethics organization is top-notch.
good,"I was not an employee of MassMutual but I benefited by working in the regional affiliate, WestPoint Financial Group's headquarters. MassMutual is a company dedicated to serving their customers. Their CEO is very supportive of the people who are affiliated with the company."
good,Worked here for 2 years. Company and office was great. We used the Sandler Selling Technique in our prospect/client meetings. Lots of hands on training and joint work with other experienced advisors. They also sponsor your FINRA licenses also.
good,"god people, competitive,. and successful, good hearted folks!"
good,"Great company to be with, offers wonderful opportunities for growth and learning. The individual must be a hard worker and goal orientated to succeed."
good,Learned lots about different marketing strategies for a smaller insurance firm and helped me get another internship in the financial services industry that better suited my interests.
good,"As it is the case with any large company, there can't be any generalization and it can vary greatly depending on the area leadership."
good,"This job was fully commission based, and that was the most difficult thing to get use to. They paid for you to take the training and get licensed to sell Life insurance as well as other financial licenses such as the Series 6 and 7. It was a cut throat world sometimes, being very competitive does help. Being able to work out of the office was always a plus and allowed for a flexible schedule. There sometimes were too many meetings, and late nights when you participated in call sessions. Basically, from the beginning you focused on setting meetings and making phones calls, which some times were cold calls."
good,Enjoyed my time working at MassMutual and hate leaving clients behind. Harder to find a work life balance as a young person due to most younger people not being able to meet until after 5pm. Co workers were fantastic mentors and I enjoyed my time in and out of the office.
good,"Meetings 3 times a week, training is very good. Managers are willing to help you. The hardest part of the job is that you have to make a lot of cold calls."
good,It won't make anyone a better Financial Professional although the systems they use are great for beginners. I do not regret working at MassMutual. It just doesn't have any role for advancing agents.
good,"The excitement this company delivers is just endless.  Wow, every day I went to work was the best day of my life.  They make the greatest product you can imagine."
good,"Overall I have nothing but positive things to say about Mass Mutual.  There was always opportunity to grow within the company and even though I personally didn't take advantage of that, I know many who did.  Work was very structured and team orientated which is very important in my opinion.  Things did get monotonous at times that was the most difficult part.  The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,My department had flexible time so that was very convenient for those with kids or other outside entities or jobs. Job security is so-so they let go randomly or if you're older and have time invested. They are diversity inclusive with is warming and makes everyone feel comfortable.
good,"The company has changed immensely.  However, the pro is that the work life balance is very flexible.  Definitely a great place for mothers and fathers."
good,"I've learned new cloud solutions like amazon web services. Massmutual is having a few SQL server databases hosted in AWS clout as a pilot project."
good,Great manager.  Excellent principal at the time of employment.  Challenge in creating clientele on your own and there was a lot of turnover which can be disheartening.
good,Great place to work.  Looking for part time hours and flexibility.   Good benefits and compensation.  Diverse culture.  Not actively looking but always open to opportunities.
good,"This job was interesting, because I was able to socialize with the customers, who enjoyed the staff's company and work ethic. This job only paid 8 dollars an hour, which was the downfall of this job"
good,I have the ability to serve in the community and flexibility to be home with my kids and take them to school and our family has also been blessed to support and foster children
good,"Because MassMutual is a franchise, the General Agent or CEO changed several times while i was working there. My position was constantly evolving and i enjoyed recruiting and office management."
good,"Great company, but the position of Customer Service Representative was challenging. Very fast-paced and somewhat thankless. But there are opportunities for advancement."
good,"MM has enjoyed record-breaking growth, year-over-year, for last several years. This has been accomplished through strong executive leadership, commitment to clearly articulated goals, and the ability to make long-term investments (resources and focus) due in large part to being a mutual corporation (not publicly traded, owned by its participating customers)."
good,Although I was with the Mass Mutual DI Department for a short time (6months) I was able to connect and enjoy the team. Each day was different and the team connection was vital.
good,"MassMutual is a very desirable job to work at, but be aware that despite Management stating that they're listening to you, they often times ignore what regular employees state. There's been times when management states to do something despite that being impossible to complete in the time frame allotted, which leads to sloppy, half-finished work that just gives everyone involved a harder time."
good,Excellent compensation program and benefits. The work/life balance is great because you are you own boss. The colleagues are friendly and the managers are always available to assist you with an open door philosophy.
good,"MassMutual is a profound institution with highly skilled and intelligent leadership. Daily and weekly accountability keep advisors focused and excited with a sense of belonging."
good,"MASSMUTUAL 真是一間不錯的保險公司, 我在這間公司已4年多了, 感受到公司文化是比較低調簡樸，人事關係並不複雜，沒有太多的政治或黑暗場面。同事相處得很和諧，部門與部門之間要溝通得很好。"
good,I learned a great deal about personal responsibility and accountability. I enjoyed learning new things everyday and becoming faster and more efficient at what I did.
good,"There are many opportunities for variety of work and advancement.  Dynamic systems environment and diverse staff keep it interesting.  Quality is recognized, but many times comes second to speed.  Management falls short in long-term planning of large projects.  Much time and effort is wasted when projects are abandoned due to cost or management priority changes.  Overall, had very positive experiences in many departments.  Love variety!"
good,"The position that I held at MassMutual was an internship position. The work that I did was useful and viable to the managers that I had."
good,MassMutual has gotten a lot better in recent years.  Unfortunately some management has not..
good,Training could be better but the compensation package makes up for it. Be aware of the the ramp of time can vary.
good,MassMutual is a great company with great people and has been around for many years.
good,• Created financial analysis reports and made recommendation to future investments
good,I have enjoyed the past 7 years working for MassMutual. I've been lucky to have great management and some of the best coworkers. There is a ton of opportunity to grow.
good,Typical day: busy and full filling. Always worked overtime to complete projects
good,"Due to the small size and proximity of different offices, employees can really get to know leaders across the organizational business units, which makes it easier to lattice your career and have different experiences."
good,"Overall a good place to work and would consider going back. Some management was great, others not so great. It depended on the manager.  But overall, it seemed they were fair and willing to listen and work with you."
good,Challenging but if you can make it work then it is very fulfilling. Provides a lot of flexibility and the commissions are very good. Great leadership and you can learn alot.
good,"Good people but the people in my department were overworked. I was compensated extremely well. Begged manager to reduce my hours or pay after contract work was completed. Shortly afterward, there was a mass layoff including my manager."
good,Provided a relaxed workplace atmosphere yet there was a need to meet metrics and standards of quality on a consistent basis. Offered a terrific tuition reimbursement program which provided an opportunity to further my education.
good,It's a good place to work with advancement opportunities if your willing to put in the work.  Benefits (other than health insurance) are amazing.  Would recommend.
good,"I interned at Mass Mutual, where I networked with potential clients. The workplace culture was fairly relaxing. I enjoyed working with my manager, and the employees were all very friendly."
good,"Excellent opportunity for those that want to grow a practice. Good leadership. "
good,Good company other than some outsourcing.  As a policy holder I am very impressed with the management team.  They offer a good work life balance and a good culture...
good,Mass Mutual culture is different than any other company I've worked for. You are given a lot of support while learning your job then you are expected to complete your job with minimal supervision. This company treats you as an adult and expects the same behavior from you.
good,My manager was always willing to accommodate any vacation request & willing to work around my schedule. He was a big asset to the company & always willing to help you
good,"MassMutual is a solid, strong company that strives to do the right thing. This company provides a good work/balance and many wellness programs to its employees."
good,Friendly and nice environment. Had nice coworkers and enjoyed my time at MassMutual. Management was always kind. Would defiantly recommend if applying for jobs.
good,Great company to work for.  Management open to new ideas and will listen to all ideas presented.  Great location and easy commute.  Managers provide opportunity for a great work life balance.
good,"every day we start at 8 am with brief coffee meeting to review the most important files we need to work on each day."
good,"Nice place to work, Health benefits are lacking.  Management style is overly collaborative resulting in lack of decision making at times.  Otherwise very positive culture and great place to develop skills."
good,I enjoyed my time there and found the culture great.  You have to be able to sell since you will be a 1099 employee.  They have a lot of training available.
good,"Working at MassMutual was a temporary employment for myself, only I wish that I had not had a short-sighted perspective while working there.  The management team was helpful and wanted to see my success become stable and grow, but I was half-hearted into the job because I was looking for a new pastorate to work at."
good,"This is your average job. There is a schedule option of 7:45-4:15, 8-4:30, 8:30-5, 9-530, 9:30-6. You have 15 mins processing time before and after our shift. i.e if you work 8-4:30 then you'll start calls at 8:15 and stop taking calls at 4:15. Of course you get (2)15 minutes breaks and 30 minutes for lunch. You have 8 mins after the call has disconnected to  track the call. This position is okay if you like talking calls and speaking with Financial Advisers and their executive staff. Things tend to change a lot but that is expected due this industry."
good,"Its a environment that can be slow at times but can rapidly pick up depending on the situation. The hours are long but manageable, expect to work more than is advertised"
good,Filed and managed life insurance policies; filed correspondence for said policies.  Verified and update ownership and beneficiary information for said policies.
good,I worked with a good group of folks. Work consisted of incoming and outgoing calls and sales support. I was left alone to do my tasks and had very little contact with my manager on a weekly basis.
good,I was there under a Statement of Work.  The work place culture was good.  Management was fair to me as a non-employee.  We would normally put in a 42 hour work week with nights and weekends required during certain periods.
good,"Good company to work for; however, there is a high  risk of layoffs at the company.  For the area, it is one of the few companies that still have good benefits"
good,"There are multiple product lines and business unites within the company. If you put your time in you do have the opportunity to post to other positions; it helps to know someone and develop your own business knowledge. However, in addition to life, disability, annuity & retirement, there are other product lines as well as non-product based roles to be filled. There's a lot of growth potential if you find your passion and the blessing of a supportive management and skillset."
good,"The only reason I left the company was because I couldn't handle the call center: constantly being yelled at, having confusing policies that I didn't understand (and having about 2 people on staff that did understand them), and feeling the nervous energy in the environment. I don't know many employees that actually liked working in the call center. I asked some of my colleagues once why they stayed in the position and everyone said the same thing: the money. The money and benefits were out of this world. I believed them to be fair. I feel that when MassMutual gets feedback, they take it seriously and act accordingly. I had a great, supportive manager and team as well."
good,"Mass Mutual Financial Group provided a solid platform to grown and develop my personal skills as a Financial Services Professional.  The team is committed to ensuring agents posses the necessary tools and support to serve all clients with respect and service.  "
good,"Since my start here, many years ago, I was well trained and given lots of opportunities to grow and move around within the company. I understand many things have changed but I am thankful for having a great career here."
good,"Great experience, sometimes have nothing to do or do small things like cutting paper but thats what interning is all about.  Get to sit in on a lot of meetings which are cool to see as an intern, also are given real projects and responsibilities as well even though they may be small."
good,"Good place to work, advancement and management was decent, co-workers were reliable and good source of knowledge, enjoyed the working atmosphere"
good,"Typical day at work."
good,Would recommend to anyone in Western Mass. Not terribly progressive with remote worker strategy
good,I loved everything about this company and really wish I could go back. People from management to coworkers were great.
good,Opportunity to work in conjunction with many levels within the dept. on a weekly basis.
good,"A typical day consisted of :AM meetings then Phoning and other forms of prospecting for appointments, creating lists of clients to market to, then running appointments state wide to sell products and services. My co-workers were great. the hardest part of the job was getting my clients seen by para-med and getting cases through underwriting, very strict, but good and reasonable for the most part and the managers had the power to help in that area and in fact"
good,"Standardized, but challenging work but very lacking when it comes to a sense of purpose. I learned a great deal in my position as a Customer Service Rep."
good,"My typical day at work is relaxed. Hitting my target of 3 to 5 appointments a day sometimes is a challenge depending on the leads they provided. If the list is new, it's so promising. I learned a lot about other companies that the clients mentioned themselves during the call. I have learned a lot about Interacting with different kinds of people, especially professional ones. I've learned to be resilient, patient and that I have to contain my anger in the event that I encounter a bully and upbeat clients. "
good,"Very busy place and each day is different. Different functions and different amount of people for function from 150 up to 4000, 000 people. The hardest part of the job is finding workers with good work ethics. I enjoy most the cooking and my staff and each day is different and challenging."
good,"make cold calls to potentiate clients. explain the advantages of having whole life insurance. be good listener to clients, analyst families needs, provide options of different product."
good,"The management team was great at MassMutual. The work week could be stressful at times but you are responsible for your success. Overall, if you have the drive, MassMutual is a great place to work."
good,it was a good job and the people are amazing. the expiernece was lovely for a first job.  I highly recommend it to someone who is in need of a job or looking.
good,"positive atmosphere, joint work encouraged. product training is awesome. Management is honest, fair and willing to work with agent. Downside is i am looking for a salaried position not exclusively commission based."
good,"MassMutual is a good company, who really cares for its customers. They focus on giving back to the community and its employees. My current role  is very flexible, I have great hours, Monday through Friday, PTO, sick hours, etc. Managers focus on you and make sure you have everything to succeed."
good,"I enjoyed every moment i was with MM. Great management team and real sense of comradiity.. Work work there any time in the future."
good,Great place to work if you want to work for a very large company.  Managers I worked for were great and loved the opportunity to work from home 3 days a week - the pay was not so great though.  I left for more money at another company.
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people everyday! Getting to know what drives and what excites them. Did not like working on just commission, very hard to build a life style for a family, but it is a great motivator. Traveling to meet clients or just like being busy on a constant and building my own schedule was plus. Learned a lot about couching and  being a team player. Setting and achieving goals was a constant  and motivating. Dream building to figure out why we work as hard as we do, thriving for things or events with people you care about!"
good,"The ALDP Summer Internship was undoubtedly one of the best experiences I had in my college career. I was younger and hungry to learn. I learned very specific things like how to apply basic statistical measures in Excel to much broader things like how various departments in an insurance come together. Management varies by department but was overall very professional and open to interns. The culture was one that allowed for interns to voice their thoughts and opinions, and ask for assistance when needed. The hardest part of the job is putting all of the fragmented pieces of knowledge that you accumulate throughout the summer together. That comes a lot easier with lunch & learn sessions between interns and various managers, AVPs and high ranking members in the company."
good,"MassMutual allows its agents to offer many products to meet the needs of their clients.  Finding the clients, however, is strictly on the agent.  If relocating from another location, finding the business in a new place is challenging.  I wish there were more structured outlets to meet new people."
good,"This was a relatively fast-paced environment at times, but there were other resources available to help you get the job done. You needs to work collaboratively with other business areas and it was educational learning more of the in's and out's of insurance."
good,"Good company to work for, excellent benefits package, perks such as team lunches and team building skills, family friendly and understanding, very professional"
good,"Processed many post issue transactions. learned surrenders, 1035s, replacements, absolute assignments, lapse and other complex transactions. Managed and handled many delicate and law related cases. Trained new and existing associates on transactions."
good,Great place to work. They care about their employees. The healthy food in the cafeteria is actually subsidized. Most professionals can work from home when they want.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. We are like a team while working"
good,I get along really well with all those I associate with.  I have no issues with the company.  I feel like I'm utilized and have been able to continue excelling in the tasks I've been given.  I have found ways to continue improving and helping the company become more efficient.
good,"The system and processes are not. Training is really bad and there seems to be lack of transparency."
good,This location has nice people and a friendly environment. They typical stick to a 40 hour work week. The standard benefits apply for full time employees
good,This place was a great place to work at. Although it could be stressful at times. Management made it tolerable and praised everyone for the work they did.
good,Wonderful people at MassMutual.  I enjoyed my time there and honed my skills as a Director of Client Management.  There is a real focus on improving the financial lives of its client base.
good,"You not only need to know all about the insurance products that Mass Mutual provides but you also need to be good at Sales AND live / work in an environment where there are wealthy people with enough cash to want the products.  Everyone needs their products, but only wealthy people see the value in it or can afford it."
good,"My time with Mass Mutual was too short. Wish I could have stayed longer. They are a great company with great products, great management and great marketing. The only reason I left was because we wanted to be closer to family."
good,"I enjoyed working as an Executive Assistant at Mass Mutual. I learned how to work using the dictation machine, typed numerous letter, answer phone calls for clients, and helped with insurance portfolios."
good,"They tend to over-hire then lay a lot of staff off.  If you can get past that - it's not a bad place to work. Pay was good - at least it was for me. I worked in IT and that was a fast-paced environment - get in and get out as soon as possible.  But that is the standard for any place. Just get it fixed as soon as possible to get the staff up and running.  I like fast-paced so that wasn't an issue for me. "
good,"Mass Mutual was a great place to work. The managers were friendly and always willing to teach, train, and pay attention to their employees. The only reason I left is because the agent I worked for left the company"
good,MM was a good place to work.  Very well balanced. Busy. Lacks job growth from within. Always changing.  People were very nice.  Politics were old school.
good,"Productive and progressive work environment, many opportunities learn and advance. MM has many amenities, on site banking, fitness center and a great corporate Help Desk."
good,"A face-paced, ever challenging, quite rewarding job where you work on and learn about all aspects of Group Universal Life."
good,Great enviroment and great people to work with. The other seasoned reps are very helpful and welcoming.  Willing to assist you with whatever may come up.
good,Really interesting place to work at. The work are always assign to sub team. The majority of the work were done on the analysis on clients portfolios and calculation on the rate of return on the portfolios.
good,Good company for growth that challenges you to do more with the work you have and also engage in community service support programs. The company has an established status in the financial services industry as well.
good,Great opportunity for someone with an entrepreneurial mindset.  Unlimited training and support.  You must enjoy hunting for clients to be successful and productive.
good,very nice environment with lots of agents moving about. I work from my home and not within an agency. You need discipline to work from home and I have been doing it for many years.
good,"The day begins at 7 sharp.  You check all your bank accounts and make sure all items that hit the account are valid and enter the accounting for what is outstanding."
good,"Love the agents I work with, they have helped me develop my client basis. Weekly team meetings on products and understand the process of client meetings and how it all works."
good,I technically work with advisors who work for MassMutual so it is hard for me to rate MassMutual.  Working as a personal assistant for the advisors is a great experience.
good,"Everything on my Resume is what I do on a daily Basis. On the phone, answering emails and generating policy packets for brokers. I do some odd jobs in the office is other staff members are out on vacation."
good,"I enjoyed working there, friendly work environment, professional in every sense of the word. They have recently merged and took over a portion of MetLife which has sparked realignment of positions, hence I am no longer there."
good,"I'm newer to the company but I have nothing great things to say about my experience at Mass Mutual. It is highly respected, the managers are personable (most) and they encourage growth both in and out of the company."
good,A busy work environment. The building is amazing. It is like a little city of it's own inside. Be prepared to work hard and be compensated marginally.
good,Its a great place to work. Good work life balance.  Management is great. Org culture is good. Management is nice. Nobody asks you to work late even though we end up working late nights in certain situations
good,The mass mutual convention center is a really good place to work a good team work environment places. I have learn a lot in the Arena part of it knowing that my background is mostly Hotel jobs. I have learn how to built ice for hockey and put together basketball courts as 2 of the biggest part of my job . I have learn from the event managers how to run the arena events to make sure clients are happy with everything. There is no hard part to the job as long as you are doing it the right way and follow instructions. It could be challenging sometimes in the time period that we have to change one event to another but with the team that we have it gets done.
good,"The Eppy group (Mass Mutual) is a very flexible environment to be in that creates good fun while being a financial professional. The training about values and products are very good, with training that is always continues it is easy to learn and grow within the company and because they are a small family group it makes individual development and growth possible on a personal basis."

good,"Working at this company was great because of the type of industry of the insurance business you have a wide difference in ages and nationalities. working at this company has been a very challageing one, because of the agees of the agents, Some agents are right out of collage and some have been in the insurance business for over 30 years. Being in the IT department I had to be able to explain issues for each age group to understand how Technology could help their business."
good,Relaxed work environment. Several locations and provide very good benefits. This is an exciting place to work. work and work
good,"Great place to work, but like many companies in the job market today you are never truly secure. Benefits are fantastic and great development opportunities for ambitious achievers."
good,"This is a dynamic and amazing job that challenges everyone in it.  The people are wonderful, supportive and truly good human beings.  The challenge is a long sales cycle and lots of hours needed to build your base of clientele."
good,"As a contract employee, I was easy for my to fix in to the company culture.  The training was very informative and I was able to take away a lot on knowledge about the industry."
good,Sears provided a good work environment for me and my co-workers. Management was always respectful and easy to talk to. I enjoyed my position as a cashier at Longs.
good,"The company spends  a tremendous amount of money making sure that the agents have the information, tools and adequate training to be successful."
good,"MassMutual has and will continue to be a great company. However, the  ""Doing more with less"" mentality has resulted in employee and manager frustration. The challenge - HR and Executive Leadership know people will line up for an opportunity to work there and for a fraction of the salary incumbents have worked years to earn."
good,"Mass is a company fixed on growth...and they do. Great brand recognition, with a solid rep to back it up. Training is phenomenal...I don't think you'll regret being a part of the team."

good,"I had the incredible opportunity to learn about investments (college planning, 401K, mutual funds,etc), Life and Medical Insurance. I worked closely with top executives assisting their practice and bringing prospects into the office every week for them. I was responsible for building and maintaining relationships.My main responsibility in this company is to make sure top executives are hitting their goals; I continue to cold called between 20 to 30 individuals every day and bring at least 10 prospects a week. Between top executives and myself we close 30% of that weekly. I have built a network of clients to whom I reach out periodically. Some of my responsibilities include: making sure senior executives hit their numbers, maintain good relationship with partner companies (American Funds, Oxford, Parameds, Investment Banking, etc.), providing information to clients and meeting with them. Every senior Executive has a quota of $300,000 annual they must hit to achieve the Blue Chip Circle level and we did it in 6 months."

good,People tend to work at Mass Mutual because is a safe and nice working environment
good,"I started out as a temp at Mass Mutual, then was hired fulled time after a year & a half. After that I have 2 other positions within the company. The company allows work from home so it is convenient and the environment is pretty relaxed."
good,"It's a great place to work overall. Management is flexible and understanding with work life balance. After 8 months of working in office I was also given the opportunity to work from home. The only bad thing I would have to say would be management sometimes lacks structure, and puts their employees in unnecessary stressful situations. They don't hold the employees that don't do their job correctly accountable, and the slack has to be picked up by others. Other than that, great benefits, pay, hours and room for advancement."
good,Allows you to grow and develop as a financial advisor. Management and leadership is there to help benefit your career. Advising role is strictly commissions only. Bonuses are available as well. Hard work but very rewarding.
good,This was a great place to work and everyone was willing to help out and help me become successful. Even though my time there was short I built relationships that I still have today
good,Working at MassMutual was actually very easy on me since I was an intern. There were projects to do everyday but none of them were overwhelming. Each day felt productive.
good,"While on short term contract, I experienced a fast moving work environment where the emphasis was placed on production.  Great co workers and fair management."
good,MassMutual was a great place to work.  I would go back in a second if I found the right fit for me.  I had the great opportunity to learn about continuous improvement and root cause problem solving.
good,"Greeted visitors and verified appointments with their agents.a"
good,Time sheets are based on an honorary system. Positions are becoming eliminated and organizational changes are constantly occurring for growth purposes.  Company is outsourcing but provides employees opportunities to participate in work groups.
good,"Great environment, great manager, had to learn very fast, workplace culture is to be very stiff and formal, enjoyed working with experienced peers. Enjoyed some free ice-cream and lunches to celebrate certain holidays."
good,The best part of this job is that you are never bored. There is always a new challenge and plenty of things to learn throughout your career path. Helping out families and business owners reach their financial goals is very fulfilling work.
good,"The Century City office is, where I worked for several years, was one of the best places I have every worked. Wonderful, and talented General Agent. Ideal atmosphere."
good,"I was hired as a financial representative and basically you get an option to be compensated either salary plus commission or just commission. There is alot to compare when offered these. But so far, I was great for the first 3 months but after that it got exhausting. Sales is not for me."

Management was great, the hardest part of my job was the constant multi-tasking, but it kept me on my toes, which I kind of liked. The most enjoyable part was being comfortable in my work environment."
good,"I enjoyed my time working in the sales department. The culture and the people I worked with made coming to work pleasant. My position included frequent travel (which was fine by me), the ability to build relationships, and being able to set my own schedule as I worked remotely. While I worked in the office, my schedule was more rigid but I had the ability to direct the activities of my day. MM did go through some layoffs and restructuring recently, but what company doesn't. I don't get the impression that this is something that happens frequently, so generally, you can count on job stability."
good,If you are a hustler and does not mind waiting 2-3 months to make money off your cases then this is the job for you.  Training isn't very personal but the leadership does care about you.  Do not start this job unless you are financially able to support yourself for the first 6 months to a year with very   limited income as you are required to pay alot of fees to the firm even if you do not make any money your first 2-6 months of employment of trying to get traction.

good,"MassMutual is a great place to work.  I have been fortunate to work for one of the best managers the company has had for the last 13+ years, but am relocating to another state, so will be leaving the company.

good,I worked in the mail department with great people.  It was great learning experience and would recommend it to any students coming out from college with no job experience  under their belt.
good,Poor management.  Did not provide any type of training.  Job was not described accurately.  I would not recommend people work at this company.  Management was dishonest.

Best interest of the customer always comes first.  Some remote/work-from-home opportunities are available, but Home Office employees have access to a fitness facility and an on-campus day care facility.  Great for working moms and dads."

Our New  York office at 1 Penn Plaza is a pleasant place to work and offers training for sales techniques and for the many products that the company offers. Most of the success of the individual, however, is up to that individual.  It is commission based in salary and that can be a great challenge.  The enjoyable part is when an individual experiences the feeling of actually helping a client and that is what drives many that are successful."

good,This was a great job for my career and if I had the opportunity would definitely go back into this workforce.
good,Each job I do here helps me add to my credentials.  Most of the full-time employees I know started as temps and that gives me hope.
good,MassMutual is a small company compared to other life insurance and financial institutions however you would not know it. Their main focus are the customers. Working here is like working in a family owned business which makes it a great place to work.
good,Excellent new agent training.Gave me the job I was attending college to do.
good,"• Administrative Assistant: Administrative duties included data input, filing, clerical tasks, preparing documents for tax filings, assisting various agents with different projects, worked directly with General Agent and the Deputy Managing Partner, a true learning experience"

good,"Organize my day - "

good,"Typical day is to make my morning office meetings, educational meetings, make phone calls to clients/prospects and actively make  appointments, manage my appointments, go out and meet with clients/prospects to see if I can help them with their  insurance and financial planning. Meet people, meet people and meet people. Do my own administrative work.Network and market my self.  Manage my own calendar."

good,"I worked there for more than 20 years and loved it. I had growth over the years. "
good,"The level of independence that you have to develop as an individual is great. Managers always try to motivate you to do your best and keep motivated. The downside is that there in no safe salary. Either you sell and have money, or you dont."
good,"that I have been working for MassMutual for over four years now. In this time, I have held two positions, which have provided skills that allowed me to positively contribute to the company. These positions have provided high-level support across multiple business areas and built positive relationships with work colleagues at all levels. "
good,"My part time job where i learnt a lot about marketing, dealing with different people. Marketing knowledge with dealing with agents in insurance and benefits."
good,"It's a nice place to work part time, but I am seeking full time employement."
good,People seemed groggy to me or like they haven't been able to figure out why they're doing this for the rest of their lives even though they're all making a ton of cash! (the ones who made it successfully)
good,"Great business. A lot of room to provide significant contributions to the company's future. Unfortunately for me, it is a long commute from my home, but I still keep coming for the last 5 years."
good,"Only negative is the constant threat of layoffs and restructuring. Great opportunities to learn and grow, tuition reimbursement. Plenty of ways to learn here, you just have to take advantage of everything given to you."
good,"A typical day is reaching out to people to schedule meetings to introduce them to the type of financial services you provide.  It's the process of finding new clients, getting them to sit down for a meeting to educate them on financial services, make them a client and/or get them to refer clients to you so you can build your clientele/business.  Management is awesome. They are great teachers.  The culture at MassMutual is one of joining new agents/advisers with experienced/successful Financial Advisers so you can learn and grow. The hardest part of the job is getting out of your comfort zone to solicit product sales to family and friends as well as strangers. The pay is 100% commission and you have to rely on clients to not take their time so you can get paid.  Not stable pay at first."
good,"""Supportive management, good benefits, good people to work with"
good,"The company is excellent.  Training is second to none.  Compensation is generous in the long-run.  As in any position of 100% commission the role is difficult.  BUT, with hard work, good business strategy and simply managing your time and effort you will succeed if you want to be an entrepreneur and can take lots of ""no's"".  You can and will earn a 6 figure income if you continue to stick it out and learn how to work smarter not harder.  The most challenging aspect is the mental games that your mind will play and realizing that you report to YOU, not your General Agent ultimately.  Managers can be very helpful or detrimental.  So understanding who you partner with will make a huge difference and give you a real leg up and head start in the industry.  Good luck and happy selling!"
good,The four offices of Mass Mutual were under one management so the training seminars were frequently together at one site. The time away to these presentations made it had to plan a week full of solicitation of new clients. Not much advance notice would be given to the insurance representatives meeting with us. Sometimes I would need to miss a seminar that I'd really want to attend in order to
good,Leadership is focused on supporting production personnel.  They have a great system for approaching the individual prospect.  Limited offerings in the corporate marketplace.  Decent prospecting tools.  Leads provided are weak.  You must be able to attack your natural market.

good,It was a great place to work with terrific benefits. There was a lot of opportunity for movement within the company. Yearly reviews provided for nice salary bumps.

good,"Wonderful team of employees.  Fun workplace environment.  "
good,The organization was great at recognizing performance and has awesome training.  But if you are starting new and don't have money set aside you mine want to rethink joining unless you are willing tom up in 60+ HOurs a week into calling you friends and family for a sit-down.
good,"I spent just about 2 years as an advisor at MassMutual and thought it was a great learning adventure. I learned many details about Whole Life, Annuities and Long Term care. I worked with many polished professional sales people and enjoyed every day of my employment. MassMutual is an incredibly well run company and has the products to satisfy just about every individuals retirement and estate planning needs. My managers were well skilled and hard working and very proactive in teaching us a great deal about many interesting products and services. "

good,"Great culture. Co worker are friendly and supportive. Company has great mission, strategy and decision making. Flexible and opportunity to balance work/life."

good,As an employee I truly felt cared for and that they believed in my success. They were willing to invest either time or money in opportunities that would further advance my career.
good,"Great support system"
good,Overall a good agency but could use some management work. Office expense is high. and there are a lot of production requirements forcing you to sell Life insurance
good,My early career started at MassMutual.  I had excellent managers that were supportive and always helping to grow my career and promote me.   The benefits are fabulous as well as the atmosphere.
good,I would get in at 9am and start going through resumes of potential sales agents and I would call them to bring them in for an interview. Then I would introduce my potential agent to the president and other management for future consideration
good,"I worked full-time for almost 31&1/2 years.  I enjoyed the work for the most part and got along well with my co-workers and the agents. A typical day at work involved processing and following up on new business and answering the phones.  "
good,MassMutual is a very large entity with extensive room to grow. Opportunity is almost endless and management is more than willing to help you achieve those goals.
good,Best part was putting on events cost free to families with special needs and working with non-profits to bring education to families with special needs.  I learned so much about the financial and education needs for families with loved ones that have a life time disability.
good,Very good company to work for with good leadership. The agency has an established leadership in position with good support staff in place.
good,Fortune 100 Company - good company to work for -  Retirement Services - accomplished financial strength with a mission to help our love ones retire in their own terms.
good,"I think the reason I am a great asset to MassMutual and a good team player is because I treat every work assignments with great integrity and diligence. I understand that every client internal/external, team members and managers all needs to be treated with respect, and I haven’t let a single person down yet."
good,MassMutual is the largest employer in Western Mass.  They offer good benefits and many opportunities for advancement.
good,"my days was always busy then l learned the company was outsourcing my department. I have learned a lot of things from this company such as be puntual, deal with customers and kept everything neat. When it come to managment, it was like never seen before, i had the best managment as well as co-workers. Nothing was hard to me because i was doing something that i loved to do and had learn it well at the beginning and it was enjoyable to see myself come to work every day."
good,A great company with some of the smartest people I ever had the pleasure to work with.

good,"TEAM WORK:"
good,"Great company. Wonderful support from management and team members. Plenty of opportunity for career advancement, management promotes upward mobility to reward loyal employees."
good,"I worked on the Corporate side of MassMutual which is totally different from a field or agency position, so please keep that in mind.  Mass's field jobs such as agent, broker, sales manager, agency manager are very loosely controlled by corporate.  Mass's Sales Distribution is run by general agencies and they are like mini companies, so there are good ones, average ones and some that are terrible.  As they interview you, you interview them to make sure you like the culture and the people.  Management styles and the culture will vary by agency and location.  In the corporate office, compensation and benefits were great.  Mass has a formal Performance Evaluation Process that is standardized for all employees but they grade on a Bell Curve which means everyone can not be great even if you think your performance is, you are going into that Bell curve no matter what.  That said, over all their system of evaluation is basically fair because it is conducted universally with all employees alike under the same rules.  Vision and Mission are well spelled out.  Teams work well together and I have met and worked with some outstanding people and leaders!   Mass has some really, great, great people!  This is true especially of Underwriting; very top of the line people with great expertise who are also just good people! My bosses were all female and top of the line.  The relationship between the Field and the Corporate office could get very political and much more so than that of other companies. That is the negative.  My bosses incorporated a lot of leadership development and recognition"
good,they taught me a lot and helped me gain the experience that i need to succeed in the workplace. I had time tpo use the tools that are used in many different companies and i feel that will help me attain a job once i graduate
good,"As jobs go, this is hands-down one of the best I have ever had. "
good,"The amazing vibe from everyone, the workplace is always helpful and the management is always there to be willing to help. Everyone is treated equally and fairly, willing to work with those who are ill and are in need of help."
good,"Great place to work, but no salary. Culture, mentoring, unlimited income, great work/life balance, ability to work the hours you want. The more you put in the more you get out."
good,Mass Mutual is a great company and has a lot of opportunity.to be willing to take a lot of no's to get a few yes'. Durability is a must.Would advise have 3 months salary saved up
good,"Every day was different. I set my own schedule,making and going to appointments, I studied and organized client proposals, I coordinated with my assistant in networking and growing my business. and spent down time advancing my education. The general agent ran the agency and staffed support personnel as needed for the agents. The hardest part was getting back up after a defeat. The most enjoyable times were helping clients, and re visiting them yearly, if not sooner."
good,It was pleasure working with Massmutual good platform to learn and work. lot can be learned with the existing set up and configuration what they in the platform.Over all good journey with massmutual.

good,Financial Strength is outstanding; Stable company considering the lenght of its operation and existence; Working environment is well diversed and conducive to everyone.
good,I enjoyed this job once I got the hang out it. My supervisor was very supportive and patient. He took the time to get to know us find out our strengths and weaknesses and made them better. When the days were stressful we received little pick me ups like being treated to lunch or having a small party and or receiving some kind of dessert
good,"Part of an Honest, Stable, respected company. Very Proud to represent their products and services, especially in times of economic downturn companies products proved to be superior."
good,Fun team with highly qualified leadership in the industry.    Office manger actively involved with training and success of each employee.   Great team support in meeting sales goals.    Hardest part of job was cold calling.   Most enjoyable part of job was providing clients insurance needs to meet family security requirements.
good,Outstanding company with employee centered culture and strong financial performance.  Company is committed to the mutual structure while also venturing into new businesses.
good,"Internship required data-entry and reconciliations.  Staff and management was very friendly, job was straightforward."

good,"enjoyed the freedom of doing whatever you would like to get ahead. no strict guidelines on what to do."
good,I enjoy working at MassMutual but may need to relocate for my husband's job. There are not many companies that place as much emphasis on employee well being as MassMutual does. They help their employees learn and give them the tools necessary to succeed.
good,"Start day with prioritizing tasks via emails and voice mail requests.  Make sure direct reports having nothing new on calendars.  Answer phones and take care of requests.  Go through mail, pay bills due, work on ongoing projects.  Make travel arrangements.  Process travel expense reports.  Order any supplies needed for department.  Greet visitors.  Arrange meetings, set-up meeting rooms."
good,"Contacting new prospects to introduce them to :"
good,Typical day at work involved cold calling in person or by phone. Learned a great deal about insurance in regards to benefits and the ability to structure products for the clients. Management was always willing to help in some way. Co workers were great to get feedback from and work with. Hardest part of the job was cold calling and working through names and numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to show a client that they needed a particular product(s) and how it would serve them in the future.
good,"I worked for the Securities Specialist at Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co. and processed all Mutual Fund and Stock transactions.  I processed all licensing requirements for the Agents who became licensed to sell securities.  The was a lot of emphasis on Financial Planning  with  using life insurance products.  Most of my co-workers were men 20-40 years old. We had a lot in common due to our age group.  The hardest part of the job would have been processing the stocks, and mutual fund transactions in a timely manner.  I did enjoy meeting the policyholders, and working in a busy and professional environment."
good,"Days were mostly production based, working indendently."
good,"Worked as a Secuirty Officer and loved it. Had constant connections with other people and used stellar customer service to assist others,"
good,Easy and nice setting to work in. I did general office duties m-f days.
good,I came into MassMutual know virtually nothing about retirement products.  In my time at MassMutual I became a subject matter expert and found confidence where I was lacking.
good,"Good mangement, risk adverse, let you work remotely. They care about employees. Training could be better. Pension plan after 3 years. Healthcare options are limited"
good,"Excellent benefit package. Dress appropriately dress code. Flexible work hours and work from home schedules may vary by department and work needs. Large Company many onsite perks, credit union, cafeteria.  Lots of opportunity if you know the right people."
good,Overall great experience! I would recommend this company to anybody looking to get into the financial services industry. Absolutely a great place to call home!
good,"Field positions are work from home, so employees must have a lot of drive.  This company rewards the self-motivated.  As you grow so do you responsibilities with the organization."

good,"My day to day was spent fulfilling tickets in our queue and learning how to solve different IT problems that needed solving. The culture of the workplace was very pleasant , and  working together with co-workers on tickets became the most pleasant part of my day."
good,"I would come into work in the morning and Mondays were training days.  About four hours of learning in the meeting room.  After that, I would phone prospects to set up an initial meeting.  I learned how to reach out to clients and treat them with respect.  I also learned all about the company and what insurance they offer.  I learned about life and health insurance, mostly.  The workplace culture was decent.  I really liked the conference room.  I would say the people made up most of the culture there.  The hardest part of the job was passing the 02-15 license exam.  My most enjoyable part of the job was sitting down with potential clients and talking with them about what the company can offer."
good,"Truly a great place to work, however, you must follow your goals and keep your priorities aligned and the sky is the limit. Agents are given autonomy to build their own business and the Agency supports you every step of the way."
good,"Haven't had the chance to give management an objective view. Workplace culture is outstanding and excellent. Hardest part of job is starting out the first few years. Most enjoyable part is high pay, wide growth opportunity, and detached supervision. I'm learning life insurance to start, stocks, and business management to finish. A typical day is what you make of it, but also networking to build a consistently lucrative client base."
good,"My experience working at MASSMUTUAL has always been a very great experience.  I've had the opportunity to work with various managers and other individuals who were willing to guide me and let me express myself in my position.  MASSMUTUAL offers their employees the opportunity to gain additional knowledge through courses that can help advance them in their careers."
