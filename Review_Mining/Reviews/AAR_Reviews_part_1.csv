rating,review
bad,"For such a small place so much drama. Very poor management. Pretty sure he doesn’t know how to be a boss. Very unprofessional . Shares his employees personal and professional business to other employees. Management shouldn’t be able to have personal relationship with there employees , very toxic environment."
bad,"Very unorganized, management is the biggest downfall of the company, job security  is at a all to low for this company... Very little room to excell with this company"
bad,Everyday was a scramble constantly asking for you to work OT or stay late because of lack of management of people. Some people would hide all day leaving you to clear all the cards and management wouldn't even look them because they weren't worth their time. HR was terrible people quit on a regular basis due to pay issues that never got resolved. Constantly looking for new contracts due to poor maintenance and relationships with the customers. Maintenance  procedures are only followed until a few  weeks out from delivery day then everything is out the window.
bad,"AAR has really poor management, a high turnover rate, they do not care about their employees, hangars are very dirty, they want you to work 12-14 hours a day"
bad,"If you wish to lose pay increases, be undermined by upper management, not get paid due paychecks, enjoy every 6 months a month layoff, mandatory 80+ hours a week, and constantly barated by your boss..... This career choice might be your perfect opportunity....ALL positions at every location are the same.  Bottom of the barrel."
bad,"As a liscened aviation maintenance technician, I would discourage anyone with any relevant experience avoid this company at all costs, it is mismanaged and very hostile work environment, upper management is non existent, the pay is a slap in the face, if you are not an ex United mechanic you have no chance at this place"
bad,"Working for AAR put at risk everything you are; your integrity, honesty, principles and even your A&P License. They make so many shortcuts, that the place really becomes a daily jeopardy to the life of passengers and employees."
bad,"since  my contract there, the place closed and from what I understand, was sold off in pieces. the facility I worked at is no longer open. I am unaware of other facilities"
bad,Very poor company will lay off anyone does not matter about who you are or how hard you work management only cares about themselves pay is terrible 10/10 would not recommend
bad,"Dont  waste your time. Low morale. Unhappy employees, bad management, poor workmanship."
bad,"would not recommend working there, they are very unorganized and very chaotic.  very stressful to work at this location, no training available that was desperately needed"
bad,The issues pertaining to underbid projects create unnecessary stress on people who have to carry the load of lack of planning for these bids. poorly bid issues create problems that affect personnel.
bad,"That was by far the worst place I have ever worked. the hours were horrible. I got in arguments every day with quality over how a job needed to be done IAW guidelines. boss was bad, work lead was bad and coworkers refused to help in any ways shape or form"
bad,Went to training for 2 days and same day on the afternoon received a call telling us no to show up tomorrow and that everyone's it's been cancelled sorry for any inconvenience
bad,This company is very disorganized and unprofessional. They support favoritism in the work environment and there is no leadership or chance for improvement.
bad,"worst clocking in "
bad,Poor Supervisors. Very political. Lower than average pay.
bad,I prefer work where I am positively impacting someone's life; not work for low wages to make a profit those on the corporate side while tolerating disrespect from supervisors sometime. I ended up being homeless twice due to this company.
bad,"Management always passing the buck. many hourly employees did nothing or very little in a days job. management turn there heads. employees did their job was ask to do more to make up for the employees not doing their job. Company took 30% of hourly employees wage away with the promise of no man power reduction."
bad,"To many bosses, cut corners all the time, that is close enough attitude. dropped insurance all the time. A job that will not be around long as it stands now."
bad,"NA, I dont have to, if you want to consider me, its fine, if you dont,I do not care"
bad,Work only as a last resort. 80% turnover rate. Only one not looking for a new job is the director
bad,"AAR Corp. in Clearwater, FL likes to hire managers and keep them just long enough to work them 75 hours a week during their first 90 days, then fire them at the 90 day mark so that they don't have to pay them benefits. I worked there for exactly 90 days, and it has been two years. They have been through almost two dozen managers since I was there. They hire the manager, work them to death with 75-80 hour weeks (and you'll do anything, since it's within the 90 days!), put impossible expectations onto them, tell them they're doing an AMAZING job, and then at the 90 days, cut them loose with the reasoning of 'It's not a good fit'. Then they hire another manager and do the same thing. "
bad,"The company exercises excessive micro management and continually change direction daily.  Hiring is in part based on the good ole boy system, not necessarily on managerial capability."
bad,"Company sticks anyone in a managers positions. Trained or not. Very Toxic environment, treats individuals especially temps in disrespectful  manner. Bad experience on Project Team that lacks process."
bad,"dysfunctional organization. No direction, no structure, with a current management team that has total disregard for the customer, and less regard for the employee.  Wages are not comiserate with experience and no hope of meeting the national average."
bad,"It's ok, if you really need a job to provide for your family it's an ok place to work. It's an ok place to work if you really need a job to keep a roof over your head."
bad,"If you have a family, not the place to work.  You are expected to work 70 hours a week, 7 days a week."
bad,Work load unpredictable. If it is busy it usually because a project is way behind schedule.  Company never wants to buy proper tools or equipment to complete the job.  High turnover rate.  Management doesn't understand what the workers need and doesn't care to know.  Poor communication between management and employees.  The best part of the day is clocking out.
bad,Terrible company and area to work. Very unprofessional and chaotic work envoronment.
bad,"The company itself is a fantastic concept; the Management is poor, the job training is poor or nonexistent, and the moral is soul sucking. There is never any praise or positive acknowledgement to the employees--only reprimands and hostile treatment. Instead of helping the employee learn and succeed, management takes away the employees' responsibilities and ""rearranges"" their position so they don't have to bother helping. This, for the company, means no training but no raises either; and no termination, so they don't have to pay unemployment nor hire new employees. They just keep people complacent enough to keep them working since no one can afford to be without a job."
bad,Ap manager treated people unfairly and would not allow employees to leave for family emergency. (Like someone dying) hr doesn’t care cause they are a bunch of divas and do nothing to help you. Avoid this company at all costs!
bad,"Women are a minority and the department I was in didn't respect the women that worked there.  Constant write ups for no reason, and I couldn't wait to clock out of there because I felt like I was being watched, and disrespected"
bad,"This has to be one of the worst companies I ever worked for. "
bad,The company does not invest in the people or product. Extremely short staffed and sad culture. Constant feeling you can lose job at any time. Safety and quality standards are dangerous. No clearly defined goals or strategy. No one below VP level is capable of making a decision. Middle management not empowered. Destined for failure.
bad,Unless you are part of a clique you won't advance with this company.  HR is a joke.   They move people to higher positions buy don't pay.   So unless you have a for sure job elsewhere you are pretty much bullied around.   This company takes on more work than it can handle.
bad,"Coworkers were nice, but if management didn’t like you they’ll find a way to get rid of you. 10 hour shifts 4 days a week. Not flexible or accommodating to family."
bad,I would recommend not working here they are all bs they dont care about there employees when it comes to job and work schedule upper management changes and bring old workers back and hire them back on in higher positions then when they left or got fired the first time. No room to move up in company. Leadership and communication sucks only good thing is benefits. And they dont pay enough for any type skill you are.
bad,This company does not have it act together. Most of the  supervisors are yes men. Managers will hire far too many people and the budgets are blown and people are laid off.  Second shift would always take the brunt of the call offs. Day crew is mostly the good old boys in the sheet metal crew. No one above lead would have your back. I sent emails to the head corporate office and to the managers at the Indianapolis hanger about the extremely blown work cards and how this can't continue.  One month later call offs four out of five nights. Another month later massive layoffs.  I tell the manager in my hanager that escorted me out that I lost my job because of their incompetence and I get mark in my file that I have a bad attitude.
bad,"More interested in cutting corners than doing the right thing. Management completely lacks morals and ethics. Do your research on this branch before committing yourself to them. I have heard good things about the rest of AAR's locations (e.g. Indianapolis, Chicago). Too many levels of management. Friends hiring friends, very little experience in positions of authority."
bad,The leadership team throws you under the bus every chance they get! Primarily the Human Resource Director which is shameful in its self. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere . It’s disgusting how  some of the leadership team is and what they allow to happen. I cannot even score the job culture and management team . People drop off like flys.
bad,"Hardest part about this job is arguing with management about your days off and how you don't want to spend every waking moment at work. 6/7 day weeks and if you argue it your job is in jeopardy. Also, HR department is looking out for the companies best interest and not the employee for this company.  Healthcare is really bad and expensive."
bad,"Upper management doesn't care about the employess, does not care about the customers. We've been lied too."
bad,"Currently wondering how AAR fan treat loyal, hardworking employees so poorly. I’ve put in 3 years and 6 months and have currently found another job, and have been told I cannot leave without paying back money for breach of contract, when two other employees came in on the same program I did and were able to leave RIGHT after getting reimbursement without having to pay it back or be harassed"
bad,"I was in the military prior to this job and I rarely had to be at work so early. Also I had been working in the hanger I was assigned to for about a month before they told me who my direct supervisor was. For me as a none certified mechanic, they had little to no work for me to do most of the time. So I left and went back home. Would not suggest anyone this job."
bad,Former employee accounts payable specialist.  I worked there for four years.  Finally hit my breaking point.  This company works you to death and sucks the life right out of you . Upper management doesn’t care about their employees .  The only good thing about this company is the cafeteria and the fitness center.  Think twice before applying here you’ll regret it .
bad,"Pay sucks, employers lie on employees, not enough work given they send you home"
bad,"If you decide to work here dont sign a contract. Hr itself isn't bad. I had a great experience when I worked here but as soon as I decided to better myself and take care of my family without having to work 6 days a week 10 hour shifts I was outed Said I had to pay them $5,000 because I got tuition reimbursement yet two other employees were able to walk. When I asked to see my signed contract from when I first started they couldn't find it. But wanted me to sign a different one agreeing to pay back $5000 in 12 months. Knowing I made $21 an hour after working there 3.5 years. How the heck is someone supposed to do that with bills, 2 kids. Wheres money for food on my table? They expect you to work overtime but don't want to pay you what you deserve and then when you wanna leave without any animosity they try and harass you. Make you feel like you're going to pay them or else. Well to be fair there's only one person that made me feel this way. Besides the bad experience when I left, I enjoyed the years I put in and made great friends that I am able to keep in contact with. Look for a job elsewhere Somewhere they want to pay you what you're worth, and where you're valued for the work you do"
bad,"This place is toxic. Especially F117Ops department. I have never worked in such abusive, unprofessional organization in all my working years, and I have worked at some great and bad companies. This is the worse. I pray I never have to experience anything like this again. I am still in shock how I could have end up here."
bad,"On the surface, it may seem like a good place to work but beware. Hourly employees are great but salary employees and management are absolutely horrible. People are overworked. Seems whenever they get a good employee that tries to make changes, they either quite or are fired.  If they plan on staying in business, they need to get rid of management but they won’t."
bad,Worked  for aar in Oklahoma and they laid me off after a very short time.  I gave them another shot in Indianapolis and the same thing happened. They left my family and myself with little options. Leads were awful and Never helped.  They treated people like children and we're very disrespectful.
bad,"Worst heavy maintenance facility i have ever worked in, no communication between supervisors and leads. And zero communication between leads and  mechanics. Everybody there is only out for them selves and does not care about anyone other than themselves. It is pretty impressive at how that place stays in bossiness."
bad,I don't know what has happened to aviation these days. Here is the deal its heavy checks so some times your busy some times your not. Well at AAR when your not busy waiting on parts aircraft config or waiting on a new airplane if you dont have a card to clock to you go home. I have been working there since Dec and I might have worked maybe 8 40 hour weeks since then. I usually only get like 30-35 hours a week. They dont care about you at all. Hurry up get the plane out early and for doing that they are going to send you home for 3 days without pay waiting on the next plane from Alaska. Its really hard to live on 30-35 hours a week.
bad,"Prior to working here, I had never experienced such poor management. Some colleagues were very helpful and supportive, but the leaders are unprofessional in every way including being sexist and misogynistic, having no appreciation of their subordinates, and lacking direction."
bad,"no words to describe it was a struggle, every day is a fight managers are bad and people are not team players everyone is just watching there own back, no help at all"
bad,for working on aircraft would think the pay would be more for a license tech.. Just wish they took better care of their employees..not willing to pay for the experienced people
bad,"AAR did not help with a harassment case. And that's why I left. Management does not follow there own policies and procedures.  Also, they don't implement a structured training program."
bad,"Job is easy, management is political and subpar, there is a lot of favoritism that goes on and if you don't brown nose, then you won't get raises, no matter how hard you work."
bad,Tough place to work. Low pay considering you need to be qualifed on every type of large commercial aircraft and every different company GMM.  Very few A and Ps so the Inspector is working with mostly unqualified people.
bad,Overall its not a professional environment and management treats employees horribly.
bad,AAR as whole is a great place to work for. AAR cargo Sysytems was not managed for success and as a result lost the business and customers for this business group. Culture did not change and suppliers were not managed based on their delivery performance but on non value added factors which resulted in poor materials management making customer delivery comittments impossible to meet.
bad,"A typical day at this company has not been about the work but about who would be leaving next.  I have learned that the culture within a company is the most important thing that should be fostered and have taken that for granted after many years of working at companies who worked hard to show they cared about their employees.  Upper management here have been very oppressive.  There is no opportunity for teleworking, but consultants are hired and they all work from home; their is no trust of the employees that they have hired; policies are written when they are needed; it is a very backwards environment.  This has been the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part have been my co-workers.  Everyone wants to do the right thing, but get frustrated trying because of the lack of support from management."
bad,I worked here in 2013 and was treated basically like a dog....or worse...the supervisor in my department wouldnt even talk to me....if I had a question or problem my lead man would not get off of Facebook to answer my questions.  Everyday at this place was a living hell for me....the turnover is terrible..and if you are  contractor they barely speak to you.....they have their clients not even knowing what really goes on out there.....their direct hire employees with many years of experience make so little....I feel sorry for them.....if you go to work here after reading this it is your fault....you have been warned.....lol
bad,"This is the place to work if you thrive on long hours, poor management decisions, and intimidation."
bad,"I was told not to talk to anyone but my direct supervisor at all time. Too many ""demi-gods"" in the company riding on the power trip. Each uppity ups competing against the others. Not very productive environment."
bad,"Okc and dlh. Both are very similar, push push push.... damage. Push push push damage... new hires still in school, or untrained. Pay sucks, lots of brown nosers."
bad,"Communication is either nonexistent or blatantly impossible at times. It is a great job to start off, but get in and get out. The benefits are nice tho."
bad,"Please understand, there are good people at this location, but the atmosphere is way to relaxed. The first red flag I got was when HR told me that the policies in the handbook are not followed (dress code, phones on production floor, hourly employees leaving the plant and returning) just to name a few. Not orgainized! Did not have parts needed for weeks! Was told that I was being released due to performance, but I had a severe shortage of employees needed to do my job everyday! (Hence title of this review). Impossible to build without people to build with! Nothing ever shipped on time to customers, I was routinely asked to do things outside of my build instructions, and then asked why I did it that way! Plant short employees (30+), but keep rehiring people that are terminated and the same issues keep returning, wonder why! You just can't talk to people so disrespectfully, and expect great work. I should have listened to HR when I got hired about things that go on at AAR. I guess I will have to go be great somewhere else. If anyone can get parts needed at this location, please help!"
bad,company consistantly worked to find shortcuts to meet contract needs for air force(customer). always looking to cheat system in place to meet supply goals. difficult to feel part of a team that wasnt honest
bad,"They cannot sustain employment at the Duluth location since opening their doors in 2012, it's a revolving door. Experienced mechs come on board, work for awhile and see how poorly it's managed and then quickly leave. They do nothing to retain the experience when they desperately need the experience. They are completely unwilling to pay for it. They simply get what they pay for. The work is good, benefits are good. If your a new A&P needing experience you would do well to work here. If you are an airline experienced A&P, run, they will not appreciate anything you do for them. Approx. 20% of the workforce are licensed A&P's. There are people here who should not be allowed to touch an aircraft. But because they are so desperate for people, they have reduced the quality on the floor. Again, they get what they pay for!"
bad,"they make it impossible to get anything finished in the given amount of time because all the inspectors want different things. management is really bad at timing when the aircrafts are suppose to be coming in, you will work 2 to 3 weeks of 10 to 12 hour shifts and then there wont be anything to do for a week.oh and they have sheet metal mechanics doing interior work because they don't want to hire interior mechanics."
bad,"It was a good group of people that really wanted to do well, but internal and external personality differences did them in."
bad,"Lots of promises that are never kept.Lowest pay scale I have ever seen.Training was fair, work environment was good. "
bad,"Not a challenging place to work at, it is in a nice place to be."
bad,I've learned leadership valuse first hand. This job has tought me the importance of correctly managing people and time.
bad,"very unorganized, management never accepted responsibilities for decisions made, definitely not a place i would consider working for rest of my life"
bad,Not a good place to work and lack of training for any new person
bad,"I agree with many other guys that have left their comments here that AAR is a great place to start your career in aviation, to learn, but a very bad place for growing professionaly. This company (AAR Aircraft Services Miami specifically) is managed like a private latin-american (more specifically cuban) farm. If you dont have anybody from your family in the upper management forget it, the opportunities to grow are close to zero. It does not matter whether you are a knowlegeable technician, or harworking, if your manager dont like you because you dont do exactly what he wants, if you dont sign jobs does not matter if they are not done correctly or not done at all, they will put you in a black list. They call it being part of the team. Sometimes I feel afraid of flying again when I see the way they work there. I understand it is a business but the lives of people are at stake. There are no corporative rules, no respect for your knowledge, hardwork, seniority... They say you are not there to think but to do what they tell you to do. I used to love working there because I love aviation. It is my passion. But at AAR Miami they are PMK (professional motivation killers). On top of that salaries are not bad but compared to many other companies around it is not the best. That is why the best mechanics migrate all the time. To be fare, the good part is that work there is pretty stable at least for direct employees and benefits are not bad. But if you want to grow professionally believe me, this, unfortunately is not the place, unless as I said you have somebody from your family in the"
bad,"Very busy , and stressful maintenance environment."
bad,Try direct hire placement before going with contract work unless you don't value having to move around etc. pay is ok but still not worth not having complete job security.
bad,The job itself was easy but the people there made it hard to work there. Everyone trying to be in competition with each other. There was no teamwork amongst the employees and a lot of time management didn't encourage it. I think they had a lot of untrained people in positions leading the employees.
bad,I would get to work and receive my assignment from my lead. Then I would go to the computer to research the AMM that would give me instruction on how to do my job. then I would proceed to do my work to the best of my ability.
bad,"nice facility poor management have to be in the ""in crowd"" to get work or advance. Very Cliquish work environment and shady repairs. Get it done don't worry about airworthiness"
bad,"work is work, the people around you make it fun and effective environment, you learn to adapt to continuous change around you, helps to keep you alert"
bad,"Man ist von der ersten Sekunde auf sich allein gestellt."
bad,"Four General Managers in 5 years?!?!  What was once a thriving small company was bought and then micromanaged to death.  Every time the GM changed the company was in constant flux."
bad,"Not a quality aircraft maint facility, upper management just wants to push A/C out at any means. Very argumentative environment."
bad,Day starts with a 15 min or longer meeting about priorities and trying to clock in since you can't clock in till 5 mins before work so hectic. Drawings are so vague about how to install the modifications. Ask questions generally anyone will help you out. Upper Management has no clue on what's going on with the workers.Manuals for 717 aircraft have too much information missing. The hardest part is completing the paperwork. Best part of the day is when you can clear a task.
bad,"Highly competent in all aspects of contract management in government and commercial programs.  Have experienced great wins and terrible losses through nearly 40 years of professional experience. Have had the opportunity to work in numerous industries and government entities in contracts, procurement and engineering fields. Love the ability to fix and/or repair nonfunctional systems and procedures, streamlining them to better serve the company needs.  As with most managers, hardest part of the job downsizing personnel while necessary still very difficult.  The most enjoyable mentoring personnel and watching them grow followed closely by getting a big win for the company."
bad,"No real learning there. Sink or swim. Pay for position was horrible. And communication between managers and work force was really lousy. If you get job there, use for stepping stone and move on as fast as you can."
bad,"after the take over from DynCorp Intl.  things seem more out of control.  It may take them more time to figure it out, and it may all work out in the end, but right now...its a mess"
bad,"AAR Corp. is a good company to get your feet wet. With that being said they are an absolute mess. A new customer arrived last year and they officially signed the contract recently. They are setting unrealistic expectations for aircraft return to service. The management is so lost on how to achieve this timeline other higher up management is in the facility dictating how maintenance should be done. "
bad,"Management sucks, pay is sub par, and good freaking luck getting a promotion unless you know the right people. People fight tooth and nail and constantly back stab each other. Stay away."
bad,"This company has had one of the highest turnover rates I have seen in a long time. Some of its best and brightest employees have quickly departed for greener and friendlier pastures.  At least two dozen or more employees across multiple departments have left within the past year."
bad,the employees are forced to used their vacation time or choose to go home. They also use contractor mechanics and they are the first to be send out.
bad,"The company would be a whole lot better to work for if the managers and head supervisors would listen to the people out on the aircraft doing the work. Getting hired on for what is suppose to be a long term contract and getting laid-off four months later due to managers mismanagement. Also the treatment of swing shift and mid-night shift was horrible. If anybody got called off, which does happen in this line of work, 95% of the time it was people on swing or midnight shift. Individuals on days would be getting 50-70 hour work weeks but the majority of people on swings would have 10-30 hours. A very large majority of the lay-offs came from swing and mid-night shift with very few from days. Moreover there was a lot of who you know, not what you know in certain hangers."
bad,"- long and slow"
bad,"It is a group of people getting richer at Expenses of workers benefits. "
bad,"While working at AAR I quickly realized that there where certain people throughout the company in all levels of management that were willing to cut corners, bypass procedures and generally look the other way during day to day accomplishment of aircraft maintenance. Furthermore it was apparent that mangers where subjected to copius amounts of stress and duress to deliver the aircraft on time at any cost leading to several incidents involving injury to personel and damage to aircraft. Contractors were indirectly pressured to work excessive amounts of overtime or face not having work given to them for not complying."
bad,maintenance shop. wasn't a bad place to work I just didn't like they would call you at home not to come in due to lack of work. the hardest part of this job was finding the part
bad,a typical work day is busy because it is referral hospital. it is a well organized hospital.co workers relate well with one another. the hardest part of the job was lack of pay since i was doing an unpaid internship.the  most enjoyable part for me as working with abandoned children since they look at us as there guardians.
bad,"Great place to start out in aviation, but not beyond that! Management is run like a country club of good ol boys. Pay across the board is completely unregulated. Someone with no experience could come in making way more than an experienced person just because they need that skill at the moment.Training is a laugh and you're constantly thrown to the wolves."
bad,"Workflow was steady"
bad,Ceo fired 25 v.P.S to enable giving work force a 2% raise for no ther reason. Not a people supportive co. Was made to travel 90% of my time rather than build my new division
bad,"To keep it succinct, this place will rail you every chance it gets. You could be a technician operating at a higher level than 80% of the rest of the floor hands, but they are not going to pay you for it. There are people who come and go making $25 an hour and are terrible mechanics, but they are contractors so they get paid. Whereas the really good directs are getting screwed because the company thinks it can. Otherwise the company isn't bad, management is a great example of the good ol boy club, but that seems to be most places. I would NEVER recommend this to a friend."
bad,"Good place to start and learn but not advance or get paid well. Had issues with certain leadership, took those issues to upper management and nothing happened about it except i was told to get back to work."
bad,"Worked for company for 4 years, good work environment. But constant layoffs. About every year to 18 months first a hiring freeze so good temp employees can't be brought on, then the lay off. Hire ups will lie to their own managers and tell them they have nothing to worry about. Then when the anouncment is made surprise.  Even with perfect attendance, no abuse of sick time, no right ups, they have no loyalty to anyone. I would never return unless under contract."
bad,"Management was ok ,company standards was not ,pay was to low for aviation, some employees could not speak English so communication was difficult , training was very unorganized"
bad,"I work grave yard shift 10pm-7am.  Nights can be slow at time, but it will pick up every so often, because I work around maintenance hangers, who work on aircraft.  When they need fuel or lavs or water dumped or filled, I get it done.  Private jets will come in during the evening, and I will have to either: put Jet A on the aircraft for a quick turn, put them in a hanger or tie down spot, take care of the customer's on the aircraft. I maintain the ramp take care of the Fuel trucks, clean and sump fuel to insure the fuel is clean.  I will go to the Airlines if need to put fuel on Southwest or American Airline flights.  Our company has contract with the Government, so Military aircraft will come in and will provide them services, fueling the aircraft.  I will fuel helicopters( Bell 206, A-Star), 737 to Air bus."
bad,"Service that we provide to our customer is exceptional. The division was acquired by the Corporate company and was completely different than any division of the company."
bad,"I left this job because it was hard to get 40 hours a week.  I was sent home for no work 2-3 days a week."
bad,"•	Planning and the creation of projects, work orders and work cards."
bad,"They don’t hire from within, and the pay is terrible compared to similar contracting work...but your schedule is flexible and nobody ever gets fired so that’s good."
bad,"I have been on that company for 10 years but i think that is tome for me to grow up personal and profesional , with the knowledge that i have i can be and excellent employee"
bad,This is a good company that is in the rebuilding stage. The employees are very good people. The management team is new and the most enjoyable thing about the job is the people.
good,"poor management stressfull work environment, the schedule changes constantly, management harasses you on breaks and your days off. they expect you to bend over backwards for them then do nothing for you in return."
good,"Little to no training to help get you started, and management at the lower levels hinders more than anything. Great lunch room and the gym that is available is very good quality."
good,A typical day at work would be to clock on to a job card to get start time.  Then work that job card.  As for management the leads I worked with had good job ethics.   I enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,"The work place is okay, It helps a person to enjoy what he or she is doing. The management team is good, The benefits are reasonable enough to enjoy the work place"
good,"typical day at work starts with entering in the main hanger and navigating thru the hoard of day workers standing around the time clock waiting to clock out while the hanger floor is engulfed with debris and trash."
good,"It was my first aviation job and I fell in love with it. Until people caused unnecessary high scholl drama regarding relationships. I left on great terms, 2 week notice and manager said I should have no issue coming back. I had tried several times to come back as contractor and direct and was denied. HR  and hiring department said I was unqualifiedd"" although when I first started they hired me as  a Support Technician, then moved to tech 3 in the 23 months I was there. They keep denying without valid reason regardless of what position applied for and I believe the reason is personal. I'm not sure what I did that was so horrible, but this is ridiculous."
good,Was a stressful place to work. Huge turnover from week to week. Basically a revolving door for mechanics. Even with decades of experience you were looked down on as having none by some. It's a place to work to just get some experience and move on as most do.
good,"Some leads liked to help you learn, but a majority of them expected you to know what to do without showing you, and would be hot headed about it. The work wasn't that bad, we would do full paints on aircraft all the way down to touch ups. I got along well with 2 of the leads there, but the other 3 were just way too hard on you if they didn't like you and wouldnt help you out if you had a reasonable question. The leads would make very good money, and their supervisor was never around so they got to do whatever they wanted, basically making us do all the work which was not worth what they were paying us kids. They told us if we didnt like it then we could just quit and 2 of the other guys ended up taking their advice. Work was alright, but the way management treated everyone wasnt understanding and helpful like a professional really should be."
good,Management works 60to 80+ hours a week so they are irritable and tired. They are largely consumed with unreasonable demands and are expected to micromanage staff and staff no autonomy. The leadership is largely reactionary and understaffed but will not hire additional employees.  Unrealistic.
good,"Good place to start a career in commercial. "
good,"High stress, high demand environment. Low tolerance for mistakes and pressure demands statistically increase the chance of these mistakes. Job turnover at this place is consistent with a negative and counterproductive work environment."
good,"my lead abused me for 11 months, my supervisor helped me the most cause my lead threaten many times that he want to walk me out but the HR did nothing. my project manager was jerk so we never talked to each other at all."
good,AAR is a decent company to work for but I would not recommend it to many people. The only reason I have stayed for as long is for the people on my crew. We are a family. The management is horrible.
good,"Just do your job, and go resource what you need. Their will be no support only issues. Get paid every other Friday. A typical day starts at 7, no one will be there but you, management will be sleep"
good,always clustered and un safe. work 60-80 hrs a week...rushed.
good,"It was a great place to learn, and the people I worked with were very helpful and great people in general. Management on the other side needs to compensate the contractors as equally as they do to their directs or at least compensate them in a way."
good,Work is stressful but the people are nice. Some management can be cut throat for the most part. The best part of the job is coming in to make money and meeting new vendors everyday for the most part. The workplace culture is also a good thing. I learned a lot about the aviation part of it and its a lot of hands on training as well.
good,A decent place to gain experience on various parts as a technician just starting out. Management is quite laid back when it suits them. This is also another place that does not have advancements. Pay is mediocre.
good,"Worked at AAR several years ago."
good,"This company offers a nice benefits package, but has a very low morale among the majority of the non-management employees. It is a good place to begin your career, but isn't necessarily the best place to stay."
good,"It's a good place as an intern while going to school. Once you earn your Certifications, it would be beneficial to move on."
good,"This company could be great if there was clear direction.  Operating System is out of date, which requires the individual to work harder.  There appears to be no forward planning and no desire to do so."
good,i went into AAR with super good hopes opening up a new facility. only took about 6 months of the first C check A/C coming in for management to blame the techs on why A/C aren't getting out on time or over budget etc..typical MRO mentality and work environment.
good,Could have been better if they offered everything they mentioned in the interview. Understanding but less organized. Good for an experienced person. The salary could be better
good,"Good company, takes care of their employees health wise and time off wise. they made you use your vacation time."
good,"Fast, stressful environment.  lots of disorganization. poor management.  lack of resources and tools.  coworkers are nice.  must mechanics work as a team and help each other."
good,"Great place to learn heavy maintenance, A lot of OJT available, everyone is friendly. Not a cut throat job but it is very competitive. Place with plenty of schedules."
good,"Hires entry level mechanics at low starting wages, so not a career company, but a good place to get experience.  Management lacks direction and communication.  Morale is typically lower than average."
good,"Reshaping the industry within the aerospace. A company that has potential for offering new comers and recent college graduates to establish a foot in the door, along with possible advancement. However too many chiefs, not enough Indians causing for turnover and poor management practices."
good,3rd shift and did not get to used my tools to much. I learned more commercial trade and management was not around on 3rd shift that much so did not interact with management. Always got along with co-workers. The hardest parts was 3rd shift and the most enjoyable part was working for different airlines.
good,AAR isn't the worst place to work and would be alot better if the pay was more. For the most part everyone there is great to work with. It is fast paced and constantly providing new problems to be fixed.
good,"I'd like to start by saying that AAR is a great place to start in this industry. The work environment is for the most part friendly, and coworkers are the best part of the day for me personally, but after being here for a few years, things are starting to feel repetitive, I feel unappreciated for the work I do, and most of all underpaid for what I do. I've been working in the commercial warehouse now for several years and in that time I've seen this place boon in the volume of parts coming in and out the door. The sad thing is that almost all of this work falls on a few people's shoulders and to make it worse you're asked to put up with it day in, and day out.  Not to mention that if you show that you are even the least bit competent and capable of working, you'll be thrown into additional courses and classes to get you certified in Forklift operating, HazMat shipping, AES filing etc. but you'll NEVER see a pay increase for it. Pretty much you get to do more work and not get paid for it. Almost all the emphasis is put on the sales team and their numbers, even if it's at the cost of every other department here. This warehouse is packed wall to wall with inventory that can't be properly stored and all people seem to cafe about is getting more parts in this building. The work culture has been very slowly changing for the better, but sadly I don't see myself working here long enough to get to the point where I feel adequately compensated or appreciated."
good,Managment very poor lost job due to son's dislike of me. jordon head mat handler man manager are related. Conflict of interest.   Work there for 8 months until dad became manager.
good,"50 hour per week minimums. Pretty low paying for the work that you're doing and bad health insurance/retirement. Upper-management has a kind of an out-to-get-you mentality and makes it pretty obvious they don't care much about you as an individual. Lower level management is great and the culture overall makes it a good place to work though. Very comparable to a military unit as far as mentality, culture, structure and camaraderie."
good,"A day at work can fluctuate from too much at once to not enough work."
good,Underpaid and poor management. No room for advancement. Very high turnover . Lack of training. Good place if you want to have experience but don't expect too much on pay raise.
good,"I was thankful having it but had to self teach very few there were able to teach inexperienced. Work/life balance not great expect constant 10-12 hrs. No one has weekends off. Lots of ""Hurry get it done however you can, sell buybacks to inspection however you can."" come the delivery dates of the planes. Had its good and bads but to me not a great place to stay long term."
good,The hours change daily. Some days you have to work overtime without notice. Then other days you will be called off work after you have already walked in the building.
good,AAR is an established company with years of Aviation experience. By utilizing supported business units it develops solutions organically to meet the customers demands.
good,Work load is not consistent and they layoff  often they seem to always blame the employee for and downtime or workplace injures micro manage when not needed and are quick to find fault
good,always busy but not room to advance. My immediate VP and director  are very good people persons with very good people skills. I do have a problem with the way the folks on the floor are treated. Very low pay and given a lot of responsibility for which one mistake gets them fired even if they tell management they never did that type of work.
good,"Welcome to work usually 8 a.m. and there is a cafeteria where you are able to eat breakfast. "
good,Good place to start a career in aviation if your goal is to be an Aviation Technician. They give you all the tools to succeed and a lot can be learned since the type of work isn't limited to certain checks. Facility handles all type of A/C checks.
good,"A good place for mechanics to get a foot in the door and advance in their careers. However, management is lacking communication. A typical day is simple as a QC inspector. there is always a-lot to be learned in a career field. My co-workers are always helpful and open for help."
good,"Company started out having that ""small shop"" feel where everyone knew each other. It's now growing very quickly and losing some of that personality."
good,Work day was unperdictable unknown where you would be working each day.
good,"~Responsibility’s Work with Supervisors and Inspection; to inspect and change as needed parts while maintaining proper paper work and documentation though out all levels of  inspection to properly deliver the following aircraft 200, 700 and 900 CRJ’s Dash 8’s . I find working with AAR an uplifting challenge and have acquired many work related friendships."
good,"12hr shift.learned to used hand tools. friendly work environment. the hardest part was 12hr shift and working weekends,had no time for family."
good,"Typical large corporate entity. Heavy emphasis on bottom line. No land lines in the building but issued a phone you had to pay for. Lied about SCA premium on a government contract pre hire, then reneged. Bottom dollar remuneration for skills. Middle management for the most part made the effort bearable but they were treated with the same cavalier attitude as those in the trenches."
good,Good job to get you into the aviation materials handling niche. Very helpful staff and interesting materials. The problem lies in the management. Their focus is on the customers happiness and the employees dont matter nearly as much as they should.
good,Not a place to continue your career.  I would say this is a place to get that stepping stone to the next point in your career. the pay is okay but it really isnt worth it considering the stress you are under and they pay you 1 extra dollar an hour to be a lead mechanic.  nah
good,"relaxed setting, was able to personally grow by gaining experience. not much room for growth, management doesn't communicate well. great colleagues to work with, makes the job more enjoyable."
good,"I found many things I didn't care for at AAR, but overall a fair place to work and learn. It's a very fast pace work environment, and one must be ready and willing to think for themselves."
good,"Worked for a temporary contract. Procured parts and repair for military and commercial aircraft. "
good,I actually liked working there at first.After about a month I could tell the people only worried about themselves.I didn't feel any team effort.kinda sad.
good,AAR was a challenging place to work with the flexibility and leeway to manage the department as each manager deemed fit. Not a micromanaging organization but had experienced senior leadership to keep things in line
good,Just a lot of walking from parking lot and within the facility. Haed to get a lot accomplished or to get in touch with Mgmt. for answers to questions.
good,The Plant I work at was in trouble and eventually closed down. I new the this when I excepted the job. I was told that they had plan to turn it around and was on course with bench marks that were in place for success were being meet.
good,Paid good and benefits were great but people were lazy and complained about the lack of work that was really done. Union was weak there which ultimately related in over six hundred people loosing there jobs in a small community.
good,Every man hour counts towards the bottom line.  High degree of attention to detail and quality required to complete work assignments.  Paperwork is just as important as the physical work.
good,It is a good place to start out and progress from. I learned a lot while I was there and am glad the doors opened up for me to continue to learn elsewhere.
good,I did like my job as Sr. tool clerk for many years.Company offered good benefits to its employees.
good,"A typical day at work will vary every day, from the possibility of simply painting a project to fabricating whole parts utilized in fixing aircraft. While in the job field i have learned to become a structural mechanic with sheet metal and a machinist capable of precision parts. Co-workers are usually the best to work in a team in this environment. There is always a hard part to any job every day considering all jobs vary in skill level and change daily, but everything is not impossible. The most enjoyable part of my job is allowing myself to further my skills in my field of expertise."
good,"Just like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it. I will say this much about AAR. There's ample opportunity, for those who seek it to learn and advance to a certain point. If not for the opportunities available within AAR, I wouldn't be where I am now."
good,I had been with this company for approximately 4 1/2 years and they have messed up my pay on three different occasions.  Over the past two months they have neglected to pay me on two different occasions for work I had completed.  Instead of making right there on the spot they made me wait until the next pay period which caused me to fall into higher tax brackets which took more money out of my pocket.
good,work a lot of different scheduals and don't consider family life /fire people for any mistake / overtime/ want you to work way to much
good,"I met plenty of great and cool individuals here, but there was too much pressure to learn things a little bit too quickly. Do something wrong you get the silent treatment"
good,The work is fine it’s just sometimes when there’s no work to do they expect us to still work. Then that causes them to cut hours so that mean lil pay.
good,"Can learn a lot from the experienced mechanics "
good,Starting with a program at the ground level is very difficult when the resources to accomplish the task at hand is unavailable. Lacking the support need to be successful we seceded completing the project on time
good,"Large Aircraft Services.  Heavy Checks.  Nice hangar, Winters can be a challenge, but it is a cooled and heat hangar..  Very political and click-ish.  Jobs are selected on a buddy system."
good,I have worked for AAR Corporation for 14 years and have seen many people come and go but the current Program Manager is extremely stressful and not a good Leader.
good,I've only been working for them for a couple of months. as of yet it seems like a pretty good comapnt to work for. Will give better feedback as it progresses
good,"Job duties and employees are just fine. management and HR are inconsistent. "
good,"Fast paste but, a great learning experience. amazing to see and preform c checks on wide body aircraft great hangers and tools as well. great place for learning."
good,Everything was good until they lost the contract but overall good company for the short time that I was employed there.  How many words do I need to type before I can just post my resume.
good,"Working a project and staying on track or moving the dead line to the left. The most important skill I learned was communicating with the customer, very valuable! The satisfying part of the job was making schedule and budget."
good,"rev up drawing, to fix errors, creating new parts and new drawings."
good,They hired me as part of a government contract that they lost. My time with the organization was short lived. They don't have a strong culture since the organization has grown so fast.
good,Not much to say about this company. It's been years since I received a paycheck from them and I know nothing about the current environment. Was laid off partly due to their failure to maintain a long-standing contract.
good,Did not work there very long. I was an intern and enjoyed what i did while i was there. Mainly helped with model designs and help develop execution plans.
good,"Small company with big ideas.  Needed more investing in BD and more investing in the growth of its people.  In an ever changing job and business market they refused to change,"
good,feast or famine. regular c check environment.  long hours. lots of overtime. nice people. Rush to get things done. stressful at times. nice hangers. hot
good,"There's good people in the company, its great place to learn but sadly there is very little room for advancement.  The midnight shift is mainly for aircraft movement, you get to do some work there but not as much as during the morning shift or the afternoon shift. if you are trying to get some hands on experience the afternoon shift will be the best to join."
good,"The management was not so good but fair. I started out as interior technician. My mangers were pleased with my potentials and quality of my work, was always asked if wanted to work over time. The management was very friendly."
good,"Engaging in work activity"
good,This company does not value it's employees and pays much less that what is competitive in the industry. I would not suggest to anyone to work here.
good,At the time I was there the management wasn't what I would consider good but the overall workplace was good as well as my co-workers.
good,"The company and its leaders are good. When we do not have work, you have to stay at the hotel without pay - that's the hardest part. Job is by"
good,Had a blast working here. The management team is friendly and willing to make changes when necessary. Highly motivated place to work. If you want lots of overtime this is the place to go.
good,Started with PAW as a buyer and was promoted to a lead buyer in January 2009.
good,Money was good but they had little care about their employees very disappointed with the end result.
good,"A typical day at works keeps you busy working on equipment."
good,"Read and interprets manufacturer and airline maintenance manuals, service bulletins and other specifications documentation to determine feasibility and method of altering, repairing or replacing associated components, and determining the airworthiness of the aircraft and its associated components and replacement for malfunctioning or damaged components. Inspect completed work to certify that maintenance meets standards and that aircraft are ready for operation. Inspected Engines (CJR200 Engine-GE CF34-3B1, CRJ700 Engine-GE CF34-8C1, CRJ900 Engine-GE CF34-8C5) and their associated components for airworthiness; repairs or replaces defective engine parts and associated components; removes and installs engines onto the aircraft.

Replace or repair worn, defective, or damaged components, using hand tools, gauges,"
good,"I worked for AAR Mobility in Cadillac, MI for about 4 years.. off and on.. I was laid off a total of 2 of those 4 years. Floor managers were mostly nice and but I can think of 1 that actually had their stuff together."
good,load trucks&move material around station to station.
good,It was a job. Was ok to work there. Co-workers were fine to work with.
good,challenging at times but overall the people a great. I would recommend this facility to a friend.
good,very busy days where you learned a lot .got invloved with project that had to do with difrent airplanes
good,Contract paid on time.. Old products. Needed R&D lost many opportunities due to pricing.
good,"Management doesn't have a clue what happens on the floor, and are willing to let you go at a moments notice. Supervisors are, for the most part, very good, and hands off. They let the Lead Mechanics do their jobs. Project Managers (and only some of them) and above don't have a clue. I think that once they got above Supervisor, they forgot what it's like to work on aircraft."
good,Lots of good eperience on comercial aircraft. Great people to work with who can teach you alot. plenty of time off with vacation floating holidays and such.
good,AAR is a great place to work. especially if you are just starting a career in aviation. AAR have a great Atmosphere of people with good attitudes
good,AAR Corp is a growing company that needs good workers. The company has the potential to be one of the most successful MRO's in the world with the right employees. Management can stand to make better decisions but the workforce is the key.
good,I would arrive on given days and work with he clerks to come up with solutions to a better performance. Redesigned the layout of the shipping department and created a more controlled work space and method in order to make better use of limited time and space.
good,"This was my first experience with a 145 repair station. I was born and bred a skid kid and have worked in a squadron type environment up until this job. I would promote this job for an up and coming mechanic, but not for someone with 15 years of aviation experience, an A&P license and an FCC license."
good,"A typical day was selling product through emails and phone calls. Keeping tabs on inventory levels and backlog orders to ensure we had enough stock to meet demands and timelines. Learned excellent time managemnt skills, abiility to multi task and create a maintain vendor and customer relationships. Management fostered our success and growth. My co-workers were excellent and everyone really cared for each other and wanted to do well. Hardest part was losing talented colleagues and having to replace them and their skills. Most enjoyable part was building professional yet friendly relationships with vendors and suppliers."
good,"A typical work day is extremely fast paced and schedule dependent. With this job you learn what you would in the course of 5 years in 1 year as you are exposed to many different stages of aircraft certification and project goals. You are cycled from systems engineering, to stress engineering, design, project engineering and testing. Once you show what you are most efficient at then you are placed in a position within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are always learning and you always have something to do. If a project gets slow, you can go onto another project and help there."
good,I spent 10 years here. Learning and growing the whole time. Made some life long friendships. Fun things to work on challenge to my mind. Laid back not pushy. Got to see a lot of neat stuff. And advanced within. Pay was not good. Raises were hard to get. You had to beg for more money. And most people in charge knew less then the people they were trying to direct or manage. So if you needed help you were on you own.
good,With customer demands our schedules are flexible. We can work overtime one week or non at all the next week. AAR corporation does offer many opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"AAR is a huge MRO."
good,"A typical day at work consists of, engaging in serious work activity according to the task at hand and completing tasks accurately and promptly as need."
good,"Ive learned a lot of valuable information and had many hours of critical hands on experience with many systems and components at AAR Corp, which I hope will springboard me to my next job. The current management at AAR in Hot Springs however is weak and shaky at best, but with a little encouragement and a push toward intruding less into the daily work environment that floor mechanics share I believe that this could all be turned around for good."
good,All employees are greeted with a smile from one another throughout the day. People are willing to help one another and are dedicated to do the best they can. The hardest part of the job is the fact that in the last four years the company has gone through a great deal of change in management and key personel.
good,I enjoyed working here except when were working 12 hours 7 days . that was very rough on the body mind and family but great on the pocket.
good,Started out as a mech 1 but never really had a chance to advance due to the loss of there contracts and the closure of operations at the lake Charles facility
good,Very fast pased and stressfull environment. My manager was excellent. The job is tough due to the high stakes of the career. I would recommend to people who can deal with this type of work.
good,"AAR Corp. is a very good company to work for offering world wide opportunity."
good,"My current job with AAR Corp has had its ups and down, but overall it has been a great job for me. I started this job at the age of 19 and it has done great at providing for myself and my family over the last 6 years, but sadly the department I work in has a very low ceiling and you cap out really early. We are contracting with the SCA so are wages do not increase based off of our performance. They are only increased with the SCA rate increases which doesn't happen very often. I have received and experienced many great things from this job, but it is time to move on to bigger and better challenges."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. It was a great first job after college."
good,productive and fun and exciting learning how to assemble stuff relay box and breaker box. Management was great.  co-workers great to work with. bending 2 inch pipe everything
good,Good company to work for if you really need a job. With the contracts being awarded or not determines job security and future of employment is always at risk with government contracts.
good,"the company was a good company, the management was poor and like a mafia, the traveling was out of control, and the pay was bad for the time, after all company ok"
good,"Great Company however there is no job security. "
good,good company to work for and coworkers were great. No stability nor advancement.hands on learning but was not provided all tools to complete certain tasks. Company failed to provide notification to workers that lay off was in place until day of
good,"Production Controller"
good,"- Knowledgeable Mod Crew  For Virgin American Airlines  A-300."
good,"You will work around very experienced co-workers, however time is always a huge factor. Be prepared to break a sweat working while maintaining perfect safety standards and work."
good,fast pace a lot of aviation advances management could be better people are great human resource is there but can rarely help the employee good people of diverse cultures
good,"Management turn over and employee relations suffered at times. Overall management of resources was lacking. High employee turnover. While facilities for aircraft maintenance was quite adequate, management of the facility and it's potential was not fully utilized."
good,The best part about AAR are the people.  The company as a whole has made tremendous progress.  It is an exciting place to work.
good,Everyday working at this place I wondered myself if I was going to work today or be sent home.
good,If you can handle stress at times make it fun and enjoy working on planes. It’s hard to mess things up here because you have a lot of people that are willing to help you if you are unsure about things. The walk into work does suck I’m not gonna lie and they make you clock out in ur hanger so you have to use ur time to walk all the way out to ur car it’s like a mile walk so expect to be on ur feet all day but it was a fantastic experience
good,"A typical day at work included, but not limited to, creating drawings for an aerospace project."
good,Lack planning to support different job categories working same general areas. Lack long term planning or scheduled overtime. Could have used more trainers and inspectors.
good,"No Room for advancement. Crews are constantly juggled, so crew adherence does not exist. Management sometimes over run each other in duties assigned to the crews"
good,Plenty of work with zero down time.I learned new skills while applying skills i already acquired. I learned how the airline business is run. Very poor management but worked with very knowledgeable supervisors and co-workers.
good,Great business but all the work is leaving are area jobs moving to other states
good,ive worked here for almost 5 years and i dont regret it. ive learned alot and worked with good people.
good,"Employee interactions with the organization, through other employees, management, customers, or others, reinforces (or resists) the employee identification with the organization.[2] Simultaneously, the employee must manage their ""true self"" identification. In other words, identity is ""fragmented and constructed"" through a number of interactions within and outside of the organization; employees do not have just one self."
good,"I worked 10+ hours a day but 4 days a week, Sunday through Wednesday 0530 to 1600. A person needs to have Computer Knowledge and helpful if you have had shipping and receiving experience as well as forklift experience. Pay could be better as you have a lot of responsibilities. I like that this job kept me going all day."
good,you did your job and that is all it was expected of you unless they needed you to work overtime. The people were fair which I prefer because I place that above nice.
good,Good place to acquire skills and develope as a worker. It is a place where each one teaches one and NEVER lets one person be the only one who can perform a task. They continually offers developmental training to employees.
good,"Great place to work, advancement opportunities, aviation industry, sales, purchasing. Numerous locations, international branches with different airlines"
good,Was a good school to apply my past knowledge and learn a few more. Great team work and the best team leader (Cisco). We never were late on our task to do by days.
good,"The company is a great place to work. I would recommend anyone who is interested in  the aviation industry to apply there.  "
good,Culture that is committed to winning in the markets that it competes; and backed with the support of management to win. Support with capital investment of money and resources. Strong desire to be a leader in the industry.
good,"Worked there for almost 5 years before i was terminated. Management wasn't the best at times, but all in all it was a good place to work with good people. Very Veteran friendly company."
good,A fast pace and hard working environment filled with ups and downs in work all year round. An accepting environment and friendly oriented facility.
good,nice place to work and a nice enviroment. Its a great place to get back on your feet at.

good,"There is much opportunity to learn while working there, but there is also a great deal of frustration."
good,"I purchase aircraft parts, GSE equipment and tooling for the MRO.  We currently do maintenance on A330 aircraft."
good,"AAR has many locations and opportunities for individual advancement. I enjoyed working here because of the diverse work details, always a new opportunity and plenty of challenges daily. Plenty of opportunity to enhance individual work skills in a team environment."
good,"Productive and informational, very inspirational place to work"
good,During this time the Indianapolis branch is shifts management & making new changes. The effects of this process have affected the shifts hours to go from 8 to 10hr shifts which have caused some issues amongst staff.
good,Enjoyed the environment of the fast-past work it required. The best thing about this company is the Co-Workers I got to work alongside with and helped trained.
good,"Get your work assignment, review procedure, take measurements, remove damage, install repair, complete paperwork, have work inspected, turn in work assignment, get new work assignment. Learned many new ways to efficiently solve problems in a timely manner. Management provided helpful solutions to many problems. Workers were very helpful. Hardest par of the job was working behind someone else on the same project. Most enjoyable part was completing a project in less time then what was given and doing it correctly and safely."
good,"A great place to work if you like a fast pace as many opportunities in growing and global aviation industry.  Once you prove yourself, opportunities for advancement."
good,"The general manager was inexperienced and did not handle pressure well.  He defined what the forecast would be not finance and accounting."
good,"Work does slow down at times but usually the good mechanics will still have work and they will try their hardest to keep you from going home."
good,"Very busy MRO facility.  Great management team, who cares about their employees.  Learned all about the airline(s) industry and their required maintenance programs.  MRO was located in a very busy part of the city, so driving into work was a bit challenging.  Enjoyed working with a great great people."
good,"It was a family atmosphere, didnt like warehouse manager, other than that i loved my job. It could be really faced paced at times and alot of headaches trying to locate parts. The lady in Human resources was awsome"
good,AAR receives many interns from George T. Baker Aviations School and it is a great opportunity to be able to mentor the young men that will soon follow in our footsteps.
good,"Email"
good,"It was a great experience, very entrepenurial spirit. I would recommend working here."
good,AAR was easy going job everyday.  People was willing to help you if you didn’t know things. I learned certain HVAC knowledge.  The supervisor was easy to talk to and understanding.  I didn’t have any problems or issues learning the process of AAR work
good,It help me improve my electrical mechanical skills since I worked there.  There was a lot of changes as I was going thru the company but they always set good working standards.
good,"It keeps you on your toes, searching for cars the need be repossed and getting over 10,000 vehicle tags scanned in one day. Drive anywhere and everywhere to get your tags."
good,"Worked on a rotation basis overseas. Good rotation, but they pay your flight reimbursement as a wage payment so it’s taxed and doesn’t cover all your ticket price to fly back home, same with your annual bonus. Other than that I like the work and the people I worked with."
good,I would recommend AAR as a platform to start a career in aviation maintenance for A&P's that are fresh out of school.  Culture there is good and people are willing to help each other when needed or if asked.  There are plenty of opportunities for advancement for the younger generation of technicians.
good,great people and very secure work enviroment. Safe clean and competative in the industry high quality workmanship. Management was always very invovled to assist with any and all concerns
good,"AAR Corp offers a great environment for people looking for a workplace where they can collaborate, have fun, and make money. The culture is centered around a ""work hard, play hard"" mentality. It is  fast-paced, but overall a great place to work."
good,Definitely a good place to start as an aircraft technician either on the A/P side of things or R/E but it doesnt pay well in the grand scheme of things and there is no room to grow or advance.
good,"If you can deal with the culture of the aviation field, and also can deal with not being paid what other companies pay for their people. Then this is place for you. But if you just got you A/P and need the experience under your belt then AAR is the place to start out at."
good,"My short time with AAR as an IT contractor for the first C-130H program mission in Kabul, Afghanistan. We were at ground zero for this particular mission, so stand up was pretty important. Operation hours typically were 6 days a week, 10 hours a day...as long as we operated by the berm gate hours to HKIA. I've learned how to make necessary adjustments in standing up a 9ft dish, with some assistance from local nationals, and getting our modem as close to the dish as possible...being on the 2nd floor of the hangar bay area. Most of my coworkers were pretty easy and laid back to work with and seem to know their jobs by application and technical explanation. The hardest part of the job is always standing up from scratch. Miscommunication occurred from top (esp. with management on ground) down almost everyday and at every turn, primarily because there were more assumptions made than actual, factual applications needed to help the mission run smoothly between HQ and what's actually on grounds (Kabul). Still, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work in an austere environment alongside with the Afghani military and to bust myths of American incivility, while helping them make history to support them standing up their C-130H program."
good,Help to socialized with fellow works. And talk about the work that had to done and what was need to accomplished our task.

good,"Amazing company to work for if you need a job to get your foot in the door. But due to high layoffs and no benefits if you are a contractor, its best if you find another job after a few years of experience."
good,"2 ten hr. shifts four days a week and one 8 hr. shift 5 days a week, pay period every 2 weeks, constantly stay busy , average binafits, normal paid holidays."
good,Management has gone down hill used to be a fun place to work co workers is what makes the job bearable
good,Good group of people - hard workers
good,"Work with teams or alone performing sheet metal and composite maintenance to South West Airline Boeing 737-NG, and 737-CL aircraft. The hardest part of the job is the schedule and travel to and from work."
good,"a few really good people and workers, a very different environment if you come from a professional work background. some nice perks like free coffee and building-wide employee events."
good,"The work was desirable, the types of A/C receiving maintenance were the types I wanted to work.  The supervisors turned the workplace into a ""sweat shop"".  They were always telling all of the mechanics to hurry up."
good,Newer company in Rockford. The people make it worthwhile! Being a newer company there is always some hiccups along the way. Be prepared to see AAR Rockford as a powerhouse in the MRO Industry!

good,A typical day of work includes being on time at 7am then checking email and drinking coffee until orders are ready to select from the aisles. When shipments start to arrive my priority is receiving.
good,"I would review my e-mail in the morning and respond to any questions or issues. I would meet with the project manager daily to come up with a plan for the week, and go over the schedule and work progress , and address any issues at hand, and keep him in the loop. I would attend site meeting or meet with the Contractor daily on site as well as being in contact with the sub Contractors. I would review the slabs wall etc. for rebar installation and note deficiencies in a written report as well  as talk to the sub Contractor on site to have the issue addressed and corrected on site that day  if possible. I would go back to the office and write up a report and issue it to the appropriate parties.

good,"Great co-workers made for an enjoyable time at this company and the work load was normal, not overwhelming. The only con was poor management and lack of advancement."
good,"Great job culture, nice people, a lot of experience in aviation industry, but work/life balance leaves much to be desired. Would definitely recommend this company though."

Great logistics family."
good,I really enjoyed working at AAR. My coworkers were wonderful the environment was great. I do feel as if some of the managers had some people they favored and some they didn't. The Hardest part of my job was picking up heavy parts. The best part of my job was seeing my work after it was done.

After leaving the Navy I started at AAR as a Tech 1 (lowest rating) and left as a Director.  Held many positions in differing disciplines.  I was also abut 25% travel at one point when there.

I also was responsible for purchasing all tacticle clothing as well as ensuring the clothing had proper logo's to seperate AAR from other contractors working in Afghan. My co-workers were easy to work with as the job requirements were stressful at times. We worked as a team to assist each other during times when airline tickets needed to be changed. This was frequent.The hardest part of my job was attempting to maintain the work that was necessary to deploy our employees, as well as order and maintain all tactical gear for over 500 employees.

good,Learned how not to lead. Manager was poor at communicating and inconsistent when communications did occur - this was the hardest part of the job. Too much micro managing because you did not do a task the why the manage wants it done - but how it was to be done was not communicated leaving you to do it your way and be criticized or have to guess how it was expected to be done. You would be told you were in charge but that was not true.
