good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,Don’t work here That don’t appreciate you.. the paid sucks.. People lazy. People talk about you behind your back.. you don’t get your hours... The benefits sucks
bad,I've never worked for a company in my life the management staff had their picks between employees. They under pay you for one and they give you a raise so low you wont be able to see it on your check
bad,"One of the most unprofessional offices I’ve ever worked. I laughed at some of the other postings that said this company paid good. Question: Do you consider $15 an hr. good pay? Whats wrong: 1. A general lack of pride. This shows in a lack of a dress code. It used to be business casual, but now it’s just sloppy. Jeans and T Shirt or sweat pants. 2. Low pay. Even if you have a college degree you won’t start at more than $15 an hr. Raises barely keep up with inflation. (.25-.50 cents an hr.) 3. A poor training program. Managers are very sarcastic, and condescending. They have many benefits, but at $15 an hr. You can’t afford them. Health insurance goes up higher than your raises every year. So, your pay is actually going down every year. There is also a very high turnover rate. HR is clueless and doesn’t care.  This is not a job for a single adult. Most of the employees are younger who live with their parents or married women who are working for ""Fun Money"""
bad,Management is bad and if you're a driver your load is not loaded right and there's nothing you can say or do about it also the dock workers don't care
bad,"Only the lazy admin people of the night are the ones that last in that company"
bad,Bad company . manager and lead are worthless just sit around and do nothing always on their phones and expect you to do all the work also alot of favortism.
bad,"First off you'll start with the afternoon meeting with the ""Big Boss"" who enjoys berating you (second shift) and then ask for you to be at your absolute best through out the shift. Secondly management is wildly disrespectful to BULK employee's and shows no empathy AT ALL. The place is riddled with minorities (foreigners) who don't mind being treated or spoken to in a SUB HUMAN manner. You will be facing an uphill battle with little to very very little training hence HIGH TURNOVER RATE. If you have any self respect I implore you to find something better. Last but not least any good comments about this company PLEASE take those with a grain of salt."
bad,"Awful management, it's a lot of favoritism some people can walk around without working while others work like slaves there's no room for advancement you will be there for 20 years doing the same thing"
bad,I worked here full time and it was the one that paid the least for my experience. The pay here isn’t all that great except for the executives. I couldn’t recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"High turnover rate due to poor management/lack of advancement leads to long work days for the remaining employees who will then not be treated with appreciation. Was given a 1% raise (15 cents) after becoming one of the top pickers in the building in 6 months. For measure, a new employee with 45 days under their belt was given the same raise. No bonuses or incentives based on how hard or fast you get things done."
bad,"This place is a BIG revolving door. You cant get people to stay no matter what you do. Some are catered to and that whole "" doing the job "" thing applies to some and not all"
bad,Certain managers that work in oaks should be fired .You get hurt there and have to seek a lawyer the company tries to fire you. Your a robot there they care about numbers certain employees kiss managers butt to get over time employees rule the company some employees steal other coworkers lunch smoke pot in bathroom fights at lunch hr. Does nothing worst company ever there must of been over 100 employees that left in 2 years of me being there
bad,Management pretty much has no sense of what being a higher up is. The breaks are ridiculous. Favoritism is shown blatantly out in the open. Accountability is never heard of there. The turnover rate is horrible.
bad,Worst place I  ever worked. Lowest pay long hours managers stab you in the back  hr never does there job  they worry about safety  but the place is a walking disaster employees run the place worst training ever employees hit objects with equipment thousand of dollars in damage  nothing happens bunch of  back stabbers  people come and go employees steal other people stuff like there lunches  or winter jackets  and again nothing happens to them but if u take companys belongings  your fired  dont care if you got hurt they do nothing keep your mouth shut and kiss there butts
bad,"Don't be fooled by this companies, sugar coats, and lies. they are a shady company to work for and I wouldn't recommend working for them AT ALL not even if you're desperate for money, there are thousands of other better opportunities than this, just stay patient and steer clear of this company"
bad,"Entrenched managment, no possibility of promotion/advancement, overworked, underpaid, constant policy changes, dying business looking to squeeze maximum value for minimum $"
bad,Management really sucks. Men act like females and females like like men. Management gets mad if you don't volunteer for overtime. Management tries to intimidate workers but we laugh at them.
bad,"Management has their favorites. Union environment protects the weak and hurt the strong. Face paced with tons of overtime with last minute notification, making for hard work life balance."
bad,Everyone at Essendant is nice; however the workload is very high and the Manager do nothing to help with the work.  They set impossible deadlines not do not plan for enough hours to complete the work.  The Manager except themselves from having to do any SOX audit related work and provide not support.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,"DONT WORK HERE, hr doesn't care about employees, neither does managers. They don't look out for anyone but themselves. Whatever you do, stay away from this place."
bad,Was a long work day Hot I learn not to trust your manager the culture was very diverse the hardest part of the job was keeping the warehouse clean employee didnt care
bad,"Essendant was a good company to work for before it transitioned into Essendant. Pay and benefits are decent but not great. Management and Corporate is horrible. A lot of favoritism is played in the warehouse. Management lets those that tend to be slackers do what they want and put all the workload onto the hard working employees. The warehouse I worked in is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter, very dirty, and inventory is out of control with damage product in all locations. Within the last couple years the business has been on a steady decline. I believe soon the facility will be shutdown due to poor customer service and unproductive warehouse associates and poor management."
bad,"No training, no room for growth, associates get no respect and have no voice from leadership. Lower level employees are excluded from benefits that other departments receive. You are over worked, under- paid, and treated with no respect."
bad,"One of the worst jobs ever. Underpaid, slave driven atmosphere.  Management doesn't have a clue. Human resources does not care about employees. Not allowed to have a life outside of work, because you'll be working 12 hr. days, Saturdays and if necessary Sundays included."
bad,"No incentive to employees .  No focus on getting you hired permanantly. No benifits or motivation to work long term."
bad,"Good co-workers with energetic management"
bad,"My Job at UNITED STATIONERS was a very good and so much learned with this Company, came in as a File Clerk in 1985 and left as a Customer Service Rep. in September 2002. I loved learning so much and worked my way up from File Clerk to Computer Operator and them Customer Service, and still backing up File Dept. , Switchboard, all outbound and inbound Mail. This Company gave me so much learning and working with Customers in helping them to resolve any issues they had. "
bad,Management is terrible and the raises are complete trash. Every manager there is a professional at lying to your face. I would walk through the office and hear them all making fun of situations and issues people have had with whoever or whatever was going on there and then see them out on the floor acting like they care. Don't waste a second of your life in this place. People come and go all of the time because of all of the bs. If you want to live your life stressed out and miserable then go ahead and apply.
bad,The people that comprise United Stationers are its greatest asset.
bad,"tough and stressful work"
bad,Very stressful job. Horrible and unsafe material handling equipment. There's a shortage of forklifts and the forklifts are always breaking down and constantly need repairing. Managers always hassle employees about overtime while it is impossible to decrease with the volume of work and absence of employees regularly. Raises are very small annually and never exceeds 45 cents per year even if you deserve more. Managers are constantly changing the way employees work which in turn ends up causing more overtime and puts more stress on the workers and there have been many times where we go back to the original way of performing the tasks. Ultimately just an unintelligent management staff and just not worth it. Anyone can vouch for this
bad,Ineffective management and a disregard for the company's fundamental culture has made this a horrible place to work.  High turn-over and lack of leadership has made it very stressful over the last 5 or more years.
bad,"You will be told great things. They push Fortune 500 company in your face. But the building is run down! Men's bathroom with no toilet set. Smiles like urine so bad you can hardly use it."
bad,"Constant turnover "
bad,All the manager there are horrible. HR is the worse if she is still there she should've been fired. Management is never held accountable for their actions. You do not want to work for a company who doesn't care about their workers at all. I could go on and on. I might come back just to finish.
bad,"Don't promote within, disrespect the employees, and management is never on the floor. Never work here. 200+ people have come and gone."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want.

They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,"The transport department lacks leadership. What I have learned is that they don't promote from within, which is great for drivers looking to retire in a truck, but people who are ambitious and want to advance would have to go else where. I have been with the company for many years. They have a transportation manager who is racist and has gotten away with a lot of wrong doing. The sad thing is that how does this corporation allow people like that to be a part of it and expect the company to continue to grow. I feel sorry for the current drivers of color for having to deal with such nonsense."
bad,"Terrible facility. (Perris ,CA.) Upper and lower Management is inexperienced . Extremely low morale.  Management does not take employees issues seriously. I wouldn't let my worse enemies work here. This facility also has pending lawsuits."
bad,"One of the worse jobs ive ever had. The management is never available, we're in multiple roles because we are extremely short staffed because of a very high turnover. Management is never willing to listen to suggestions from associates and the amount of overtime daily is completely unnecessary."
bad,"I wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy. 10-14 hr days monday through saturday. They have no emergency contact number yet we cant have our phones on us or else its a write up. To get a day off they need 2 weeks in advance notice or you wont get it off. If you leave after your 8 hours because of an emergency, you still get a write up for not doing overtime. You only get get 4 points then youre fired. They dont care if you are sick and throwing up, if you leave early, its a point. People work with fevers and colds and throwing up but are afraid to go home because of the point they will get. I seen one guy was having a hear stroke and didnt go home ,just sat down in the break room because he didnt want a point. Management is there physically but not mentally. Its like working at a prison camp. You have no say so ,if you speak up, they harrass you and give you a point. People get fired daily. One guy got a point because he called in late to work because his Dad died. They told him he should have called before work started. DON NOT APPLY OR CONSIDER WORKING HERE. THEY WILL OWN YOU UNTIL YOU QUIT OR THEY FIRE YOU."
bad,They treat employees like garbage. Only worried about hitting numbers so they can get their bonus. No work life balance. Other employees are treated like royalty while you are treated like garbage. The managers in this company are running it to the ground trying to squeeze out anyone who thinks differently than they do.
bad,I am very sorry for people who are currently or will be working for this company as warehouse associates. There are always not enough people to pick items to fill out customers' orders. You have to cover for people on vacation or/ and take a day off constantly. There are only 20 mins for lunch break for 8 hour shift. The boxes are coming fast and nonstop. Warehouse associates have to run entire of the shift.
bad,Zero accountability for management and how they run the company. Poor communication and chaos at times. Will terminate with out cause. Will lie to do so.
bad,"Awful environment to work in. You will always be second guessed and micromanaged. "
bad,"the worst place to work no respect,no safety,u will get raise $0.25 a year ,  i didn't learn anything, they have bad management in Suwanee,my co-workers are ok,"
bad,When I was hired I was told that my hours would be from 5am to 2 p.m. well it ends up it was 5am till 4 p.m. all they care about is numbers understaffed under managed horrible place to work you sweat to death in a hot Warehouse they don't care about their employees all they care about is their numbers and if the trucks get unload run run run as far away from essendant  as you can you cannot go home until all trucks are unloaded and in the winter time you fight for hours
bad,"Low morale is an understatement for this company. You start your day off with being told all the wrong you have done in a degrading start up meetings. Management and leads need to be put in a communication class so they can learn how to talk to their employees. Management micro manager to a extreme of ridiculousness. ZERO room for growth!  The GM love bragging that he have never laid off anyone for the 17 years he had been with the company,  um, that's true because everybody do you the favor and resign or quit. The turn around ratio with this company extremely high. They take forever to rehire anyone and expect 9 people to do the work 20 people was doing. The Operation manager, 2nd shift manager and the 2nd shift lead, need a complete over haul on life, management and people skills! I won't recommend this job to no one.  There is no such thing as work life balance with this company.  12 plus hour days with 30 mins lunch. Extreme fast pace, continuous, backbreaking work. And if you slow down it's call ""downtime"" which you would be written up for (they track your every move through your scan gun so they know when you are slowing down).  This place is run like a sweat shop. Beware of United Stationers or (Lagasse in Lithia Springs). I have never been so miserable at a job until I worked here. Hope this review help management realize until they correct themselves the turn over ratio and losing great harding work people will continue. "
bad,"Management and leads have no respect for the workers. This company is run by people who micro manage to the fullest and if they could legally make you work for 12 hours plus, with no lunch or breaks, they would. Managers and leads make sure they sit with you on your half hour lunch and 10 minute breaks just to make sure you are not taking a minute extra. They say the company is a fortune 500 company that made 1 billon dollars in sales in 2012, and told us that we were a major part of their accomplishment. We were awarded with a $27.00 (Twenty seven) bonus. The general manager give us stolen digital cameras that was delivered to our company in error. He removed the serial numbers and gave it to us. There is no end to your shift, they claim the schedule is 2pm-10:30, big lie. If you leave there at 12:30 consider that a good night. "
bad,I worked for United in the 1980s. Corp was terrible . Poor computer system made the job hard.. Had a very poor micro manager. He made work miserable. He was the worst boss i have ever experienced. Glad i left.
bad,"Very hard to stay positive when you are apologizing for things you do not control but responsible for fixing."
bad,Unsafe Industrial equipment. The equipment are decades old and very sketchy to drive. Never a time equipment doesn't fail and need repairs. Would help if management would stop hiring  Incompetent people. Workflow/employee ratio is always off balance. Either there is way to much overtime or not enough hours worked to survive on. People get hired and leave on a regular basis. Raises are very small annually and never exceed 35 cents per year. This place sickens me to the point of quitting every day i work. The only thing this place has going for them is Payed Time Off.
bad,The management at Essendant treated it's employees like children in a school yard.  They made promises of advancement that they never intended on keeping.
bad,I would never recommend this company to anyone and I mean anyone the management is shady as all they pick and choose when they want to imply rules and the management like to pick on / harras you so I repeat that this company is a joke
bad,"There was never team worker. Lack of communication."
bad,"The company is in transition at this time.  They are laying off employees (or already have) in all departments.  Job security cannot be guaranteed as they move through the current changes.  They have extremely strict attendance policies.  This includes if you have children and need to leave for their illness you will be docked attendance points.  The only thing they waived for attendance was if you were admitted to the hospital.  If you have a child, spouse, partner or family member admitted it does not matter; you are still docked on the attendance record.  The management inside is completely hands off so if you want to learn new skills and better yourself professionally this is not the company to work for.  The only positive is that you will find many outside sales representatives and a few (very few) upper management people that are genuinely concerned about you and the company.  The atmosphere inside is that of a high school: gossip, gossip, childlike reporting to managers.  It is far from an adult, professional work place.  The most enjoyable part is that they do include benefits once you are hired on as a permanent employee and they start you with a very fair amount of accrued paid time off."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,If you are a smoker you can talk to your manager any time of day because they are always on a smoke break!  Raises average 4-9 cents annually.  Very little advancement
bad,Management was not willing to listen to supervisors. Didnt care about suggestions and was not a very good leader at all.If he left then I would say the company is great.
bad,"This place is overall horrible! They over work you with a majority of hours and overtime is mandatory no matter what! Its bad, poor management! No communication lack of respect and they talk down to you. Coworkers don’t pull there weight . Alot of favorites i just do not recommend working here alot of people get injured with all the heavy items you lift with no help . Its dangerous worst place ive worked at!"
bad,"worked here for a couple years and the actual work was OK the management was really dysfunctional, breaking laws and rules left and right. Not a good working environment."
bad,"Essendant is trying to get back to profitability but is too arrogant to listen and be open to fresh ideas outside of what they know.  Their Care leadership team is holding the company back; too focused on self preservation; they do not let leaders from the outside execute their plan - they nit pick until they leave.  They need fresh leadership who is not afraid to say something is wrong (rather than pointing fingers) and then having the support to fix it.  Leadership needs to connect with the frontline more - they hide in their offices or conference calls, again contributing to the 'gotcha' culture of this company."
bad,This place is a joke. They make promise after promise and dont follow through on anything. The managers are awful. They rely on the few employees who work their butts off and then let everyone else slide. Zero to no communication and shady practices. Stay far away
bad,"Too high schoolish. If you need something to help maintain a few of the bills until something better comes along then this is your spot. This job isnt something long term. Low morale, gossip, inconsistent management, and poor leadership."
bad,"If you are looking for a warehouse job, this should not be your destination for your next career."
bad,"not a good place to work with the management don't know what the left hand or the right hand is doing, tells you one thing and does the other, yesterday the electricity went out, we went home with no pay."
bad,"Managers and supervisors are lousy. They show favoritism towards the kissy employees. You cant leave if you have a family emergency or you get a write up. You come in late during a car accident its a write up. You only get 4 points and and you are done. They dont care if you have a death in the family, they only care about money. You dont have a life or family here. They treat you like a slave more than treating you like a human. I wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy."
bad,"I worked at the United Stationers Orlando Facility for almost 6 years and it was a waste!  I kept getting passed over for promotions even though I was one of the top level performers and more than qualified.  The department I worked in there was alot of backstabbing and favoritism for those who ""sucked up"",  but slacked off.  It was sickening and I had enough.  I left in early 2014. I work for myself now.  If you think anything of yourself, don't work for this company!"
bad,There are good people at the company but also a lot of corporate politics. The co-workers are nice and helpful. Mid level management and upper management need training. They are not helpful and only think about how they can move up in the company.
bad,"Management has no prior work experience in this job field, Safety is not priorities , favoritism goes around, hostile environment"
bad,"When I started here at the call center there was a culture of “as long as you treat the customer with respect, and solve their problem we’re good” no micro management, no super importance of numbers, no “customer is always right no matter what” attitude. We didn’t have to put on the fake voice, etc. Now if you don’t worship the ground customers walk on you’re doing a poor job and they only ever side with the customer. Don’t have the reps backs at all"
bad,Hard work poor staff I worked there for almost a year and never got a raise. They are more concerned with production then the employees and it is very obvious. It’s ridiculously hot in summer and cold in winter and that’s to be expected.
bad,They don't compensate you for the amount of work you do. They don't even pay you cost of living every year. Management on my shift are not fair at all!
bad,"love my excoworkers reason why i stayed so long, "
bad,"Worked for a long time, and will not miss it. Coworkers are amazing, but the management needs a lot of work. They tend to stress out employees. The best part of the day was leaving."
bad,A good place to get some forklift training on different lifts. Other then that. Its a dead end job with no raises or any job advancements. Only care about getting there numbers met.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want.

They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,"Sounded like a great place to work. Decent but not great pay, good benefits, said they would train me on their picking system ( headset w/hand scanner)  and let me get acclimated to the layout of the warehouse. Didn't happen. My training lasted all of 10 minutes. Then I was on my own. My scanner was useless most of the time and when I went to one of my 4 ""supervisors"" ( when I could find one) for help they told me to ask one of my fellow employees. Which was another battle....they all barely spoke english and were new hires themselves. Got old REAL quick."
bad,"Not a good company to work for. There is racial discrimination going on in this company and although everyone knows it, not many want to speak up or out about it."
bad,worked in accounts payable
bad,"We had race issues when I started so they brought in a African American man to run inbound and outbound. I do things that he doesn't know how to do, and he looks at me like I'm a blow to his pride. So personally I started out dealing with a white boss with race issues to a black boss with pride issues. Not good"
bad,"Management has their favorites. Union environment protects the weak and hurt the strong. Face paced with tons of overtime with last minute notification, making for hard work life balance."
bad,"The management does not respect the employee, they treat the people like animals, because they want to do the whole job at the same shift( Monday- Friday 4:30 p.m-1:00 a.m) for example: pick up the L B I orders, the L T L  orders, U.S.S.C.O orders, the pick up order, export orders,"
bad,"It’s not climate controlled so it’s hot in the summers and cold in the winters. You never knw when your going home because you work till finished. Always short on employees, can’t keep ppl to stay."
bad,They work you till you drop. If you cross train they really treat you like garabage by setting you up so you wont meet the goals.the work place culture is everyone for themselves. The hardest part of the job is trying to make it to the end of the shift
bad,"Poor management, very high health insurance.  Micromanagement. The company has no regard for its employees.  This company is a newly  merged company,  The merged did not go smoothly very irate customers.  Company has done several Lay offs with in the past year."
bad,"I am a previous employee of this company. I left on my own terms for personal reasons I will not mention here. However, this company is not the best company to work for, especially if you are looking to apply for the Customer Care Associate position in Suwanee, GA. The supervisors and managers there do not care about their employees nor their customers. In fact, on many occasions myself and other coworkers brought issues to upper management and nothing was done regarding it. If you are looking for a place of employment where growth is encouraged, this is not the place for you. Supervisors do not work with you to assist you with moving up within the company. They also will not work with you on getting a better schedule, seniority plays a huge part with schedules. The best part about working here are your co-workers because they were in the same position you were and they are very helpful. Also, the benefits are nice as well, you have multiple choices to choose from. The hardest part will be dealing with your rude customers as well as management. If this is something that you can work through, I say go for it. However, you will be looking for employment elsewhere within 18 months."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Would not reccomend. Work"
bad,The hardest part of this job is constant heavy lifting to successfully complete the job. Your body maybe sore at each end of the day. This is by far an unnecessary way to retain employees.
bad,first day they want you to work long hours management was horrible they don't even speak to you superviser was horrible I did my 8 hours I ask can I go home he made a smart remark saying I am one of them workers that just wanted to do 8 hours and go home he told me they work until it is done you get in 4pm and sometimes leave at 4 am in the morn. I went back to my old job Please I am warning you don't go
bad,".The most toxic environment that i have every encountered,"
bad,Hard monitored working job 3pm.-11pm
bad,A typical work day is routine and provides limited mental challenge. In addition to the routine leadership consistiently attempts to dissect every interaction with the customer until a questionable flaw is found which can be very discouraging. A supervisor and leadership training program should be created and passed before position is awarded to avoid unprofessional interactions and low performance.
bad,"I've had some great opportunities here in the past, but that's not true recently. "
bad,"Scheduled hours did not work for me..."
bad,"Low paying job and bad management."
bad,"The current work atmosphere is not good. Current hours are 12 hours per day mandatory for the foreseeable future. "

bad,"Management is terrible at this company.  You are micro managed and treated like a child.  Managers are constantly looking over your shoulder .  Certain people are allowed to get away with murder, sleeping at thier desk during working hours, not pulling thier weight,  not doing thier job but the people that come in every day and do thier job are the ones that are constantly threatened and punished."
bad,Not a very good place to work. The environment is very stressful with little to no help from management. The employers have no idea how manage employees and make things harder than it has to.
bad,Got into with a lead who didnt know to speak to another adult respectfully got so bad went to management and it went nowhere to the point I quit because of it .
bad,Different General Managers for the pass three years. There is no room for advancement. The company does not value tentured associates. Low paying and health insurance is costly.
bad,"New management came in 2015.  Warehouse became a negative work experience.  ""Contractors"" were hired and took over jobs, fired people that had been there for years.  Self serving manager(s) will prove to be the downfall of this company.  CEO needs to take notice of the Cincinnati facility."
bad,"The organization is going through a major change with no culture and no leadership throughout the transformation.  New executives create their own counter-culture without looking at the ""big picture.""  This is topped off with a major reduction in force that was poorly communicated and handled.  Company ascribes to a ""fake it till you make it"" philosophy as well as a ""buy it, not build it"" approach to their staff."
bad,"I worked there for about a month and it is a terrible company. The management is horrible,they don't have enough equipment for the workers and the equipment they do have is bad. You get paid every week but even that couldn't keep me there!!! The cops were called to the property because several employees argued about working conditions,work load,bad management and unsafe equipment!!!!!"
bad,"In my review of this company, they say that they have a culture for the associates but you find that the culture is against certain tones of people and they are treated differently."
bad,not at all offered after many years of service when started was given many sick days then some were taken away was given many vacation weeks then some were taken away was told at one time that I should change attitude or look for another job.
bad,"This company relocated to a new building in August. Management themselves said they cannot meet the customers demand and also have had high turnover. Management however is non existent, it seems as though employees do what they want and no leadership is actually on the floor making sure things are going smoothly. "
bad,"Management makes promises that they do not follow up on. I took personal time off of work to get several IT certifications, in lieu of a position that was going to be 'created' as it was needed. Once I got back from Leave of Absence, they brought someone in and said it was out of their hands. Kind of disappointing but the potential for other companies was great."
bad,If there ever was a company that needed the Teamsters then this would be it. A lot of overtime because of high turnover. Pay is average. go Teamsters!
bad,"I quickly understood that working with human resource and they are a valuable asset.Learning how important coaching and counseling are the success of team building. Though unpleasant, there is a constructive way to disciplining employees and still keep a person engaged. The importance of communicating job expectation and  planning are vital. I was always monitoring, appraising, and reviewing job contributions. Enforcing policies and procedures are a priority."
bad,Sadly the management within the Human Resources department is subpar.  The leaders are all unqualified to be in such positions. You will only be promoted if you kiss up to the senior leaders. If you push back you will be terminated. The company seems to have to financial issues to overcome and then they might be a better place to work at. My advise to anyone looking at this company keep looking . Check back in 2 years they might be more stable by then
bad,Management staff sucks and are not open to new Ideas. My worst mistake was accepting this job and I place this above marrying my Ex-wife...
bad,This company has no direction. The training is horrible. The benefits are horrible. The VP will curse and chew dip as he carries a conversation on with you. Not organized. Prepare to work with thugs. ORS is the only part of the company making money and they are barely holding on. 
bad,"Work day: tiresome, since you are connected to a phone all day, very repetitive job, little thinking is necessary. Understaffed, high turn over."
bad,"I worked here for 6 months and then had to leave early on my maternity.  They fired me while I was on bed rest waiting to have my baby.  I was a good employee so there was no reason to except they didn't want to pay my disability.  Then they tried to deny unemployment. The company also fired some long time employees but still have job openings listed on job boards.  If you want a company that takes care of it's employees, this is not the place to work."
bad,Responsible for the daily operation of the Jacksonville distribution facility. I had 60 employees and 4 supervisors with a 24 hour operation. I had close relationships with customers and sales representatives on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,the team is very strong a typical workday could be over 3000 shelf and 2400 bulk and you need to sort and order everything to the correct location and ensure it goes to the correct customer.
bad,"You work like a slave for a bonus that's not worth it after taxes!!!But the upper management bonuses r big but you worked hard and they get paid for nothing,when they don't put any effort or work!!!"
bad,"not enough pay for the amount of work"
bad,"I have been with this company for quite sometime.  I have been here through all the companies name changes and buy outs.  A lot has changed over the years some good and some bad.  The pay is a lot better than when I started years ago but the increases in the past were better tin the past versus now. A lot of long hours, hard work, and a lot of responsibly with little reward.  Management tells you thanks, good job and way to go but this not always enough.  The bonus program is garage and not enough focus to get it better because maybe than we can keep people here for years to come.  I have seen a lot of good and bad people come and good. It would be nice to seen people stay because a high turn rate over not only hurts the company but the associates too.  Cleanness is not a strong suit either and that impacts safety and quality which impacts bonus's."
bad,Learned the difficulty of working in an environment where functional areas each were in a silo. Hard to accomplish goals when you are not empowered to make business decisions that would drive profitable growth.
bad,"I was hired on as a temp, I worked here for 3 weeks and I regret even wAisting my time, I took the offer because of finacial problems...the managment just sit around on the computer all day, they don't respect employees personal life, the Shipping manager came up to me and said you was in the bathroom for 5 whole minutes, what was you doing, I couldn't take it after that, me and the shipping lead got into and altercation because he just think he can talk to you any kinda way....they pay you on the back for the first week then when the new guy come in they shift their focus, Terrible company I wouldn't recommend nobody to apply"
bad,"Don't even bother. Lots of politice, even more than usual. Managment is focused on themselves"
bad,"Facility leader needs to get a clue. This place has the ""buddy buddy"" system in place."
bad,Cutting hours even though they are still hiring.  Was told by management no layoffs but went from full time to part time for apparently 3+ months.  Management lied when I was hired and continued to as I worked there.  Co-workers are good just dont trust management
bad,"Our branch has a lot of work ahead of them. Turn around rate is pathetic, management is overall not good, and hours on our shift are ridiculously long. Morale has been down ever since I started there making it a dreary place to work. People are friendly and the pay is ok, but that’s about it. I’m thankful for a job but I’m sure there’s better ones out there."
bad,"When i first started it was a great job but, they didnt wanna move me up, kept me the trailer all day for 8+ hours with rarely no help or no help and just kept working me. Don't get suckerd into what they tell you, only if you become their pet they will listen to you."
bad,"You will be overworked and asked too much of. To get off work by your scheduled time you are dependent on all other team members to carry their weight, which they most often do not. The physical labor wears you down day by day. "
bad,good working environment
bad,I disliked this place. Everyday was  a mess or a complete bad show. Mangers bearly know wat to do plus the hrs was never there. Other then the great people who worked there. I wouldn't work here
bad,"all i want to say is... this company is under a union, however, there is no unity to this place. constant backstabbing, favoritism, bullying, etc etc. it is based off of cliques...and if you are not in the right clique.. well, for lack of a better term.. you are screwed. you get 1 half hour break and then 2 ten minute breaks (they count the time you have to walk to the break room as part of your 15 minutes so they only allow you ten min for your actual break). the pay is good, but not as good as it should be for the amount of work you are expected to do. instead of hiring more people they just continually give LOTS and LOTS of OT (anywhere from 2.5 hours to 3 or 4 hours). they are on top of your performance. constantly keeping track of your numbers, meanwhile there are ppl there who are lazy and do whatever they want. and even when you are doing a good job there are no ""thank you's"" or ""good jobs"". its a very high stress environment.. not worth the pay.. currently looking for a new job. it's not worth coming home stressed every day. I STRONGLY suggest not to work for this company.."
bad,"The company was once growing and now facing too many headwinds. Management very reactive and not thinking about long term growth - only short term actions to stop the hemorrhaging. Too many priorities to focus on now that there is a new private equity owner and the company has not met expectations and goals. Culture has suffered. Hopefully, the company does have a plan that has not yet been commercialized that will poise it for growth."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items.

They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
bad,"If you can keep your head down, do your job and stay away from those ""in charge"" you should be fine. Management will routinely, almost pathologically stand in your path and systematically try to make things difficult for you if you do not follow specific instructions. Favoritism, sexism, bigotry and Messiah Complexes run rampant in that building. There are many people ""in charge"" with many deep-seated psychological issues being played out on every shift, in every dept, with many employees left to suffer under these abnormal conditions. The company has an embarrassingly high turnover rate for a reason...."
bad,"Been here a longtime.. I have never worked anywhere, where the MANAGERS really don't know the job .. Supervisors are no different, they just come in to get paid .. basic rf systems and old tech in the warehouse .. Things could be better if corporate cleaned house and brought in some new blood .. it is a union house , but you can't let employees run free like they do ..The company just announced they are moving to perris CA and employees need to apply again at new none union facility.. it's a huge risk for the company as stocks are falling and they are trying to rebuild a profitable facility .. O and HR is the worst I have seen since I started ,  she is never there !!!!!"
bad,Good companies start at the top. Management needs to listen to the associates who do the job. I was a manager and my associates worked hard for me because I showed them respect. Other managers were on power trips.
bad,i learned a lot at this company  a typical day at work is i go in and get on my piv after doing a thorough check of the machine. i get my list and start picking and putting the items on my cart. after i wrap the items an place them in the place for delivery. and do that all day basically
bad,Unless you just need a job to get a few checks. Dont waste your time. They never have room for advancement. People been there 20 years still unloading trucks. Management has been going through changes. Alot of racial tension. The employees hate the company because of the low pay and high demand of labor. Thats most people biggest complaint
bad,"Still too many management layers after countless layoffs."
bad,"Fast paced environment, managers and supervisors expected for employees to keep the same rate the entire shift period. hardest part of the job was to be sent home early 1 hour after your shift because of over scheduling."
bad,"When you get in the City of Industry distribution center, you start off as part-time. Hourly rate is excellent, but you only get 20-25 hrs a week. Plus you work with some very lazy people, that move slow and socialize a lot. I'm sure because its a Union job, some people feel like they can take advantage. Plus they complain a whole lot about everything. I don't think they realize how good they have it. Probably because that's the only job they had. Supervisors aren't good, they're afraid to speak up to the strong personalities and pick on the weak. Best thing about this job is if you become full-time, you get a very nice check."
bad,The culture is very fun and fast paced. The company holds a lot of lunches and provides employees with drinks and supplies during their shift. I would recommend
good,The company doesn't know their Identity. Lack of leadership. Great hours. Good people. Uneasy job security. No career advancement opportunities. Company has been going in the wrong direction since changing to Essendant.
good,"The is a great company if you want to work part time at a full time job.  Overtime after 8 hours, but not guaranteed 40 hours in a week.  Benefits are good, but you better plan on using your paid time off to compensate for the time that is not given to you to make up the 40 hours a week."
good,It's a good company but the management is poor. They don't care about employees' life.
good,The company is okay to work for but their is no room for growth. Poor management.
good,"The daily safety challenges are a slight break from the daily stressful work day. We have wheel of fortune, pong, in house golf challenges. "
good,"Would not recommend working for this company."
good,"This job has no room to grow in, poor raises, and poor management. The pay is average and the people don't work as a team. There are very little opportunities to do anything here. If your looking for a temporary job this might be ok but as far as a career ...... absolutely not."
good,I loved the work and co/workers.but  supervisors are terrible .they do not know how to talk or listen to employees .everything is a power play with them
good,"This place is good if you like micromanagement butt kissers, flunkies watching you peeping through the racks, and liars, decent living requires over 10+ yrs, talk to you like you don't know anything, lots of favoritism and will stab you in the back. They'll tell you lies with a straight face trying to manipulate you. The only good side is some (a handful) of your coworkers are straight and help you out but besides that nothing else is good. If this sounds good to you then, by all means, go for it. The place can get better, it just needs some major changes mainly in leadership."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want.

good,"great team"
good,Employees are hard working and loyal. Work is very detailed. Can be fast pace. Lots to learn. Very generous when it comes to helping and giving to various charities.
good,"the people are fantastic the onboarding process is great and everyone does a fantastic job making you feel very much at home.  While this was not a perfect fit for me, I would recommend for anyone looking to broaden sales experience"
good,"As a distribution associate 2, you have to operate a forklift to either work in receiving doing put aways, or in outbound as a picker.  if you are not on a lift, then you are either packing LTL orders, or small UPS orders."
good,"Nice place to work. Co-workers were nice. Family environment.Typical day, process orders, answer customer service calls. Run reports. Pull orders."
good,This company is alright but not for long term. The raises come slow and the way production is set up it is hard to meet 100% every week because of set backs you will have day in and day out.
good,"13 years ago an excellent start in distribution, No Comment"
good,"A tyical day is ok at best if management does not bother you. The GOM does not have high respect, proper professionalism, stubborn, does not listen to employees, and never shows gratitude towards his employees. The starting off pay is decent if you have enough experience. The raises given here in the Visalia branch are next to nothing, only 25 cents a year if your lucky. A good place to work at if you are going to school on the weekend or something. other than that, its not that great to be employeed at simply due to the management team."
good,"They promise you time and a half after 8 hours but you're lucky if you worked 6, I was full time but worked only like 32 hours a week."
good,"Essendant is in transition due to buy out by Staples. In the past 14 years there were at least 4 major workforce reductions, and since the buy out there have been the expected major personnel changes. Difficult up to very recently to establish a work from home schedule, very few internal promotion opportunities."
good,"Was not the best job but had all the benefits (PTO, medical, vision, etc.). Coworkers were all nice and so were all the managers. Can be a dead end job with not much opportunity to advance."
good,"I enjoy my job, I'm learning everyday."
good,"Probably the epitome of the ""ready, fire, aim"" mentality. Great people to work with, but the overall goal of the organization seemed to change on a weekly basis.  They follow allot of the ""flavor of the month"" management trends."
good,For the first 7 years the company's culture and direction was outstanding.  Downturn in business has created stress and uncertainty throughout the organization.
good,"At first the job seemed like a dream come true; with a high starting pay, layback environment straight 8 hour days (paid lunch) and at will breaks (can be taken when desired). Essendant quickly became a nightmare do to incompetent management, lack of communication, and lack of empathy for under staffed departments. The job itself is simple enough sorting and scanning products to the correct route and customer and then stacking and wrapping the skids adequately for shipping. Unfortunately the simplicity of the job breeds an unsympathetic management team; never requiring other departments to help out on hi-volume days and always experimenting with how few people the job can with. when deadlines are missed the dock is first to blame even when the required product is brought down from picking and packing departments an hour late. For a company that employs both direct hires and temps its strange to see not only a lack of bodies but also a lack of new faces. With  limited promotion and (once per year) 2% raises make this company completely unworthy of anyone seeking something longer than a summer job."
good,"The work is detailed and very interesting. Our goal is to give the dealers and customers a pleasant and seamless transactions."
good,"4-5 hrs. MANDATORY OT every night, poor management w/little skills on how to resolve issues between employees, if you are white you are the minority and treated like one too, decent pay but could be higher considering all the work you put in. The union sucks and does not stick up for you in times of need. Run poorly overall, but not the worst place due to the salary and job security."
good,"unpredictable days, long hours. friendly staff."
good,"Decent work environment. Management could use improvement all around and the machinery could definitely stand to be upgraded. Easy work though for the pay, but expect high turnover rate."
good,Essendant is a good place to work. It's not easy but it has many benefits and you make good money.  The people are very nice and also you have weekends off.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want.

good,"Decent work environment. Management could use improvement all around and the machinery could definitely stand to be upgraded. Easy work though for the pay, but expect high turnover rate."
good,"They were too busy for the first two months to get me trained and introduced to their systems."
good,"The team thatgtoh work with is great. Once you get good at your position and get cross trained you’re a slave to management. They have a lot of expectations, but reward the laziest employees. If you’re not a favorite you won’t go very far."
good,"A company with bad managements, managers who are not qualified to be managers and a place very low morale environment to work at. The pay was low and the raised was very low."
good,they are very flexible but pay is not good. could have better management also. They pay people that come in as much as the people been working there for years.
good,"Good benefits, generous PTO, good work/life balance, ability to work from home, compensation is fair.  On site fitness center. Laid back workplace culture."
good,"Essendant  does now value their employees, I had to pay an extra $100 to add my wife and children plus the basic plan coverage to continue health care plan."
good,Good company for hourly employees. Shows dedication to associates growth and development. Very easy to establish roots and make a long lasting career if a warehouse environment is desired.
good,Fast paced. Low appreciation. Upper management will most likely drive all the customers away unless they change policies. The place is ok if your ok with the mundane
good,Not very organized. Management does not communicate with very clearly with the employees. Employees are too complacent and feel after being with the company for 10 plus years they should not work as hard as newer employees.
good,"There are several departments with multiple shifts each day. The company offers tuition reimbursement after one year, grade based. Management works with the employees to adjust schedules if needed for a short time."
good,I learned how to operate heavy machines. The people I worked with were great. I enjoyed most of my time spent working there.
good,"The work/life balance is not that great. You work a lot of overtime almost 12 to 15 hours of overtime in a day. The pay is really not that great. For how much pressure you are under. If they boost the pay up a little it will be great, and there will be no complaints. I've learned to drive different forklifts here. Some I haven't seen before. So that's a plus. Love how they are big on Safety."
good,"Go in, drive forklift, go home."
good,"United Stationers was a good company to work for.  Unfortunately, their main business unit, Office Supplies, is a dying industry.  By far, the most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers.  Everyone was very knowledgeable and welcoming.  I never felt like the ""new person""."
good,"Inventory control management. early mornings, unloading trucks,dealing with UPS and fed ex"
good,"Despite a shortfall, company is well behaved, busy and productive."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items.

They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"It was an easy job for the money but they were not flexible with hours and overtime was mandatory. Very physical so get ready for a workout. Its good if this is your only job but i had another part time job to do. "
good,I liked the job in the beginning. As time went on I realized why the turnover rate was so high. (7months) They don't pay enough for the work you have to do. Meanwhile you staying away from your family most of the time..
good,"I found my time at Essendant to be mostly positive.  I do like the work environment.  I believe the managing staff does well in their roles.  The workplace culture is generally good, the staff seems to get a long with each other well.  Essendant does have work from home days which helps when emergencies spring up.  It's a fast paced environment where you are not always given the best direction.  Although, the people there are willing to help and guide."
good,Lots of different jobs to to. People can be “clicky” and hard to get a long with. Hours aren’t bad though unless you want to get on a different shift.
good,"my experience has been good working for this company, my boss was awesome and my peers were as well. the daily operations were smooth and the customers were outstanding."
good,"The job is fairly easy and the company is on average more than fair, as far as benefits and pay. Poor management is the company's biggest down fall, to slow to change."
good,I did alot of loading and unloading items. Shipping and receiving. Scanning and wrapping and cleaning up work area. Making sure the correct labels are on the correct items.
good,It is not a bad place if you are ok with staying where you are. If you are ok with doing the same thing over and over again. It makes it really hard to want to come to work with the same employees constantly calling in.
good,"ill be short and sweet.. absolutely no chance of advancement at this location in inbound operations. management has there favorites and they get to bend rules and have special privileges. the shifts range from 3am to 11am to 5am to 1pm with no shift differential for coming into work in the middle of the night. overtime is optional but is encouraged or else you will be threatened with a ""mandatory saturday"". your co workers will tell on you about anything they assume you're doing and you will be confronted by management about their assumptions. dont get me started on ""efficiency"" numbers that is setup to over work you for not even a pat on a back if you make the efficiency number"
good,"management is clueless.."
good,"A legacy organization (United Stationers/Essendant) aquired by Sycamore Partners (Staples) to serve national and regional distributors office products for resale."
good,"Very good place for getting people introduced into a fast paced, warehouse-feel environment. Plenty of optional overtime, and the work isn’t backbreaking"
good,it is a great place to work and be apart of there are many obstacles you may come across but the help to succeed is there as long as you come to work.
good,"I never worked for Essendant.  I applied for a job there once, but I can't even remember if they even called me back.  So I have nothing to say about the company."
good,"I worked for essendant 16 years, working conditions normal warehouse environment. fast pace, extremely hot during the summer, cold during winter. team working environment, opportunity to advance if you desire,   teamsters union, work schedule option of 3shifts. mon-fri...off on most holidays..double time if you worked holidays. off on weekends...driving distance one way( 7miles ) for me it was a ideal job because of the distance I had to drive to work, union job, very good wages, good medical insurance. If the company hadn't moved in 2018, i'll probably still be employed."
good,Job consist of operating a forklift/picker and picking office products and wholesale goods for different route locations and would have to be picked at a certain time to move on to the next batch of activites
good,This place is always changing although I know that’s most companies I can tell you in the last six months here they have changed our shifts and made us come in early or late permanently at least three times. They are OK and competitive with a starting out around $14.50. But there is no real room for advancement.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"Essendant is a giant in the wholesale office products industry. They have a diverse and interesting relationship with technology companies, big box office products retails and small offices shops."
good,"In the middle of a buy out by Staples, things have only gotten worse in the past 4 months. Timelines extended, projects canceled, people laid off and many others leaving on their own."
good,Essendant has provided me with ample opportunities to stretch my existing skill set with continuous learning. I feel fortunate to work with my team members and to have found multiple leaders I consider mentors.
good,"Was a nice job with decent pay in a fast-paced work environment. The manager was somewhat new to the role so that was a department that was lacking. Overall, not a bad experience."
good,I really enjoyed the people I meet and worked with.  The travel distance was very nice.  The pay was decent for the area I lived in and the travel time. I do wish they paid more I would consider going back.  The enviroment was very friendly.
good,"I worked here for over 5 years, while I did learn a lot for this job that's about all I liked."
good,"contract alerts and updates come in everyday, what I learned is be more thorough and understand the demands of each contract and management regarding said contract. No room for errors"
good,A call center environment with fast-paced work. The staff is friendly and easy to work with and the job provided a lot of client interaction and opportunity to hone your customer service skills.
good,"pick, packed, items. places items onto rightful pallet to be ready to ship "
good,Working for essendant was a great experience. Was about work with and certified on various forklifts during my time with them. I wish they was paying more then and had more room for advancement.
good,"Excellent management"
good,Some Managers are great most are not they do not care about you really all they care about is meeting their numbers and safety is like their number one thing cause they get paid more for days of no accidents.
good,Essendant is an office supply warehouse who supplies anything you need for your office. we are the main supplier for W.B. Mason. The job itself is very easy but the management has no idea what they are doing. I would not recommend working at Essendant
good,Benefits were great. Worked there for 17 years met a lot of people. I learned alot over the years as the company advanced in technology. Management was ok at times.
good,Constant movement and usage of your body. Specifically arm and leg muscles along with your back. Constant lifting every day and loading trucks with completed pallets.
good,This is a good job for ones going to school or in between jobs. would not recommend someone to make career out of it. can be very long hours if trucks do no show up time which is typically in the winter.
good,"Essendant was a good place to work with an ok work/life balance.  I think the hardest part of the job was working with limited tools and resources, however, there is plenty of opportunity for process improvements."
good,The company would be great for a recent college graduate that's looking for some work experience. The management team is diverse and there's some really great employees to gain experience and knowledge from.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"Great flexibility with work scheduling, the constant changes and lack of communication gives employers a feel of insecurity and advancement and how to achieve never discussed, management lack relationship with employers"
good,"unloading trucks, breaking down pallets by part number, receiving and tagging merchandise, co-workers and management ok, learned how to drive tow motor"
good,This was a great college job. It kept me busy but the hours worked great with class schedule. It was also helpful financially by allowing me not to have to take out extra student loans.
good,Downsizing and restructuring has led to instability in the work place.  Every day was a struggle to see who was being let go.
good,"I large company with many Ideas, worked on integrating their new dashboard and was a interesting process. They have good IT leads that work for them."
good,"Heavy work load."
good,"Beige cubicle farm, lots of spreadsheets.  Super exciting industry of printer paper and staplers though...your friends and fam will be so jealous."

good,alot of work to get all of it done. every one did there part every night.
good,I feel that the company's salary was satisfying but the training could have been alittle more effective in terms of the information needed to perform the job..Also..management needed to be MORE visible and accessible for new employess than just the team leads...
good,Job is easy and straight forward. Company does vary from day to today on what is expected of you. Supervisors don't speak up much for you and general manager doesn't want to hear what you say for the most part

good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."

They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"A typical day was busy, I learned a lot about receiving and loading equipment. It was a fast pace job. If there was something I would change about the company, it would be the management"
good,"I worked at the Union City facility for 5 years.It was a typical large distribution center,hectic work environment at times. Overall I enjoyed my time working there. Management was a revolving door other then the one constant who would spend the majority of the day smoking outside."
good,"Great pay but the hours are long. Management should get in touch with the employees"

good,"Director of Inside Sales is horrible manager, should be replaced, doesn't know how to manage and destroys employee morale, along with customer satisfaction. Sales Managers hands are tied. One Sales Manager undercuts other Sales Managers and sexually discriminates against single women, singling them out and getting them fired behind other managers backs."
good,They followed all guild lines for safety. They also actively train you on different machines. I had a overall good experience. I enjoyed working there.

good,"Essendant used to be a great place to work, but that changed after a few department/company reorganizations.   With Management and job changes work became much less so."
good,Working at Essendant was a great place to gain and learn new experience. To be able to join certain committee's such as the wellness committee and the safety committee. I was part of the saftey committee and my job in the committee was to improve safety in the facility and bring associates and management to promote safety and health in each department.
good,A typical day is good if you can work without direct supervision. I learned to work as a team which ideally fosters good morale. Management keeps us informed about changes in the company with periodic meetings. The hardest part of the job is driving the forklifts safely while maintaining all safety expectations along with quality and accuracy. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the work done efficiently and looking forward to vacation.
good,"busy days working with different people throughout the company and overseas.  Given new challenges each day and given the tools to work them out."
good,I ensured no account placed us on credit hold due to late payments and assisted coworkers on the most efficient ways in resolving more demanding account.

good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery.

good,"enjoyed the fast paced work environment and developing new computer systems that would be used by our customers."
good,"Very physical position! You will be trained for forklift, many types. The atmosphere is in a warehouse without climate control so be prepared to sweat in the summer."
good,"A wholesale company in the office products, facilities, and industrial business units.   We enable our partners to succeed by ""winning from the middle"""
good,this facility was a fast paced environment. I learned to work in the shipping receiving department and enjoyed working with my co workers. I enjoyed the workflow but management can use a little more improvement.
good,Applied for one position that had been filled internally. I opted to move out of my job skill to attempt to work a customer service call center. The job didn't work out.
good,"United Stationers is a great place to work.  Typical work days were busy from the time you logged in to the end of your day.  Benefits are first rate, and United does honor seniority, so there is no ""competition"" among coworkers.  Especially handy during the Holidays when everyone wants time off.  United encourages a team atmosphere, but also allows associates to work individually on projects for one on one recognition.  Merit and pay increases are average.  United encourages personal growth and allows associates to apply internally for open positions, however, the Company isn't consistent with personal advancement."
good,It all depends on the department and people you will be surrounded with. Is an ok company to gain experience. Nothing else to add.
good,I only worked here as a temporary employee in the Credit Department. All the employees and management were very nice. I would've loved to have been offered a full-time position.
good,"it was a great place to work. the co-workers were great as well as the supervisors"
good,It was a great job others just took advantage trying to slack and not grab orders accordingly making it to where you were the one doing most of the work and they leave and you're still working to leave at a decent time
good,Fast pace but they work is not too hard. Paid training and you get two breaks and no lunch but the time flies by because you stay very busy. Not a bad place to work
good,"This is a good place to work, flex hours, nice people, good charitable foundation; sometime can be a bit overwhelming.  Career Advancement is lacking."
good,"There is only advancement with a degree of any kind. The less you do the further you get. They diversify which is good, but they don't correct where necessary when someone cannot do the job."
good,"I worked more in the warehouse searching for missing orders, also was in charge of Army Carbone Accounts. Also filling online orders for Vendors mostly office supplies, and making sure my large orders were checked before shipping."
good,"early arrival, late depart. busy day time past quickly. learn the different levels of managing associates. manager of people and process. co-workers are cool to a certain point. staying cool in different situations.  I get to express my concerns and thoughts to the bosses and have a say"
good,Typical day was to work with resellers and end customers to provide a complete solution to reduce their overall expense on printing. Hardest part of my job was not always being able to be in front of the end user to show them the benefits. Overall experience was well and I have nothing but respect for my direct leadership. 
good,Supervisors were very communicative. Upper Leadership needed to be available more though.
good,"Typical work day would be picking orders, making sure trucks leave on time, and housekeeping at the end of the shift. I learned how to be a team player, how to use their system, which truck order goes first and work in a fast pace environment. Management is okay but could be better. Co-workers are decent, they tend to talk to much and not work. The job is pretty easy, not really hard unless your new there. The most enjoyable thing about this is job is that is very laid back and easy."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"Working at United use to be an exciting, fun place to work. Now it has become a very stressful atmosphere to work in. They don't have any possibilities for advancement. They are restructuring the company and asking people to volunteer to resign to compete with what they consider the economic situation. A typical day at work is high call volume, short breaks and lunches. I have learned to master the art of customer service with this company. Management is fair most of the time, my coworkers are very nice people to work with. The hardest part of the job is not being appreciated for your contributions, hard work and dedication. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I do have one and the relationships I have formed with coworkers. We try to encourage each other to go on."
good,Essendant is a great place to start your career. The team is like family and provide work life balance. The company promotes from within but at times there are not many opportunities available.
good,"Being here 12 years I have come to appreciate my time here. I have managed credit in all Divisions that are based at the Deerfield, Illinois Office.  I have great admiration for all the associates I have managed and mentored."
good,Make sure you are physically fit or this job will wear you out slowly but gradually. The furniture is big and you are standing every day on a picker with a metal harness on your back. Just uncomfortable but its for your safety. So be cautious.
good,We focus more on quality because we try to give our costumer there product with out any kind of damages.We also make sure that the people recieve the right items that they purchased.
good,"Typical day can be 7-12+ hrs depending on the season and where in the warehouse you work.  Plenty of PTO and good benefits, along with team lunches.  Can suffer from the ""too many chiefs and not enough Indians"" as direct workflow coordinators (leads) receive zero training in actual leadership skills which leaves you with too many bosses and no leaders.  Overall a pretty good place to work."
good,"Professional and decent coworkers to work with. The company supplies the laptops and training that is necessary. While there were several voluntary severence packages offered, people liked working here."
good,"I love the culture of the company.  I have a great boss and have had  lot of opportunity for upward growth. Once you get into higher positions, the tougher it becomes to move up."
good,Constructive workplace with a positive employment growth opportunities. A company that not only provides good customer service but also appreciates and cares about its employees.
good,good place just a constant work load that needs to be done in a timely fashion also can be under pressure at times when the work is heavy
good,Essendant is a Fortune 500 company that took me to the next level of management.  Learning new skills such as Lean Distribution and taking several training courses throughout the year.
good,"To fill customers orders, from anything to pens and packs of paper for office supplies. the one thing that was the hardest for me was the hours I had to work."
good,"At my time for ESSENDANT. I had the lucky to learn different aspects that reinforce my career and my knowledge in all the ways, since management, leadership, supple chain, ecommerce, inventory and operations and so many more. It is a company that you can learn, practice and grow."
good,"Essendant was a decent place to work for, pay was ok It paid the bills for the most part. hours were SWEET M-F 8 to 5, Had all holidays off major and minor ones :)"
good,"My experience at Essendant was mostly positive.   The compensation/benefits were great but management’ was overall poor being unopen to new or innovative ideas.  If you like working in a warehouse, this one has a great overall clean aesthetic and environment."
good,"Every day there is much work to be done.  Essendant does stress a safe work environment, as what we do does not mean getting hurt over.  Health care insurance is available after 30 days.  We get a paycheck every week."
good,"Getting items and putting them in boxes , i learned how to control my emotions , hard part was helping other people and still trying to maintain my work , the only thing that had me going was my friend pushing me to keep going far as life ."
good,i don't remember too much about this company except the contract ended and all the drivers had to find another job and that was very stressful to find another job so soon I really would like to forget about these thing kin a company but i came to realize it was just business and that is how the business is operated all over the world.
good,"Many of the employees have been at this facility for many years. There is a great feeling of family at Essendant. There are many different areas to work, so you don't feel like you are stuck in the same job all the time."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,great job with great benefits everyone is eager to work and work hard to get out on time to eliminate as much overtime great management.great paid time off floating holidays and more.
good,"Great company with benefits and pay, unfortunately there is no advancement. Easy going, not too stressful. There are some lazy people there that you will have to help but that is everywhere."
good,"Great place to work!  Hard on personal life, but rewarding if your around for a long time.  Forever changing of employees so hard to maintain a good balance between work anf home."
good,"On average its a typical 8 hour day however depending the shift you work, you stay until the work is complete. Work ethic and a positive attitude is helpful in this work environment."
good,"Job consists of processing orders of office supplies, tools, food, etc. Using pick to voice units to pull items correctly and ship out . you can find work in this company either order filling or working on the dock."
good,"Essendant (as United Stationers) used to rely heavily on contractors and freelancers, and for 5 years I was essentially an employee without the benefits. My hard work and talent was recognized and I was brought on as a full-time employee, and the use of contractors was reduced somewhat. It was a good job, I was good at it, and my managers were all highly competent and considerate."
good,"benefits are good, there are not a lot of things i can complain about. I do commute a little further than i would like to be doing on a daily basis, hence my being here"
good,My typical work day consists of helping and leading 65 associates and handling any escalations that may arise. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping other people to become better.
good,"I was an order picker and this was via automated talkman. You had to do about 50 boxes during your shift with a 100 % completeness. My co-workers were good about teaching me how to get up to speed. The hardest part of the job was not forgetting anything and making sure it went in the right box. management was ok, we didn't see them much unless we had a meeting. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting everything done on time and not having to stay late."
good,"I loved the flexible hours and the fact that you can work from home. Essendant is going through a lot of changes right now so as I interned there there were times where no one really knew what their roll was. Overall, though the people were really nice."
good,Learned many business tactics. This was my first company out of college and felt comfortable and enjoyed the work immediately.  Great teams.
good,Fun work place with supportive managers. I enjoyed working alongside my colleagues and contributing to the growth of the company.
good,"A typical day started at 3:30 am and there was an immediate need to get the operation up and running.  There were two to three tractor"
good,"a chance to enter into the industry with a know office supplier. Good training and hard working individuals,"
good,One of the best companies I ever worked for other than that I really cant give anymore detail.
good,"Responsible for stocking, filling and auditing merchandise for warehouse. Pulled orders for customers and loaded merchandise into customers vehicles"
good,United Stationers is a great culture to work for and I've enjoyed the internal and external relationships I've built the past ten years. The disadvantage is advancement to upper management is limited. Once an associate becomes a Supervisor or Manager its rare for them to be there for short-term. I'm ready for a new challenge and/or take the next step within my career by either starting a new job in a new field or becoming a Supervisor in another Call Center.
good,Heavy calendar management and orchestrating travel and events.
good,As a bulk picker/forklift operator workloads can vary a decent amount on the day to day. Be ready to move and have a decent level of physical activity in the workday.
good,Over all the culture is good.  There are incentives for managers such as manager of the quarter and many foundations that they promote.  I enjoy working on the different teams.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"Based on my experience at Essendant, it is a good company for those who want busy and truly productive job. Its located in a good area too. But I wouldn't want this job forever."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is when we celebrate holidays, maintaining job safety, and safety coaches. Our celebrations consist of food, recognition, and fellowship."
good,"shipping, picking and pulling parts.driving sit-down,cherry picker,and standup and reach truck.loading and unload.cycle counting.fastpace company, dealing with office supplies."
good,"if you like a fast-paced environment with good pay, then this company is for you. Occasionally you might be pushed and pulled in different directions either on the shift you're working on at the moment, or the next time you work. Corporate comes in every so often, so of coarse, there will be SOMETHING that they've change because they check numbers and haven't worked in the warehouse a day in their lives. On ""Corporate"" days, expect your Leads and manager to be intolerable. One thing about having a boss here, they cannot take things out on you, nor do things out of spite because of the strict rules at play within this company. It protects your right as an employee as well as their right to fire You! "
good,"A typical day is high pace, diverse culture and employee relations  is a top priority.  I have learned to be a great listener without judging, and a better problem solver.  The best part of my job is interacting with the associates to encourage, motivate, and train."
good,"Job pertains to make quote goals, Managers are good, work area clean, proper tool given to perform work, pay is on the low end and does not equate the effort required to be considered a employee of value."
good,"Usually eight hour work days, but workload dictated hours worked each day. Overtime could happen on any day and slow season could work less than eight hours. Management numbers and reports driven. Average work life balance but slow process to job advancement within the company."
good,"Co-workers are great, hours are horrible.Enjoyable job, mangers are easy going, customers are some what difficult, they have warehouses all over so transferring to a different state is a plus."
good,"Everyone was nice to work with.  I did many different jobs. I was a special order rep,  sales rep assistant. sales rep and then I became a collection rep.  I loved that I was able to try different jobs,"
good,"start time 3am get all the drivers routed loaded and in their trucks by 6am . handling any problems that might come up ! diplomacy , how to think outside the box in order to satisfy our customers needs ! not much available management training but good support ."
good,Sterile environment. The company used to be family oriented but quickly turned very corporate. Due to the many managerial turnovers.
good,United stationers was a very good company to be apart of for 5 years. Great pay and good benefits!
good,They perform in a good standard what you like. And help people look for the right job . I'm glad that they prefer us like like a person. I would like to be like them to help people get job.
good,"I loved working by myself without competition using a hand held scanner and wrapping products, scanning products and using fork lifts to further my skills"
good,Honest Company good employees managers and supervisors are very nice they understand when you need time off or are you going through things it would be better if you got more than one raise a year though but still not bad company
good,"Management was very nice and understanding."
good,Fun company with decent pay but not enough to be able to be comfortable without looking for something that pays more. Good managers and working with friends helps the job move faster.
good,"Essendant formally known as United Staioners, was a very friendly and nice paced company to work for. Extremely structured and very professional. There was plenty of opportunity to move up in the company. They offered excel classes and plenty of classes to help in our growth as employees."
good,"Aside from the culture, the rate of pay is slightly below the industry in this region. Management could certainly step up their game and become more like bosses in my opinion."
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"Good paying, off early if you get the day shift 0400-1230 Monday through Friday with overtime, angel the manager sucks at life and got bullied as a kid up until high school."
good,Working there is so much fun essendant is my second family love this place. The 10 year that I invested at essendant I've learned a lot and I use the leadership skills in my everyday life.
good,"Very busy for my typical work day. Working on a time frame to answer any issues the customers may have, Learned to manage my time effectively. Job could be stressful,"
good,This is a big company with many moving parts but the Georgia location is a great place to work.  Team atmosphere and very good local leadership.  A lot of very good motivated people that make the culture fun and productive.
good,"I managed a territory and was very well supported. The organizational structure was very effective. We all worked very hard, met our goals and learned from each other."

good,"A fun and enjoyable workplace with positive growth opportunities."
good,"I currently work at the W. Coxsackie facility as a distribution associate 2, and so far it's been good to me, order picking can be a bit frustrating some times due to the head set not cooperating with you or isles getting traffic jammed with multiple workers at once but other than that, the pay is good, decent benefits, management seems more coordinated and professional than previous jobs I've worked, other employees here are helpful, second shift hours are the best if your not a morning person, and breaks could also be 5 minutes longer."
good,"the workplace culture was a fun atmosphere, friendly employees, understanding management, willing to work around your schedule, great benefits. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was empowered to work freely and work at my own pace."
good,"A typical day for me at Essendant involved maneuvering the aisles on a large bulk picker while using a Pick-to-Voice system. I'd travel up and down the aisles, pulling merchandise off of the shelf and then drive it down to the shipping area. A typical day working part time meant moving around 10,000 lbs of merchandise in a span of four hours. It's heavy work, but if your body can handle it, it's an interesting experience to say the least."
good,"I like working at USSCO, but there was no climate control. So it was very hot and sweaty during the summers. But I managed to work there for 5 and half years. Unfortunately, co-workers were being taken advantage of and groups were horse playing too much."
good,The workload was very balanced.  I enjoy a job where we have a set workload which varies from day to day and one which challenges me allocate my work force to achieve the most efficient and cost effective  production.
good,I enjoyed working for United Stationers. It was an awesome work environment. Management was helpful and encouraging. I assisted business owners with ordering of office supplies etc.
good,"Working at Essendant has been pretty good.  There is a pretty good work/life balance, you get summer hours, and depending on where you work within Essendant, there's pretty good culture among the associates. The problem is, the industry is on the downswing, and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight."
good,This was a very fast paced and busy warehouse environment with lots of work to do in receiving and distribution. There was plenty of work to do for a full time schedule
good,A typical work day consists of answering an 800 queue and helping dealers conduct business. There are times when suggestions can be made to help a dealer takes his business to the next level. There is always cross training available to broaden one's horizon. The hardest part about the job is finding one training you like and not rushing to the next. The best part is how much management is involved in your professional development.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"they were a very professional, but at the same time we had allot of fun there all while getting out work done on time every night, and meeting our goals and put the employees before anything else and didn't sacrifice employee satisfaction for personal gain."
good,"Great place to work. Culture, culture, culture. Stable industry leader."
good,"the people at the indianapolis facility are like family. over the past few yrs the work level has become overwelming, but a no fault of local management."
good,I've been there over 11 years.  Looking for something closer to home with chance for advancement.
good,Great place. Needs to update tools and some business practices. Essendant is about the people so they take care of customers with care. They could benefit from mirroring Amazon's business models.
good,Overall it’s a great place to work. I hate the company is moving. I been with the company for almost 20 years. I’m the outbound manger with a ten of 12 people. Pulling orders loading trucks. Will calls and pick up.
good,Had several different job responsibilities and titles. Management always treated employees with respect. Would give internal employees the chance move up. Several cross functional teams developed to improve processes. Listened to the employees that did the work.
good,This job is great for independant workers that can come in for the day and get started right away. We all work as a team and strive to do better! The atomposhere was very positive and you really turn into a big family. We help eachother when opne coworker is in need or fallen on hard times. They show you how to be a team player not just during the work day but around the clock.
good,I love the overtime and you have great benefits. The work is very easy and you catch on really fast. The work environment is fun and clean
good,"It took a month to get a call from them and I interviewed with a shift lead and the manager on the same day. Took a week to get a Call back. I had to do a drug test and physical test. Pay is okay not to bad. I am a new employee and I love the job culture here. Lunches every month, and they have company picnics, bonuses every couple of months. Co workers are great. Production numbers and quality is very important. Overall great company"
good,"Untied Stationers is a highly productive company that emphasizes on quality and employee preparedness. From morning exercises to daily quality meetings, they put employee safety ahead of the daily duties. The melting pot of cultures creates an interesting and fun work environment, managers are fun understanding people that remember that they were once in your position so the level of intimidation is almost nonexistent, co-workers look out for one and other creating a family like environment, the hardest part of the job is clocking out, and the most enjoyable part is clocking in."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working here for 7 years and had planned on retiring here until life threw me a curve,  The call center environment was very professional and I enjoyed having my own cubicle where I attended to hundreds of customer needs daily."
good,"Large company with very good benefits and good vacation plans for new hires. My experience has been good working for this company, my boss was awesome and my peers were as well. the daily operations were smooth and the customers were outstanding."
good,"I was very impressed the the focus of team spirit, working together to get the daily job done. The focus on safety was also a large part of the company."
good,"Discounts for anything office related; that we had in stock; HR did not like to hire Temps. That could have been improved upon...all in all I enjoyed the work but not the commute."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. I was surround with excellent workmates (including top management). If I would have stayed with this company, I could definitely see myself growing with it. The only downfall was that they put me in a position that required no college level degree, even though I had a bachelors degree."
good,"Load, route and deliver office furniture and supplies. Enjoyable work. I earned good pay with the freedom to pick my own pace with a balanced culture. Some heavy office furniture was the hardest part of the job. I liked being out doors and working with the trust of the company."
good,I worked hard and got a raise with promotion. To lead...management is smooth.its what u make out of it. Alot of work most days just got to work smart. Doral is a good location to work at. Clean and nice environment
good,I preferred the job as I was able to help train new employees and make sure the department had all the tool need to work at our best efficiency for our customers.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"no room for advancement, tough environment to work, under a union and contract. time of negotiations can turn into very uncomfortable situations"
good,"good people to work with. willing to help on the converter. with a chance to grow.very clean warehouse, all the overtime you can get"
good,"great management , very comfortable environment "
good,"I worked here just over 4 years, I learned all of my skills here. It was a great team based job but management wasn't the most respectful towards its employees. I applied for other positions throughout the company and never interviewed me for it. They promote its very easy to get higher positions within the company but they always hired someone from outside the company. All in all I enjoyed doing the work, I'm glad I learned all the skills I did and I know it will help me with my future careers."
good,Fast Paced. Great Environment. Weekly pay. Good benefits. Family setting. Room for improvement. Job Security and willingness to cross train employees. Can travel and transfer throughout USA for work.
good,"loved the job, very easy."
good,"Great place to work . Fun everyday. working with good people who grew up there. I learned that as a Team we can accomplish anything."
good,nice company to work for with a good starting pay rate. lots of friendly people and hard workers.nothing more to say about this company.
good,From this job I learned better management skills and the ability to operate a taylor dunn . Loved going around and picking on the machinery it definitely made time go by so fast.
good,"This was an extremely buy position working with 30+ distribution centers, but management was always available when needed, and if they weren't available at that moment, would always schedule a time to meet with you."
good,"Great company, great people. Enjoy working at this company."
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Took orders all day long with phones ringing continuously.
good,Provide opportunities for growth. Fantastic supervisors.
good,"Some managers have favorites and it’s completely obvious, they do what they want, and say what they want. Some of the managers are like drill sergeants standing over your area with arms folded and scowling at you as you work. HR is amazing, he can only do so much when it comes to complaints about mgmt. Overall it’s a great job! It’s never the job that creates stressful and unworkable conditions, it’s the people!"
good,The only reason why I left this company was because of having my son and I wanted to be more available for him and my family.  I don't regret that decision at all.
good,"I am seeking for better opportunity based on how hard that work. I do have family that depends on me based on the energy, motivation, and the drive I bring to the table.In another words; the jobs I have experience are non-communicative, and very unorganized facilities, Hardest part of the job is to get people on the same page as a team; to accomplish goals that we are trying to reach. Last but not lease, the most enjoyable part of the job; getting to know new people and learning more experience."
good,"High turn over rate, with little or no chance of advancement. Always working with lack of full crews with same amount or work..."
good,"Filled customers orders in a timely manner. shipping and receiving, housekeeping."
good,I learned how to scan and place boxes also learned how to drive a selector and change a batter into the machine. Also had some knowledge learning of how to use a scanner.
good,Standard warehouse operations. Union so not much room to be promoted or advance. The management can vary from very effective to not at all helpful. For the most part other employees are friendly and interesting.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items. Most enjoyable part is that they celebrate birthdays, they get a cake every month for both shifts for the birthdays for that month. They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,Essendant was a very hands on job the work was very tiring but it was pretty well paid so it made it okay for some of us employees to deal with at the time.
good,"good work environment and good culture to work with. Good place to work, but will be better if there was more room to build or to if they promoted within for managers positions."
good,"A typical day would consist of unloading te returns truck, detailing products in the return area, detailing the ups boxes that come in after lunch, moving the skids that are finished so the bulk and shelf stockers can put them away. I learned to work very well in a team environment and speaking up when the company was in need of help. I came up with some ideas and brought them to my managers attention because they were talking about permanetly laying off a few people. One of the ideas I had the company went ahead and did it. I said they shouldn't give raises to anyone this year to any of the 36 warehouses which would allow them t have more revenue to wor with. It worked out great even though I'm sure some people didn't care for the idea of not getting a raise, at least nobody lost their job. I loved all my co-workers and miss working there because of them too. The hardest part of the job was haing to lif the really heavy furniture that weighed around 2-300lbs maybe more sometimes. I enjoyed the people te most."
good,i understand that on a corporate level they're really awesome the amount of resources they pumped into the new facility was great. facility management messed up on that one.
good,"Training is great, hours are not bad.  The schedule is Monday thru Friday .  The company puts family as a priority which is nice.  Great team atmosphere and support.  I do not approve of the pay because I feel it is low.  I can not afford to lvie and pay expenses on the wage."
good,a typical day on the job will require a minimum of 8 worked and overtime is mandatory if needed to get the work done. work life balance isn't very good as i have 3 kids and the hours for this job are 1-9:30 p.m. monday-friday
good,"nice place to work.. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a job to have job security, great work environment and a great group of guys to help you."
good,It's a great company and I would highly advice anyone to take a position at that company.
good,"Great people and work envoirment, the staff realy cares about their employees will being."
good,Good place to work. Plenty of work to stay busy. Everyone is friendly. Just go to work and work. Stop with the fraternization...be about your money. That's all
good,Essendant people are great and that is why people stay!  Culture was the foundation for success but business change and challenges have made the culture less consistent.
good,I would give Essendant and overall rating of 7 out of 10 stars only because of the lack of management to see full potential in promoting from within the company.
good,"Workload is manageable, and the opportunity for advancement is everywhere.  "
good,"This is a great job for someone who is getting out of college and needs a job. They do offer benefits as well, the management is great too. They do work with you!"
good,"I learned and performed many tasks. Got my Forklift certification. Drove Taylor Dunns, operated forklifts, pallet jacks, and scissor lift. Filled customer orders, packed products, palletized and loaded onto trucks for shipping on time. The management was fantastic. I enjoyed and got along with everyone I worked with. The only thing I found hard about the job was the heat, but got use to it. The thing I enjoyed about the job was that it never got too monotonous or boring. I moved around a lot and had a different job every week. One week I would drive the forklift, the next week the scissor lift, the next week on foot filling orders. One of my most favorite jobs."
good,pay was low hours were good no room for advancement a good place to work fresh out of high school
good,good company all questions answered quickly and efficiently people really cared.. always work to do
good,"United staioners was a good place to learn how to interact with people from foriegn countries, as well as manage a fast past office"
good,Essendant is a great company to work for. The job and the work is good. The biggest problem is that they use a lot of homemade applications that are like going back to the 1980s. Middle management is not always very open to new ideas.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want. The enviroment was always pretty good, everyone goes in ready to get the day started and finished. Hardest part would be the lifting, they do have some pretty heavy items.

They have employee of the quarter and if we met are requirements they would get us pizza, or food catered, we even cooked out a couple times in the summer."
good,"Essendant is a good company, they have awesome benefits. The work can sometimes become redundant, though that is true with most jobs. The only thing is the turn over with new employees."
good,Not a stressful job. Coworkers are great. Promoting is unfair. Good pay and benefits.
good,"Definitely able to meet standards with clients needs. Pulling and packing easy to catch on. Easy to find items and easy to make boxes to pack essentials in place. Orders very simple for employees to follow with ease. Clean, healthy environment to grow and learn"

good,"Very productive place to work, fun environment at times. Gain skills quickly as always a learning process. Co-workers are great, always willing to help out."
good,Great place to work in good co workers & great management. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. This company recognized the hard work we did every three months they would give us a bonus.
good,"Typical work day starts at 5:00am to 12:30pm currently working for the receiving department stocking product through out the warehouse. I have learned everything from the driving forklift, cherry pickers, walkie rider, RF units, and filling out paper work that needs to be filled out. Management is very good keeps you update  with information about our company business wise, safety concerns, and keeps us up on safety. My co-workers are great older crowd but very willing to help you out when needed and anything else you may need. The hardest part about my job is waking up at 3:30 am in the morning but the most enjoyable part of my job is just working there in general and the opportunities it has given me in my personal life."
good,"A typital day at work was to make sure all shipments were ready on time , and the shipments for the owner-operator fleet-drivers were ready in the am. I learned that many companies ordered in bulk, on some days, and then they would repeat the same orders. The management was held accountable for all shipping dock movement. The co-workers worked very hard and I showed my appreciation The hardest part of the job was the very long hours-16hrs.  The fun and enjoyable part of the job was the work-force."
good,I learned every aspect of the warehouse as well as customer service which better helped me serve my customers.
good,real good job love the boss one of the best jobs i ever worked for and love the co workers so friendly
good,"Here at this company they gave me an opportunity to show myself that I can accomplish what I want to accomplish. For example, I learned to operate cherry pickers which I never thought I would learn to operate. Thank you #Essendant."
good,"The company is in transition, and it can feel a little unstable at times, but the environment lends itself to learn a lot and grow. They offer flexibility and ability to work from home. Many projects to be involved in, and much to learn. Company gives back to the community and there are a lot of opportunities to be involved and give back. Jeans every day!"
good,"I currently work in the inventory department, counting inventory. I was trained to use the RF scanner. My supervisor is fair and reliable. There isn't really anything hard in my position. I enjoy the work hours very much."
good,"Essendant Co. is a wonderful place to work.  I picked up skills at the highest level because the state of the business was in flux.  The hardest part of the job was seeing good people move on in their careers.  However, I enjoyed taking on more responsibilities and very much owe the new direction of my career to the skills I have fine tuned in the past 5 years."
good,I pull orders and pull them efficiently and accurately. I also help with all other duties as a signed. I am also on the dock to help load and unload trucks.
good,I would clk in go to the locker room and change into ppe.Afterwards I would check forklift equipment.Go to supervisor and get my assignment for the day.Proceed with my duties and and if I finished early I would offer to help others or start on my duties for the next day.Along the way I would check other departments to see if anyone needed help with their orders.
good,"the environment around you is very good people around are all friendly and willing to help when you need it, would love to go back myself if i get the chance to."
good,"At times was stressful but majority of the time was an enjoyable, fun atmosphere, lots of laughter to get by during the stressful times...Compensation could be more compatible to work"
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery.

good,"Working at United Stationers was always enjoyable and exciting. No matter what I had planned for a day's activities in this fast-paced environment there was always something new and unexpected that came along to make the day interesting."
good,I have been here for quite some time and love working for the company.
good,"I ran the 2nd shift operation and I had almost zero supervision and had the total trust of the plant manager. My co-workers were great and I learned here that the only way to be successful in management and life is through other people. The associates do the job and it's important to listen to what thier ideas are, they know the job better than management. I helped open two different distribution centers and traveled the country helping train other managers."
good,Typical large company with Corporate Offices making all marketing and sales goals.
good,This is by far the best truck driving job I ever had although the reason I was let go was by any one I've discussed it with extremely  weak and totally unjust.
good,A typical work day begins with suiting up with safety harness for the safe operation of the stock pickers. Perform safety checklist inspections of any material handling equipment. Must consistently pull orders in a safe manner to meet production requirements.
good,Good place to work learn how to work safe  at united stationers they had sow us  how to manage things when they get hard  learn my most things at united ..
good,"A good company to work for, as with any job it can be stressful.  we usually work 8-10 hours per day sometimes 12 but that's rare. management is ok the work environment is casual and fun at times. The best part of the job is your constantly moving not stuck in one spot all day."
good,"At essendant we used RF Scanners, we would scan product and load them onto a pallet, once the pallet was a certain height we would wrap them and load them pallets unto the truck. Each station had a specific route they went on. Also each station had its own name and own different truck route. Co workers we very competitive, we all wanted to be the best and get the most scans. Hardest part of the job is the heat theirs was no air conditioners."
good,"Always busy, so there is plenty of OT to be made."
good,Great place work employee are wonderful people we work together as a family safety is top of the line for this company benefits is great the job is not you come to work and learn the skills you need to system. Small business but place to work

good,The company was major factor in my families life. It provided me skills and classes for my health. It was a great work culture and management was on top of everything.I enjoyed every moment of it.
good,"On a typical workday the company has a deadline for scheduled shipments. I have learned that you have to manage your time in order to avoid late shipments. I personally enjoyed management because I had opportunities at see them out side  work place during company functions. They try to treat everyone equally. The hardest part of the job was working with people who didn't want to do a task but would get upset if you did it and received good recognition for it. For example, if overtime offered at the beginning of your shift and I came in early working 12 hours, some will be upset if they were mandated on the end of the shift or I worked more than the 12. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I served on the jobs Activity Committee, Safety Committee, and Diverse Committee. I felt that my opinion was not unnoticed. Plus the company provided picnics for employees and family, Christmas parties annually and celebrated other holidays as well."

good,"Changing industry"
good,I love Essendant.  Management lets you do your job without hovering over you.  Lots of hours but its part of the job and overtime is anything over 8 hours daily.
good,"A typical day you would either pick off of shelfs or scan the items on the dock and get them ready for delivery. I learned how to use a few different riding equipment and they will help you learn anything you want.

good,Great people and work environment.  Perfect work/life balance coupled with managers that take time to help and listen.  workplace culture is truly into giving back to the community and helping out
good,I enjoyed working for a quick thinking fast to react technologically up-to-date company.  I learned a lot working there...would never have left.  But writing was on the wall....I survived through 4 previous RIF's....but once SAP was implemented....kinda knew the old way of budgeting was over....

good,Great place to work. Low pay. If the had more money to throw around then it would be a great place to work. Would do it all over

The hours were very long and a lot of standing was required. But overall I enjoyed my job it was a lot of fun, also my co workers."
good,High volume calls which made the day go by nfast because you  stayed busy. sometimes did not receive breaks at all if you had a high volume calls.
