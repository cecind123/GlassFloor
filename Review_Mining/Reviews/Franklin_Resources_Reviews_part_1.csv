rating,review
bad,The finance industry is very tough and you must have the drive to stay in it.  I traded with the most prestigious companies in new York City - but this job is for the youth and not an old gringo like myself.
bad,"On a busy day they cut your lunch hours, and walk around handing out snack size bags of Doritos as if your in elementary school, truly a great moral booster, woo-hoo!!!  You have to raise your hand to go to the bathroom, and if you go too often, they will approach you.They also don't want you to tell customers that they do business with India. Such an unethical company."
bad,Worked there a short time. Dysfunctional management. No Constancy in direction.
bad,"The lack of integrity of the two heads of the Real Estate division in New York is shocking.  It's easy to see why investors invest once and only once with them.  "
bad,"Might be an OK place to end your career, but not a great place to start it and even worse if you are mid-career.  Competitive work environment among teams, with no incentive to collaborate.  Upper management within some divisions doesn't know what transparency is."
bad,A typical day involves research and customer service. There was always more to learn about the shareholder's statements.
bad,I enjoyed my time at Franklin Templeton. The vacation days and sick days were more than I was able to use. Management was pleasant to work with. Over all it was great.
bad,Franklin is a slow paced environment providing job security and a lack of growth. The company is primarily focused on active investment which is slowly declining. The company is not handling the changing environment and acts like a dinosaur. Despite being in Silicon Valley it is about as far away from the culture as a company can possibly be.
bad,"I worked for Franklin Templeton for over 10 years in the TA. Over the years the moral has gone down. It is now a revolving door and no one is happy. The Managers and Supervisors don't promote you unless you are apart of their click. They don't give the tenured employees who have been there through all the ups and downs a chance to move up unless you are a favorite. The pay scale is on the lower end for the industry and they are hiring people with less no skills at all and expect the tenured to train them. in the past 3 years the average a person stays is 1 year.  "
bad,"People are not very nice, Sr. Management plays favorites. Culture is very cutthroat..."
bad,This is a good company and brand to work for but the culture is biased. While the people have remained for years but the method of teaching and training for new comers especially from a different industry is poor.
bad,I was not given enough training/direction to do my job properly. Management did not seem to know what the parts of management was doing and what assignments/ tasks were given out.
bad,work life balance typical day at work what you learned the most enjoyable part of the job good co workers learned management
bad,"I will say that I learned a lot about the securities industry. I met a lot of smart and genuine people. However, I cannot say the same about the management of my former team. There is a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of big egos. They don't seem to care about their subordinates."
bad,I admired company's disciplined and conservative approach to their business.
bad,NIce place and nice people. I was only a temp employee so I dont have much of an review.
bad,The company does not take their employees happiness into any kind of consideration. Franklin takes more time figuring out ways to send the jobs to their off shore sites like India and Poland. They say it’s not out sourcing do to they are keeping the jobs under the Franklin umbrella.  They can pay India about 1/3 to 1/2 for processing US Shareholders transactions. They technology is completely out dated and is constantly going down.
bad,"Company is conservative in investment approach. It's very difficult to get promoted in US. Lots of tenured people who get favored during bonus cycle. Most staff growth is out of US. Benifits are good, but salary is not very good."
bad,"Worked for Franklin Templeton for 10 years. Very difficult to advance for most employees due to jobs constantly leaving to India and Poland.  Franklin believe strongly in outsourcing jobs to low cost centers outside of the US."
bad,"It's a very good company, the team i am working is the worst the management is worst. All they need is work work work all the time. There is nothing like fun on the floor."
bad,"Job is face paced and busy, but there is little to no room for upward movement. Most jobs are now being moved overseas, or outsourced to other companies completely. Full departments are being closed out at the start of 2020. Long term knowledgeable staff members have either been paid to retire early, or are being forced out the door. Morale is low, and numerous staff members wind up taking a leave of absence due to stress. I used to enjoy my job but towards the end, I could barely stand to force myself through the door each day."
bad,"good job stability and general working environment.  however, 10% of the people do 90% of the work and those that do the work don't necessarily get compensated.  pay is way below market."
bad,Nothing to say much. It is overall a good experience to work with Franklin Templeton Investments India as a Finance Associate.
bad,"This was my first Job in the company."
bad,"This company is very by the book with their approach to everything, and they will not give you the time of day unless you can drop names or make their high demands in production."
bad,The financial services industry is going through a transition and it will be interesting to see how/if Franklin Templeton adapts to meet the needs of it's clients.  Many investors are now interested in robo-advisors and are choosing to invest in low-cost passive ETFs.
bad,"I worked at Franklin Templeton as a contractor for a year and a half."
bad,The workplace culture was good. The people were friendly. It is a good job if you are interested in accounting for mutual funds. If you are not then you definitely should not work there.
good,A company in which you can learn the basics of the mutual fund industry.  They have an Uber conservative culture in which it is hard to grow as once you start on a track management tries to keep you there.  The pay is also the worst in the industry so don't stay past learning the basics.
good,"Being like a fish in aquarium. The dishes in aquarium listens to the one which stayed from long time, the same approach is seen. There are no advancements and no innovative approach. Major politics and low merit compete. Experienced professionals feel degraded and demotivational."
good,"Day to day: Reviewing outage/relocation ticketing systems for prioritization and scheduling. Completing any minor tickets. Plan large divisional relocations with vendors. Schedule one on ones with divisional heads. Monitor global Audiovisual systems. Perform the Moves adds and changes throughout the day. "
good,"Executive management are slow to respond, often feels the company is more reactive vs proactive.  Asset management philosophies outdated, as investment principles from 1950's, often fall short in today's market place."
good,"Overall a good company for work/life balance, promotions can be a bit of a challenge. I would say maybe 85/90% of the company have a great culture and good work/life balance"
good,"I would say at first you would feel like all is perfect. Everybody in focused on achievement and management on numbers. "
good,"The work is done on a collaborative basis, with employees in India, Poland and the US. The culture is relaxed and casual. Dress code is dress for your day. There are two locations in Toronto."
good,It was a pleasure to work with excellent investment professionals and dedicated colleagues in a industry that is facing numerous challenges from low-cost providers.
good,"Work is constantly changing, and is challenging, but focus on off-shoring work makes US opportunities is impacting US wage increases.  Do appreciate the mix of men and women in management roles."
good,"Come in respond to emails and then do monthly, quarterly, and semi or annual reporting requirements."
good,First working day on live environment.
good,"Mutual funds as a product have become very undesirable, and hence the sales growth for this company has suffered recently.  However, is still a very large global diversified profitable company."
good,"Team structures are not organised when the company is offshoring the business functions to unqualified staffs. It's good to reduce the cost for business, but creates messy for day to day operations."
good,Some workers must clock in. The compensation is low and there is high turnover. Very little opportunity to advance. The company lacks diversity.The pay raises are low.
good,"- Good opportunity to learn"
good,I must say this my first job as a sales person i know about people behave &  how to work according.
good,"A typical day of work used to be full on enjoyment and motivation. There were many opportunities and there were leaders that laid the foundations for a prosperous future. Coming to work was a pleasure, with many chances to learn things. Co workers now and then were like family. The difference is the leaders now did not earn or learn their positions. They undermine the performance of staff heckling and bullying them. Destroying all motivation to advance, and protecting their own interests rather than protecting the company and it's staff. If audit were to ask them the workings of the company, it's policies and their functions and how they add value to the company, there would be a no answer. This is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is enjoying what little of the past company lingers."
good,"As stated above, that's the only plus, besides a few people to work with. Other than that, not worth it. You do learn a lot of stuff but it makes it so hard to move around and also management likes to play favorites, as well as try to bring those who are working hard down."
good,"The people you work with really make the company what it is. "
good,"Depending on what department you’re in, jobs has been transferred to India.  St Petersburg campus has 5 buildings.  But more than half the space is being leased out to other companies."
good,"Working environment is good."
good," I had the privilege to work with some tremendous people there, extremely bright. However, the processes are lacking and hard to change. Therefore, they are facing lots of redundancies. This is very costly for the company. Coworkers were always very nice and professional."
good,"I worked in customer service, answering calls from shareholders and financial advisors. All our calls are recorded, and some are randomly selected for review. The degree to which these calls were assessed with a fine-toothed comb was incredibly aggravating, and the cause of much disciplinary action; for example, the difference between saying that a specific fund was ""heavily invested in the healthcare industry"" vs ""has heavy exposure to the healthcare industry."" I found myself feeling stifled and suffocated, and unable to move to another department, despite 2 years of trying."
good,"Stressful and political, long hours due to staff reductions, push to offshore almost every staff position in order to reduce cost even though work quality suffered."
good,A fair platform to learn the gamette of mutual fund industry and it’s functioning. But employee satisfaction is least in terms of ling working hours and least pay.
good,Great company to work with but there is no personal growth in Franklin Templeton.
good,I learned more than I could have imagined. This was a great employer right out of college.
good,"FT a good company to start your career. Can learn a lot."
good,"Nice company to work for, nice benefits, nice location, good team and place to learn "
good,"FRI is a wonderful company that builds upon its past as a family business. The overall company was great, but reorganizations and consolidation have turned some departments into much less than they are capable of being."
good,"Pretty good work environment to learn for resume builder. Coworkers are very nice and helpful. Good benefits. "
good,"A good company with a lovely campus along with facilities like cafeteria,transport and with a good work life balance  management is good an friendly if you have a good rapport with your leader work can vary depending upon the profile you are working even though the workplace is open there is a certain level of hierarchy and it is orthodox salary hikes and  incentives are average."
good,"AUM is not increasing, so operational cost is taking a hit. It makes the company in cost cutting mode. Near future depends on inflow in passive investment but again company is not able to distinguish itself from top players."
good,"Pay package is less, otherwise a decent company to start your career with. The growth is slow. The management is good. Company is booming in its sector."
good,"Work Place/ Environment is good. Nice people, No drama, very productive. Benefits are decent and Pay is good. Management is horrible. Have untrained managers that needs more development and takes unfair advantage of authority. Belittles their workers and Office managers are rude and stingy. But if you can avoid it, then its actually a good place to work! CEO is wonderful!"
good,"New York office is great, the St. Petersburg office has poor leadership. There is a relaxation room, vending machines, and two on-site cafeterias. Location is great in proximity to Downtown St. Petersburg and the lake by the property is very nice."
good,"The day starts off with my department inputting trades from institutional investors, researching problems, contacting clients to answer their questions."
good,"It was a great company to work at until an American company took over us, since then it has all been extreme cost-cutting to the bone and transferring the jobs to India."
good,"Franklin Templeton is a prestigious firm. The structure of the fund group provided the opportunity to be exposed to all Franklin Templeton funds serviced by the site.  "
good,"A very good place to work, I have learnt so many skills like Inter-personal skills, work under pressure and How to dedicate towards our job."
good,Not so easy to move up from call center entry position. Dealing with callers can be a time stressful. This was great way to get through the door however getting too comfortable will hurt you in a long haul
good,Requires very long tenure to achieve promotion (10+ years). Lots of budget dollars to do a variety of projects. Great bonus system that pays out frequently.
good,It's been a great place to learn as the company grew and changed.  The benefits offered are great.  The people working there are committed.  It provides flexible working hours.
good,Good life balance but not good for carrier growth. It is very to get you to next level and few team mates are not supportive and managers will act based on seniors in the team.
good,Good  company with a great culture and lot of learning opportunity.  Especially For freshers a great company to start their career.  Great work culture.
good,"This is a large company with many types of jobs available.  The company is based in California so there is a rather relaxed atmosphere.  The benefits are good buy have been reduced and become more costly over time.  Recently the company is bleeding assets so they have been in cost cutting mode and putting a lot of pressure on employees to do more and become very critical.  We have an onsite gym, game room, walking trail, and cafeteria.  The campus is very well maintained and is close to restaurants, stores and the highway. There is good training.  The best part of the job are my colleagues.  The hardest part of the job is that they tend to promote people to management positions that are unqualified and untrained in how to manage and then they leave them in those positions for many years with no oversight.  HR does not truly help those that need assistance.  Overall it is a good company to work for if you are fortunate enough to get a good boss."
good,"Sadly fund performance is typically not very good. Sometimes there is a bright spot but not usually."
good,The progression to higher level is kind of hard and it rely heavily on performance based ratings. The company's trading strategy is not very quantitative. But the management is friendly to entry level employees.
good,"Productive work place - competitive.."
good,"Good company, decent benefits, good work/life balance."
good,There is no chance for advancement here.  Management has their favorites for sure and do not see the ones that are actually putting the work in nor do they care.
good,"it was a nice experience working with fraklin templeton investments. A good place to learn , share and explore together on the technical and domain perspective."
good,"Excellent opportunity after college to gain knowledge on investments policies, procedures and strategies. Fantastic work  environment and culture due to colleagues from different background."
good,"I understand the world of mutual funds and stocks and bonds is fast paced, but they want robots here.  You have to adhere to a certain way of managing your call or else they will fail you even if your call was perfect.  It's insanity."
good,This was a good place to work.  I learned a lot about the Mutual Funds world.  After 9/11 changes were made in the department and I was let go.  It has been a long time since then so I can't comment much on how it is to work there now.
good,"Fun environment to work and good work life balance is provided."
good,"Happiness with the company is contingent on where you are at.  If its Sales, Marketing, or Compliance life is peachy and there is an opportunity to learn and grow until you've got the chops to make it elsewhere...if in Operations or Customer Service not so much.  Constant revolving doors, childish micro-management, lots of office politics, workers at other global sites are often lazy and/or incompetent with none of the repercussions experienced locally.  Poor training on specialized processes is the norm in the TA, then results are often nit-picked when much greater macro problems are apparent."
good,"Culture is quiet, processes are lacking and hard to change. typical day is working on my own at my own pace, not much management and guidance. Coworkers are nice, just not a lot of interaction"
good,"People are nice - management and company culture is conservative"
good,"Company does not value existing employees for advancement. The culture is very open and supportive, but they don't adequately value existing employees when posting jobs."
good,"i have been working here for last 5 years,Its a good company to work.A lot goes into discipline and work culture is also nice. You get a lot of opportunity to learn and earn."
good,"Very busy place, a lot of responsibility "
good,"Good Workplace "
good,"Worked as an intern in the Institutional Investments Department, mainly on monthly/quarterly reporting.  Lot of excel and powerpoint.  Good beginner job, learned a lot."
good,"Good work life balance, Nice growth opportunities, great benefits, Challenging work Easy access to leaderhip, allows creative and out of the box thinking"
good,"Team is good. Work life balance is good, but in busy seasons, project management could be better as we end up working 14 15 hours a day. they are good facilities available like gym, TT ping pong"
good,"Good place to work and have great work life Balance."
good,"Average company to work,mostly depends on which vertical you are working.Big and Nice Campus and good facilities.Paywise Franklin Templeton is very poor."
good,"Provide daily client service and review various reports to meet deadlines.  "
good,"It is a multinational company, very sophisticated, advanced analytic projects are available. The management is very conservative and strict some times. But the facilities that are available are really really good."
good,This was a great opportunity to Lear RIC Tax. It also allowed to to understand RIC compliance and reporting. I enjoyed working with my colleagues as well.
good,As it was my first job learnt so much here and got a chance to explore my knowledge to complete extent possible. over all i enjoyed working here. however i need a change and career growth.
good,"The staff is fun and very helpful. No micro-managing, you are left alone to do your work. The company as  gym onsite which is good because you can go on lunch break and workout."
good,"Fun & Productive work environment, Company is downsizing due to pushing jobs overseas. Loved working in Main Office Services, handling suspended trades, requests for specific reports for back offices, manual processing, handling research on omnibus accounts to review accounts and determine why they are out of balance. Handled incoming and outgoing calls to the back offices as well as gave requirements and paperwork required for legal transfers. My co workers and Supervisors were wonderful to work with. The best part of my job was researching and determining why accounts were out of balance and training my team mates  on specific processes,"
good,It was my initial organisation and pretty happy to start my career in this organisation. Such a nice company with wonderful people around. Wroked there for more than 3 years.
good,"Typical busy work day "
good,I was a contractor at Franklin Templeton and the people were ok to work for.  Don't get caught up in the politics and you'll be fine.
good,I got to learn about how mutual fund industry works and its various products and services. Also how to develop and maintain client relationships.
good,"Stable company. Conservative and steady culture.There are not many opportunities for advancement but if you get a job, you will have consistent employment."
good,"A typical day at work was fun and at the same time challenging, Co workers were great to work with, Templeton was a great place to work"
good,"I loved working at Franklin Templeton Investments truly because of the wonderful people who were employed there. The work was challenging, time constraints could be stressful, and workflow was ever-changing, but I enjoyed going everyday because I just really appreciated the environment that the employees created"
good,"Good place to work with Especially for Freshers."
good,"Contracting.  Command center.  Escalations.  Troubleshooting software.  Lotus Note, Outlook,"
good,"good company to work,co-workers are supportive in work, we can enjoy the work culture."
good,Franklin Templeton is a great company to work it. Not only do you feel productive but the work culture there is such that you get to do a lot of extra curricular activities.The people there are very friendly and look to help each other at the first oppurtunity they get.

good,"ok company, high energy small customer service department. multiple job duties"
good,"Tends to be a young culture with good work/life balance. Has offices near downtown Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, so happy hour after work allows to get to know coworkers outside of professional environment."
good,It is the best company for experienced who are already with title team leaders and it is a pain for the experienced people who are not with title team leaders.
good,"It was highly stressful. We had to work all day with only a lunch break, we could go to the restroom, but it was expected to have that done during lunch. Everything was monitored, our phone calls were recorded, if we made 2 mistakes, like not saying the clients name 3 times we were written up. If we clocked in more than 5 minutes early or was 1 minute late we were written up. If we didn't have 95% accuracy on our paperwork we were written up. We weren't allowed to have conversations with the people who sat next to us."
good,Don't get compensated fairly
good,"Jobs with Franklin can very from slow to very fast paced. Overall it is a low paying employer and not much opportunity for growth. The management is very friendly and the open door policy allows for ideas and input from all levels. The people are the best part of the job for sure. If you aren't concerned about pay and would like a nice work culture, this employer would be good for you."
good,"Day start with Security setups, Continuous learning, hardest part of the job is when volumes comes all of a sudden and difficult to handle when there is shortage of staff."
good,Franklin templeton investments is very good place to work and its very peace full place where you dont see much crowd and the management everything is good.
good,"Everyday is great to come to office to explore something new"
good,"The job had a lot of good challenges when working with callers, things like problem solving and research. The micromanagement due to being in the financial industry was terrible for morale. The intense  disciplining they displayed over the smallest mistake made it really challenging to be human and do your job - micromanaging at it's worst."
good,Work environment was impressive and company culture is appreciable..
good,"Although the staff could be a bit more transparent with agendas, I'm sure because their in the financial industry."
good,"This was a good employer.  My supervisor was very pro employee, they were always very understanding to all my professional and personal needs."
good,"It really depends on who your manager is. The job is like any corporate job. Great benefits, good facilities. The management staff can be challenging. They waste a lot of money on unnecessary expense because they don;t like to listen to ""new"" folks w/ experience. Better to do things the old way."
good,"Company with good opportunities and with a  good growth trajectory, very collaborative and supportive environment . Good Interactive sessions and helpful workforce environment."
good,You will get good work life balance. I liked the work culture in Franklin Templeton. Campus wise it is the best. I feel that this is a fast paced company.
good,Good place to learn about the mutual fund industry. Not much room for advancement as many of the jobs are now in India. Great benefits and good people to work with.

good,"A beautiful new campus in San Mateo, CA.  Good benefits and perks."
good,Good Workplace but everything depends on the supervisor. It would have been a much better if supervisors would have given a lil bit of freedom to the employees and make it a fun at work space.
good,Working at Franklin Templeton has been a good experience thus far.  The company offers a 37.5 vs 40 hour work week to its employees.  What makes the workplace challenging is how manual the system and platforms are so paying attention to details and doing your due delligence are key skills for success in this environment. The company also offers excellent benefits and a competitive salary to its employees.
good,"Very good Work life balance, smart benefits like transport etc, Nice Job Security, very nice place to work, "
good,"They are leaders in the financial market.  Great diverse workforce. Ft. Lauderdale location is in Downtown area,  Office space is clean, easy access to break rooms, and local restaurants."
good,Nice place to work . You can work as you like in few department and in few departments is too stress full . Operational departments are so hectic that they don't even get time to take a break . Where as IT and other departments except operation the nature is very cool .
good,"Great people, Good Job security. Tedious work and management likes to micro manage. . not a whole lot of room for growth within the transfer agent. the co workers are nice and the 401k match is pretty good 75 cents to the dollar"
good,"The work/life balance is amazing and the benefits are hard to match in the industry. The mobility is practically nonexistent, however. Everyone is comfortable where they are and in order to move up you will need to wait for someone to retire."
good,A company which has given me a scope for my career growth and the team which always mentors each other. Great professional environment. Many opportunities to learn.
good,"It all starts with checking of emails which we get from the employees providing us with personal trade details of employees after that dealing with rejects which includes security and access person and reconciliation of the statements which employees earlier provided and ends with generation of the violation reports."
good,"Provides a lot of exposure to those with an attitude to learn. Management is really supportive of employee development and training, and a great place with a lot of diversity."
good,"Enjoy working with colleagues and key stakeholders researching emerging trends and determining which would be most beneficial if implemented. "
good,"FT is good place to learn but due to politics  in certain dept it no go area to continue in this company more than 2 years,management are very strict regarding office reporting timings."
good,"Franklin Templeton offers excellent benefits and competitive pay but lacks in all the other areas. Poor management/leadership in the transfer agent department. No vision of career advancement to go into other departments. "
good,"Back office role, which is a good entry level work right after University.  Good friendly people, but tough management.  Highly routine work with limited scope for value added work and/or imagination!  Fairly relaxed atmosphere depending on your direct supervisor."
good,"To be a part of franklin templeton was really my pleasure, the work was good and learnt lot new things and the management was very helpful and team members are always ready to help and the people work as a team and make sure everybody is on the same track by the end of the day."

good,"- Flexible place and secured place to work"
good,"Good company to work for, amazing benefits and good management.  Franklin offers great training and room for personal and professional growth. Work in team environments, and learn a multitude of information regarding the mutual fund industry."
good,Good company to work. Life Balance is average. Salary  Benefits are less. Job Security is good.
good,"The starts with verifing the trades weather the all the trades have flown into the system correctly. Then we check for Recons if there are any unresolved issues. Then we check all the other things say expenses, interest, dividend, taxes etc have been accrued correctly. Then we check for the corporate actions and if there are any we book them into our systems. All the corporate actions should be accounted in ex-dates. Then we wait for the FX Reval to get posted. Then we allocate the income & expense to the respective share classes. Then the final step we generate the NAV for that particular fund."
good,"The company has a tremendous focus on clients. Which is the bonus for the company. There's a lot of tenured folks in the company, that shows growth and potential."
good,It is a good firm to work with and will learn a lot while working in the field of finance and mutual fund industry. I got to learn so many new things here.
good,"Overall a really good company to work for and even retire with, but there is no room for (upward) mobility. Management in some levels needs to be improved."
good,"It is a good company to work with. But pros and cons are there."
good,"I have nothing good to say about Franklin's IT Management.  If you are of a certain ethnic origin, you will succeed at Franklin, if you are not, well you are wasting your time."
good,"Its been a good work environment but no recognition for my work,"
good,"was temporary as a contractor, learned a lot and management was good, co worker was nice "
good,"NA, Do not wish to provide a response regarding this employer. My sole opinion would not be an accurate representation of the company as there are many roles."
good,Good place to work however they are shrinking their footprint in the USA so a lot of jobs are going offshore. The people are fantastic to work with and it they treat the employees fairly well.
good,"Meeting with stakeholders, application developers and testers are a typical day, add to that some application issues/problems that may arise. "
good,"There were many different facets of this business that I learned when I worked with this company.  I started with a single territory and advanced into Field Management and Special Projects Administrator. I dealt with training of fellow employees and clients.  I traveled extensively and was able to learn a lot about business in general through my experiences with FRG."
good,"very busy dialy work and requirement"
good,"iam an senior executive in franklin templeton asset management private limited, chennai"
good,Franklin Templeton has excellent benefits. The culture is very friendly; the amount of work-life-balance you have will differ based on the department you're working in.
good,"Pro: Stable company with many long-term employees; hardworking people, very good 401k plan (company match 75 cent for every dollar contributed by the employee up to IRS limit)"
good,"Great place to spend 19 years but time for a new challenge.  Franklin is undergoing a lot of changes is direction and reporting.  Franklin is a respectable, family owned company that will be fine when the market turns.  "
good,"Really great people, lots of support.  Been there a long time. Flexible arrangements and hours, WFH options. Opportunities to travel and work virtually with other globally."
good,"Provided high-level administrative support to the Corporate Real Estate and Facilities Department. Assisted one Director, Manager and three Supervisors."
good,"Good working environment, and particuarly if you are not looking for a challenging or stressful environment. Not a place to be if you are looking to innovate."
good,"Franklin Template was a very challenging place to work, as the company was growing and expanding.  Very collegial and collaborative environment.  Dysfunctional  teams within the company have caused them to lose market share."
good,Job security is not there. By looking towards your future goals. I started woking here as a fresher so i gained a lot of knowledge here and gaining more .it provides a good plateform for freshers as well as experienced.
good,"The position I held was a stressful position but I gained expierence and knowledge in the trust administration field.  The office staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and willing to take the time to train me in the different aspects of the position.  "
good,Its a fun place to work. One can improve their skills for carer advancement.The company gym is a stress buster for many employees. I love to work for the company again

I would also collaborate with the TA workflow team to improve service capabilities, workflows, policies and procedures.  It is important to be very detail oriented and patient at my job.  My managers were great.  I worked with my director in a mentor/men-tee capacity where we met once each month and worked on goals to be more efficient and learn more about the business.  My co workers were very supportive.  We worked collaboratively together by delegating responsibilities, covering each other.  The hardest part of the job was working with peers who were not hard working or efficient.  I am very detail oriented and responsible and take my duties very seriously.  The best part is the people, the staff and the customers. I would not be here without our customers and in these difficult times I am so happy to be in a position where I can help others. I truly enjoy every interaction I have with my peers and our customers. There are times where you can make someone's day and times where you can't but you can help someone understand.
