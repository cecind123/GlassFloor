bad,"This company uses people and takes advantage of their best qualities to use them to their benefit and once they have exhausted all of your resources and are no longer seen as valuable in their eyes they will find a way to get rid of you. Seeing from both the floor and management side of the company I have seen how poor the management is and how employees are treated as less than human beings at times with very little leadership from management. HR is corrupt and will change and manipulate the system in order to get what they want and what they think is best. Rules and regulations  are changed and things are done in secret behind closed doors to make themselves look good and in order to protect the company from say having to give employees their earned and given benefits as an example. Worked with this company for years and got to the point no matter how above and beyond I went with my job there was no room for growth. Was promised raises and promotions in which again ""Corrupt HR"" portrayed on paper that I was receiving the promotion and raise but in their system it was never changed and disregarded. But when I left for a better company was asked why I wasn't happy and what they could do to keep me. Would strongly recommend that you reconsider working for this company as I know many feel the same way as I do and the numbers show all of the people leaving to find better. It is also terrible pay. For what they pay you the company down the street for the exact same job would pay 2-3 times as much. Management has the buddy buddy system. So unless you're in good with one of the higher"
bad,"The worst company I have ever had the pleasure of working for. Factory employees, or Members, as Gunlocke calls them are treated like dogs. Stay away!"
bad,"The work is very physical and you're often times not appreciated or shown any kind of respect.  There are many managers/supervisors, but a lot of them don't know how to be assertive and let people know what they're doing wrong.  Most of the time they barely communicate with the actual laborers.  Hard work goes unnoticed.  Incentive program was taken away."
bad,"Allsteel corporation is a great company to work for, amazing people and great pay.  Being promoted to HNI corporate office was the worst decision of my life. Unprofessional and childlike behavior was exhibited by the women that work in Shared Services. Promoted people with little to no skills because they knew people. Educated and great individuals were let go or treated badly."
bad,"When you have an idea, it doesn't matter. If you have anything to add, it doesn't matter. You're doing well? You're average. Backstabbing culture is the norm. Unless you pucker up, you won't last long."
bad,They don't care at all for there employes they only care about money the stress that you feel working there is really bad the managment is a careless.
bad,"If you would like to spend your entire life thinking about work and taking it home with you, HNI might be the right fit for you. HNI has no employee loyalty.  If you are salary, your boss may determine that you get compensatory time or they may not.  This issue is not treated the same across the company - as many other policies are not."
bad,i personally do not like factory work nor the hours. the job itself is not fun either! plus extremely dangerous and not many people take ideas into consideration
bad,"When I was employed at this company, the department I was in was very unsettled.  There was animosity among managers and a division within the team.  There was also no training program provided for my role and the manager I reported to never had time to provide me with direction."
bad,"A typical day at work was prepare for daily production review, process daily/weekly reports, answer e-mails and questions, projects. I learned new systems and the demands of a controller. The management team had a difficult time being to focus on any of the challenges because they were being pulled in too many directions. The co-workers were very hard working and wanted to learn. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep morale up. The most enjoyable part of the job were my employees."
bad,"I had a lot of fun working in the team I was in and they helped me grow my skills but the overall environment was rather caustic."
bad,It is not a steady pace job. Co- workers are easy to get along with. If you like know knowing if you will work 8 or 9 hours from day to day  and or not knowing if you will work Saturday until Friday afternoon. Than HNI is the place for you
bad,The only thing I liked about working there is the people you work with because they can  relate to you on what is going on in this company  I have been there 15 years and I regret starting my career there
bad,"Many customer orders were not filled, even orders received 5 months early.  This left schools with no furniture when school started.  Production and management did not seem to care and when customers (dealers) called, production would not even give customer service and expected date to tell customers when they might receive their furniture.  Customer service had to make things up to tell customers.  Management did not care either."
bad,This is a great company for someone fresh out of school that has no experience.  It is an unwritten rule that the expectation of longevity for a new salaried employee is between 3-5 years and then they will leave.
bad,"Worked with lots of good people on the shop floor and in lower and mid level management.  Direction from high level management was minimal and infrequent.  MCR was not good to the members, more like a second management team interfering in daily operations."
bad,"- Work as team "
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job is watching and executing trades , "
good,used to be an awesome place to work. if you leave they have a 3 year no hire back policy. hours are either long or short. no consistant balance. management is horrible about listening to employees concerns. the culture and policys are top notch...if management chooses to follow them. mcr/hr is not there for employees unless its easy stuff. new badge help with benefits or questions ect. any safety concerns or problems with management they become company people. a lot of favoritism.
good,"As an assembly line worker from the day you start and every day you work on the line your body will be in some type of pain, it just depends on the job. Of course your body will adjust to it, but it will always be there. Management doesn't care about each department/line equally. Some lines get all the attention, all the new employees, and all the updates while others are stuck struggling and not getting the recognition they deserve. Management will shut down the ""unimportant"" lines and have those people move to the ""important"" lines to work or they will flat out just take people from the struggling lines so they struggle even more. 1st shift is not held to the same standard of goals or organization as second shift, 1st shift also has twice as many workers as 2nd shift but 2nd shift is still expected to hit the same numbers."
good,A typical day was going non-stop from the time we arrived until we left at the end of the day. Things were always going wrong because they were changing our working environments so it was hard to adjust to the job we were hired to do. I did learn how to manage my time well and how to take charge when issues arise and problem solve. Most of the co-workers were amazing and we still remain friends to this day but some were favored over others so they didn't treat everyone equally. The most enjoyable part of my job was challenging myself and achieving the goals I set out for my own personal achievement.
good,"It's an ok place to work. Great benefits, great co workers. Fast paced,  on the line. Advancement opportunities are lacking, but they do come up. Pay is okay, for what you do, but could be better."
good,"Project managent was not present. Project deadlines are unrealistic. Resources are hard to come by, and the average age of employees is only 23 years of age."
good,"Although the atmosphere appears to be team driven, in my experience it was the complete opposite. When I was first hired the most popular quotes I would here from my peers and subordinates is: ""make sure you cover yourself"". Quarterly presentations were demanded with minimal assistance from managers to basically state, ""look what I did"". I found the culture to not align with my beliefs."
good,This is a good place to work if you are interested in propelling your career quickly and willing to make your job your life.  There is a strong culture of improvement and making change happen quickly.
good,HNI Corporation is a great environment for people who want a good working culture and opportunities for advancement.
good,"Working under minimal supervision. "
good,Fast pace. Hired as a welder and told at orientation there were no openings for welder. Got put on a line. Not very well compensated for the effort. Have to get on a good line with good workers or you don't get the benefits
good,"At HNI, you have the ability to work independently, make a difference, and try out several different career paths. The culture is different depending on the the different operating companies. Much attention is given to the stock price by the leadership team, and layoff/job cuts are one of the first ways the company will work to right their bottom line for the stock holders. The hours can be long but the company takes care of its employees. Work/life balance is important, and you are able to flex your hours. You are paid well for the area as Muscatine is a smaller community."
good,"Teams are open to listen and accept new ideas, give equal opportunity to all the members, no hierarchy or favoritism, emphasize on getting the job done in the best possible way."
good,"typical day work from 4am -4pm "
good,"easy going workers, safe an comfortable environment. great place to work. only problem I had was when my team leader would ignore requests and almost refuse to see me."
good,"average pay with lots of no value added work that gets pawned off on you by management, and very little knowledge of individuals daily workflow. Very old school in many practices and many individuals are not held responsible for their work or lack thereof. Makes it difficult to make change due to so many resistant to change minded management individuals."
good,"Everyday I went to work at HNI I was in charge managing a department of 35 members. My goal everyday was to improve metrics of safety, quality,delivery, and true efficiency."
good,HNI has been a great place to not only work but also to gain the experience needed for me to learn the field that I am currently studying. HNI has also helped me gain the knowledge that I need to go on and experience other opportunities and to move forward in my career and be successful in my future.
good,Good company management needs works as far as members getting injuried. Pay could be a little better and certain members need to be retained and need to reforce rules
good,"Overall the agency culture is very flexible, great benefits.  What happens where there is not true direct leadership within the benefits segment contributes to their continual turnover."
good,I have been with hni company for 12 yrs now and for the most part i ask and  ask to be trained in  other parts of the plant and i get 101 reasons y they dont
good,"At times there are too many irons in the fire with a lack of clear direction. You learn to get close and then move on to the next task. "
good,"Good place to work has great benefits but management likes to keep things to themselves until the last minute."
good,"Good and competitive environment. opportunity to learn new technology. work culture is little tough . location is little disadvantage."
good,"Great group of people but management wants answers fast. Don't bring up an issue unless you know root cause, and associated action plan now! Too any meetings"
good,"I had started working for hni when i had found out that me and my girlfriend where expecting, they hired me right away full time, i work hard for them, started as a fork truck driver and busted my butt for everyone all day long, love the amount of reasonable that came with the job, after that, moved to a cnc position, about two to three months into the new position, i began to loss my motivation for the job, it became more of a fixed,  you standed here cut this put it here cut this put it there and do it fast, no skill really needed for job"
good,Senior management is engaged and visible for all workers to approach. Managers are hands on and aware of most challenges and are good resources to utilize in solving problems.
good,They give interns meaningful projects that help you develop professionally. There is also a great internship program set up that allows you to collaborate and network with fellow interns.
good,was a good midway job as I looked for something else in my skill set.  the pay was competative and livable but advancement required knowing someone closely or having 4 year degree.
good,Over time work is all was available for most of the year.  Loading and unloading trailers is a good way to stay in shape. Management is all was is looking for employees to move and learn new areas of the warehouse.
good,Good place to work. They offer a lot of positions. They offer advancement as well. It is also a drug-free environment. They have three shifts with multiple locations. Most of them are just two shifts.
good,The environment is welcoming and HNI appreciates having interns. They take care of housing and keep all the interns together to help create camaraderie.
good,"Independent management of territory sales."
good,good place to work just had a few issues with work and school and school won. I would go back to work here again. In the warehouse the jobs are done by you with little supervision this I did like.
good,"I love what i do and were i work, The hours are very flexible for me with young kids. The atmosphere is great, and everyone is great to work with. I am just looking for career advancement and having a hard time finding it here."
good,This was a great place to work while I was there.  They do overload you and expect to do more with less.  Pay did not match results.
good,"Since most of the work is located in Muscatine, IA they compensate fairly well. They do promote a lot from within but there just weren't that many openings unfortunately and I felt stuck in my position for over 2 years. They do reimburse for schooling or to get any related certifications."
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits and friendly environment. 401k packages are offered which could be a great opportunity to save and invest. Good medical benefits.
good,Good place to get a solid paying job for an engineer. Not a place you can greatly your skills as an engineer. They're are very few opportunities for engineer to advance unless they do something in operations management. Culture does not promote critical thinking.
good,"good culture to work in"
good,"I have had a very enjyoyable time at alsteelhni corp. They were very helping with some medical issues and loss of family members they did there best to get me experince in things i have not worked in before. the pay was decent and managment as all places has its faults, but i don really have any negative comments about this job."
good,"HNI was very boring, but everyone was friendly and we worked together to get the orders shipped out on time and orderly."
good,"Hard work but friendly environment. Some potential for growth. Big on safety, big on worker moral. A fast pace environment but not a very stressful environment."
good,HNI was  a good place to work with lots of opportunites within a very small city/ town.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking for employement.
good,"Pros: HNI fully supports career advancement and has a great company culture. This is a great place to work if you want ample opportunities for lateral and vertical career moves, and everyone is supportive of members trying out a role that may not necessarily be their typical field of work."
good,"Great member culture, quality, quality, quality, continuous improvement, metrics driven, manufacturing focused, good supervisors, opportunities galore"
good,"Great company culture, opportunities for multiple roles. Need to offer more PTO or compensation to keep talent there. Muscatine, IA not a destination."
good,"In my position, I currently administer 26 State/Local contracts including Federal contracts. These contracts have terms and conditions that I must adhere to and must remain in compliance with. My day to day responsibilities consist of providing sales support to the sales team and answering questions regarding the contracts. I am also responsible for submitting bid packages to various Request for Quotes/Bids. The hardest part of of the job is determining the risks associated with these bids and determining if we can meet the terms and conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being awarded the contracts so our sales team can gain sales off these contracts."
good,"HNI Corporation's Technologies Center, where I was placed, is a pretty laid back place. As long as you get your stuff done, the supervisors don't mind if you occassionally look at your personal phone or social websites, preferrably on your break time. The coworkers are great and very supportive and understanding."
good,Management was highly receptive to my desire to learn new things such as operating the CNC machines. Attitude And willingness to learn go a long way here.
good,"They have great benefits for their employees, they pay weekly, management encourages their employees to do their best. Help the meet their goals and stay on track and even do work on the line."
good,Wonderful company with lots of opportunities. People are respectful and willing to help one another succeed. Flexible hours. Fun activities and discounts.
good,"HNI really values their employees, along with the interns. They created a seamless experience from what you learn in school to the workplace. Overall, a really great experience!"
good,This is not a real company there is an issue in the software to detect the company. HNI is the type of clients I worked with for Morgan Stanley. Hence the error
good,"I liked the work, it was easy once you knew what you were doing. Some days were busier that others but typically not overwhelming.  More time was spent at work than at home with family, especially in the busy season and hours would drop dramatically in the winter which was rough if you didnt save."
good,The company offered benefits and possibility to get other jobs into the company. If you like to work a lot of time it is a good place. Good opportunity
good,"HNI puts on a huge Intern program for the summer. They give most of the Interns free local housing and provide various events throughout the summer. They put on all intern Lunch & Learns every week, as well as job specific Lunch & Learns for each group of interns. They grouped up the four IT Interns and put us on one project for the summer. They gave us a few days to dive into the software we would be using, then put us to work. Some of the tasks were typical intern tasks, but most of the work was challenging and engaging."
good,very hot in the plant co workers made it stressfull but i could still pull threw the hardest part was the additude of co workers the best bart paid breaks the management was descent they ran the place but not the best as they could or i would in general
good,"I started in Customer Support before moving to MDM. CS was very had and demanding. Really hard and frustration work but helped me to learn the company. I stuck with it and moved to HNI and felt a whole new side to the office. My manager was awesome, I worked really well with my immediate team. At times things were stressful but I knew I could count on my team and manager to have each other’s backs. I knew that if I worked hard I could continue to advance and had the support of my manager to grow and learn new skills."
good,"Overall the best place I have ever worked. Alot of good team players and management is great. The work balance is wonderful. If you have issues upper management and human resources are always there for you. Very family oriented, not perfect but who is. I actually enjoy going into my job everyday."
good,"Fast paced work, with alot of great resources around you to help at any time ."
good,"There was great opportunity for development at this company as an Engineer. Management above you can be quite fluid at times with rapid changes occurring throughout, but there is a good culture, especially at The HON Company"
good,"Good, productive environment to learn and grow. Great place to get started. Meaningful work from day one. Mostly younger engineering staff. Cleaniness of the plant is an area that could be improved."
good,"The company is built on cultural visions. Great pay and awesome benefits. I've been there for 5 years and i have no complaints. Lots of changes, challenges, but always for the better."
good,"being a part of this big company is just amazing and I will recommend to others to apply and come see, team member are the best I never work with, just wonderful"
good,"I started HNI's first HR department and enjoyed doing so.  I felt I contributed greatly; however, they decided to make HR part time as they had in-house experts on benefits and 401k.  I could not afford a part time salary."
good,"HNI's ""member culture"" emphasizes the work-life balance of their employees.  The tone from senior leaders reflects this and a commitment to member development."
good,"The work environment is great, they treat you like members rather than employees. They setup each person up for success. Hard work is rewarded with many chances to move up within the company."
good,"assemblying, reading production schedules, getting parts to lines to produce always paying attention to detail and quality.I learned many jobs and skills here and leadership skills,management and co-workers were great working as a team and meeting common goals.Nothing  hard about job except when pushing to numbers out and you get bad parts brought to you so it's harder to get goal out.The enjoyable part was great hrs, great pay and having a life after work for family and friends"
good,I loved working for HNI. The making of office furniture was similar to my major in High school. only draw back was the closed the plant in N.C.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at HNI Corporation, although it was short lived.  The company has an amazing culture and they are very employee focused. Management is wonderful and is always on board with trying to help employees better themselves through career advancement."
good,"working for HNI is always hard. It is long hot days in the summer and long days in the winter, but it is worth it. I loved my co workers and my bosses always made the days fun."
good,"I will go back when I can go back to them  "
good,Daily improvement is allowed at all levels of the business.  Great benefits and 401K matches.  Travel and advancement available and looked for.   CI training is annual and available monthly to all employees.
good,"Buenos beneficios, buena paga y el personal de oficinas de los mejores"
good,This place knew what it was like to work as a team. It's a real shame this location closed. I had the greatest work experience there than anywhere I've ever worked.
good,HNI is an amazing place to work. There are great benefits plus many activities they go out of their way to include your family. They treat you with respect and there is a tremendous amount of room to grow and move up the chain.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering incoming calls in a call center, helping with customer concerns. I've learned not to take the calls personal and to treat each call as if there the first caller of the day. I've learned how to manage/supervise, and get along with my co workers in a team environment. I would say the hardest part of the job is saying no to a customer when you really want to say yes but you have to follow company policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home knowing I was able to help somebody in some way. I like the feeling of knowing I did the best I could."
good,you are able to achieve goals if you want to achieve something this is the place to work.
