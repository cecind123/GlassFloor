bad,BorgWarner team leader are heartless they show favoritism  they have no respect for there workers .THey are all bullies with leadership skills and workers are beneath them
bad,Work by hot oven in hot weather horrible management from the bottom up they make you hammer part's and hit my fingers all the time they didn't care can't leave or go outside if you are a temporary worker
bad,"A munkahelyi légkör rossz, megkülönböztetik a dolgozókat, nagy a kivételezés. Interjún ha valaki nem szimpatikus a sikeres tesztet eldugják, nem lehet megnezni. A fizetés sem a legjobb, sok selejtet gyártanak. A gépek beállítása katasztrófa. Mindig az operátor a hibás. Nem megfelelő a karbantartás..."
bad,"This is a company where good talent goes to die."
bad,From day one team members came in and worked without prior approval. It was pure mayhem. No one tracked attendance. The shift manager only came out to check numbers at the end of the night. It was a horrible chaotic place to work.
bad,"Bad.  Avoid this company"
bad,They talk big like they are fixing things but nothing changes except it gets worse. No appreciation for hard work and they play favorites with people to promote them to higher positions. Area managers are not very nice people.
bad,"You can’t have a life at all, refuse to hire enough employees to cover all work needed done. It’s not what you know but who you know to advance. Stretch people too thin with poor pay"
bad,"The temporary staff conducted most of the work, as they were paid the least.  The plant manager informed the temporary workers that they would not be hired as permanent employees ever.  This was a dead end job."
bad,"Worked in Machining for months, right before it was time to get hired on they moved half of us to assembly which was about 5$ pay cut per hour. If you start out in assembly obviously it wouldn't be too bad, but switching there is no comparison at all."
bad,got hired june 5 for material handler job trained on forklift 4 days then they decided to end my job just like that im totally shocked because i left my permanent job to come work here this company full of doodoo forget borg warner!!!!!!
bad,Horrible management. They seem to only hire the worst people.They work you non-stop and treat you like dirt.I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Full time requirements placed on temp and contract employees without full time compensation or benefit.  No encouragement given for full time achievement. Requires all employees, full time permanent or temp to be completely ""engaged"" with the daily process in spite of no promise for a future with the company.  Apparently an engagement means they intend to ""break up"" at the end of their use for temp and contract employees instead of fulfillment of a ""committed marriage"".  Rules and regulations are invented and amended as necessary to achieve the desires of management are met despite being completely contrary to previous demands placed on employees.  After working in a temp position for 5 years I was unceremoniously escorted off the premises at the end of the workday with no notice, explanation or reason other than my contract was completed.  I was not allowed to even go back to my work area to retrieve my person belongings."
bad,borgwarner est une bonne entrreprise  l esprit est familiale tout le monde s appelle par son prenom le plus difficile pour moi est la climatisation qui asseche les muqueuses le travail n est pas difficile
bad,Great Team work supportive people and fun place to work for every one good people.
bad,"Benefits are great"
bad,"I don’t have anything good to say... and what I’d like to say, there isn’t enough space. I only met some great people there that I still talk to. That’s it."
bad,A typical day at work is met with consistent challenges and new opportunities for improvement. Learned about different process and organizational structure. Teamwork is valued.
bad,"you can go to work and mind your business and still be terminated for reporting staff whom choose to tease and medal folk all day/night long. This is not a place of profession. They throw you around like you are an animal. They want you to work here, here, here and over there. This place is very unorganized. Just because you like being alone and not being bothered with people because they keep up so much drama, they choose not to like you. If you don't gossip, medal folk, lie and keep up drama you are not allowed at BW. If you want your job at BW you have to keep up fuss and be messy. These are the type of folk you are dealing with at BW. A group of people will get together and lie on you when you don't want to do their dirty work. The set-ups and Supervisors are the worlds worst. Only a few people will assist you if you need to learn your job. It all depends on where you work. The SSA line is the worst line there. This is the line where each person starts that is hired. When you try to reach out to HR, they pretend to want to help you but then they will tell the person you report every word you say."
bad,"BorgWarner was once highly regarded as a company which brought product leading products to market. This allowed them to compete on product value than on cost. This strategy, through investing in engineering, brought exceptional growth rates and margins that were the envy of the supplier industry.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. High level managers were brought in from the outside which marginalized engineering and managed the product lines as if they were commodities. In many business units there is no significant new product development. Further in a panicked attempt to leapfrog into the electrification trend they are proceeding with commodity type products with insufficient engineering to make them product leaders. Larger suppliers with significant investments in the electrification revolution have products with significantly better performance and better value. "
bad,If you are not part of upper management friends outside of work you are pushed harder.plus they do bidding for jobs but they pretty much already know who they want for the spot
bad,This is a seven day a week job. some days they will ask you to work 12hr shifts. once you get hired on or if you do then there are better benefits and paid leave time.
bad,"BorgWarner overall is a decent company, go work at the company/manufacturing level and it is a nightmare!"
bad,"Loved running machines, it was 3rd shift. But was in a car accident and they let me go. I was through a temp agency."
bad,"Did people wrong after laying 400 employees off but when started hiring back would not hire people back that had worked so hard for them, but hired new employees that they had to train instead of already experienced employees.."
bad,As long as you are not a middle aged Male you will get treated ok . They lie and all they care about is production. They talk a good game but when it comes down to it you are nothing to them now matter your experience or what you do for the company.  I worked there almost 3 year and couldn't take it any more  .we went through 3 plant managers 3 HR managers. They can't keep good people
bad,"There are three business units on the Ithaca campus. Depending on which building you work in depends on your work load, innovation and bonus. The campus is a union facility (UAW)."
bad,"Not a good place to work, poor management, boss was very mean. Workers were very rude and disrespectful while working, not very good weekly pay, long drive everyday"
bad,"job is full of hateful people, human resources isn't even human, management is unprofessional, the actual work was super easy until everyone realizes you`re a good worker and then you get to do their jobs too. the most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day"
bad,"They demand work output while not supplying the proper supplies or testing devices for quality of product you produce. The supply and demand don't meet the employees needs. There's a set quota for each job which is impossible to reach if you don't have the right size parts or you have a shift change and your equipment is not operating from the previous waiting for maintenance "
bad,"Worked there for 3 years, use to be the best place to work until micro management become their main focus. Lost all views on quality and employees. Only expect bare minimum from 50% of employees. Team leads pick and choose favorites and management sucks."
bad,"Working at Borg Warner was the most frustrating years of my life. The management was poor, the projects were boring and constantly being cancelled, pay was mediocre and what goes for ""innovation"" is just copying what other companies are doing and hoping to do it better. With no chance for advancement and little challenge my career basically stalled. Only people I would recommend for are new grads that can come in get a couple years of experience then split for greener pastures."
bad,"The job was good money for saving, however the people are rude and don't care about you. I was bullied and BorgWarner employed can be very very rude! Especially the older women! They fired me and my friend, we didn't work out because we didn't fit in with the hateful women, I'm glad we didn't fit in with those median woman!"
bad,We worked everyday of the week. Each position was easy but I wasn't able to spend any holidays with my family. The head people talk to you crazy. The point system  is crazy and they tried to end my assignment each time I was about to get a raise.
bad,"management is terrible, double triple even quadrouple handling material because of stupid decisions made by upper management. they expect the impossible to be done with limited resources, space, and people. the list of job duties grow but pay remains the same. i dont see the place running much longer unless new management comes in that has common sense and can fix the mess."
bad,"they do not care about the employees or about safety "
bad,It is a very hot and stressful place to work. Very little team work and bad management. Worked 7 days a week and only 1 weekend off a month IF you were lucky.
bad,"Human Resources could care less about workers. Even if you have pneumonia with a Dr note saying you cannot work and are on a nebulizer, they will not accept that as a excuse and allow the tardys to build up and if you don't have enough days to cover yourself they will send you straight out the door."
bad,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, fácil acesso a todos os departamentos."
bad,I wood not  Consider anyone working there if you’re not up to working 12 hoursAnd some of those 12 hours you have to work mandatory or you would get points or you will get fired if you don’t so yeah if you anyone work there just be careful and watch your back
bad,Assembly line 12 hour shift was very fast paced. Hands hurt and swelled up. Had to sleep in braces. Huge turn over. Rate of pay is very low for the job you do. You work very hard for a low amount of hourly pay. Company misleads you into thinking you will make more money at the start. It takes a year to get a raise and 2 years for top pay.
bad,There are very few nice and understanding people at Borg Warner the work is tedious but a pain swell and management and the benefits are pretty good...
bad,Management needs to be more in touch with its employees. The employee are not treated with the respect they deserve. Management treats employees as if they are disposable everyday.
bad,To many hours to much cheating going on women are free and lose. Drugs in Seneca plant no one cares in management or hr! Ethics are not enforced. Wife works third shift six to seven days a week. Sees our young son maybe 20 mins a day.
bad,I work at borgwarner the staff workers were good but the management and supervisors not fair at all this is one of them places if your face fits your ok if not then there get rid of you or mess you about make you do long hours always watching you on your back i would never work in that enveiroment again you do something wrong there on top of you don't know how to speck to you can't solve problems in a professional manner waste of time not a happy place to work.
bad,Poor morale.  Weak management with an environment that rewarded below average employees and didn't reward above average employees. Pay structure was far below average.
bad,"Lots of overtime. 7 days a week. Pay is good if hired on. A very large company, over 600 employee while I was there. The work itself is not bad."
bad,Productive and works a lot of overtime. Weekends that is .  They also started 12 hour shifts  . I’m now on a newer assembly line that has been there for a year now and it’s been hard to get it going so very soon it’ll be doing lots of overtime to get production going .
bad,Company has crazy guidelines. They expect you to work 24/7. The most enjoyable part about the job is air conditioned and able to work overtime. The management is hard to deal with.
bad,The benefits were terrible.The health insurance had a $5000 maximum payout and we were stuck paying off medical bills for 10 years.
bad,Terrible! Got fired for something that HR didn’t not tell anyone in orientation! I would not recommend if you have a family or other obligations. You never know what days you are working and what hours. It can change from day to day and Borg Warner does not care about work/life balance as they say they do. Terrible management and terrible hr people.
bad,can say wasnt given much chance at borg they i guess were jealous of me didnt give me any chance for advancement told me bs to get rid of me owell there problem
bad,Highly stressful work culture. Working 6-7 days/week with no guarantee of getting holidays off. Couldn’t get approval for vacation time when needed to use it. Upper management always got weekends & holidays off.
bad,good work hours and has overtime if you wanted it.safe work enviroment advancement can be done but job bids only avalible for 72 hours.
bad,This is not a good place to work. The managers are not very professional.
bad,Review parts for first piece inspection. I learned ongoing training as a gage technician. I did not meet mangement as this was a tempoary job. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job as a gage technicain having to find gages to keep them out of production as reqiuired. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to work because I lived close.
bad,"No matter what you did to work hard and fast the management had no respect for any of the temporary workers whatsoever. The people I worked with that were hired were kind and always asked for me in other departments because they KNEW I worked fast and hard but that wasn't enough for the company or management. Pretty sad, but I got along with everyone expect for the people I never met. A conflict of interest no matter what and when they were cutting time in one area of the plant I was moved which I was thankful for so I could keep working but after 60 or 90 days most temps were discarded like yesterdays trash."
bad,"Upper management at Bellwood facility has managed to kill moral and is more worried about making numbers than investing in people and equipment. High turnover with temps on the factory floor that are not the most qualified for most operations. Huge disconnect between mahogany row and what is actually happening on the shop floor. Lot of yes men and women that don't want to tell the king he has no clothes. Currently got a new plant manager, hopefully he turns things around for that plant."
bad,Worked over three years as a Temp. and was told I was going to get hired on but false hope. They don’t want to give you the full time benefits. They like having not to worry about health insurance and company bonus because temps get none of those rewards. Terrible organization
bad,When I first started working there they encouraged promotion from within the company. Eventually it became apparent that the new management turned everything around and stopped advancing employees within the company giving the higher paying positions to outsiders. That brought down the overall morale of the workforce. Making it feel like more of a stagnant work environment. With no advantage of being on the inside of the company.
bad,"Older people watched the youngsters sit on their cans at the easiest jobs while they ruined their backs (literally) in the toughest jobs in the building. When supervisor is confronted the response was "" if I put them on those jobs they won't do anything and it will ruin my numbers'. It was the first time in my life I had to resort to a chiropractor and I am just starting to feel better after a year, and getting out of Borg Warner."
bad,You can have never miss a day put up the best numbers on your shift day end and out and still get laid off the people who run the company dont care about their employees
bad,mucho favoritismo a otras personas  no valoran a los tecnicos
bad,"Walk in 15 minutes early, clock in on time, go to a quick meeting that's worthless, start your cookie-cutter day, take your breaks (too short), clock out, go home, repeat for 13-20 days in a row (if you're lucky), get one day off, then start it all over again.  Management varies between team leads never being seen or micro-managing everything under the sun.  Upper management has NO clue what's happening day-to-day, and doesn't care anything about their employees (who are little more than numbers on a time sheet to them).  You get VERY limited time off, and if you go over that for any reason, you're fired (even seen people fired for extended bereavement after the unexpected death of a child or spouse).  Numbers are everything and people are replaceable."
bad,"Management is lacking. HR has no idea of what they are doing. Favoritism. Unhealthy work environment. Don't care about employees. Assembly line rotates every 2 hours but people were given the same 2 jobs each night during a 12 hour night. The APL's take their job to extreme by micromanaging and writing people up for anything. For example, taking gloves off to scratch their face for a second. Favoritism is rampant. Team leads hanging with associates outside of work and then letting the friends do anything and any job they want. Working at borgwarner is like being back in high school"
bad,"I found Borg Warner's treatment of its temp workers to be quite unfair. There were several temps that had worked there for 3-4 years who had not been converted to BorgWarner employees, which I feel is not in keeping with federal law regarding temp to permanent employees."
bad,"Too many plants and to many employees to addressed. Lack of any meaningful leadership. Benefits are great. Salary is good. No remote working, which is ridiculous."
bad,"Fast pass competitive environment in which I enjoyed the challenge, on the other hand it takes too long to get hired in as BorgWarner and management can be better, also leadership roles and staying in your job description lane can be an issue... everyone the boss but your boss kind of place."
bad,"- változatos"
bad,Projekte werden kurz vor Ende abgebrochen um scheinbar zu sparen. Es fehlt an Interesse der Vorgesetzten an einer geordneten Struktur in der Abteilung.
bad,Es una empresa en donde puedes empezar a aprender con libertad de trabajar en varias áreas a la vez.
bad,Muita eperiencia adquirida e oportunidade de contatos com outros países.
bad,This is the worst High School you will ever attend. They let the people run that place. They talk about one another all day long. The Supervisors there don't even know how the machines run but expect you to make the numbers.
bad,A job where credit wasn't given when credit was due. I learned how to orientate turbo chargers while using Microsoft applications. Working there for a year on second shift really had its down side. Was never able to get anything done around the house before or after work. Looking for a first shift position.
bad,Company stands by the rules and regulations for only certain employees. Others get to do whatever they want break as  many rules as they want with very little discipline. As for me I was fired for missing time to be in the hospital with my fiance due to a high risk pregnancy. I was denied FMLA because we weren't officially married. Borg Warner did not care about this all they were concerned with was I wasn't at work and I was essentially fired for choosing to be with my family in a time of need rather than at work.
bad,"Good People, dedicated."
bad,"Quality control can be mundane.  I needed a job and it fit the first shift schedule.  I learned a lot about quality control working there, yet the pay and environment was a bit of an challenge."
bad,Nice place to work with good people that strive to achieve company goals. The relationships built are strong and the help foster a community. It is a good place in terms of pay and benefits.
bad,Most of the floor associates wee good to work with.  Management and the HR department were the downfall of the materials department.  most days were pretty good. the hardest part about working there day to day is wondering how the management staff was going to get someone in trouble.
bad,Enjoyed the type of business company was formed to develop. Unfortunately business didn't fit with the desires of the parent company
bad,"Great co-workers, team environment.  Overkill of VP's and upper management micro managing and who do not understand what their worker bees exactly do."
bad,"The job is easy, its good money and good benifits. By all means i would work here again. The only part you have to watch out for here is that they are all about favoritism. And if you arent good with the older people that work there. They will make up reasons to get you fired and will treat you like a pos till you quit. But if you can get on thier good side you will have it made in there."
bad,"Management at Borg could use some improvement. I believe coaching sessions & extra training experience would improve that company a lot. The potential is there, knowledge is not."
bad,"La empresa a muy buena en cuanto oportunidades para crecer profesionalmente."
bad,there is zero organization at this company. there is no team aspect. upper management would sell their grandmothers for a dollar.keyword is reactive.
good,"The employees at Borg Warner, are really good people. There are probably 4 managers (plant manager included), actually care about the people & the experience they have with the company. Most of the APL’s will quickly let you know that you are ALWAYS replaceable & "
good,"Work third shift not the best for me, was hard to get used to. The management is ok but they could care more about the employees then they do. At work I assembled part for different car companies. We worked to reach a certain production goal, some are reasonable some are far fetched, but the most of them are easy to achieve if you go to work and do your job."
good,"The typical day is filled with knee jerk reactions, high levels of stress and constantly shifting goals. If you can handle it here any future job should be a easy."
good,"BorgWarner like most other businesses is just that; a business. They focus on the money. Most people are there just to get a check. There are some employees, like myself that actually want to work and succeed in what they do but it is challenging especially when you aren’t given the opportunity or you are thrown into a group where you are pulling your weight and the weight of everyone around you. It can be stressful but the last thing you’ll want to do is complain because then you may not have a job at all."
good,"I ended up being a permanent employee after 5 years of being a temp at 12 dollars an hour . Previous to work at Borg I had supervising experience and the company rule is the best qualified get the job regarless of your senority ,but even with señority Or experience ther is people that are less qualify bidding for jobs getting them because of the old buddy system even though HR might say the opposite. It looks like it would be a good place to work but is not if you add the time it takes for you to became permanent, where you could earn 14 an hour with benifits somewhere else. Mandatory overtime is ok if you like being notify 2 or even 1 day before you mandatory work day wich are usually on a weekend. The work it self is not bad, standards and procedures are good quality  , the plant where i worked is clean and climate control, management spend lots of money keeping it nice and clean. Dont be tricked there is better ways to make more money."
good,"I worked 3rd and by about 1 each morning some machine was broke or either the line was stopped and no management to be found, the hardest part was meeting your numbers when at least 3 different machines are going out more than twice a night, but when we did meet numbers it was a great night that would go smooth."
good,i found that borg warner was a company that did not offer a good opertunaty for permant work as i felt that i was used just to acheave the warehouse managers targits. and once he and acheaved them i was finnised with some lame exscusse
good,decent place to work. no opportunities for advancement and its a very dry place to work for younger people. its very repetitive and nothing never changes as far as your work routine goes.
good,I was told that everyone that is hired by BorgWarner is a temporay employee with no benefits. I can not work that way. I have bills that have to be paid. And that consist of a 40 hour week. But I would like to know that my job means something to more people than me.
good,not a great place to work but not the worst. They'll keep you on as a temp for as long as they can. really its just a pay check nothing more. There's only second shift positions ever open and the waiting list is endless.
good,Da fehlt die arbeitsklima. Da wird nach 2 jahren gekündikt
good,this is good job if you dont want more than money and you dont look for ways to develop yourself. The staff is not helpful at all when you want to make progress and try to develop even you have skills.
good,"HTI is a temp-service, so it is ok.  One thing that was a little rough would be locating the Human Services department if they were not on-site during the time an employee was there."
good,the people are great but the work is hard. its hard to get trained and get hired on they have favorites. its horrible to feel like your always getting talked about.
good,A typical work day was ten hours long. Never worked with better co-workers. Management made mid-management changes moving the key people that communicated with me about was needed. The new people did not communicate. When two people left I was expected to do more with no additional help. Was not given access to everything but expected to do what was needed. Harsh talk but nothing in writing. No one tried to help with issues just laid in my responsibility pile. If you are good at making people communicate with you and enjoy great co-workers this would be a good company at this location to work for. HR is a great support but management over rules what everyone thinks is fair. Best thing about job co-workers! Lot of work so you stay very busy however getting help is slow and often is held out as a way to make things better but they seem to want you to do more and more not help. Some managers have no idea what all a position is doing to keep everything flowing.
good,"Inventory, raw and finished goods. I set up production schedules, assigned people what was to be done for the shift. moved material, I did time study's every hour to make sure we were hitting production goals .I was also quality control, if material was bad. I had to reject and DMR the material. I had to work hand in hand with maintenance, to make sure production standards were still met. I had pass down between shifts written and verbal to inform company what was done and what had to be done. Management didn't always help employees, with everyday problems, I felt they just thought they would just go away., The hours were a 15 hour day. and were very long. I liked all the people I worked with. people tried to do the best for the company but were not appreciated for what they did. They made people who work hard work harder and not discipline workers who just were there to get a pay check."
good,"The company overall is good and I think it really depends which business unit you’re a part of. Some have great management and are doing excellent while others are constantly struggling, constantly having management changes, and a low employee retention rate. The company is a bit behind the times on flexibility, WFH, and extra perks."
good,Overworked very little SUPPORT from supervisor that's my review on borg Warner I hope this is helpful for any person looking for employment thanks ...
good,"Its a fun place with lots of good talented group of people,  growth is very hard,  company is influenced by auto industry ups and downs. You will have you change positions if you want to grow."
good,"A shift starts with a morning meeting. You go to the schedule to see what cell you'll be running, as it changes. Do safety checks, calibrate gages, and check the programming of the machines. Run the first piece to see if it meets customer's spec, and if not, make corrections and then continue running to do a check every thirty pieces. While employed at BorgWarner, I gained further knowledge of operating CNC machines and lathes. The workplace environment was unfair at times. Certain employees were given unlimited overtime while others weren't allowed very much. The most difficult part of my job was being overlooked for my accomplishments and upper management taking the sides of team leaders when they were wrong. The best part about my job was my paycheck, time off, my bonus, and the benefits were great."
good,Love the people that work on the floor. Job can be stressful and management does not seem to want to innovate. Company needs to move into the future and use the Data that is out there.
good,"Good company but it can be stressful at times. Depends on your local manager, some are excellent while others are very poor. Higher levels of management are very good though. Benefits are very good. I would work there again."
good,Great company poor supervisors advancement only to preferred employees only they make it a point to let you know who are favored for overtime and advancemet
good,"In a town that doesn't have the largest amount of quality jobs Borg Warner is a descent one. The jobs are pretty easy, all though monotonous, and pay and benefits are pretty good. The problem that BW has is that the management has large holes of incompetence that later tends to get blamed on workers. Incompetence that has lead to a recent loss of contracts"
good,"BorgWarner has a LAGS philology - Local Accountability Global Strength; which is good for the local facility.  As long as the local facility makes their goals, Corporate does not bother them.  This gives the local facility the freedom to plan activities through out the year to keep morale high."
good,"Faltaban instrucciones de trabajo y esquema de desarrollo."
good,A typical day at borg warner was working in a sweat box.  I learned a lot about safety working there as this could be a very dangerous place to work if your not careful.  You were only a number to the management but everything went well as long as you did your job.  My co-workers were all men.  The hardest part of the job was being able to put up with the heat.  The most enjoyable was payday.
good,"A typical work day - I would come in and go to work - we loaded, unloaded, and put up freight all day - very enjoyable place to work"
good,I was actually an employee of HTI staffing the client was Borg Warner manufacturing I spent 2 months as an assembly line worker and then was promoted to quality inspector. There was barely any chance or potential for advancement. Compensation was always minimal.
good,"I  am a currently working as a Material Handler for one of the assembly lines. It's literally a 7 day a week job. "
good,"Bonne convention collective, bon salaire qui va de pair avec un nombre d'heures très important (bon salaire car heure de nuit, heure sup, primes....)."
good,I would deliver materials to the different machine operators and wait for the operators to complete their tasks and totes to take to the dock for staging and shipping.
good,"I've been employed for many years with borg warner.and have seen lots of management come and go .seniority or time of service means nothing anymore.including keeping your job during a layoff.because they will classify certain jobs to be more important than others to keep the ones they want..seniority means nothing.management which are APL or dept managers .have their own secretarries , that do the job they were hired to do. These people are called team leaders..they do not treat people equal.they cater the best jobs to their buddies..you have caused a division amongst your department., and resentment with your team members..( BECAUSE WORK LOAD BALANCE IS NOT SHARED AMONGST EMPLOYEES)soon you will be left with the ones that dont work.becaue its the only alternative you have!!!"
good,"No kids? Go right ahead and sign your life away to BorgWarner if you're desperate enough. 2 days off a month if you're lucky. Poor management and emotional, untrained leaders. Never know for sure your next day off until the end of the shift before."
good,I planned to retire from here. I truly enjoyed myself after learning the different equirements software and components to keep the machines running But once I was laid off. It gave me a chance to look at other jobs available out there. Once I was called back and made aware of being possibly laid off again. I took the job with another company.
good,"General tasks handed to me. Worked very efficiently. To the point, I was finished and needed more work usually every day. Just as an intern, I saw that the company was having struggles with positions and tasks. The led to future ethical decisions that were not okay in a manufacturing company"
good,Good benefits with poor work life balance. Pay is good but morale is low among senior employees. Cant make any plans for days off because you will get forced to work on short notice.
good,"Best benefit package I've seen, hot-line cafeteria with good mix of healthy and tasty choices. Fast-paced. Rapidly changing priorities and long meetings tie up managers and hurt productivity and good communications with their subordinates. Surveys done every few years on how employees feel about working there, but seem to be worded to get only positive responses and little done to improve things.  Reasons for problems on lines collected but not always acted on. Hourly people excellent and want to do good job, but they have to work a lot of OT and weekends constantly because of machine trouble and other problems.  Profit sharing system, but seems to be shrinking . Review system very time-consuming. Peer recognition a good step with small rewards like hats ans shirts for doing especially good job or fixing problems quickly. No suggestion system. Too many meetings. Teamwork encouraged but often not possible due to workloads."
good,job work to life balance is difficult work 7 days and 6 days a lot of the people are nice to work with and you are able to learn a good bit on how machines work
good,Um fábrica com cerca de 200 trabalhadores na altura e processar a faturação para grandes grupos do setor automóvel foi sem dúvida uma grande experiência.
good,"Overall a great place to work, but do not get the recognition that is deserved for the work that we put in. Alot of overtime work required of us that was originally eliminated by a weekend shift, but then they management started using them as a PM team on the weekend. That means we are to cover the weekends again which is a slap in the face."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of 12 hr shifts. Sometimes working in the grueling heat. What I learned and was able to hone was to have a good relationship between myself and my team. By making them feel comfortable helped boost morale. Which resulted in my shift out producing all other shifts on a daily, weekly and monthly basis."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of 4, 2 hour rotations. Each rotation consisted of different stations with different objectives to perform. The variety was great, not doing the same thing for eight hours was great, but the physicality of the work and the pain it caused to my hands was almost overbearing. The managers gave out gloves every week to help as much as possible but when you're constantly moving sharp objects, they only last so long. I did enjoy, however, learning each station and learning how everything works. Once you know it all though, it tends to get a bit monotonous."
good,"1. In this company, i selected as a design engineer, but company keep me in quality department. this was the typical day for me but after five to six days due to my interest and knowledge Management change my  department from quality to NPD."
good,"Fast paced and goal oriented."
good,"nice work enviornment, learned alot of new things to help further my career. Both company and union tend to be misleading leaving you constantly worrrying about your future"
good,Suivi de la productivité et des indicateurs en impliquant les collaborateurs et les services connexes.
good,"A typical day at work is all over the specturm. I have learned a great deal working at BW. Upper management is very supportive to a select number of people, which is frustrating to others who are working to boast their own careers. In general, co-workers are helpful and a joy to work with."
good,"esprit d'équipe, structuré, organisé, relationnel paisible"
good,It’s        decent         money       but employees      are    just       another number   They    could     care    more    for    their     people
good,clean environment to work in. temperature controlled .the hardest part of the  job for me was working 3rd shift after working day shift for the past 20 years .reasonable pay for the work that was asked of the PFH .
good,"Os benefícios são bons como vale transporte, cesta básica, alimentação na empresa mas o plano de carreira precisa melhorar, a gerência também. "
good,"I never knew what the next day would hold. The people were great! The biggest problem was getting management support. When you work in the safety department, people tend to cringe when you walk by."
good,"Pays well and has good benefits, but it does come at a cost.  Very stressful environment.  High customer demand while dealing with frequent mechanical breakdowns."
good,"good place to work but alot of time had to work over way to much and lost time with home life."
good,"not a bad place to work, just do your job and keep your mouth shut. Because under the surface its a shark tank, very political, dosent matter if your good at your job ect...  its all who you know, -if you want a career...or to move up.  Better machine, dept, shift -whatever you gotta kiss, kiss, kiss"
good,I love this job and I'm sure the company is great but the structure leaves much to be desired as acquiring a job is not based on job performance. It is solely based on who you know. Not a company i can see myself being a part of
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar com eles,agradeço a oportunidade que eles me deram."
good,"The organization is very lean and expects a lot out of the people that work there. Many hours including working at home in the evening are expected. Very little, if any opportunities to move up in the organization."
good,I worked through a staffing agency here and had a great experience here. I learned useful skills for an HR professional here.
good,"La empresa Borgwarner creo que es muy buena escuela para la persona que va empezando su carrera, pues ves muchas cosas y el aprendizaje es muy rapido."
good,"The normal day at work would consist of a long twelve hour shitf, short breaks and working in a hot oil toxic area standing running three maybe four machines."
good,"my duties at work were to run press operator, hi lo driver and also quality control."
good,"I would clock in, go to my area team meeting, return to my station and supervise two grinders. I would have to keep count of production and also record measurements of the parts. At the end of my shift, I turn in my production sheet and record how many bad parts I ran that night."
good,Group morale in maintenance is very low and most maintenance technicians are actively searching for new employment. We received little to no support from management. HR changes policy on a daily basis to fit their needs instead of listening to the employees.
good,"Offers a good benefit and compensation package in a nice office with beautiful outdoor surroundings."
good,the job itself wasn't tough but lacked leadership and management was bad depending who all was there. during seasons there would be lack of work and you would usually have to sweep or atleast look busy. they need to work on leadership skills
good,"En vanlig dag i BorgWarner är att man går in till arbetet. Går igenom ett möte i början. Därefter går ut till arbetsplatsen och ut till maskinerna."
good,this is a good place to have a job and all around place to work. I enjoyed most of the jobs I had here and learned a lot about the company and its associated benefits
good,It was a good place to work.  Provided necessary training to help further your career and help the company achieve success.  Management was good but was on the decline.
good,"Empresa dinâmica, boa gerencia, porem sem muitas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"Satisfatório no dia a dia;"
good,"Very fast pace."
good,a very fast and productive place were you work 5 to 7 days depending on how much work gets done but it come extremely go benefits
good,"I never thought I would work at a place that interesting. It seemed like you were putting together modle cars,at times."
good,My shift began with a review of how the machines were running for the prior shift. I worked with experienced coworkers who taught me a great deal about the precision grinders I operated. The best part of my job was working with good coworkers and great running equipment. The hardest part of my job was filling in for other employees in unfamiliar work stations.
good,"El ambiente laboral esta bien, normal, no muy estresado, pero tampoco tan relajado."
good,Stressful physically & mentally. No balance of work & home. If you have no family its a good job for you if you just want to work a lot. Poor management because of high turnover. Unorganized management. Constant training of new staff & operators.
good,"Borg Warner is a very clean environment to work in. The machines are fairly easy to run and the environment is very relaxed. The shifts are long and some jobs require heavy lifting, other than that it is a fine place to work."
good,"The pay and benefits were good, but upper management is disconnected with employees at the ground level. Very poor communication. Changes implemented without taking heed to ground level employees suggestions, thus making processes less efficient and more difficult as time went on."
good,"Your typical day of work depends on what department you're placed in, but generally you will spend time on the floor gathering data and at the desk analyzing it to look for improvement areas."
good,"La resistencia al cambio viene de los gerentes, solo se hace algo cuando vienen los directores."
good,3 bis 4 Schichten habe ich da gearbeitet das wahr nicht  schlecht
good,"Good company to work for - manufacturing / assembly setting. Typical working hours - 8 hour shifts. Three shifts for most areas."
good,It was a good work place some of the people were really good people but there could be some improvements done to make sure the workers are happier to work there.
good,"This job wasn't my best job I had but I learned to stay consistent, because you only had three chances to be late or miss work or you got fired so this job made me a better person."
good,"A typical day at Borg Warner was to enter at 11am, go to a pre work meeting and see what department needed you. It was typically the same department each day. You would go and machine transfer cases that ultimately turned into transmissions. The hardest part of the job was working twelve hours and only getting three small breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere and how easy it was to work with others."
good,"BorgWarner was a very productive plant. You really didn't have any breaks, they would only last a short amount of time. Leaving workers no time to do anything."
good,"Good place to work start off , good people, good management, everyone helps when needed. i learned how to handle and inspection powered metal car parts for different big 3 companies , hardest part of my job dealing with hot heat from the ovens the metal parts came out of."
good,"A typical work day at Borg Warner was hard for because it was first job and I was not use to working on an assembly line. Also, having to complete your section in little time. If you did not finish on time you would back up the line causing everyone else to stop what they were doing. The workplace was in a warehouse type of setting. The hardest part of the job moving fast pace and putting engine parts together."
good,filled in on a temporary basis for someone on leave.  I was not there long enough to make a determination if it was a good place to stay long term or not.
good,They over work you and you will always be underpaid. My co-workers were nice but some refused to do their share of work. The management is incompetent and often blame workers for their mistakes.
good,Taught me the value of teamwork and working towards a common goal on a daily basis. It was good experience to follow my initial field of electronics. Hard work.
good,"BorgWarner / Rheinland - Pfalz / Kirchheimbolanden."
good,"I loved this position."
good,Right now the company is going through shifting into a Lean mindset.  It can be chaotic at times. The parts washers get pretty nasty at times with bacteria build up.  Plus side there are big bonuses and a new cafeteria. 8 hour shifts except for weekend shifts.  Pay rate is on par with facilities in Anderson and Greenville.
good,"les travaux sont répétitif. Dans l'entreprise, on fait le montage de systems de transmission automobile"
good,"This position started out fantastic being the Wellness Director and Medical Department Administrator/HR Administrator until my supervisor left for greener pastures then everything changed.  I did enjoy claims processing, and the health care seminars we held, working with the nurse and physician and scheduling appointments for employees for yearly physicals and sick visits.  When employees started to get laid off, it was scarey, especially when administrators were told to leave...this company lost a lot of good people to save a buck."
good,"Venho atuando em todo o controle processo, como CEP e FIRP e manutenção preventiva de maquinas. E um grande conhecimento de processo tecnico de manufatura e remanufatura na area de reman. Parceiros de trabalho com boas perfomances de trabalho e conhecimentos tecnicos, e otimas pessoas de se trabalhar. Areas de parte eletricas são as de dificiu trabalho para minha pessoa, pois ja que sou de nivel tecnico em mecanica. E de agradavel area de manutencao e processo."
good,"Nachdem ich einige Tage angelernt wurde, bin ich im Unternehmen hauptsächlich in der Qualitäts-Endkontrolle tätig. Da ich hierzu meist über die ganze Arbeitszeit hinweg mit der intensiven Sichtkontrolle und Nacharbeit von gefertigten Bauteilen beschäftigt bin, ist die Arbeit meist sehr schnell monoton. Die Zusammenarbeit mit eingen Mitarbeiten ist teilweise schwierig, da sie eher Quantitätsdenken statt Qualitätsbewusstsein an den Tag legen. "
good,It would help if management would hold people accountable and follow through with there decisions. I enjoy the freedom to be creative without someone hovering over me.
good,"Very well structured and regimented days. Good instruction for job specification. Management on the lowest sector need to be addressed. I did not know or interact with the CO."
good,Everyday was a good day when I would go in. I was always doing different and exciting things. So it was never a boring day at Borgwarner
good,"•	Evaluated existing production system and implemented kaizens for continuous improvement."
good,"Nice place to work if you are running a machine, assembly line is harder. But, the people are great."
good,"In 2000, they had generous severance benefits. Didn't really spend much time with BWA as they acquired the company I was working for at the time."
good,"A typical day involved fast pace drive to maintain efficient operations on the production floor."
good,"3-4 Schichtbetrieb"
good,Worked as a temp years ago. Able to move up and gain experience with pay raises along the way. Easy going culture. Nice people.
good,"The start time is at 6:00 am, each day was filled with different challenges and opportunities for advancing in knowledge of different controls."

good,Irish site has emerged from German ownership to large US corporate takeover with interesting times ahead.
good,good company with good people learn alot about techniques & how to work in fast track production systems
good,"When I worked at BorgWarner, there were very few people I was able to trust. I am not a fan of having to tip toe around people and I especially do not like working with people that you cannot trust. I had some bad experiences there with backstabbing. The job itself was fine and I had no problems there, just a strange group of people."
good,Ambiente de trabalho toxico consumido por problemas pessoais e desorganização da gerencia
good,"The job is very easy. Everybody works together. It was very exciting, there’s always something different to do, whether you’re switching work areas, or filling in for someone else."
good,I thought we had great benefits but stress level was high  on a high production level. We were fussed at a lot  sometimes felt like we couldn't do enough to please supervisors and upper management. They wouldn't listen to operator concerns    Worked a lot of overtime  we were on a point system I didn't like this. Even if you were sick you still got a point for being out even if you went to doctor even if you were in hospital. They seemed as if all they cared about was parts and production at end of day and the heck with you. This is making me mad so I prefer to stop   That's why I retired I couldn't get a day off even if I had vacation days left with a week in advance notice this could go on and on but I really don't care to
good,"I enjoy working at borg, its a fast pace environment. I was a temp operator then worked my way to a set up tech."

good,"Un buon posto in cui lavorare."
good,"a typical day @ work was always a adventure."
good,"Você consegue aprender diversos tipos de ferramenta voltados a melhoria e produção, como toda empresa você tem as pessoas boas e ruins de lidar, porém é necessário fazer o possível para saber lidar com os mais variados perfis de personalidade evitando brigas e discussões.Em questão de gerencia tem se muito a melhorar na minha opinião, principalmente no quesito quem envolve a relação com funcionários de uma ordem abaixo, também poderia ser melhor na questão de oportunidades de promoção e investimento no crescimento dos funcionários."
good,"Gostei muito de ter atuado na BorgWarner,  bons colegas de trabalho, ambiente agradável e cresci muito profissionalmente atuando nessa empresa."
good,Na Borg aprendi a lidar com a pressão no trabalho e a desempenhar varias funções ao mesmo tempo.
good,"Machine Operating Engineer."

good,I enjoyed my temporary position at this company. The staff was friendly and very helpful
good,"Its alright to work in this company but they demand very hard work from few employees."
good,"A productive company in the automotive transmission field and has been in business since 1958. I have learned a lot from working at BorgWarner fixing machines, supervising a team, and running production. The training process is fair, the management is great, the culture is good making it a great place to work at."
good,It is a steady paced work place. I build parts for automotive companies on the graveyard shift. They are making some positive changes but it needs more work. Some Team Leaders are biased and I think they need more leadership training classes. Working the graveyard shift being away from my husband since we are newlyweds. The amazing co-workers I work with.
good,"Great team atmosphere, average work day consist of 10-12 hrs day at least 6 days a week.  NO room for advancement / moving up within the company. Company coming off couple rough years but seems like mgmt change focus to improve things"
good,"BorgWarner has a very good work culture, benefits, and decent salaries but also lacks options for mobility.  If you get pigeonholed in the wrong job you could be stuck doing it for a long time with minimal pay increases."
good,It's a good place to work if that is what you want to do with the rest of your life but if you actually want to get somewhere this can be a hard place to grow.
good,"friendly and fun atmosphere, family oriented employees, hours were long at first but evened out after a few months. supervisors were not over your shoulders watching you work."
good,I have not been employed here long enough to form an opinion. So far management is understanding and fair. Free insurance and great wages. Extremely big on safety.
good,this was my first job coming out of high school so i dived in head first. i learned alot about the construction business. my teacher also was a master at his craft.
good,The only hiring is done after an employee starts as a temp there.  Depends on the economy on how long you work as a temp before getting hired in.  Office positions have been eliminated after an employee retires instead of hiring a replacement.  Their duties were redistributed to current employees.
good,Must make production or 8 hours can turn in to 12hours unexpected. Nothing hard about the job besides working long hours and 7 days a week. Great place
good,"I have very busy days in the office, working in and leading  cross functional teams. 1-2 business trips per month, to customer or other BWTS facility. I riport to Sales Manager monthly and to Plant Manager and high level management: President-VP-Director on quarterly. "
good,"Borg-Warner was the best company i have ever worked for where machining is concerned. They have a great training program, even with people who have no experience. The people who work for Borg-Warner are some of the best i have ever met."
good,"Bonne ambiance au sein de la logistique."
good,fun environment to work in all the supervisors are really nice and caring they make all kinds of car parts for different cars and air planes very productivity place to work in.
good,"The volume of work required is increasing even though the staff is decreasing. There are a lot of good people in management that are working 10+ hours most days."
good,i dont know what to put for a review for Borg Warner. I guess it was a great place to work. You had great people around you. the only problem was that the work was repetitive.
good,"Pros: The work is not hard for the pay that you receive."
good,usine parfaite bone ekipe fermeture ppour cause de delocalisation
good,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of parts sometimes hot but great co workers, but this is expected of a big company."
good,The work is easy but the hours are long and u may not get a day off. Sometimes we may have to work over  our shift or come in early to a nother shift to help out that shift and then still work a whole shift.
good,The comapany overall is  Okay to work for.   Mangement  lets you do your job without Micromanaging your work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers  and prodcution staff.
good,"Very good place to learn operator skills. Went in a beginner with no experience, came out a pro ready to go ahead and take on other employment assignments and tasks head on. Unfortunately the employees have no life outside of work so they tend to cause much drama within the company."
good,"average at best, have huddle with team, schedule production according to customer needs"
good,"I've been with Borg since 2012. Work-life balance has improved majorly since then but not for all employees. Many employees have been frustrated for so long with Borg..they no longer care. Upper management couldn't care less about the backbone (the hard working employees) of the company! The opportunity to advance is scarce unless you have friends in high places. It really could be a great place to work if upper management would open their eyes. Pay is good, benefits are great. Leave your morals and values at the door, do your job, go home and get paid. There's no sense in caring about this company and the harder you work, the harder they'll work you! Don't waste your time trying to make a good impression by working hard thinking you'll have a chance to advance. The potential to be a great company is definitely there..but is squashed by negligence!"
good,This is an overall good company to work for. Plently of overtime which is optional if you work a swing shift. Pay is good for the area. Be willing to work holidays
good,The work was real easy it was a okay job. I learned how to build transmission parts for cars. The Management was horrible everybody showed favorites in co-workers. It wasn't nothing hard about the job just working 7 days a week with 2 boys that go to school an seeing them once a day. The thing i like about it most i was making money providing or my family.
good,I would punch in check the board for my assignment report to my job and start my press and run it. The management was ok my co-workers were great and the hardest part of the job was working for 7 days for almost 2 years straight. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting payed every week.
good,"It was so close for me to work there. The drive was awesome, the concepts were easy to grasp. The only difficult thing is to get hired on from a temporary service to a full time employee."
good,"nada a dizer, boa cooperação entre colegas e patrões. aprende a lidar com clientes e fornecedores."
good,"A good working environment,usual routine everyday,learned how the machine work properly and diagnose some machine problems.Management is not transparent enough.Good working colleagues.Job is easy."
good,Um dia de trabalho nesta empresa era bom.
good,BorgWarner Water Valley is a great place to work and make friends. But one of the most stressful places you will ever work because of the hours and management.
good,"Borgwarner has great benefits and pretty decent pay. However,  the management isnt so great and they really dont care much about their employees.  Work a lot of 7days"
good,"Empresa seria, porem varias mudancas na gestao dificultam avanco"
good,"Excellent place to work ... if only the time was right.  I was cut from my contract with zero notice (budget cuts).  What is really frustrating is that only 2 weeks before was told I was doing great work and getting extended into the next year.  "
good,"Great learning opportunity. Friendly work environment. The only thing is, is they had the temps training new hires that were making double the money and most temps did not get hired on. Sometimes they know you are there 5 mins early or more waiting to clock in but then whilst in line to clock in if you clock in one min late the systems deducts five mins and you are punished and even let go for tardiness."
good,"1)A day at work we have to stay more hours waiting for the next shift as they were in late,"
good,"During my time at BorgWarner I was given alot of responsibilities right fromt the get go. Even as an intern I had many duties mimicking a full time employee and even that of my manager. It was stressful at first, but the ""sink or swim"" process allowed me to learn very quickly and I am confident that I have learned more in the two years there than I would in five years at any company. Especially overseeing two facilities, as a safety professional it was important to take in as much learning experiences as I could and it definitely paid off in the long run."
good,"Collègues très ouverts et efficaces."
good,Borg Warner was flexible to learn different and new skills and tasks.
good,"A Borg Warner (antiga Wahler) sempre honrou os compromissos assumidos com seus funcionários, bem  como proporcionou treinamentos para o desempenho das competências requeridas, e as oportunidades que sugiram ao longo do tempo sempre decorreram da situação do mercado."

good,Good people. Good friends and family. Just never gonna be able to make it to 1st shift and afraid of slowdowns every year where threatened with layoffs and moved to other shifts.
good,I was only there a year for a contract position. I hoped there was an opportunity for an offer to stay. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with. And I gained some of my experience by working there. I was still attending school at the time.
good,"They want you to do more and more work with less pay. we are constantly doing other peoples jobs and they get no punishment for not doing it, while were held accountable for ours."
good,"Das arbeiten mit CNC gesteuerten Dreh- Fräsmaschinen und Bearbeitungszentrum."
good,"Offered a unique opportunity to see products go from raw materials to finished products.  Decent place to work, good company culture, hard working employees."
good,People are very nice and understanding. As a student I didnt have much work coming my way and I didnt see my knowledge or understanding advancing sufficiently enough to stay at the position.

good,"Worked 8-4:30 usually with a 30 minute lunch. I learned a lot about the transmission chain industry and problem solving in a mechanical environment. The management I had was very efficient, they let you grow at your pace while helping you to learn more. My co-workers were friendly and always open to answer questions I had or my ideas. The hardest part of my job was meeting deadlines because of a wait for outside parts that were needed or when other people weren't available for some reason. However, the job as a whole was pretty enjoyable, I liked my time there and definitely would consider going back."
good,"It was a good place to work.  Enjoyed working with the members of a diverse team.  Grateful for the time I spent there, unfortunately the plant closed."

good,"En arbetsplats med väldigt bra, rolig personal och kollegor. Dock väldigt lite chanser att ta sig någonvart."
good,"Pros: great pay, good hours, lower management is awesome, focused on safety and quality"
good,"I was a temp. worker at Borg Warner on the assembly line. If you can handle lots of leaning over to lift and bending over, you will do fine. It's a very fast paced and competitive workplace especially if you are a temp. Getting hired on full time is very hard to do and job openings for those positions don't open up often. The management seems to care about their employees, but they also have to get out as many parts a day as possible, so they can be a bit hard on you at times. The money for full timers is good, but not so great for temps."
good,The typical work days consisted of making transmission bands. The culture was good and they appreciated the employees. I was trained on the equipment and safety was a top priority.
good,Borg is a great place to work if you like being away from home. Alot of hours spent but alot of money to be made. Good health benefits as well. Hours is the major complaint from most of the employees.
good,"Being Operations Manager was difficult due to the amount of responsibility.  However, the interactions with the employees and clients was very rewarding."
good,Borg Warner is easy to learn. It's also can be stressful if you have to pick up someone else slack. I work through temporary but they don't give you the opportunity to better yourself
good,Good place to work. Management needs additional training for interpersonal skills. Coworkers provide a true family style atmosphere. Pay is below average. Other benefits exceed previous positions.
good,Not a bad place to work. Very fast paced production work. Good pay. Lots of overtime. Good insurance and benefits. 10 days paid vacation and 3 paid occurrences.
good,"I made a mistake and substituted action with thought..  Second mistake was returning to day shift. and not staying in the bearing department.  I was under the assumption that we were brother., to gather fighting for a common cause.  That wasn`t the case. A work day was a pleasure. Get instruction and carry them out.  Write work orders of problems in the department. Assist personal with any problem that arise."
good,It was an amazing place.  Over a mile long with thousands of people who worked there.  It has been closed for a long time.  I was laid off with 2500 others.
good,"La empresa es muy buena, salvo quien la maneja falta de capacitación hacia su personal y mala organización para turnos y transporte, mi opinión personal en el departamento en donde labore, pero agradecido con la empresa."
good,Very knowledgeable work environment and I learnt a lot while I was interning with the test engineering team. I work there for one semester and worked with very professional engineering team
good,"A typical day of work is combined with travel, meetings and working with people from a variety of Manufacturing Plant types to either launch new components or resolve quality concerns. I have learned that the greates resource is people. Organization agility (getting things done when you have responsibility with not authority) is vital for success. The hardest part of the job is 75% travel.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a variety of people from differenct technical backgrounds....Semi-conductors to bearings to Electronic Control Units."
good,i ran cnc presses and when the company closed I got to go get a education in CNC programming

good,Overall a great place to work. Satisfactory pay. Great benefits. Ample paid holiday time.Colaberative atmosphere where suggestion and ideas were considered.
good,"BorgWarner is a great place to work in terms of the work that i did as a manufacturing engineer.  I loved what i did and i enjoyed the people i worked with. Management on the other hand sometimes went into directions that i couldn't logically understand. They are all about making numbers and less about the quality of work. You will often find yourself having to put out one fire to rush to the next (problems, not actual fires...). I believe that if they would focus on developing an effective environment instead of numbers than this would be a less stressful place to work and the management would make more sense to me."
good,Daily use of AS400 for purchasing product for prototype builds. Maintaining supplier shipments. Maintaining spreadsheets for incoming and exporting products.
good,BorgWarner was my first maintenance technician job out of college. I have learned a tremendous amount by simply experiencing day to day maintenance work. I could say that I learned more on the job than in school. I feel like ive reached my limit here and would like to expand my knowledge in this field and I dont believe that I could achieve that ultimate goal at BorgWarner.
good,"fazer controle visual de peças essa é a rotina diaria , aprendizado algumas medições, direção e gerência falta um pouco de atitude em relação a ser mais rigorosos  em situações complicadas com colaboradores , a empresa  tem uma boa cultura, principios e valores ótimos ,mas tem uma certa dificuldade de por em prática , a parte mais dificil é organizaçao e cronograma de trabalho , falta planejamento. A ´parte mais agradavel honra seus compromissos."
good,"BorgWarner is a fine place to work if you want to settle down until retirement. They provide good compensation, but there is little chance for advancement."

good,Fun place to work at.   Strong interaction with many cultures.   Learned to utilize extensive customer service.    Co-workers were good to work with.   Hardest part of the job was losing contracts due to employees failure to complete job assignments.
good,I enjoyed working here.The people were helpful and management listened.I was able to work as much OT as i wanted. I learned alot about the automotive business.
good,The biggest issue during my time there was machine up time. There was a short lived shift to a 24/7 operation with ABCD shifts that was intended to drive production but wasn't successful due to issues with keeping the machines up and running. The management left a lot to be desired as far as organization and communication are concerned. The people are pretty nice.
good,"Foi a primeira empresa na qual eu trabalhei, uma grande escola onde adquiri experiencias, coloquei em pratica a teoria aprendida no SENAI e desenvolvi de acordo com as oportunidades de treinamentos oferecidos pela empresa."
good,A typical days work included numerous duties. what I learned from  this was how to multi-task in an efficient manner. Management were very accommodating with their scheduling and showed appreciation for good job performance. I had no problems with co-workers as long as they showed up for work and did their job. The hardest part of this job was keeping up incoming truck traffic and data input.
good,"Trabalho dinâmico e muita evidência."
good,"If you dont have a family. Hard to coordinate the shifts with family life.  Go in, do your job, get paid well, go home.  "
good,.BorgWarner is a growing automotive company where I learned quality skills as a press operator and quality inspector.
good,"Borg Warner offers a great pay rate, but it is difficult to maintain a rewarding life outside of work on second or third shift."
good,"Excellent place to work. Great pay and benefits. Health insurance is 100% company paid for employees and family. Employees are very knowledgeable and helpful and very well managed."
good,This is a great job in terms of pay and benefits. My only issue with my employment here is depending on others to do their jobs so I can continue forward with my own.  Pulling multiple members jobs weight while at the same time completing my task given to me is overwhelming on a day to day basis.  It comes with the position and it’s my only complaint towards this great company.
good,"Empresa com bom ambiente de trabalho "
good,"O trabalho em si é muito bom, bastante dinâmico e com muita variedade de operações e máquinas."
good,This job is a great job to have for anyone who needs a steady job getting paid weekly. The work is easy to comprehend. The hardest part about work is staying awake.

good,great opportunity for anyone that's trying to make a career working with a great company that has wonderful job security.
good,I have learned how to handle myself on a corporate level. It is a nice company but their wages are not competitve and placement is difficult including advancement. Lower levels have more issues hiring within.

good,I am happy working here and would stay if I was able. I am only able to receive temporary employment - no benefits. If I was able to get a full time permanent spot I would stay here. It simply is not possible until at least 2021.
good,Es un buen lugar para aprender despues de haber teminado la carrera.
good,The benefits and 401k plan are great and there is room for moving up. Some departments have poor management and it’s hard to get them seen as they are when there isn’t many that want there job.  Weekend shifts are rough on the family life. Other than that I love it at Borg Warner.

good,"Fairly easy work, coworkers are easy to get along with. Relaxed and fairly clean work environment, indoors out of the weather. Management is fair as possible and will work with you as much as possible."
good,"Worker productivity has been growing by about 2% annually since WWII. But if staffers aren’t equipped with competitive tech, your team will fall behind the competition. I love it when team members keep me informed of new performance-enhancing options. And performance reviews are the perfect way to contextualize a conversation about the benefits of adopting new tools and methods."
good,"Great place to work with many fantastic people. Salary is lower than market, but benefits make up for it. Extensive opportunities to learn new skills or polish existing ones."
good,It is a good place to work but you have to be willing to work and learn a lot of things. The pace can be fast and sometimes slow. Most everyone is helpful if you ask for it. The job didn't fully work out for me but it is a great place in all.

Yes, at times there were some pretty hard spots to work through, but nothing was expected which couldn't be accomplished. They set reasonable goals and expected you to perform.Management was very personable and easy to work with. Pay, however, was not all that good. That is the ONLY reason I left."

good,"Era responsável pelo setor Almoxarifado de Ferramentas no meu horário, cadastrava itens no sistema, tomava decisões: recebia orçamentos e solicitava a compra de materiais, analisava itens p/ consertar e em fim de vida útil, etc. Realizava os trabalhos de preparação de ferramentas conf. a demanda da produção. Havia dias tranquilos c/ pouco trabalho nesta tarefa onde aproveitava o tempo livre p/ desenvolver e implementar projetos. No entanto havia também dias bem corridos, posso dizer que essa era a parte mais difícil do trabalho, as urgências na produção, onde precisavam ser atendidas no menor tempo possível, p/ não deixar a maq. parada. Isso nos testava enquanto profissionais e após o atendimento, gerava a satisfação de dever cumprido e até mesmo risos entre os colegas em algumas situações como por exemplo atendendo duas urgências ao mesmo tempo.  "

Assim como todas as empresas existem algo que discordemos,de colegas ou de gerência mas no geral a Borg Warner foi uma excelente empresa que trabalhei e se algum dia tiver oportunidade  de colaborar novamente."
good,I typically ran the automation machines. I made sure the bins were filled and refilled any manual things such as the resistors or bobbins. I learned a lot about running automated machinery and making minor repairs. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and we worked as a team. Hardest part of the job was trying to change from one part to another part at a moments notice.
good,It is a great environment to work in. Just enjoy working there.
good,This company is always working for the employees and their product
good,"Being a machine operator at Borg Warner Automotive gave me the chance to work on machines and to do things that were completely foreign to me. I got my start with the company as a temp with no manufacturing experience at all. It was a ruff begining, but the training I received was excellent! Our hard work and dedication allowed me to become a great team member and duplicate what I was I taught."

good,I enjoyed my time here people were good management  took care of employees alot of overtime while I was there but I have heard it has improved ..... ...
good,People are engaged all day. VCT is what is learned and many disciplines relating to this product. Limited engagement with management is needed. Workplace culture simple self directed. Hardest part is keeping up with customer demands and time constraints.Enjoyable part of the job is freedom of opinion.
good,Its a fast pace environment with lots of opportunities for individual growth and learning if the person is willing. Benefits are second to none.  Wages could be higher.

good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar na Borg Warner, minha saída dela foi a mudança de estado mesmo."

good,Loved working at BorgWarner I miss old coworkers and some facilitators. Most of the people there was friendly and when enjoyed the time there making the best out of our job. The company events was always a blast including see some of the HR personnel have a good time for a change.
good,"my typcal day at work would be to report to the cantine every morning for our morning meeting, stretch and then get to work. I would come in to work and immediately check the pinions to make sure they were in spec and right for the customer, make all of my checks and continue down the line. The other employees were joyful and just as happy as i was to be moving up, especially in an automotive industry. I would say that the hardest part of my job was when before i was moved up I had to inspect guage and pallitize transmission cases being made by 10 different mazak machines which produced 60 parts altogether within 15-20 minutes. The most enjoyable part of my job was being noticed for my hard work, I love to be acknowledged for my efforts."
good,"Minha primeira grande empresa em que trabalhei durante 6 anos , de muita aprendizagem sobre equipe e liderança e convivência muito trabalho ! Gerencia uma das melhores que trabalhei deixando todos muito a par de todos os assuntos da empresa , e dando condições familiares fora da empresa. Consegui muitos nessa empresa , uma empresa bem familiar com grandes pretensões e objetivos. A parte mais difícil éra a hora da refeição ,pois tínhamos apenas meia hora de intervalo,éra comer e voltar trabalhar. A hora mais agradável do trabalho éra quando quando  chegava o final do expediente."
good,Once you learn the job the work is easy and the environment is laid back. You run different machines every week. You can always bid on different jobs 8n different areas.
good,Siempre se va a trabajar a Borgwarner con ganas y animo.

good,"My biggest complaint about the company was the lull time in between projects. The company is safety oriented, which is a constraining factor at times, they look out for the welfare of the employees as long as it fits their model of what is good for the employee."
good,Good Company to work for but takes to long to tramzitiom from temp to perm. Have seen tempz get turned over after 7 years of service. Thats too long of a eait for a company to evaluate you.
good,Great benefits and incentive program for healthier living. The rapid growth of the company is causing confusion and mismanagement. Lack of job descriptions and expectations for employees. Expectations vary by shift and supervisor which leads to conflict and confusion. No real clear rules set for any employee. Advancement is possible but the use of networking throughout the company plays a more important role rather than job performance. Wages are based on time in position rather than job skill. There is an effort to change some of the processes and practices but they are slow going.
good,"La mejor empresa que me a tocado trabajar hasta el dia de hoy, de preocupa mucho por la seguridad de sus trabajadores, tambien es una empresa que desarrolla a sus trabajadores otorgandoles cursos y capacitaciones para motivar a su personal al crecimiento."
good,Worked lots of overtime. But the money is worth it. Job isnt too bad. Just very repetitive. Easy job. plenty of overtime for assembly workers. Staff was really nice.
good,"This company trained me in CNC handling and operations, assembly line production and mill operations. I started the job earning $12.50/hr (because of prior knowledge) and soon moved up to $12.75/hr because of productivity in two weeks.  This job helped me realize my true work ethic, 12/h shifts, seven days a week, no holidays. It was rewarding."
good,Was a great place to work as a contract consultant. Very friendly culture and all employees that I worked with were helpful. Would welcome the opportunity to do contract work for them again.
good,"Great place to work.  Great benefits, Growing company.  Organization is flat so growth upward can be somewhat limited.  Associates that work there have a great attitude."

good,Confront interesting challenges daily. Hardest part is trying to keep up with all the work . Management is not pushy and the team you work with is very hands on.
good,A good collaborative work atmosphere and senior management was on the constant lookout for continuous improvement opportunities and willing to hear from employees

BWA demands the utmost effort from its employees, making it a very challenging yet rewarding place to work."
good,I worked at powdered metal presses making auto parts and placed them in furnaces so that the powdered metal would harden. Necessary checks were always performed to ensure that the parts were acceptable before they were shipped out of facility.
good,learned a lot of things working there and theres always room to advance.
good,Best group of people to work with. Treats all employees the same no matter what their position is.
good,"I was a temporary employee there for over a year. Not much of a chance advancing in the company. People were there for 40 and 50 years, so it was hard to get hired in unless a position was posted and no one in the company wanted it, then a temp could bid on it, maybe."
good,"The job was not bad, I learned a lot during the three years i was employed there.I worked on the assembly line operating a hydraulic screwdriver, I also operated a dot-peen machine."

good,Long Hours with plenty of opportunity to learn many different areas
good,I really didn't work at this place long I got sick alot and had some family emergencies that caused me to miss too much work
good,A typical night at work for me is to come in get on the line and go for 100% at all times. My supervisor informs us of what is expected for the week and what we need to do to get to where we need to be as far as getting production out the door safely and in a timely manner. Hardest part of my job is to get people to follow work instructions and to stay within the 5S policy. The thing I enjoy the most is being able to work well with others even though they say I take my job too serious.
good,"This was a union facility. It seemed that the union was protective of poor workers, and encoruaged workers to restrict production to pre-set limits. The work was easy to complete,the hardest part of the job was tolerating poor attitude of union workers."
good,Great work environment. Amazing learning experience. Management is very professional and easy to work for. HR not so helpful. Usually work right hour days and some Saturdays.
good,"BorgWarner is an excellent place to work. BorgWarner is a very ""driven"" Company.  Excellent benefits.  Good annual bonus."

good,Not a bad place to work... layoffs are excessive if not at least 10 years seniority... good benefits and family atmosphere... lots of management but not a bad place to work.
good,BW is a great place to work but there is no room for advancement. NY is expensive to live in and the wages don't add up with the cost of living in NY. Benefits are getting worse by the year but used to be great. Overall it is a great place to work.
good,"Closed"
good,"-Clock in with an employee keycard"
good,Borg Warner was a family to many of it's employees and as many of us have left we are still in touch with other. May employees have been there for 30+ years. The hardest part of the job was getting there.

good,"I tested torque converters and other components. There was a lot of fumes and hot oils to work with and the possibility of being burned or hurt was great. A lot of the parts were in excess of 70 pounds and they had to be lifted by hand. Much larger components use a hoist. Management was great. I never asked for a raise, but slowly worked my way up the salary ladder. Out of any employer I have ever had, Borg Warner Automotive had the best benefits and was the most fairest employer. I'm sorry they closed their doors."
good,I worked alot of 12 hour days and worked 6 days a week.I was trained thru out all departments to fill in or operate all jobs thru out plant.

good,"Empresa con gran salario, buena prevencion de riesgos laborales y con bastantes descansos"
good,"Have worked with several automotive suppliers in metro Detroit. BW is by far the best I've experienced. Every company has some issues so you have to weigh the pro with the cons. BW management makes it a point to keep their employees happy and treat people with respect, not as numbers. A little lacking on career advancement  unless you are in HR or upper management but other than that its a great company with a good future."
good,Strong leadership culture at BW.  BW has a long history in the automotive space and understands how to stay competitive in the future.  Would recommend as a place to work.
good,its a nice place good people people are nice in a good area constantly trying to improve management truly care about employees i feel upper management really listens to front line employees

I learned a great deal regarding commodity strategy, advanced purchasing processes, supplier management, and the importance of cross-functional collaboration.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the culture of BorgWarner.  Everyone is nice and helpful, as we are all working towards the same goals.

I found it challenging to reach them over the phone, however the importance of direct communication outweighed the challenge, resulting in dedicated efforts to manage the supply base."

good,BW is a very fast paced environment that allows someone to excel no matter what career path they may be in.  The challenge with BW is being able to leverage organizational agility as people tend to get siloed and aren't helped to reach their desired career goals if they are performing their current duties very well.

Had to look at parts as they came out of the machine for defects and had to load parts into machine by dumping them into a loader.

good,Tanto a Ticket como a Carlo Erba (Montedison Farmacêutica) foram empresas excelentes por onde passei. Na verdade saí da Montedison Farmacêutica ( ex-Carlo Erba) porque a empesa inteira se mudou para Duque de Caxias no Rio de Janeiro e saí da Ticket somente por necessidade no momento de ter um salário maior porque minha família aumentou naquele ano e a estrutura da Ticket não permitia aumentos salariais na época.

good,A typical day at work would start at 7:00 am with a meeting talking about how many products were made and how much we needed to reach our goal. Three breaks a day were amazing! Sometimes the machines would break down for an hour or less or more if they broke down we wouldn't have anything to do. We would usually reach our goal of finished parts if the machines wouldn't break down. Co- workers and managers were wonderful to work with the most hardest part of the job would be just waiting for the machines to get fixed so we could work again. The most enjoyable part was socializing with my co workers.
