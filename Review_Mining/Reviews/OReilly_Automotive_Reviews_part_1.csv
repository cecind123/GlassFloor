rating,review
bad,While I worked my fellow employees watched videos and played on their phones.  The store manager spent his time making fun of whoever wasn't present.  I finally have up when I realized that the more effort I made the less others see asked to do.
bad,The district manager always hire bad managers I work for oreilly 10 years and went through 14 managers the pay is not good at all they would rather hire outside the company than to promote within.
bad,"Workers are lazy and do absolutely nothing but complain about there job and whine and moan about how they hate there wife and home life. "
bad,Management is rude and unprofessional and they steal from employees. Watch your paychecks and write everything down. These guys are crooks. They will not respect you. You will do all the work. They won't appreciate you at all.
bad,This company wrote me up for missing work less the 2 weeks after my husband passed away. A worthless company too work for. Dont do it unless you want to be treated like garbage by lower management
bad,Supervisor steals and blame it on the employees worst job I’ve ever had. Everyone has an attitude and management are pretty much okay with being robbed.
bad,"Now that the O'Reilly family are not active in the company, it has lost it's focus on what got it and how it got to where it is. Current leaders have forgotten where they came from."
bad,They could do alot better more security better pay and more responsible people hire defetnely better treatment for employees and staff and better quality tools
bad,I started working for the company in 2014 I was ready to work give it my all and advance but People didn't want that they want you to stay and work like a good worker ant and be content with your current situation until they have to move you up.
bad,"Worse place ive ever worked. No help always trying to find ways to screw the help. No upper management , no big family orient no matter what they preach. No holidays off but upper management does."
bad,Had to quit due to harassment from the store manager and other employees. Corporate did not seem to care to address the issue at all. Very unprofessional and emotionally hazardous place of work. Not worth the money. A billion dollar corporation that pays employees $8.00 an hour.
bad,"Running for the hills They make promises that they cannot keep they get upset when you take a day off and make threats"
bad,".. Bad place to work, unless you like starving.................thrown to the wolves........low low pay....no advancement unless your a suck up....insurance is a joke"

bad,This company was horrible I would not recommend it to my worst enemy the hours suck the pay was horrible and the management legit did not know what they were doing making the drivers jobs more complicated than they had to be every day
bad,"This has too be the worst place ever to work! It all starts with the Management Team! The DC Manager doesn't have a clue, Op Managers are just getting a free check, and the Supervisors are just lost! You can move up within the company, if you are an attractive woman...that would be the only way!"
bad,"This is a horrible company to work for. Horrible pay, and horrible job advancement. Absolute waste of 3 years of time. I constantly put up amazing numbers, but was NOT compensated fairly for my efforts."
bad,"Unless your an Assistant, or Store Manager:"
bad,"This is a plantation. They treat people like slaves. They think people are robots and are never supposed to get sick. They don’t give any sick or vacation time for a whole year and if you do get sick and can’t come to work they write you up, even with a doctors note. They are horrible!!!!"
bad,Your hours can change it anytime you never did get back on time for a full lunch you only get 30 minutes for lunch you nobody's happy your day is off can change at any given moment work 13 days off one work one off on work one off on very unprofessional
bad,You work the hours that they make you work they will not work with you on any time off or any requested days off you don't make any money at this company it ultimately shocks to work for O'Reilly Auto parts
bad,"Job sucks "
bad,Upper management does not care about employees -- only about the bottom line. Don't want to listen to reality. Only want you to perform like stores in bigger markets.
bad,"They will find any excuses they can to cover up their mistakes. They choose only the uneducated, teacher pet, and no brain worker to be supervisor. Su"
bad,"Hostile, back stabbing, employees mistreated, very low pay, no respect..."
bad,"Low paying, no promoting or raises, horrible hours, careless management, upperManagement are just ...,  always some drama with employees. Good job for teenagers or retired but just a dead end job. You might get 50% off products."
bad,Truly did me wrong I was a good worker fell sick was disabled for a while and when I tried to go back after human resources told me I was medically cleared  the manager didn't want to hire me due to the fact she didn't like that the customers liked me more than her
bad,"if offered a store.. do your research ask questions..could be asked ..indirectly to work 80 hrs a week for the 35 to 45000 a yr..they try to lure you in ""potential"" . look at thr turn over rate.. its there for a reason.. untill they can be honest and give the store manager the power they need .. the company will always fallow napa"
bad,Very easy work but disorganized management lead to problems with customers and other workers wasn’t paying attention to the matters needed just plain wasn’t caring to fix any situation
bad,"Upper management does not care about employees, and store managers are lazy.. They leave all important take for assistant manager so they don't have to work. Corporate doesn't care about you either. Good luck keeping employees with upper and lower management that shows they don't care about anyone but themselves"
bad,The management is lazy and dont want to do anything but sleep or play games on phone. They dont have good managment in the main office or ate stores.dont back up there warranty and give wrong parts
bad,Company dosent really care about people-empoyees all a front corporate greed bottom line takes over  not hearing  people who work the field shame missing the boat!
bad,I worked for almost 3 years there i promised a lot of stuff form the begining if I quit my one full time job to come there mind you I was told id have my pay increased to what I was making never did 2 years later I'm having to use my vacation time as my days off and I tell them not to screw me but they do so I decided to go back to school and need to work days they said I'd be part time
bad,Pay is ridiculous and so is the company. The managers don't respect you and the people don't listen to you. I wish I would have never applied to work at this company. They start you out with $8.75 what is that?
bad,"Does not care about employees do not attempt to work here bunch of know it all that can't run anything. Low pay looking to fore you if you know anything about automobiles, only hire people that have no know ledge about cars"
bad,"No one cares about your job manager only cares about the store numbers, no one ever says good job for the good you do but yell when you do something wrong I quit because I was offered a raise waited two months and to find out it got denied this is a 20 billion dollar a year business and couldn’t get a 75 cent raise stay away from these guys!!!"
bad,Would never recommend this place . It's a joke and very unfair. The people that were there when Bonds owned the place could continue to do things the way Bonds did but I came in as an employee of ORiellys and HAD to do things the ORielly way. I could not stop and by myself coffee not could I eat in the vehicle when I was delivering but the others could . Like I said before I loved my job but not the bill carp !
bad,"They don’t let you move up I was there for almost 1 year and 1/2 I didn’t move up at all. They talked to me about firing people and moving me up and it never happened. If you become pregnant while working there they won’t let you go to doctors appointment, wic appointment, or do anything you need to make sure your baby doesn’t die."
bad,I got hurt on August 2018 and they denied my workers comp. claim for 8 months. Because of this I was treated like I did something wrong and ask to hand over my keys. I was also asked to clock out and go out the back door! I had to get a lawyer and after a QME Dr. said that my injury was from work they over turned it. It's been over a year and workers comp Dr. Said I need surgery.
bad,i worked over 6 months 7 days a week and open to close never got help just got replace like a pice of trash after i made goals and quota with 2 to 3 people for months
bad,"Very low wages. Fast food pays more . They tell you it is a discrimination hassle free environment, but complain and you WILL find out differently. They need to practice what they preach."
bad,"Where should I begin??  This company had rules that made no sense??  and a system of progressive discipline for every stupid rule they had!!  With this company it was money, money, money all the time and it was all about how much the employees made for the managers..Typically the managers had no idea how to do the job and the district managers knew even less..I witnessed unethical business practices which included selling parts to customers that they didn't need and price gouging..Terrible company to work for.."
bad,"There were so many things wrong with O'reilly auto parts to count. From under paid to leadership. When new hires got paid more than the ones training them. Before you think that maybe the new hires had experience working on cars or parts think again.They would have no parts experience, no idea what basic maintenance lintel, what questions to ask to get the whole picture. Came down to having to hold their hand and walk them through everything.Overall it's not worth working for this company."
bad,"Black manager was a racist and shows unbelievable favoritism to other blacks. Manager will break you down instead of train you. Lie to you about the pay you negotiated. Want you to work on peoples for minimum wage, and enable customers to abuse you to fix their car because they are lazy and cheap and are for slave labor."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. the DM's and RM's just like to stomp all over you, if numbers arent where they want then you are worthless to them. the  DM's at least in the PA region are back stabbers"
bad,i would not recommend working there. very two face and pay is horrible. this job would be good for a high schooler starting out. do not make a career out of it.
bad,"They give you all the responsibility of the job. But the pay stays the same, I started with 10.50 knowing automotive repair and I found out that my co worker that is a part timer is making the same as me and am considered to be a full timer. I don’t understand why the company is like that. Another thing the customers are rude and obnoxious they don’t give us any respect. And the company doesn’t even back us up. I don’t understand why they do all this and still expect us to bring in 17,000 dollars a month for our goal."
bad,There intimidated by black women  no promoting from within manager scared to speak up no backbone assistant manager secretly wants manager position so lies and does whatever it takes to get it  white America man
bad,"This company is not a drug free business they allow discrimination and harassment. I worked in this company for 13 years and at the end I was on a hostel, harrassed environment by an employee that does drugs and drinks in the job and the management knew about it and did not do anything."
bad,Was there for 2 years and when I asked for a raise they kept giving me excuse upon excuse. Upper management doesnt have a clue on what they are doing half the time.
bad,I advise against working for this company they will screw you over every chance they get!! I worked there for 3 years and in those 3 years it was everything but a good experience.
bad,Bad district manager he no got the capacity to work
bad,"They play favorites,they dont follow there own cultures.sorry raises and you have to fight there ins co to pay.If they dont like you they find a way to get rid of you so they dont have to pay unemployment.The rules only apply to who they want them to."
bad,Management is a bunch of push overs  people get away with stuff all the time  work sundays even though there’s no deliveries  place is terrible  don’t go
bad,It was 17 months working with no people sometimes by ur self long hours all the time complain about overtime to much I was ast manager n then they screw me no never against with them I regret work for this company
bad,I like the people the company is a joke. They make you work crazy hours . They really don't train you worth anything. It's all a huge joke . The turnaround rate with this company is a joke
bad,"This company does not believe in its employees, they will never pay anyone what they are worth, Ever! Managers expect you to work as if they pay you well, no breaks, no benefits for part timers, it’s a who’s who job. If you wish to stay on the good side and receive good shifts you must be able to kiss up! Also everyone is related so beware of that as well."
bad,The district manager was a real jerk. they play favorites and every one there would do drugs every hour behind the building. No one wanted to work and always wanted the new people to put away all the daily stock while they just sit around and got high
bad,I worked partimr for ovsr 8 months. When yjeyfecided they nerfed to hire a gulltime drivrrthey told sll og us we eould have to take less hours to pay for the full time driver (i was getting 24-30 hours a week) when i came in at the end of shift .i lookef at the schedual and they had reduced my hours to 9 a week. No explination just a if you dont like it quit. And so i did
bad,"Computer systems are outdated, no true access to Internet for searches so get ready to use your personal phone to really help a customer. The stores are dusty, spiders/ their webs are back room residents and no one is given incentive or time to clean. Their parts are over priced and their employees are under compensated. The colture is a joke as promotions seldom happen from within."
bad,"O'Reilly's looks out for people who have been with the company for years. If your new, your on your own. I worked hard and walked to work everyday and I received nothing in return but negativity."
bad,Never work here bad vibes after the new manager took the store i had customer call me the color guy from oreilly.......................................ps i will never recommend anyone to work at oreilly
bad,Oreillys was a job and is all this really necessary. It was like any other corporate job that the people doing all the work weren't getting paid what they should.
bad,People in O'Reilly  are every sexist  just cuz your a female they dont cared about you and they pay females less then men. A  assistant's manager  should not get pay $10hr.
bad,Don't even waste your time. They never call you. they tell you the job has been filled then the next day there posting the same dam job they told you was filled.
bad,"for $7.50 an hour, you are expected to do everything. work the counter, drive, stock shelves, check in incoming stock, process returns. no set hours. full time is 32 hours. try living on $175 a week. manager on power trip. when they do inventory or a store reset, you are forced into helping. once worked 33 consecutive Saturdays because they had no help. I would never work there again and I suggest you only do as a last resort."
bad,"At the particular store I worked at, the management was a joke...both store and assistant store managers worked the same shift...never in my 31 years have I ever seen this..."
bad,I worked at O’ Reilly Distribution Center for a very brief time. I enjoyed working there and loved that it was fast paced. I was a material handler my job was to put parts away in the correct location in a set amount of time. I was taught to be a better team player and to strive every day to work faster in a safely manner.
bad,this is a very bad job for older people  the pay is very bad and they do not give raises to drivers. at times it can get stressful they now use handheld devises to track ur every move and u do get a talking to when it tells them u have been at a place too long or u r not leaving within the 4 minutes time limit u have to pick the part and click on the depart on the handheld..i do not recommend working for this company it is not worth the stress and the no pay raise. they micromanage you.
bad,"Managment is the worst. They work their store management to the bone. Highest pay you can receive ar a store level is 14$ hourly, that is the same salary as a store manager. After learning how the company works in the Pacific North West region, I wont even shop at this company.  They have no value in experinced parts people, or in mechanical experience at all."
bad,Almost impossible to ever make more than 50 cents over minimum wage no overtime unless u wanna travel doubles every sunday never had a weekend off in 5 years
bad,Poor management and they don’t rotate weekends like they are supposed to. They treat customers poorly and don’t care about their employees at all. The manager doesn’t know how to run the store and all she does is take time off and expect everyone else to pick up her slack
bad,Worked for this company for five years. Full and part time. They hired incompetent management that didn't know what to do at time of stressful moments. Distract management didn't follow rules and only stressed sales and nothing moor. Wouldn't recommend to female s because of poor work environment.
bad,"After working there 8 months, I was advised that I hadn't been with the company 6 months and couldn't be moved from delivery driver to parts counter, where I would have an opportunity to suppliment pay by making sales.  <No I wasn't there 6 months, I was there 8.>"
bad,Every job is 911. They expect everything but do not want to pay you. Not really a good place to work. Most people find out how horrible it it to work there when they start working for the company. Alot of people stay there for the discount or until they can't take it anymore.
bad,"One of my worst job's in my life."
bad,Sucky job and sorry management. They expect you to bend over backwards for a little bit of money they're trying to pay you. If it wasn't for the discount probably half of the people that work for the company wouldn't be there.
bad,"Company has free range to terminate employees without any real reason. Very political company, doesn't matter what you do or what you know. It's all about who you know with this company. Commission on sales is a joke and knowledgeable staff is rarely a factor. Poor training and low morale"
bad,"I worked at Oreillys 15+ years and was fired over a made up lie along with most of the long term employees because the new workers where willing to do the job for a little more than minimum wage."
bad,If you are looking to get into the parts business stay away from O'Reilly Auto Parts.  A lot of back stabbing and in fighting at the store level not to mention blatant favoritism.
bad,Management and upper management will lie to you. Hostile  working environment. Being constantly harassed by other employee's.  They all run around snitching on each other for brownie points. Awful  place to work. Would not ever recommend  this company.
bad,"The pay is terrible. The management is worse. People who care about their jobs are passed over for raises & advancement, in favor of people who didn't care about doing a good job. Only people who treat others badly are moved up to management. I worked under 2 store managers, both treated their employees extremely bad. Would never recommend."
bad,"Management is incompetent and lie to your face. Lied about raises. Failed to give earned raises on time and promised back pay that was never received. The “insensitives” were decent on me, because no one else ever met sales goals."
bad,"The pay was horrible. Raises were rarely given, always had something negative on employee review regardless of performance. Cared nothing for your need to see your family. No flexibility with schedule. Insurance prices were the highest I've ever seen. The pay was about on par for a part-time high school kid. Horrible place to work."
bad,"My training consisted of watching the night manager play on his phone until he quit and then they make me night manager with no pay raise from entry level.  The GM would constantly throw temper tantrums, yelling, slamming cash drawers, throwing phones and keyboards, punching holes in the wall in his office.  Problem doesn’t stop at store level though, the GM quit and the district manager wanted the new GM to schedule me 6 days a week, still no pay raise from entry level.  I gave my 2 weeks, told them I’m really just needing a raise, they told me good luck at my new job."
bad,"Typical day, no help from assist mgr! , the girl that takes care of the hub has no idea what she is doing! The drivers are great to work with! Easy job! The other store in the area would be much Better to work at, so if your thinking about working for O’Reilly’s work for a different store! Not 2378!"
bad,Gave that company everything I had to give for 6years and in the end I was not treated right. Broke my heart seeing how I was treated. I had to leave the company
bad,"Tho job is awful. It’s not enough pay and not even Pugh store coverage.  The new store manager is very hard to work with, no cameras so an increase on the lack of safety , and irate customers ."
bad,"As someone working under an incompetent manager, stepping to take initiative getting the warehouse straightened up, all I received was a reduction in hours. Wasn't looking for any recognition as I needed the hours, but instead I got the opposite. Don't waste your time with this place, it's a joke."
bad,hated it money sucked the people sucked every customer you dealt with was rude and disrespectful acting as if it was your fault they were there management sucked i rightfully hated the job
bad,Management & Parts Pro sucked! I was railroaded & got the shaft. Worst store in the corporation to ever work at. The whole corporation is corrupt! 👎.
bad,You work in all weather conditions and with poorly maintained equipment and the warehouse is always late getting the loads ready.This is how it is at Forest Park Ga .
bad,Stressful work environment and high standards.  The more you get trained and the more you do they dont give raises. They give raises to people in warehouse to everybody but drivers. They play favorites and there is alot of favoritism. No equality in employment.
bad,"I worked for three months straight and was passed up for a promotion to a full time position twice. The manager knew I wanted a full time position with benefits so that I could get health insurance, and seek the medical treatment that I needed. Instead they chose to promote employees that did absolutely nothing productive, while making me do their work. I was also sent on a trip to the distribution hub in Poulsbo where I was taught to view my customer's as my paycheck. So when you go into O'Reilly's and they try to talk up an expensive product, it's simply because the sales person wants more on their commission."
bad,The company itself only cares about the money they make and their stock holders. Employees are overworked and under paid. The turn over rate is extremely high in all positions
bad,"Management never followed Company procedure unless it was to benefit them or to fire someone. Alcoholics and drug addicts are hired and never given drug tests before hiring or randomly while employed. Bad place to work. Management is always cussing and threatening the help, leaving vulgar messages on message boards and always causing a hostile work environment which always falls on deaf ears to corporate."
bad,"I was writin up for being rear ended at stop signs red lights and driving the posted speed limits ,  and getting hurt due to safety Hazzards in store. Came back from heart attack and was fired the next day due to that and being on a final.                                 I was there 2 years nearly never got a raise in pay and I have a CDL A"
bad,I was made a closing manager with no pay raise. I was not given time to complete paper work. After I was robbed at gun point they treated me like I was the one who did it.
bad,Terminated accused of stealing a landline headset I promoted brother hood which was turned down. Didn't appreciate the racist gestures presented to me.
bad,"This is a sexist and degrading company to work for. DO NOT DO IT! They will promise you promotions and raises, only to look past you for a man with 1/2 the experience."
bad,Pays minimum wage..overworked...poor management...if you aren’t part of their circle of friends they run you out of there.  I worked at one that was a Bennett that was bought out by oreilly.
bad,I worked at O'Reilly's for 2 year at 40 hours a week before I was considering full time may time I was told that I can only work x amount of hours each day while being secudaled for working when what I was  Scheduled for . And never got a raise or promotion despite being the highest sales men in the story consistantly
bad,"It’s. “OKAY “ ..... "
bad,"If you enjoy working 105 hours a week and not getting paid more than 40 and having to be forced to not have a social life or the ability to sleep, then this is the company for you."
bad,management sucks and they play favoritism among other employees. They also don't obey with state regulations when it comes to breaks and meal time. Management don't do their work and give all paper work to employees.  I also felt harass by management and since I was a delivery driver many of the charge accounts used to make rude comments and make me feel uncomfortable.  It is a male dominated job so girls get taken advantage to do everything at work no matter if is heavy stuff or just dealing with customers or inventory. (and I was pregnant 7 month lifting marine batteries and rotors and climbing latters to get heavy parts from the shelves)
bad,"Poor management at times can be hostile work environment  they don’t care about the employee they only care about how much money the company making."
bad,"Don't recommend working for a company this shallow. I had an amazing team, until the district managers came in and fired the store manager due to false accusations . Our entire team walked out with him. I believe in team work, without a good team, work will not get done."
bad,"This company was not a good company to work for. Poor management, under paid and no growth opportunity. Didn't get a raise that I was promised. Overall not a good company."
bad,Low pay and overall a lack of care for employees and individual.  District Management  and Regional Management are corporate kingpins who really do not care about the individual as much as just their role and just filling quotas. Oreilly is such a big corporation that this is to be expected however the low pay for the extremely high margins and profit they make is unbelievable.
bad,Poor management . They want you to do more than what they are paying you for. Refuse to understand that I have a child (only person there with a child) working way to much and not having any time with my child. Refused to work with my schedule
bad,"Due to my most recent manager, i do not wish to comment on my work experience at O'Reillys. It was not a good work environment, as well as the pay is not appropriate for the work you have to do. O'reillys is a good job for those just needing something to give them a small income, however, it is nothing more than that. Raises are far and few in-between, depending on your manager its all about up-selling the customer which i do not approve of. O'Reilly auto felt as though they do not care about their employees and if you decide to leave, they are perfectly okay with it as they will find someone else to take your spot."
bad,"If you want to be able to support yourself, receive benefits, or be able to advance your career this is not the company for you. Started part time with the understanding that I would be able to advance or receive benefits when I switched to full time, I was lied to."
bad,they will have 6 people on staff looking at eachother with nothing to do and not send one person home they will schedual a driver for sundays when only one account is open
bad,While working here I was promoted to RSM (assistant manager) but was not given the raise or the title.  Instead I got the keys to the store and safe along with all passwords and duties while a co-worker was given the title and the pay.  Contacted corporate and nothing was done.
bad,this place sucks I regret ever having worked for this company they do not offer any chances for advancement unless your willing to kiss the bosses butt.
bad,I worked at the Knoxville tn DC for 4 years. They new when they hired me they where closing the DC and moving to Nashville. Management is a joke. I've been in transportation all my life. This by far is the worst I've seen. They continue to lie and deceive to hire drivers. Shame on you. You have no business being in transportation what so ever.
bad,"Not good training, under-paid, just wouldn't recommend. They are very cheap and offer limited hours, not to mention the management does not care about you and is corrupted, but really you shouldn't expect anything more from any kind of business these days."
bad,lowpaylong hours. The pay was low and the hours were long. Low pay and long hours. Store never closes. have to work all the time. Bad weather dont matter got to go to work.
bad,management sucks. time sucks. no time off. no proper care of employees. 10-12+ hour days with little to no break other than lunch. easily written up for nothing
bad,"The incentive they give you isn't worth it if your not working 90+ hours & can actually sell related items, they take you as a joke their only concern is money your well being and safety is none of their concern. No security no working equipment in cameras or anything get a career instead not this b.s it's not worth it."
bad,"work culture around pars sales mainly no other culture other than sales on parts and knowledge ready for parts issues or car issues, also goals need to be meet it."
bad,"I would not Say that O'Reilly's is a good place to work. It is very much a cut throat work place. Drama filled, no one really gets along with each other at all. The Store Manager could care less what the people do. The Asst Manager is just as bad as the Store Manager."
bad,"Contacting commercial accounts to verify orders & deliveries ."
bad,"No hours, barely paid over minimum wage for someone with 10 years of experience in auto parts. No benefits. Always worked holidays. No opportunities for advancement."
bad,"At my location the managers were more concerned with gossip than actually working, this includes upper management as well. My time here may not have been the best but it did get me ready for more stressful jobs and worse bosses."
bad,"Work load enough for 2 people daily. "
bad,"A typical day Punch in at start of shift get straight to work pick up parts that had been left laying around put them away start helping customers. till lunch then go to lunch comeback help customers. make sure store is cleaned swept. returns are ready to go back clean store take out trash lock store go home."
bad,the new manager April is awful. she talks trash about all of her employees and does not treat them fairly. She should loose her job. She should be fired
bad,I would not recommand anyone to work for O'reilly company. The company is not the idea portrayed for a good reputation. The place is fill with drama. No one cares about doing the job.  Most people only care about getting a pay check and that is it.
bad,"If you just need something to get by or need something until something better comes into your life. then its ok.. this place have alot of back staber. I wont work here unless i couldnt get anything else... there pay is Below, there benifits SUCKS! THE ONLY THING I MISS WAS THE DISCOUNT I GOT ON AUTO PARTS!!! THATS IT"
bad,"Management ins't the best, don't really care about the employers and aren't interested in helping you create a career. They never followed the scheduled and make you cover their shifts as they wish, they remain clocked in....."
bad,was a good place to work when they had less than 1000 stores but they got too big for their pants and forgot about employees and their needs in the blow up.
bad,They fire people based upon if the hr department don’t like you I personally have watched 2 good strong workers get fired over nothing it don’t matter if you have witnesses or nothing.
bad,The management is very poor and unorganized and always calls so he can leave early and has the other employee working seven days for months with no day off because he will not hire any help and when he did hire a person let's her leave everyday early and give her a day off.
bad,Don’t do it. It’s a terrible place to work. You beg for hours and they drop them more. You do literally everyone’s job mainly because they won’t. And management does nothing to correct the issues in the store. You can never hit your sales goals because you’re either not in the store or you’re not on the counter. Or customers don’t want to buy from this company because of the service and or pricing.
bad,"Poorly managed,  underpaid, not appreciated, overworked, no benefits for part timers yet worked full time hours, dictated, slavery, violation of civil rights, discrimination, favoritism towards managers new hires, overlooked for promotion many times.. great employee discounts! That's about it ."
bad,I worked 8. Hours overtime for my mgt And bye the end of that week I lost lt all due to my manager Do Mot Work for this company You will be Sorry Later
bad,Will work you like a dog. Management couldn't care less about the employees. No garanteed raises with promotions..... no garanteed promotions for that matter. Management has no standards for discipline.
bad,"Not a good place to work especially if you live in flat rock, or any other city. Management sucks and does noting. all the work woul be put on the new guy while all the other people who were also friends got to do nothing but take credit."
bad,STAY AWAY no advancement once you reach management your paid based on how the store sales are doing hourly employees dont make anything but minimum wage and they come from corporate to brag about getting around to meetings in an o'reillys jet so no raises because JET FUEL that's why.....
bad,"Overworked due to “unavailability of other applicants “, despite seeing numerous applications coming in. Was required to work overtime and then would get reprimanded for doing so."
bad,"The employee discount was great!  The customers were great. Very slow working there. Will run out of things to do. Spend alot of the day, just standing around"
bad,Managers see only what they wanna see. They don’t see all the good things you do. Try to help the company. They won’t see the help. It’s not worth it.
bad,If the managers make a mistake you will be the one whose head will role. No manager accountability. If your not buddys with the managers and one of the favorites makes a mistake the will try and pin it on you
bad,"This job is not for anyone that is looking to do more with their life. If you are looking to grow or just pay your bills you will not get far. I spoke with my manager about more hours, and they turned me down. I worked a whole week by myself delivering parts while the other driver was on vacation. I tried hard to prove myself. I was making 8.50 per hour working one and sometimes two days a week. They fired me when they found out I was working at NAPA making more hours but the same amount a hour. This place is not for someone young looking for a living. They should hire older people that has retired and just looking to do something. It's horrible there. I am so glad I was fired because I was breaking by back just to be fired. I will never want to go back."
bad,the manager was a donkeys butt and mad me do pointless stuff and if I didn't do it his way (right or wrong) I had to do it again. the only reason I stayed was I was building a truck and used the discount.
bad,"They do not believe in promoting within,They train people to come in from other cities instead of training the people within.I worked long hours some days open to close.Not much time with your Family, 2%raise every 2 or 3 years"
bad,Terrible hr department the company jacked my vacation time up and did nothing to fix it. Was sad to leave but the clearly did not care about employees enough to make me stay there
bad,"Manger hard i have nothing else to say about this company. "
bad,"overall dysfunction and bad management . Only ting positive, is I was able to sit in a corner, and do my job, for the most part. Other than that, it was not a pleasurable experience"
bad,Typical day pulling orders with no help or poor help from employee. Lazy employee put orders wrong bins or lack of caring or no orders part in bins. management schedule meeting on days when on busy days and we run behind on jobs yet get yelled at for not delivering product on time.
bad,I spent a lot of years of my life at a place that rarely gave reviews or raises and could care less about the people in the stores except the manager. If you called in sick they made you feel guilty for doing so. Lunch breaks were far and few between and a lot of micro managing. Not to mention having a district manager that talks behind your back about you if he doesn't like you. Many other employers that actually care so I would keep on looking.
bad,O'Reillys is a horrible place to work had problems with the manager and other people who worked here as well has the additudes I got from the manager as well as the other people working here.
bad,"Working at O'reilly Auto Parts was an easy job for me. Knowledge is key. You have to know how automotive systems work. In general, O'reillys refuse to pay you a wage to live on. You will need a second job if you are providing for a family and living on your own. Being a parts specialist was straightforward. Cash customers out, assist customers in finding the part they need correctly the first time, face shelves, test batteries/starters/alternators, and install headlight bulbs or batteries."
bad,Good job for a part time or a collage kid. But not a career. You need no automotive knowledge. And you do not need to care about customer service.  And a great job for a single person.
bad,The word team does not  Exist at all.  Our supervisor in the maintenance shop doesn't know nothing about convert belts.. There is a lotto favoritism a
bad,"Pay is very low.  You are pushed to answer phones a certain way.  If not, you get in trouble.  You have no social life with this place, Upper Management doesnt really care about its employees.  No praise for when you do good.  But mess up a little and you get into trouble."
bad,"Better job are out there that are willing to pay you what your are worth! No flexible hours ,favor other employees and their situations. Management sleeps with employees( Or trys)."
bad,No training nobody has any knowledge! Tons of drama!! I reported employee theft and It was turned around on me. Crooked employees dirty management! This place is ran by corrupt management
bad,"The comapny itself is not bad and has a good business model. However, they do not care at all about mid level management and openly feel that their sales force can be replaced at any time."
bad,I will not bad talk them but they definitely are not a professional company and the people that work there are not qualified to be a parts Specialists
bad,"Just not a fan of the management staff. They don't take care of their team members, and only care about the job getting done, no sense of teamwork. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Hot, cold, dirty, bad culture and low pay."
bad,"Management didn't  care about you and it was everyone for themselves, I had a Manager that was 2 years younger than me and im 24. It's all about making upper management happy and not having a spine to protect your workers. You didn't even have to know your job. I was working 50-60 hours a week because so many people would quit and they wouldn't hire anyone. I was having to do the job of 5 people."
bad,"Not a very well managed company, the district representative was awesome but the local management was awful and never worked with your scheduling. I wouldn't recommend working for this company."
bad,"Unreasonable expectations, management pushed constantly, but could not do what they expected. Physically demanding, short breaks, hot in the winter, miserably hot in summer. Upper management could care less, lie to new hires, totally misrepresented ""core values.""  Non Union, not interested in unions, believe they pay great, offer great benefits, so, who needs a Union mentality. Obviously, have not worked for a Union company, and are not educated in the perks of such. Big problem, favoritism, extra breaks, good numbers part of the ""you're my fave"" perks. Low top out pay for job expected. If you're looking for the ""good ol boy"" mentality, you may go far here, unless your Dad is in the Executive offices of corporate, then, you can go farther than you deserve!!  Unbelievably ridiculous place to work."
bad,"They have favorites. If you aren't a ""favorite"" when you are hired, don't plan on staying long. The atmosphere is like walking on eggshells, and for a parts store, employees are sensitive."
bad,The management is horrible they are very racist and prejudice! Management is very harassing and they are too strict for the wage they pay and they will treat you horribly
bad,"O’Reilly is a job for people that are retired and just wanna be out the house, they don’t appreciate good employees also are constantly telling employees that they pay you good money and you don’t bring enough business into the company, well maybe if your managers knew what they were doing and they also invest a little bit of money in good employees then they wouldn’t have to worried about bringing business in. This company is not like they make it seem to be family owned and that they care about their employees that’s all talk to get you to work and fill in bodies at there store."
bad,The coworkers I have and have had have become very good friends and their the only reason I have stayed as long as I have. I would work with them anywhere.
bad,"Poor Management, lack of vision, difficult communication, poorly defined roles, lack of adequate PTO, policy discrepancies. Look elsewhere you can do better."
bad,Very poor management and very poor communication!  This company really has no idea how to treat their drivers! They were new to the transportation industry and they are still learning.
bad,I have worked at the distribution center for 4 years now and on numerous occasions been passed up do jobs that I was not only qualified for But I was the best candidate. All because I speak my mind about how unsafe the work conditions are. The management only picks people they like or are nice to look at bot to mention they don't bother to tell you that you didn't get a job until 6 months after the person they hired is in the position.
bad,Wasn't impressed with the corporate side of things. district manager was rude and very unprofessional. hours were constantly cut so they wouldn't have to offer benefits
bad,every other month there is a new manager.. they was giving me almost 40 hours a week as part time and out of no where with out telling me they cut me down to 24 hours!!!!
bad,"Would never go if I wasn't being forced.most of the workers will tell you they hate it and most are looking for other employment already.""............................................. . . . ."
bad,"I was a full time employee at the presque isle maine location.they say they strive to make everyone feel like a team member and it's all a big lie.I used to be a full time employee makin the same hourly rate as new part time employees even though I had been there for years.there's no such thing as on the job training,it was more like learn what you can on your own and do everything you can to meet or exceed managers expectations.Needless to say I would never ever recommended this place to anyone for a place of employment or a good place to buy any auto parts.from now  on I will take my business to AutoZone.They lost a good hard working  willing and able employee with 20yrs of automotive experience. Absolutely pathetic excuse of an auto part store and I'm surprised their doors are still open"
bad,"Poor management and low pay, very unorganized and they do not care about the employees. They make promises that they do not keep. The managers treat the employees in a very disrespective manor"
bad,A typical day at work stressful because don't have enough people to work. It take's almost a month to get anyone hired. Just poor management skill's need more training classes for the employees.
bad,"Very unsatisfied, this company does not really care all to much about it's employees. Very little to no time off, and not friendly management. It was honestly one of the worst jobs I've ever held"
bad,Co-workers were fun to work with as well as some bosses.Hours not so good felt like I had no life cause I slept all the time.Pay not so good.Would not go back
bad,Very uncomfortable environment for new hires. Management is based off of favoritism with no regard to corporate offices. Hardest part of the job was dealing with complaints from management not in charge of your department.
bad,terrible place to work. no support no team work every one for there self.ya hour get cut for no reason in house relationships they lie about raises just to get you to do more work and never come through with promises
bad,Would not work at that location again under current management. Unprofessional favoritism is the unwritten protocol. Employees not held accountable for company violations.
bad,"manager was racist, expect me to do everyones job. and also talked about my unborn child being his. made me cut grass due to my race. always gave me low hours."
bad,"People show up, angry because their car is broken. They want you to fix it, because you're a mechanic!!! ""They pay you good here, I know it"", you'll often hear (as you reflect on your $8 per hour, sub 30 hour work week)."
bad,"Very few women in management & one of the few there was over my department. She showed favoritism & treated you differently if you weren't friends with her. I complained to HR re yelling, cussing, treating employees badly & nothing happened."
bad,"This is among your only options of places to work if you're at the end of your rope. The staff members are generally unpleasant, the management is a shitshow, district and regional management is a legion of corporate yes-men that lie to their employees about wages, hours, and benefits. Don't expect the job you sign up for to be the job you keep, and don't expect to be told the truth about your pay, either. In fact, just don't. Don't do it. Don't sign up, this job steals time that could be better spent doing something worthwhile."
bad,Very poor management starting from the top Manager all the way to the bottom made a lot of big promises they could never keep.   You have any kind of parts  experience Move on don’t waste your time there.
bad,Supervisor family member move up quick and get position first before employees. There one supervisor  should has been fired for supervisor having relationship with co-worker like O'Reilly policy said but they cover it up. Supervisor harass you for using the bathroom while they sitting desk looking at your scan. There some  people don't like you they find way get you fire. Oreilly hate union and union came there twice cost DC manager and HR lost their jobs.
bad,"Don't apply to work here. You are made to work off the clock.  The schedule changes from day to day,  The manager takes credit for all the work you do.  You never get the days off after giving 2 or more weeks notice."
bad,Higher management do not take care of their people. Higher ups are to busy swindling your commissions from you and cutting payroll to a bare minimum. The low sales per man hour and pay kills morale in your team and makes it hard to encourage them to do better. Not a family or disability friendly company.
bad,"I was thankful to be employed, but had to get out of O'Reilly the 1st opportunity I had. Bogh Engineering offered me a career changed, that according to them was ""for the long term"". They let me go after only 3 months."
bad,"Upper Mgt. does their best to divert the issue so store and not held accountable for shrink, cash loss. Travel is extensive way more than anticipated, as a manager the expectations constantly change for payroll and staffing . The turnover for manager is extremely high."
bad,I was a store manager on CA and I was somehow paid under min. Wage. They actually took a dollar and hour a way by some loop hole to make it under min wage. You get 1% of you store's sales but if your in a small town low volume store it is not much! Regional Managers and higher only care about their paycheck bonus and not the employees that work under them.
bad,"They put anyone in a management position, even if they are unable to do the job. Between store managers, I had the place running smoothly, then went to a funeral and the new manager had the store profits in the red in 3 days. WOW. Such an unprofessional place to work."
bad,Only company I know that would promote the poorly experienced young adults to positions that required actual thought and understanding of their job titles.
bad,"Typical day is brief then get to work"
bad,"poor management that is not truthful, stressful work environment with extremely long hours with little breaks.  Low pay for work provided and quick to be written up."
bad,this company was the worst company i could have ever worked for they stole money from me and messed any chance of management experience up for me i would not recommend working here at all
bad,This job was like indentured servitude. I don't see how this company can continue to exist the way they treat their employees. I was continually harassed by a coworker all the while making a wage well below the poverty line.
bad,"They care more about competing to be number one, than spending money on important workplace functions; such as, transportation upkeep and equipment upgrades. As a driver, I never feel fulling safe, while using their vehicles or equipment. I've worked for one of their main competitors, and rarely ever felt the same way."
bad,"If i had known what i know now i would of never applied for this job in the first place"
bad,"Buyout of other business made for lack of care for employees, upper management only took care of themselves, wouldn't listen to people who actually made the sales."
bad,"They will promise you the world."
bad,its a have to situation right now.  extremely underpaid.  Just above minimum wage.  They try to squeeze blood our of a turnip.  It's ridiculous.  Management doesn't want to help out.  One of the managers only holds up the counter.
bad,"The Location I was at, the manager was a tyrant. She was horrible and mean and said things uncalled for. I have never worked for such a horrid person in my life. I was warned that working here would be an issue. If you must work for this company go work for Jeremy Cash in Highland. Fair Manager, good man and a hard worker."
bad,"Distribution Center Kansas City Mo."
bad,"This company puts the term ""Sweat Shop"" to the maximum. they treat all their employees like slaves and they take whatever they want from them such as your paycheck."
bad,Just poor management  with poor skills  as well store does not get cleaned and products get stolen by employees that are favorites and nothing happens to them
bad,O'Reilly's was a typical auto parts store. Environment was what you would expect from auto parts. Delivered parts/sold parts to customers in a timely manner
bad,Wouldn't let you work your full time people 40 wanted part time people to work management had to work all the time every holiday except Christmas that's the only day they close out of the year high numbers and low payroll is all they care about
bad,my store was a very poorly run store. management was not very communicative and played favorites. work was not evenly distributed amongst employees. always understaffed.
bad,"I do not recomend this company to work for. They will do anything to make sure you do not get sick or vacation time and hope a family member doesnt die. I found out my brother died 10 min before my shift last year. My manager held me hostage for 2 hours, until i promised to come to work the next day. I had to fight for my berevement time. I also had to go to work with a fever of 102 a few months after that.  Every year i lose vacation time. Usually 2 or 3 days. This year my manager refused to pay me all but 16 hours of my 120 hours of vacation time for my trip to europe."
bad,"Very stressful, not appreciated for the work you do, manager always complaining with bad attitude.Not enough pay for all the work you do with all the stress you have to deal with"
bad,"In a 2 week pay period I was working 100+ hours, getting paid $9/hr and picking up the slack of all the other employees in every department. When I ask for a raise I was told that by management that they couldn't make it happen. I found out the next week that 4 employees at the same store had just received raises. They take advantage of hard working employees. When I stopped stepping up and doing everyone else's jobs it was nothing but attitudes from everyone. It's a horribnle place to work don't waste your time!"
bad,I wasted so many years for a company that could careless about it's employees or it's customer. you have to fight for a raise and they put our lives in jeopardy with no type of security system.
bad,It was much better when it was bonds and then oreily took over it's been a mess..  garages call for parts and we mostly have to order them they r early in our store and the prices r all out of wack ..
bad,As a regular team member you are treated fairly but as management you are treated poorly. We received a half or 2 percent raise. You have to work and entire year to get any paid time off. The lack of good leadership is what make the Distribution Center  36 a very poor place to work.
bad,Management are all friends and work in a click atmosphere. Was promised raises that were never given. District manger was not ethical. Expected to run multiple positions without increase in pay or thanks
bad,"The way O'Reilly Auto runs there business is absolutely atrocious. I spent 2 years there and there wage was horrible. The things you did were in the end not worth the money. You were given so many tasks to complete and lets just say if you stayed after to finish something, you still got yelled at either way for using up payroll or not getting it done? I mean the workers were a mess and it was not a team. A team comes together and works well together. I do not advise ever working for them. And i was never given lunches until my 2 year mark."
bad,This place can not keep people working there. The manager is rude to the employees. I would not recommend anyone to work here. So many people have left.
bad,They don't care about you. Just a big company making millions of dollars while you suffer and make barely nothing. I do not recommend working here. You sit in a car all day and if you don't  smoke you work more.
bad,Managment is lazy and hardly helps with anything even if it is just the manager and one other person in the store. I personally had issues with the assistant manager and the store manager and regional managers did nothing about it.
bad,Working at O'Reilly Auto Parts isn't for ladies if you want to advance your career. They don't care about their employees at all. I had filed complaints and they were dismissed because it was a male that took my complaints. This company is terrible
bad,"typical day includes dealing with bad attitudes, phones constantly ringing with stupid questions, poor lighting, co-workers who are teenage know-it-alls, adjusting items on shelves, repeating silly,pointless quotes such as "" hello how are you"" to every customer (which you will get written up for not repeating to every customer)"
bad,The store dont pay much at all and you are constantly getting screwed over by management. No raises and no home life work all but Christmas day. This company is a joke to work for if you dont wanna make money and dont wanna do anything outside of work its a good job for you
bad,"This company only seems to care ab out 1 thing and that is how much the managers can keep the stores costs low... Meaning, you will never get much over part time because that is a cost to the store for you to get full time... Very lousy pay as well...."
bad,I did not enjoy my time here. The training they provide you for management was so very brief and not that informative. It was a learning experience. Your experience could and hopefully be different.
bad,Awful place to work..They treat employees and customers badly.If your not their friend you won't have a job long...I called  H.R to complain..They made up stories and fired me...I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone...there is no proper training..No respect..It's filthy and they are always mad about something...You will be promised full time but then only get part time..
bad,"I waited on the customers, put out stock, checked in the truck, delivered the parts to the customers. I also cleaned the floors, dusted the shelves, cleaned the bathrooms, and planagramed new products."
bad,Home healthcare was a great experience for me considering I wanted to help the people that couldn't really help themselves.
bad,I just left from there. First of all the pay rate is low. The place is a revolving door. The management is horrible. The district managers seem to not care. They are very disorganized and you end up doing things that are not in your job description. If I were you I would not waste my time here.
bad,"company is a great company as a whole but they throw out in with the bare minimum training .Expect miracles once your in a broken ,run down store, Great delivery times as far as parts goes."
bad,You have a job until someone does not want you there anymore!!!  They will dig for any little thing to get rid of you even if you are doing a great job!!!  Bad pay and overall bad company to work for!!!
bad,Worked for oreilley's in Shreveport on Pines Road and couple of the bosses were actually stealing from the company and blamed it on the employees. In actuality the store managers were stealing money and many people were fired as a result. The loss prevention authorities did not thoroughly investigated the store managers' activities.
bad,delivered parts everyday. drivers are under paid but are held to very high standards to keeping customer relationships. Management skills are horrible at every store.
bad,Manager never cared about customers said I should never price match. Gave me very few hours. Would not let me do extra training to get a promotion. I also got a write up for not showing up to work on my day off.
bad,oreilly auto parts pays you minimum wage to complete to complete top quality customer service and adding poor leadership along with poor management. this place makes good money but pays employees low wages to keep doors open. with opportunities for advancement. I give oreilly auto parts 2 thumbs down.
bad,All they care about is numbers and money do not work at this awful company anywhere in America. Sucks waste of time and effort.
bad,"This company is VERY, VERY Unprofessional. Mangers in departments don't get along. The equipment is outdated, the faculty needs to be inspected by OSHA ASAP."
bad,"They are opportunistic, and favor one race over others. Women are treated unjustly as well. The customers are allowed to belittle employees, and management plays favorites over other's. It's happened more than once where sexually inappropriate, and bullying situations were disregarded by management, and upper management."
bad,Always Walking in to a I need to talk to you from the manager every day going in to work it was always negative. some good co-workers
bad,"not a good place to work,. they don't care bout the employees, make u work through your lunchbreak... when I put my 2 weeks notice in they wouldn't even pay me for my remaining vacation time"
bad,"Worked for O'Reilly's my last two semesters of college. What I thought was going to be a decent part time job quickly turned into mayhem. If you enjoy juggling the workload of 2-3+ employees for minimum wage, then this is the place for you! Very fast paced and no brakes at all. Management was lazy and disorganized, did not carry their weight, and were unethical in every way. O'Reilly's idea of a raise is an empty title which consists of more work for the same pay. If you show any initiative or intelligence during your employment at O'Reilly autoparts, you will be labeled a threat and met with an insufferable work environment in hopes to drive you out."
bad,"No District Management, no store management, no accountability. a disaster of a company. avoid. auto zone and advanced are better."
bad,Gave them 7 years as a store manager and made one mistake outside of workplace and now I am no longer employed by them and they cheated me out of all my end of year and quarterly bonus.
bad,It's a very boring job just standing at a desk punching in year make and model information all day and putting products away when the truck comes to drop off items is a pain. only upside is the employee discount.
bad,"Sure not everyone's experiences will be the same, but the manager I had was rude, disrespectful, constantly gave attitude and overall was very unprofessional. Breaks were only given when we had no customers and I worked almost everyday 3-10:30 (sometimes until 11:30 or midnight) without a lunch. If we stayed late to do this we were yelled at, but if the stock wasn't put away by the end of the night we got yelled at.  Managers leave on time, but the regular associates are expected to stay late and come in early to pick up the slack from managers and other incompetent employees that work there. I was given the keys to the delivery truck on many occasions before being drug tested, which I'm sure is illegal. The lack of communication was one of the reasons that gave me a bad feeling about this place, but I took the job anyways. The store I worked at #3380 was a complete mess and no one cleaned up after themselves. I found chicken bones that missed the garbage can and fries that were so old they were stuck and petrified to the shelf. I did all of the training in one day(9 hours)but the incompetent managers failed to add that to my paycheck since I couldn't clock in because I didn't  have a counter # at that time. The lack of actual working managers really hurts that place and they wonder why they can't keep anyone there for more than a couple months. As I said before, I realize not every store is like this and I'm sorry to say it but I walked off the job because of how poorly I was treated as well as how the store was ran."
bad,"Unless you are in high school and don't want to go anywhere, this is not the place to work. No advancement. No raises. Constantly promised things that are never followed through on. Total nightmare with management. Don't expect to take care of your family with this income. .30 raise in over 2 years working. Not up to date on vehicles. Lying to customers."
bad,"Will offer you the world to get you to switch then give you nothing. I dont know about other stores but mine, rhe manager was mean rude and disgusting!"
bad,Not a good place to work.  Harassment from managers and employees to all the women that work there.  Bad management worse owner.  Loved the work couldnt deal with the work environment.
bad,"Big O Tires did some shady stuff towards corporate and their customers. From slashing tires sending them back to corporate for a full refund so the store gets full credit and the sales men or boss at the time would use that credit and put it towards their personal vehicles, to selling customers expensive parts they didn't need telling them they would ""DIE"" without buying the parts from them."
bad,"NOT a place for a career,  no employer loyalty and low compensation for the workload.  Any competitor pays more and expects less for each position.  Very little training provided by Oreilly."
bad,Job was bad. Hard to get a raise. A lot of people coming in and out. A lot of people would quit and get hired all the time. Didn't get a raise for almost 2 years and was sexually harassed twice.
bad,nobody knew squat about cars and nobody took pride in there work period. The manager actually looked to see if there was blinker fluid.
bad,"Great parts selection , bends over backwards for customers , BUT , thier employees are underpayed , treated poorly , over worked and Nothing is done when complaints are registered."
bad,"Worthless company, scheming, and politics are among the LESSER issues. Verbal assault is a constant, and they allow it to customers as long as you're an assistant manager and up. I have never treated a customer poorly, like my old assistant manager did, and I was fired because they THOUGHT I stole from the company. My old Assistant Manager has at least 20 complaints in one month, and nothing."
bad,my store not like the rest of the company so therefore can not give good review and would be best not to say anything. there is not much more to say.
bad,"don't even bother, terrible company on every level. Dirt bags for upper management part time hours. Very low pay and horrible HR department"
bad,This place is an awsome place to work for as long as you know who you work with but the politics you have to go through to keep your job is crazy. The biggest complaint i have with the place i that they give the people that steel cheat and lie to keep a job there way to many chances to keep their job but a hard working employee that does nothing but help the company and opens an oppertunity for some one to steel from them and they terminate him instead of giving him a write up. So if you make a mistake at all weather its your fault or not they will release you from employment with them. So in conclusion unless you want to make this company your life and tell your family that they are second to it this is for you.
bad,Total joke very low pay horrible HR department. Management completely unapproachable and detached from employees. District Manager frequently on power trips when entering the facility and shooting down morale.
bad,"Open store receive orders from DC. Do inventory Push sales."
bad,"never gave raises, racist  managers, and sales reps. low wages, no promotions. promisis never kept. only works you part time never allowing you more than 28 hours. no insurance or benefits. no lunch breaks."
bad,"management does not play fair and they play favorites, very rude management, no benefits, will no give you a schedule until start of work week, not a set schedule and your lucky if you even get hours, if you request a day off they make sure you are scheduled for that day"
bad,"Schedule depends on who you are friends with and who doesn't like you. Your hours will get cut if the supervisor for that week doesn't like you. Very drama filled, and clique oriented."
bad,Spent 6 years with them. Wars injured on the job in 2012 and terminated in 2015 once my doctor determined that I would require a job with lighter physical requirements.
bad,"The number one issue with this company is how they treat their employees. they pay the lowest wages in the industry, and hire high school students who know nothing about the world, let alone customer service. we were not selling car parts, we were selling ourselves."
bad,"would not recommend, lack of training lack of proper upper management  very poor overall rateing from all team members ,walmart of parts stores"
bad,"this job was fun at first . I like that I was learning about car parts , but after a while my hours where being cut and then I was only doing one thing organizing parts."
bad,This place was awful. I was constantly disappointed by upper management. The company culture needs lots of work and unless you want to be a store manager there is no room for advancement.
bad,"bogus management,terrible place to work. I was on the schedule every holiday, we never got our hour scheduled lunch breaks and theft was rampant.Managemant was unsatisfactory as management used to gossip about each other all day."
bad,this company does not care to know you. they are obsessed with profit and thats all they pay very little even to management not a very happy place to work
bad,I had only one manager who was pretty cool and unfortunatly being a female to them was intimidating and then on top of that being educated made it worse because to them men were always right.
bad,Not a good place to advance. They wont give you a raise even after five years.
bad,this job is predominantly Hispanic. The manager is nice but doesn't really help with any issues anyone has
bad,I worked at Getwell and Park. It was a very violent and dangerous part of town. The pay was not worth  my life!!
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of me getting there at 7:00am, checking in warehouse, and then beginning to put warehouse away.  As the day went on more and more drivers staggered in, which was fine, but the store manager played favorites, and didn't make all of them do what I was doing.  I then would deliver parts to local mechanic shops, which by the way my boss didn't help with directions, which made it hard at first due to not being able to have your phone to use as gps, and Flint is a scary city.  At this job, I didn't learn anything other then I didn't like to drive as much as I thought I did.  Management was horrible.  I was told at my interview that they care about their employees, and that they always backed their employees up.  For instance, during my interview with the store manager told me if something ever happened such as me not being able to do a certain job then they would put me in a different position so I would not lose my job.  I got sick in December; had a seizure, which left me unable to drive, so there for I could no longer be one of their delivery drivers, and he refused to put me in a different position when there were other positions open and available.  So I ended up having to quit, due to not being able to drive due to a seizure.  I got along with most of my co-workers; like most places people do have personality conflicts, but still I kept to myself and bit my tongue and did my job.  I went to my store manager a number of times with my complaints, and he refused to do anything about the situations.  He actually made it worse by telling everyone"
bad,"worked 14 years and went through numbers of supervisors and changes, liked the job but they treat employees like dogs unless you are buddies or family members of the supervisors,you are treated like a queen.  I would not recommend applying here unless u like to be treated like dirt with a management that had no clue in direction of the place.  Team members are part timers with no benefits.  They are weeding out the full timers slowly."
bad,"want a dead end job ? this is for you ......don't think your boss is your friend ,whenever he can he will stab u in the back, and for the H.R. dept. what a joke they are ,,,they are suppose work on your behalf ,no way they will fire you every chance they get ....they H.R. dept. needs to go back to training as they have no clue as to what they are doing complete idiots"
bad,"I no longer wanted to work with people who discriminate against people with Dyslexia. Do to the fact that I am a person who has Dyslexia. "
bad,"This company does not care for educated or hardworking people.  They will pay you the least they can, and use every excuse they can to deny you a raise.  They will offer you chances to move up, then drag their knuckles on actually doing it."
bad,Horrible Company No work life Balance poor pay DM's with the leadership skills of small children.
bad,"Not a good work environment, was laid off for for miscommunication and was never offered the job I was hired for."
bad,go in do all the work that other lazy kids and old guys won't do. deal with angry customers because the other team members don't know what there doing and give wrong info/parts to customers. very bad management !!! terrible pay and shifts..
bad,"I enjoy working there,,but to many turn overs.Only part time so they don't have to give you benefits.They don't pay well either."
bad,This company has some problems that is why I'm looking for a more rewarding job.
bad,"VERY unprofessional staff mainly management, no benefits at all, unfair, hostile work environment"
bad,Just another low budget improperly managed organization .
bad,"I just got a promotion. Still trying to get out. The workers are lazy. The management sucks. The pay is rediculous. The ""commisision is s*** I get paid 8 bucks a hour. I left Lowes for school and I was making 12 there. I don't get raised been there a year. My store consists of all managers except 1 person. I don't get time off on holidays. I'm actually surprised I got promoted. My store manager from the old store was a complete idiot. He didn't even know how to use the computer. The workers are know it alls. They don't even work on cars. Don't believe what they tell you.....TRUST ME."
bad,The DM is horrible he has his favorites and if you werent keeping him happy then prepare yourself for a bad day. If some stealing is going on it is your fault becuse you didnt catch it right away. Everyone who works for this company including high up will back stab so if you work for this company watch your back.
bad,it was okay its a good place to work but they dont pay well for the work
bad,worst experience of my life
bad,O'Reilly's is not a very fun place to work at all the big shots are mean
bad,"I loved this job, up to the point i quit. I deilvered parts to body shops, repair shops and other store. The biggest downfall for this job was, a bossy 19 year old assistant manger who thought they knew everything, and was very disrespectful. Didnt care if she offended her co workers, or how the work enviroment was. Im 4 years older than her, i have been an assistant manager before, There is a difference in being a boss, and a dictator.. This job was not fun, because of one assistant manger who was rude.. The store manager didnt care either."
bad,"They don't care about you as a person all they care about is making money. They don't care for your safety at all, and when you're sick or injured and call in sick, they harass you. Whenever you have a problem with the store manager and you talk to the district manager or higher they always take the store managers side even if he/she is wrong."
bad,Promised advanced management training to take manager's job within one year of hire. Management fails to follow through as promises with training only to blame employee for not reaching goals. Retaliates with poor performance review to avoid giving raises and advancements.
bad,"Never work here! You will be a slave to their lies and mistrust. Consistently lied to every person about promotions. It’s always the same thing, “you’re next”"
bad,Upper and lower management do not promote any employees and im talking about the ones that actually stay and put up with their bull. They will wright you up if you give them the smallest reason and instead of encourageing you to do better they say your doing a bad job and put you down. My point is dont work here unless you want to be treated like a slave.
bad,not enough people on the counter to answer phones and help customers basically a terrible company to work for manager is all about him and his group and the district is the same if you are not in there group of people u are nothing
bad,Besides the lack of total ignorance from the CEO concerning the individuals that work around him and the total cut throat management style. If you do not land in the correct department when you are hired - you will be pushed out by other employees who have a since of entitlement or by management whom have no actual experience in managing but will lay all the blame on anyone else besides themselves to.
bad,The company has a great cultural foundation however it lacks people to implement the culture they strive for.  They want ASE certified people however they refuse to give pay increases once you achieve the certification.
bad,Had a bad manager who made up his own rules. He was very self-absorbed and narcissistic. He was always doing things that he shouldn't and he was reported. He is still with the cimpany.
bad,"This company has a culture that is fueled by workplace politics and nepotism. I've worked for several stores and all stores are the exact same. People sleeping with each other , favors for advancement and/or special treatment, drug use in stores etc. This behavior is encouraged by lower management and upper management turns a blind eye. No upper management advancement would not recommend."
bad,"Before I say anything, I do want to preface the below by saying my experience was from back in 2017 so conceivably it's possible that things may have changed there since then."
bad,Find something else as soon as possible. They deliberately don't mention your salary because you don't make anything. In 5 years of loyal service and good or excellent reviews ( which you'll receive as little as possible because they are averse to Any Raise at all) I got 2(!) 18 cent raises making my final salary 9.67 per hour. Need I Say More.
bad,"If you dont like being valued work here. Upper management is rude and unfair and benefits to their own advantage. Leader in Las Vegas is a joke, no one is happy here."
bad,"No Saturday or Sundays off for counter crew. Do not call in sick because you will be chastised for asking and told you are are needed at the store... be prepared to stand your ground.  Don't expect training for professional upward movement.  Poor management knowledge of sales metrics and the application of such to employee expectations.  You better have tough skin as the manager tends to get under it.  Very poor flexibility with scheduling, apparently to ensure certain people enjoy a wonderful work-life balance."
bad,"I had been in the automotive parts retail business for the better part of 19 years. I had done every aspect of store operations from part time driver to store management. Never have I seen a company so morally corrupt as this one. In the Pittsburgh area market it is about who you know not what you know. When I was initially hired I was promised to go into the store manager in training program within two weeks of my start date. That never happened, In fact, any promise that was made was not fulfilled by the company. My entire time there was one big lie after another. In my store particularly The store manager and the merchandising specialist had an outside relationship that often came into the business. The store manager would back the merchandising specialist regardless of how many policies she broke, and would break policies herself in order to defend her friendship. It created a hostile workplace any time she acted unprofessionally. whether it was an employee or customer. I was an assistant manager and the title was empty in meaning. anytime I tried to help the inexperienced manager it was seen as a challenge not guidance. I was hired based off of my experience and the direct promises of opportunity based off of that experience. Instead of embracing that experience and knowledge, I was seen as a threat to their job security. The reason why I say that, is because O'Reilly Auto Parts is relatively new to the Pittsburgh market, and instead of bringing in the right talent they just put anyone they liked in charge despite their lack of experience. Its"
bad,Worked here for 2 and a half years and there's no room to grow. I was hired in at $8.50 and only got up to $9. The day I quit I found out the new hire was hired in at $9.50 and everyone else made even more. I was also the only ASE certified person at my store. Basically if you work hard for the company you get walked all over.
bad,"Management sucked. Placing people to lead others when they do not know of what they managing is ridiculous! Employees always complaining about managers, hours and pay. O'Reilly- stick to parts."
bad,The management is full of bullies and if you are women forget about having respect. I field several complaints transferred from one store to another just to get bullied some more and eventually fired for him putting me on the schedule knowing I'd be at my other job. I left him a note with the date on it.
bad,"Poorly managed company from regional management all the way to store management, policies change constantly never enforced,  stores poorly staffed all the time, very little communication within store and between other stores all the way from local DC to branch stores."
bad,"I worked there for almost five years and all that happened was a 15 cent raise, multiple promises on promotions that never went through, and high turnover rates."
bad,Things are fine at O'Reilly Parts when I first started but as soon as you start having family situations such as an emergency they ask you how soon could the emergency stop. The manager at the store would complain when somebody had a family situation as if somebody had kids he would say something along the lines of I don't care about your illegitimate children.  Corporate is taking care of of the situation
bad,They don’t really work with you on anything and most of the time you are standing at the front counter doing nothing unless a rush of people come in and then no one can do anything in a timely manner due to their computers being so out of date
bad,"They will do whatever they can to screw their employees over, driver pay rates are a bad joke and the management staff as a whole seem to have no idea what they are doing."
bad,"Quick interview."
bad,"Fun place to work with the write boss's, witch I found had to find, minimum  wage , require consent tests every week even if your job doesn't require it."
bad,"Liars, bad dM's and Rm's.  Recruit you, make promises.  Things cange and screw you over.  That's all I have to say.  Don't!"
bad,It’s all based on the buddy system if you don kiss up you’re doomed they find a way to get rid of anyone who doesn’t play their games worst employer I’ve ever worked for
bad,"Oreillys is a great company but sadly management where I’m at is useless, manager is clueless and loves retaliating against me even on my days off, District manager doesn’t care about fixing the issues, hopefully HR helps me. My manager literally makes me want to commit suicide, but since I need my job to survive for myself and my family I have to tough it out."
bad,U cant make a living working there! Racist manager! They care only about making money ! Under pay there driver which are the back bone of the company!!!
bad,"Work night and day shifts during the same week, every week end and most holidays.  This company has different standards according to age and being a drinking friend of district manager."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked . The management team acted like a bunch of children and did nothing to correct emplwhen they were in the wrong . Just ridiculous
bad,"If you're looking for a good part-time job try to get on driving at one of their hub facilities. As far as working at a retail shop, depending on the manager, you'll either like or hate it. They offer no means of advancement, pay is rock bottom, and from my experience the company is fickel to the extreme. They will not help you what so ever, most people that work there are already retired. May as well be an old folks home."
bad,"Anyone looking for a job should avoid this place. Management acts like they own you. I worked there 10 years and it got unbearable. If you like doing other people's work while they stand around talk, you'll love it. They call that teamwork. They'll make anybody a supervisor as long as you pucker up. One of my supervisors was so smart that he let all his teeth rot out. If you're a hard worker and you care, this place isn't for you. If you're looking for a job where you can eat food, smoke cigarettes, play foosball, stand around and talk, slack, chill, procrastinate, then this is your type of job. It was a disaster when I started in 2008, By 2018, it was a dumpster on fire. Everyday they just wing it. Lots of lower class citizens work there. People steal your lunch. Clock in at 5 am and go home at 8pm. Then repeat. This isn't a job for anyone with kids or any kind of a life what so ever. A guy from California got grandfathered into a high position because his mom and sister work at corporate. This guy had no experience at all. After that, it went downhill fast! Avoid and look for a company that cares about you."
bad,"Over worked under paid, minimum staffing. The company has no new ideas., they always follow suit. Work 630 am until 5:30pm and get paid 40 hours. They use to want you to clock in, but later.asked to stop..."
bad,"A typical day is always the same, with each person going to their respective department and completing their daily tasks. A bare bones job that one would expect from a simple warehouse job."
bad,"This job can be fun meeting new people and friends but they except you to go above and beyond for almost nothing. The pay sucks specially for the about of work you are asked to do, over all pay sucks, management sucks and pay cuts are how they make money cutting your hours so you don’t get benefits and so you don’t hit over time, plus they expect you to do leadership work for less pay."
bad,"Supervisor over maintenance was stealing from employees and the company, giving false write ups to lower annual raises, which causes to make his bonuses bigger on his pay check annually."
bad,"when i started we rarely had to stay late, then we got a new supervisor and then we stared working anywhere from 14+ hrs at the start of the work week to 12+ at the end of the work week our job responsibilities didn't change just our supervisor our job should take 8 hours or less."
bad,Terrible environment with even worse management. Theres nothing worse than having promises by management only to have them sarcastically broken while they laugh and say that they never promised you anything. You can go to a brothel and still won't be jerked around as much as the management here will do to you as an employee.
bad,"Managers frequently trash talked other managers and departments."
bad,If you don't know much about parts the associate will take advantage of it and sell you more than you need. The management of certain stores do nothing and lawn the role to someone else. The place is a bad to work at.
bad,"Was the best Merchandiser in the district (those were the DM's words not mine), and was harassed by other coworkers trying to get me in trouble all the time. NOBODY would do anything about it, not even their TIPS Hotline. I received a ton of awards and even became a Certified Parts Professional which no other Merchandiser in the entire company had done. Was treated poorly. When hired I was pt and was told I'd always get 30 hours and I did at first, but they sent me to too many inventories at other stores (where they also tried to not pay me for travel time, which was an hour or more one way) and gave me too many extra hours, so they cut me down to 26/week and said it was only till the new year,but when the new year started they kept me at 26. They finally made the position ft, because they realized it was hard to get all your own job stuff done when you are doing the job of 3 people but still never got much more than 30 hours . Their ""manager conference"" is a big party not a ""training"" opportunity. This was only the tip of the iceberg, so much wrong with the way this company handles its business.They were making so much money it was unreal but yet they made me wait for 4 months after my 2 year review to tell me I was maxed out at my current pay and they cuouldn't give me a 25 cent raise after our min wage had just gone up and I was barely above it yet again."
bad,"They promise you big things when you are interviewing, but the fact of the matter is that once you come on board as a sales rep with Indeed, you will be looking for a new job with the 6 months - 1 year. You will either be a disgruntled employee or they will force you out because of their aggressive quotas and micromanagement. never will get a raise at the end of the fiscal year.. management sucks. very selfish"
bad,Oreillys does not care about the hardworking employees. The management at these stores are full of sexually harassment endorsing idiots. They play favorites.  Oreillys also does not give raises where they are due. They pay is awful.
bad,I do not recommend this location for any employee with a desire for promotion or pay increase.  The management team is incredibly unprofessional and inexperienced.
bad,I work for the oreilly auto distribution center in Selma Texas and it would be a good place if management actually followed protocol and didn’t play favorites. There is no room for advancement unless you kiss up big time and dedicate your life to this company. Would not recommend.
bad,Management was cool but the DM they need to replace him. Some commercial customers are nasty and rude. They don't care about their drivers at all. Racism is at an all time high in this particular zone. Just don't trust people in this type of business. Money and parts being stolen. It's chaotic stressful and sometimes depressing.
bad,Not crazy about it there were not terribly well organized the pay was quite low it was a difficult place to work for when you were on the bottom of the ladder
bad,Company is only thinking of its self. The District Manager in Colorado Springs will lie to cover his mistakes and leave the employee hanging. The favoritism is out of control and the management jobs go to only the favorites. The upper management is known to engourge staff to find things to get other staff in trouble for. I hear this company is ok in other places but from my personal experience stay away.
bad,"First, Like any job management is the key! In 3 years my store had 3 different managers! Combined with the low pay and bad environment and it's definitely a lose lose!"
bad,if you are looking into the Automotive Retail stay away from Oreilly they tend to lie to their employees. If you dont want a raise regardless on how productive you are come here.
bad,No flexibility in scheduling horrible pay unreasonable management and expectations a lot of emphasis on robotic talk on the phone district and regional managers will absolutely pick you apart.
bad,"I've only been here for about 6-7 months now and I have to say that they don't care about the employees. The district manager makes a lot of false promises while flirting with young female workers which is considerable harassment. Not only that when an altercation occurs between employees, they say they're going to investigate the accident but end up siding with the person who's been with the company longer than new hires or anybody that's fairly new. Unequal work environment for the most part while other are taken for granted and others get a slap on the hand for something that is not fair for others."
bad,"I've worked for O'reilly as an Installer Service Specialist for a year now. Was given this title and responsibility to go with it and transferred to another location. I bumped heads with an account that was shifting their business to NAPA and I was relieved of my position asset that store and placed back in my original store. Didn't get a pay raise when I was transferred originally and was not given one after my 1 year evaluation. Sales weren't good enough I was told. I started with this company in March of 2015 and by January 2016 had a truck repossessed, lost my apartment and missed my grandfather's funeral. I've been homeless since January while working for this company. I can't competely blame the corporate tools because I'm the idiot that stuck around to let this happen. I will give anyone fair warning: Don't EVER think about a career 28th O'reilly Auto parts. You'll be promised the moon and be given the dust instead. I was asked to explain why I deserved a raise, with my District Manager having full knowledge of my current living situation. The utter lack of compassion is appalling to me. I've never worked for a company that values expense control more than the welfare of its workforce. I'm currently employed with O'reilly, how much longer I do not know. "
bad,"I worked here as a Matinance Specialist and it is the single most unorganized, disfunctional, manipulative company I have ever have the displeasure of working for."
bad,"The management is a lot to be desired . I worked for them 6 months & had just gotten a good 6 month review. The next day the GM came in to work the BBQ for customer appreciation & fired me because my shirt tale was out while breaking down an order in the back room , keep in mind the order was stacked on pallets 7 foot tall & I'm just over 6 feet tall , kinda hard keeping the shirt tucked in. Never the less I was scorned about it & when I stud my ground on what difference did it make because nobody could see me I was told not to let the door hit me on the way out . but it's OK if you're female just not male . oh & then there is the computer tests that never stop . if I wanted to know how to install air breaks I'd work as a mechanic & make big bucks not for a fricken parts house ."
bad,"I really enjoyed driving for O'Reilly Auto Parts because my route was just under 200 miles and I drove it twice a day.  I also got along really well with my coworkers, and I made some great friendships out of working there.  However, the District Manager was one who felt that women had no place in the Auto Parts industry.  I was told I would be getting promoted to the HUB Manager once a new location opened in Loveland, CO.  I was also trained for the new position.  But once the new store opened, the position was given to a Male employee instead.  "
bad,Selling auto parts. Customer is always right. Management is clueless until it happens. Long days without breaks and sitting not allowed. Most counter help are hard working but pressured to up sell customers. Helping customers solve their auto related problems are the most rewarding part of this job.
bad,"My position as a retail service specalist was overall like the  assistiant manager. I spent most of my day fixing all of the screw ups that were caused by my staff who just shrugged it off and moved on making no attempt to learn from their mistakes. Most of them could not even follow simple instructions. I also learned that no matter how much positive coaching was done to correct an issue it does not work! I spent lots of time with associates discussing their mistakes to them even while walking them through the correct way of accomplishing them. I explained to with my associates I did it this way to help them avoid a corrective action. Most of the time just fell on deaf ears. My normal duties ranged from checking in freight, turning rotors/drums,processing returns,stock lifts,searching for missing parts,running to the bank,cutting in new stock,running the commercial sales counter, doing a delivery/transfer and serving retail customers. Another aspect of my job that did not make it easy was poor management all round. The upper ups were promoting associates to store managers who did not even have the same experience as I did and it seems they were just key carriers for ony less than a month. That is when I learned the importance of  management style and how a poor one can affect your overall outcome as a whole.I also realized this when upper management hardly supports you on most issues even if you are right. An example of this is when your customers tell you off to the side that because of certain managers and other associates they will be shopping elsewhwere. When this in made"
bad,"In a typical day I deal with unhappy customers who are in the store mostly because they have a problem with their vehicle; my job is to help them find the parts they need within the confines of their budget. In my years of service I have learned a lot about vehicle maintenance, repairs, and automotive systems."
bad,"If you are 16, have no experience, and want to work for low wages, go ahead. If you are 48, have more than 25 years worth of automotive aftermarket experience, and need a decent wage to support your family, don't bother applying."
bad,"The corporate staff especially in HR are very clique.  They gang together and make others feel like outsiders.  Men are not appreciated and shunned.  8-5 and no flexibility or cares.  Living in the 80s based on what feeds the shareholders....mostly the company execs.  Those in power own the stocks and make decisions not to grow, but to enrich themselves."
bad,They dont promote within. They find a good worker and suck them dry while everyone else just does what they want. They talk about team so much but its everyone for themselves there.
bad,"The absolute worst company i have ever worked for, their corporate policies are even worse than a banks policies I know because I work for a bank. Their top dogs could care less about their employee's."
bad,Will force to work way out of your pay grade. No real management. Management can not keep work environment professional. No room for growth within company
bad,Upper management ( the district  managers) are bad. They falsely  accuse people  of things and demote you or force you to quit. They don't  like females in any important  position. Managers are not allowed ( or will not stand up for their employees) because of fear of retribution.  O'Reilly  has a revolving door. You come and you leave. The turn over is unbelievable. Only thing beneficial is the  discount you get on parts.Onbeneficial
bad,Manager was not very helpful relied on other works to do job. Told them I needed new glasses and had them on the way I was fired the day I received my  new glasses.
bad,I didn’t have a good experience working for this employer. Too much to say. Not every O’Reillys is bad to work at but a lot of us employees are underpaid. I was the puppet who did all the work so the others could stand around and talk and not have to work. I was so underpaid for the amount of work I did.
bad,"The managers don't care about the lesser employees, they care about the money they make them. My manager made SIX FIGURES (+$100,000) a year and couldnt afford to pay me 35,000 a year FULL TIME? I was constantly getting harrassed by my other employees, text messages and calls on my days off. YOUR INFORMATION IS NOT CONFIDENTAL HERE. Multiple coworkers got my phone number somehow. NOT OKAY. This is a terrible place to work for. Just don't."
bad,good place to work but the unskilled upper management put focus on things that needs no focus and the things that need focus gets overlooked. the promotion process is extremely unfair and management has favorites and make no secret of it.
bad,Managers promise advancement but the process is so slow because the district manager and regional managers have no  clue what they are doing and dont recognize peoples strong points and abilities
bad,This location in Altoona pa is a joke to work for  I had all my training done and was doing jobs and not getting the raise or promotion for those positions.    People there Are R out for themselves and will take anyone down to do it.   I was fired from there because of a manager that I don't know how he still had his job.. Written me up 3 times in one day   mind you I had never had a write up until this person showed up..
bad,"Was terribly managed and they play favoritism with employees, hard work sometimes with non compensating pay.worked harder than others and wasnt identified as doing so."
bad,"Was promised a raise i was never given, almost no days off, i pretty much lived there. I loved the people I worked with and loved the customers, had it paid more and i had a better manager, I would have stayed."
bad,"O'riley is not a place to work unless you are single and have no children, no rent to pay. Most of the drivers are too old to go back to their other jobs. The older drivers are also retired so they can afford to work there. I will not recommend working there for anyone."
bad,"I called out my Manager on some things, not in a demeaning way either . Manager hates to be wrong or called out on anyone. So my full time hours were cut in “retaliation “ . I called HR , they sent some representatives to the store to talk to the Mgr. This was before my hours got cut , so I knew why then. There is favoritism  towards 1 employee especially. This employee gets away with things nobody else could ever ! It causes other workers to notice the special treatment this particular employee receives . I had to get out of there . Had great co-workers , I will miss them, but nothing else about this store"
bad,Favoritisms. No room for advancement . Productivity percentage not accurate . Timed daily even rest room breaks . Just overall a sad place to work ...
bad,"“Part time” full time hours. "
bad,"They start you at 9$ an hour even with management experience. Empty promises. I put in 2 years. never called in, worked my way up to management only to realize it wasn’t to recognize me and compensate me what I was worth but rather a “here you go it’s your problem now” kinda promotion. I was promised a new store only to be put in a struggling store with no employees. Also I made more money as a assistant than store managers expect to work 80+ hours a week on a short salary"
bad,I don't ever recommend anyone working for oreillys especially the waxahachie store where the district manager has favoritism for the store managers and the store manager has favoritism between him and the girls that he likes because he is dating them even though that's not allowed human resources allows it along with the district manager even though they knew how much bad stuff was going on in the store and how it was run and how he let the girls do whatever they wanted because he liked them and was dating them
bad,Management and upper management only care about numbers and not employees. Always understaffed and can’t keep a manager. Basically a dead end job. Definitely glad to get away!
bad,"My time at this job was short lived, the pay wasn't the best and when is came to the manager of the store he was an angry little man that needed to be pampered. I would show up for my job as a Commercial Manager and help all the local shops with their auto parts needs and orders."
bad,"Only drivers that have been there for several years get full time employment.  Employees unwilling to help new hires with questions, management is only intetested in sales."
bad,Loved my supervisor but t in the end job sucks.. lack of communication and never wanted to hear any feedback from the people who are doing the job!! I recommend that the manager take some time and get on the floor and identify the problems and address them according
bad,Hired to be a delivery driver with a promise of not having to work the front counter. Rarely if ever allowed to make deliveries and put mostly on front counter from day one. Minimum wage. Some employees that have been there for ten years or more still haven't received any raises. Poor place to work.
bad,They just look for bodies to fill base pay rates and many of the people in position have major personal / psychological issues.  Other college students working part time are great but they do none of the in-store work.
bad,Too many things to write. Awful place. Cant trust anyone. Very little communication. No one has any respect for their coworkers it's very cut throat and the manager seems to be alittle bipolar. Employees r always working against each other. No team work. Also constant finger pointing. Very stressful environment u don't knw. 1 day to the next if u will have a job.
bad,"During a typical workday as an O'Reilly Parts Professional, you'd be tasked with doing your job, the merchandiser's job, and in some cases, you'r bosses' jobs. In my particular case, management would sneak out through the back door and work on their cars during company time or meet up with friends. The hardest part of working there was dealing with surges of customers with little to no help from the rest of the team - especially management. Many managers at this company believe that they're above the average counterperson and doesn't need to work the register because they're above that."
bad,"Several of the employee's were unhappy with the manager, spoke badly about him behind his back. Schedules put out 3 weeks in advance but was not consistent, would change on your day off and not check to see if you already had plans. Complaints of mistreatment by a certain co-worker was not addressed by manager. The manager was only concerned about his bonuses would sit and watch his phone a lot a."
bad,Good place to work willing to learn good people somewhat good customers but too much favoritism or stereotyping through management depending on your location but anything else good place all I can say is just watch yourself while working there
bad,"If you were not involved with the ""Click"" you were not given enough hours to work. For the most part I like to be a team player and help one another. This particular location had a number of individuals including management that were stealing from the company. I can't be a part of that type of behavior. Your integrity is most important!"
bad,"The GM is very demanding and shows personal favoritism. Hostile work environment. Alot of cussing and voices they're political, anti- American view. Will not properly train employees."
bad,"I thought it was a good relaxed job, but the management really goes over board to ruin all these good drivers attitude. They have a decent fleet in Lakeland, Fl, all tucks under 400k miles, they care more about MPG then driver safety. Job requires you to drive mon-fri nights 7pm-5am $18 an hour. Depending on the route you average about 9-11 hours of work, between waiting to be loaded, PTI, and driving to multiple stores. Routes pay average 9.5 hours to 11.5 hours depending on your seniority bid. Stores are not trained or held accountable,  %50 of the stores know how to build a pallet that fits and is legal to take in the trailer, the other half has no clue and if you don’t take there return pallet they bring you more issues. Transportation supervisors are ok workers, but they are bad human beings that are out to get you, to either prove a point or just fire you. We were promised a minimum pay at the enterview. A month ago all routes where cut down in pay and now we went from a low pay job, to a student start up OTR paycheck. Obviously this was done so upper an lower management can bonus more, been that the company is expanding allot in Fl. But they don’t care about the drivers feeding there family. Drivers are now wanting to get a union involved. They had the biggest turn around record, allot of drivers have quit a few got fired. The managers and supervisors are all buddies. Drivers are afraid to report there supervisors for been unprofessional, disrespectful, making up rules or lies to get you out of your raise. Drivers don’t speak up about there bad experiences with supervisors"
bad,"When you get fired for something everyone does and the boss allows it, and had since from the beginning . Kinda malarkey. I knew you were trying to get rid of me. I loved my job. 😥 It was the pesky Favortism that I'm thankful for being away from."
bad,It's almost impossible to get raises. You get promoted with no pay increase even when you turn down the promotion. I've been there for six years and make the same amount as brand new employees even less than some. I've been promoted twice with no raise. I get called names constantly and when I call HR and tell them what happened they say they will look into it and nothing ever gets fixed. No one is happy within our store and everyone smokes through the building. Also another thing our corporate wont do anything about. Overall a cheap company that doesn't care about their employees.
bad,"Your supervisors are useless, they never hire anyone and they’ll overwork you and don’t care about you. Everyone is so disorganized and swing shift is literally the bottom of the barrel. No promotions and they complain off literally 1 minute of lateness and earlyness. The steel toed shoes don’t make it any better especially during the heat considering we work with very light parts inbound."
bad,"O'Reilly has unrealistic expectations of its employees. Not enough breaks in the long work days, lunch is only half an hour long while work days are 11 hours long on average."
bad,They just hire warm bodies no experience Need to change more catalog experience  they are back stabbers people you don’t know nothing very poor management skills
bad,"Everyone is out for themselves, very backstabbing and lying, upper management doesn't tell the truth. District manager will tell you one thing then do another, or tell you he didn't say that."
bad,this job is ok to work for but it's just the management that always pulls you and make sure your doing the right job and scanning the product. But this job is a really fast job to work for and you need to pay attention what your doing before you miss grabbing the wrong parts and sent it to different store you will be in trouble... this job is horrible for me a lot of favorites and harassment going on.
bad,Would absolutely not recommended . I was there for a year and a half with the company. Anytime I had an issue I went to my sup. Who never helped then took to my ops who said brush it off . Finally to the DC manger who never got back to me. Too much favoritism at play. Abuse of power with supervisors .
bad,"Worked there for 1 1/2 yrs and couldn't get a pay increase. Never had an incident. Perfect driving record. Did stuff that was never asked of me. Went out of the way all the time helping others and doing my job correctly. After 3 reviews and a bunch of lame excuses, due to power tripping supervisors, was always denied any raise or advancement opportunities. This is a job for retired people that just want a little extra money, on top of their monthly checks, to supplement their lacking income."
bad,This has proven to many that the company will take advantage of employees and treat them like dirt so at the same time while trying to teach racism and how to cheat your customers behind their back.
bad,O'Reilly Auto Parts is only good for people that need a part time job. Full time job is not woth it. I would not recommended for anyone. I really don't recommend it.
bad,Manager is lazy like operating a circus . Everyone is on ther phones rather then working. Only 30 min lunch hardly enough time to get something to eat. Gotta do training everyday.
bad,"Manager is super lazy, says he will do something then 6 months later ur reminding him, yet another 6 month. All anyone want to do in be on there phone."
bad,Not the best place to work. Good starting job. No advancement or pay raise from 2 years working here. Only benefit was discounts on parts for part time. Full time employees receive a lot of benefits.
bad,"Dont do it, they only care about themselfs not employees, get hurt on the jobs and see if they know u.They will tell u it didn't happen thier. Slow to promote and they will work the blank out of u for low wages."
bad,"good ol' boy environment, your skills are not part of advancements, who you know and have brown nosed are more important than skill, more concerned about saving pennies then it's employees, room sharing required for traveling positions, can't say anything good other then they do have strong commitment to wall street and maintaining sales growth"
bad,"I started here as an assistant manager and later became a store manager. Every year there would be a new store manager put into the store. The turn over in these stores is ridiculous. Promises are made that can't/won't be kept. When you ask for help from upper management, you do not get a response, ever. So when I made the decision to leave, they tried everything in their power to get me to stay. However, my mind was made up. They also have a flawed pay system that resulted in lost wages, and as of currently I am consulting with the labor board discussing my options. Be warned, they will deceive you into thinking that it is a great company to work for, and in some aspects maybe they are. However, in my area, it is the exact opposite. Do not work for O'Reilly auto parts."
bad,"Very stressful,there is always drama.management at times is very abusive,quick to write up or accuse when things go wrong. Company only cares about making money not the people who work for them."
bad,"These people don't know how to treat they employees they work u to death literally and they really treat employees like less of an employee, $9/hour.!"
bad,"You work 6 days a week. Graveyard shift. does not matter the weather, you WILL run. Even if the freeway is shut down they expect you to run and wait it out. Horrible home/work balance. They want you to be all about ""Team O'reilly"" but refuse to be about your family. No to low chance of ever moving out of anything other than a driver."
bad,I've been here for 4 years and management for 3. The training for management has steadily declined and a lot of people are being promoted just because someone is willing to carry a key to the store and close. Honestly if I didn't have student loan debt I'd leave the place.
bad,"Extremely high turnover rates, bad co workers, bad management, no benifits, almost next to impossible to move up in the company no matter how much you know or learn the systems, do not get paid fairly for experience or knowledge, raises are promised but never seen, constant training that needs to be completed weekly that doesn't help with the job at hand, and never paid fairly."
bad,"Unless you are a high school student looking for work to make some money on the side, stay away."
bad,a typical day consisted of getting to work having to take on the majority of tasks that hadn't been done. I learned that if i don't do it no one else will. the hardest part of the job was doing most of the work myself. the most enjoyable part was leaving.
bad,"I think they can give you a raise if you are a good worker,i was waiting for a raise because i worked hard.I wish they can maintain the area clean of garbage and people who drinks or smoke in front of the store,that can give them a bad reputation at that area."
bad,"Main manager needs to be a manager and fix the problems that was occurring, and people need to work together instead of against each other. The work environment isn't the best either"
bad,Stressful days with new manager but I learned a lot about automotive parts. Management was not good and did not know how to be a manager. The easiest part of my day was helping customers find what they needed. The hardest part was dealing with the negative energy from the manager.
bad,i started working for checker out parts they where bought out by oreilly. oreilly cam in and gave everyone pay cuts and replaced all the managers who where  all about % so treating employees wasn't high on there list of things to care about i was always threatened with my job
bad,Didnt have a good experience with upper management. Coworkers workjed in fear for their job 90% of the time. Zero job security. Bad pay unless you dedicated to working 60 or more hours a week on a 40 hour salary with no overtime. Benefits were really expensive. The work load between management and upper management was not split at the least..
bad,My day would consist of coming in to work helping customers getting them there part. I learned a lot about cars threw my manger and people that would come in and show me the only thing wrong about that job is that they dont pay there employees a good wage for the job and they hire people who dont deserve a job.
bad,Low compensation for technical positions. Promotes an unhealthy lifestyle by providing junk food on a near-daily basis for employees. Very boring co-workers with little to no goals or aspirations in life.
bad,"Good entry level job, but tops out VERY quickly. Management has little respect for you. There are a few good people who work there but most of the store managers are jsut grumpy old men."
bad,"Benefit package, along with the extended package, are bare minimum."
bad,"This is not a company i would recommend to any potential employee. there is no program for advancement, they hire punk high school kids because they can pay them the lowest wages in the industry."
bad,the stores might be nice to work in but the DC plants are horribly backwards. You have to keep a productivity of 76 at least to keep your job and you can work as fast as you can into your evaluation and then they will lie to you so they don't have to give you your raises. I saw a lot of people quit in a years time because of the same thing . as you work as hard as you can as fast as you can if you or an elite worker but the worst part is you cannot go home until you're finished and when you're done with your zone you have to go help other people because 99% of the staff work slower so they don't have to go help anybody at the end of the day if one person or two persons are trying to make a difference it's only an hour a day that you're leaving earlier . The O'Reillys DC plant in OKC is a very bad work environment
bad,job sucks a typical day at work is going in at 8am and the management did not have the rite training for co-workers or management and did not let me go to lunch the hardest part of the job was the management not giving me change for the costmer
bad,"Compensation was pretty good, lots of hours to work. Poor management, poor policy regarding attendance, punctuality, and sick time. Personal Protective Equipment is unavailable, resulting in frequent respiratory illness. It wasn't worth the stress or bodily harm."
bad,"Average day at work-14 hours.(store manager)"
bad,"I most always was looked over for lunch breaks, coworkers weren't nice at all"
bad,top out pay 15.00 no more raises or bonus 10-20 years 15.00 hour dats it
bad,I worked there for 3 years at the same pay rate while others came in newly employed and making way more than myself.
bad,"O'Reilly is a fast growing auto parts company. If you want to advance to management, that is doable. The only reason  I quit was I am semi-retired and the job with Laser came up , it had better hours and was closer to home"
bad,different scenery every day  never boring many wonderful co workers 
bad,I work hard helping customers.
bad,The manger was always cutting out early. There was ans is No team work there. It is a Do as I say not as I do work place. No leadership at all.
bad,"It is a very unprofessional work enviroment. I learned alot but the managment was very poor, showed a lot of favoratism. I loved working and interacting with the customers, but they only made certain employees do things, while others stood around. I liked what I did, what my job intelled, but I did not like the way that things were run at this store."
bad,"I put up stock daily , delivery parts if necessary.I have nice co workers . Management is terrible. The hardest part of my job is mechanical knowledge. The only thing i like about this job is the discounts on parts. But their is more to a job than a discount."
bad,"Rude customers and rude management equates to a hostile, not-so-fun place to work. apply elsewhere."
bad,"Not a stable work place. Company could care less about their employees.Comapny has their picks of people and if you are not one of them you don't stay very long.Managers at stores are not trained right, they don't promote within.Comapny is for the younger people not the older one."
bad,"If you're a yes man and do not care about improving your work environment and would like to work a lot of hours for no pay, this is the place for you."
bad,"This company is based on who like you not on performance,they quickly cram training down your throat and don’t follow your up with questions answering and support unless you are a part of the favorite .people"
bad,The managers I dealt with only looked out for themselves and the people they wanted too. I saw people work hard and extra hours never get a chance to advance in the company.
bad,"Management is terrible. They show favoritism, they don’t talk with if schedule changes, they don’t care for your well being they’re only concern is what benefits them."
bad,The manager at that location is horrible. She runs the store like her own personal business and leaves the employees to deal with it. Not worth it!!!!
bad,Management does not treat other management equally. A ‘buddy system’ per say. Was fired for doing my job. Too many people in charge that don’t have a clue as to what is going on. Manager gave preference to convicted felon who came back from being in jail and chosen to handle certain managerial duties over the other managers. Bad place to work.
bad,When you start making a good wage for what you do they don't want you around.    Lots of discrimination and harrassment tolerated.  No respect for long term employees if you are not management.  Overall wasted many years working hard to save the company millions in expenses just to get let go for having a health issue that used the insurance benefits frequently.
bad,O'Reilly Auto parts do not pay employee's what the market is. Way below average money for to much hard work. It's like a high school petty environment
bad,"O'Reillys management doesn't care about its employees. "
bad,"This place is terrible if you expect to have any kind of life. They don't tell you in the beginning that you are expected to work 60+ hours a week. The turnover rate is terrible, so it's very understaffed. The DC has too much volume and not enough bodies to get the job completed in a timely manner. The management is clueless and have no business being in a leadership position. They don't regard you as a person, you are just another number and they expect you to perform like a robot. The morale is absolutely terrible, everyone is angry, tired, and burnt out. It's such a negative and toxic environment, you feel drained as soon as you walk into the building. I could go on for days but the moral of the story is don't work here."
bad,The management don't care and encourage staff to be rude to customers. Regional management is trash and are doing everything they can to cut costs. They force staff to do more work without an increase in compensation. I quit because of this.
bad,To much OT don't really care about there  employees.  You try your best and it doesn't matter to them make your rate or get out no retraining not much help.
bad,"Not good, all you are is a number to fill a spot. Went from sales to store manager with-in a year. After getting store DM was only there to train me for 12 hours in 3 months. when was told he would be there for a week at a time he never showed up or called me. If you don't want a home life or good money , good job. Only good thing was most of my co-workers."
bad,"Several Supervisors use their leadership to help their favorites and allow scandalous behavior against others which is totally against the company's policy and the so called ""Culture Value"". Several of these Supervisors do not take care of those who create problems, and won't tell others to go help other Team Members in different work zones. Several Supervisors let individuals continue to be unruly, and lawless. Several of these Supervisors are a bunch of HYPOCRITES. "
bad,"-They'll write you up for anything."
bad,Does not treat women and men equally. They will pay the women $1.00 less than the men per hour. O'Reilly Auto Parts will try to pay you as little as possible for doing more work than the job description.
bad,Loved the job hated the discrimination the boss didn't know his store or employees at all and wanted to discriminate me because I was real... So told him to fire me
bad,"The first lie was home everyday on the application. I was in dirty hotels, Bad smells in rooms, lots of roaches, drug dealers around, bums, It really felt like they were trying to put me in the worst places they could find. Management would get on to me for others mistakes and I was suppose to fix them. I was treated like I was a bad driver, but I did not make many mistakes like most of there drivers did. I also was one of the few drivers that actually did what I was asked to do everyday. They lost a great driver and a great person. Was treated very poorly by management, that did not respect any of the new drivers, even though in many cases the new driver was doing a way better job than the older ones.There were times They would test new ideas for WAY TO LONG in the warehouse making drivers sit  for 4 hours or more waiting for loads. I am no rocket scientest but I could tell it would not work from day one. Any time you touch something 3 times vs 2 lol its going to take more time."
bad,"They don’t pay anything, you can’t make a living there. They will lie to you and say oh yeah 90 days you’ll be full time, a raise, insurance the whole 9 yards.. 6 months later you’re still part time, they’ve even cut your hours because they hired 3 more part timers, you still don’t have insurance, so you can’t go see a doctor because oreilly pays so bad you can’t afford to pay out of pocket. They will lie lie lie lie to you, about everything. They won’t do anything about problems with your pay check, and they also don’t care if employees steal from the company or customers, saw it with my own eyes in the belt line store, I even told the manager and called corporate, nothing was ever done about the thieving employee or my incorrect pay checks."
bad,"Poor training "
bad,"Management fails consistently to help employees in advancement, and allows cliques to form in stores and districts. Upper management ignores issues unless suits are threatened, and retaliation for reporting issues is commonplace."
bad,If not on friendly term with manager you are not worth it there to continue.  They talk the talk but do not follow through on any feedback you give them . Very closed minded management
bad,Promise u the moon get nothing.......could get a raise every now and then worked my rear end off 9years for nothing except to get fired putting kids in paying them less
bad,"This job is a temporary job , it’s very hard to advance when management doesn’t like to hire within the company ,  They hire outside instead of inside."
bad,O'Reilly does not care about their employees unless you're the top seller in the store. They overlook a lot of wrongdoing by their managers and ISS and they are the main ones robbing the company of parts and money.
bad,They have to many people that thank they are incharge when they are not I will never do my business their again I will go else where my time with them was a waste
bad,"Pay sucks, hours suck, always short staffed, overworked but never compensated for the extra work. A management promotion got me a 1 dollar raise. Corporate cares more about sucking up to customers than employees. Customers are ashholes especially the commercial customers."
bad,When i went to work i see paper work from a week ago that i had to take care of. once the paper work was done i had to make sure all the store need was done doing the week
bad,"Very poor management,  absolutely no support of you are a manager. I absolutely do not recommend O'Reilly as a career choice. Not great pay. They can not keep a promise to save their souls. The discount is really good, most of the people I've worked with are great and now are longtime friends. If your looking for part time, extra cash kind of thing. Then the job is not bad. Just do not go full time or management."
bad,The manager had a couple of favorite people who basically did nothing while the rest of us did all the work.. However no matter how hard you worked if you where not liked by the commercial manager your job was not secure.
bad,"They don't pay anywhere near enough for their employees, especially management. There is no work life balance, and even if there was, the money was terrible."
bad,"How does a company expects staff to work as a team when commission is involved. At least, they should not make everyone's income an open book for other workers and make it a competition. This leads to workers grabbling over high spending customers and neglecting those who are not planning to spend as much.  And if the customer is not planning to spend a lot, teammates would give false information on vehicle needs, which leads the customer to spend on what is not needed. I believe in right info, correct product or part, makes room for a happy customer who will trust me and request my help on future business. That's how one should honestly gain commission, by honest relations."
bad,"the pay rate its extremely poor. "
bad,"The work was a quick pace,high stress job.Upper management,encourage a cutthroat way of life.Working in a field that is based on customer service,The book has to thrown out every once and a while to keep them happy.There is no reason to through roadblocks in front of employees to accomplish the goals set fort by the company.This just encourages dis trust of all staff,and deception through the entire staff ."
bad,"if in management you will have no life outside of work. You will be on call 24/7 and are expected to be there whenever asked. no support from any upper management. if you have a problem they will tell you "
bad,A typical Day at oreilly is 10-12 hours with no lunch or breaks. Mandatory 6 day work weeks with required overtime. If you are looking to make 8-12 an hour max this is the place for you. They claim the offer great commission pay but it is hard to live off such a low base with less than stellar commission package. There are opportunities for advancement however. This is where you sign your family life away as store managers work 55 hours minimum a week. Its a great job for retired individuals who want part time but not a career. Oh Oh Oh o'crappies auto parts!
bad,"Good people being taken advantage of. Overworked employees beyond 8,10, upto 16 hours a day with min compensation for hourly and no compensation for supervisors.  This place has failed the annual inspection two years in a row and have made no changes to better themselves, when you report up the chain to higher headquarters you get let go. Poor management STAY AWAY!!! some of my employees left to go make more money working part time.. fraternization, favoritism, etc.."
bad,"I have fun working at this job and my manager"
bad,The job itself was fun but the atmosphere was terrible. Constant belittling by the DM and store manager. I was actually assaulted by the DM during the work day. I would not recommend this company if you want to benefit yourself until they fix the leadership issues in this district.
bad,This company wants you to do multiple jobs for less pay. They want you to take higher positions and increase your pay by .25 or nothing  and then will cut your hours so you are back to making less money.  I have had some awesome manager some of which came from Hi-Lo. I also have had some bad managers. They company wants you to learn the policy and procedures and will look down on you for up holding there policy. So with them  if you take care of a customer's problem they give you the 3rd degree.  When I took my position my DM told me he was happy because he didn't have a women of color in a lead position in his district.  I have sat back and listen to a DM that gossips more than he should. With no respect for some of his managers. To work here you would have to get a second job even being full-time
bad,"I learned that people want to be treated with respect. I had to close the store most nights. I would come to work at 2pm and leave at 9pm. My typical day started as follows: get money for my drawer, help customers, maintain clean store and stocked shelves during operating hours, sweep and mop every night, wrap the pallet, and lock the doors. My co-workers where great, we all helped one another out. Teamwork is the best way to work. My manager did not do his job as a manager should. If someone called in sick, he would tell them to find someone to work for them or they where fired."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend O'Reilly Auto Parts to anybody their management stinks and their rules suck,,,"
bad,". busy"
bad,Enjoyed working with the public and co workers.  Good discounts
bad,It’s a at will company that give 2 dimes over employees... I got injured and company fired me and is only covering my medical needs not getting any income and they even denied me unemployment... 18 wheeler drivers are treated un fairly and always leaving from facility at really late times of night as work is grave yard
bad,Job is easy workplace is fun but the pay is not that good. The only thing I would say that I do not like about working at oreilly is I can’t really support my family with $11.30/hr. That is all I got to say.
bad,Working for oreillys was great but the manager I had sucked. She was a drunk and there was no room for advance for inprovement. Boss was always sick/hung over never wanted to be there. Wouldent recommend either forest lake locations.
bad,I suggest you don’t do  it they lie all day and work you like you like you don’t have a life out side of the job. But the job is easy  . But it just isn’t a good company to work for .
bad,Management could have been better. This place is not organized at all. They don’t pay good enough for the work you’re actually doing. Pretty rigorous job for most!
bad,If you like working harder than the guy next to you while knowing he’s getting the same raise as you; then this is the place for you. The more capable you show leadership that you are; the more they put on you. Complete and total lack of accountability from top to bottom. Looking back on my time there I can see now that my work ethic was completely taken advantage of. There’s more to life than that place
bad,"My job is easy. But the management is so bad that they make it difficult to accomplish anything. They don't communicate with anybody, they refuse to take any suggestions or advice. They treat the hourly workers like we only live to come to work."
bad,I was hired full Time to work 40 hours a week but the second week there they cut my hours down to 25 as well as several other employees. I understand I was still new but how can you promise a full time position but give them part time hours? That’s not livable!
bad,Do not work for this company unless you have no life. They work you from sun up to sun down with no organization what so ever. The management sucks big time. I quit after 6 months because they promise you a raise after 45 days and I never saw it.
bad,Wen I worked there it was I was excited coming from the zone but once I got hired  started they was steeling parts under customer accounts using your sign in # and code err body knows err body code the district manager audit at his store so ridiculously out of pocket over 30.000  missing in parts bulbs then he comes to the store wer all the black employees at and looking for it's a low key racist job cause ova west the Mexicans all in those stores and ova east from Ashland to the 100s all blacks and err body under trained they steel your hours no lunch cause they too cheap to hire enough people and no security cameras don't work dangerous place to work at night they want u to be cashier parts pro and security and they steel your hours and don't awe and they never remeburst u for your gas on sales call or taking they money to the bank at least zone had security and money pick up they really need customer service training
bad,O’rielly claims to care about their employees but it’s just another greedy corporation. Give you all the positives about the company during hiring process but none of that ever shows while actually working there. DM takes expects a lot of you and gives you nothing in return. You could have the best sales in the store and they’ll still hesitate to give you a raise. Would not ever recommend.
bad,"Long hours, low pay, training is very poor. The hourly associates make more than supervisors with overtime. Expectations are very high for the low pay."
bad,/I don't know about all of the O'reilly location but the one that is located on lamar is not the best. So disorganized that they assume employees are stealing when parts are in actually not stored in the correct location.
bad,"Not a very good company to work for. The lack of management skills that I had in my store was very apparent. Was treated unfairly, and the surrounding workers did not respect one another, and often criticized one another. The manager of the store did not seem to care at all. The store was constantly in horrible conditions, and she would not lift a finger, telling all of the employees under her to do her to perform her tasks for her. Furthermore, the employees, aside from myself, and two other individuals, showed no respect for the customers, or their wants and needs. I would never recommend working at this establishment, and I hope that any of the surrounding stores are nowhere near as disgraceful to the O'Reilly's name."
bad,"Poor management and lack of communication. They will put you where they will use you, promise advancement to promote production, and are required to lie and fabricate to avoid raises. Becomes a negative environment."
bad,"They are exactly like AutoZone except green.  They sell cheap universal parts at high prices.  All OEM parts are ordered, never in the store.  I encourage you to shop at Napa Auto Parts."
bad,"As a delivery driver it’s very stressful when you haven’t gotten a raise, especially for being there for a year and a half, it’s honestly a major headache."
bad,Was hired on by a manager that quit and didn't show up for work wasn't trained right wasn't paid right just to stressful of an environment and nobody cared the manager that took over was just power hungry and had no clue what he was doing
bad,"Loved the job hated the company, fun easy going place but they dont care about you pay sucks for all your hard work you will always be underappreciated they could care less about losing people and only care about the numbers you make them"
bad,"The work was OK, The pace differed, & depending on days we would all get truck loads of parts from companies to put on the shelves. It would take a long time to sort them by bar code."
bad,"They lied about everything possible. Not one thing I was hired for, or told was correct at all. Seriously disgusting atmosphere. Only one person does their job and they managers could care less, it's seriously an absolute joke to the work force"
bad,Lack of management skills in dealing with people/employees. Training was lacking ...low pay...my hours were ok for the job I did as part time delivery.
bad,"didn't so much get full time nor mornings, didn't receive any benefits i worked late hour plus overtime didnt get the days off i needed. under staffed"
bad,"I hate corporation they do not help companies they hurt them if anybody have a company don't get involve with corporations, I will never work for a corporation again."
bad,Easy job but horrible pay  most days you're helping customers at the counter as a delivery driver and putting stock/freight away.  Most days you just sit and think of all the bills you're not going to pay because you don't have the money and you're not getting paid well enough.
bad,"I was recruited by employees of this company to leave the job I was at. I was made promises that were not kept. We had a management change and I had to train him while he took all the credit for ""getting things accomplished"""
bad,Long hours and little pay. Cant keep a manager longer than a few months. The benefits suck and insurance sucks. i would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Five years of service and 25 cents raise,a common practice behavior from the Regional Manager and District Managers too, stuck in a state of mentality that no business is being competitive of financial compensation, this companies turn over is at it's highest rate, 100% nation wide, Corporate Greed, lack of recognition to fellow team members and financial compensation as well, not the place I would recommend anyone with a solid background in the automotive industry, especially Women,Blacks, Hispanics or anyone from the minority group, witness married male District Managers to busy chasing tail, upper corporate managers catching wind of the incidents going on at my previous region and not doing anything about it, just a pat on the back and let's move on"
bad,"Management is bitter. The pay is good, but it's all about who you know, and nothing to do with what you know. The management sticks together like glue even when they are in the wrong."
bad,"The management doesn't know how to communicate with the staff properly and they complain about having to train you.Asking for days off is hard because they don't care about you or your plans. They lie and tell you one thing but do another.The management decuss your pay with other co workers."
bad,"Buddy system is rampant, if your a christian or don't get drunk with the in crowd you are doomed to entry level positions. Management In my area) is rarely on site and is a poor leader and very unapproachable,"
bad,"50 hour work week"
bad,"This company has a very high turn over rate because no one cares about the employees or the building itself, very dusty &dirty environment! You can be doing the very best but it will never be great for them. The pay was great!"
bad,As a Lead Driver your typical day involves the planning and delivery of various products to various locations. I recieved one day of training by store management before being thrown into the position.
bad,This job is very stressful. They have you working for little or no money. They have you completing many task with no money.
bad,"As a whole I learned a lot from my time at O'Reilly's, but sadly certain members of management say and do things that are clear examples of harassment and get away with it, several large groups of employees do the barest of minimum efforts and get promoted while people who give up literally hundreds of hours of their lives to better this company are forced out do to childish and petty treatment."
bad,"During the time I worked there, a high turn over rate. The company offered great benefits but there management team was left to desire. They are also more likely to promote men with better positions and pay grades then women."
bad,the more you produce the more they push for longer hours. there work ethic is get the freight delivered no matter the condition. getting time off is almost impossible there.
bad,"The management comes to work sick and expects the same of everyone.  Although I used less sick time than I accrued, the manager kept harassing me both verbally and in my reviews of the negative impact of using sick time.  One assistant manager was overheard saying that someone had just called in sick but she, the assistant manager, could tell he wasn't.  On one review, the manager wrote that I had missed 6 days and left early 4 days that year.  That had a negative impact and created hardship on my fellow drivers.  It's a double standard.  When the manager needed to leave early, she did.  It's nice to be salaried and not answerable to anyone in the store."
bad,Upper management shows no interest in the employees and would rather fire and replace you than accommodate you. the fellow employees are great and the atmosphere is good.
bad,"My trainer wanted the hub route i was assigned to, so she decided to lie during the training and in the end it cost me my job. Some stores that get deliveries from the hubs can be nice others cuss you out for being 5 minutes late due to traffic"
bad,"Having worked for several different stores across several states, it really depends on your management. Thankfully, it is a corporate company with guidelines and rules and a hotline one can call if anything serious is going on. A typical day has swells of busyness, but there's a rhythm to each store. You'll learn a lot about car parts, for sure, even if you come in with 0 knowledge. The managerial system is set up nicely, with assistant managers, managers, district managers, and so on. The hardest part of the job is trying to be flexible and having to fill in gaps when shorthanded. The most enjoyable part is learning about vehicles and parts."
bad,"As a company that prides itself on its ""culture values"", O'Reilly's management and department structure does not adhere to many of the values. They often create a stressful work environment for employees. Mis-management, poor training techniques, distrust among every employee, constantly having to watch your back or be weary of others because of how they may speak about you to a boss."
bad,The district managers don’t care about anything but padding their pockets. Managers are too afraid to stick up for you. You will get fired for the smallest things. No one cares about anything but making money.
bad,the job is stressful and  the management is poor. the customers are great but you can't rely on help and they are always short handed. the district mgr is an  butt and put the whole store in a hole.
bad,"I started as a full timer, but the big bosses told management to cut the hoirs of most employees and only keep a few full timers. Thus ensuring that the company (nation wide), stays under a specific amount of full time employees. This of course comes with tax breaks. My benefits were lost as well."
bad,"Very few people here are enjoyable to work with. There is a lack of respect, professionalism, a blind eye to inappropriate behavior, and a need to just get it done."
bad,overall not the best place but its up to you to make the best of any situation. This was not the best work environment I have been apart of.
bad,"Good job if you are just getting off from high school, or if you are single with no kids. Reason low wage job! If you have a family to support and they relay on you do not work here, this is one step above flipping burgers. I gave this company six years of my good work ethic, became assistant store manager for the last three years, and still was getting paid $10.60 an hour. Their mission is to keep you there the long as they can with a lowest wage, and tell you that's how all the company's are. Do not waste your time working here because you will waste years like me by not providing for your family, and you will not be happy. Go somewhere else where the company will pay you and reward you with hard work you done for them."
bad,"Just when you think you're safe and secure in your position, doing an excellent job as your review and sales statistics show, you're accused of doing something that never took place, getting totally blown out of proportion, then you're unemployed."
bad,"My ""trainer"" was the assistant manger. Her job was to show me the ropes and prepare me for management. Nothing of the sort was accomplished. I wasn't trained at all."
bad,"Stay in a lower area like stock, drive, chair that way you dont get pulled into more then you want to stay away from anyone that try's to befriend you they might bite you in the end"
bad,While working for this company I was racially profiled. I Loved my job but quit due to these horriable conditions. Tried to get my job back within the year so I wouldn't lose my benefits but was not hired back nor able to speak with anyone to get hired back.
bad,Liars skimmers theives and cover-up very well known at my store . I can't speak for everyone else store but I can speak for mine and it  was nice in the beginning but it was horrible in the end from the district to the lowercase supervisors they need to be replaced and retrain to treat their employees better and what they do.
bad,management lie to you... new manager likes to retaliate against employers that she don't get along with. makes it a very uncomfortable and hostile work environment
bad,"They suck"
bad,"Oreillys is a great stepping stone or part time position. It’s not something to make a career out of. If you al looking to make a little cash and learn a little about cars it’s a great place to be. However, there isn’t much for advancement without working 55+ a week and being paid too little. Promotions are who you know not what you know. Great job for teenagers and early twenties don’t make it a career"
bad,This company is so unorganized its amazing they make money. The mangement district and store were bad. My outside sales reps were big help but others lacked knowledge
bad,Management changed to often and the job descriptions changed with each manager. Pay raises were not given as promised or posted.  Team work was advocated but not followed thru with.
bad,"Most of the people I worked with were already my good friends. I had no problems with employees or customers at all. I worked for one of the best managers around but, the pay was horrible and the district manager had it out for individuals who he didn't care for personally. I was told several times that I would be getting a raise and boosted to full time employment but it never happened even when I was ""Promoted"" to Closing manger/key carrier."
bad,receiving in bond product and  us of a scan run to put product away and counting every peace of product in the ware house and order picking to fill order for shipment.
bad,Drivers some times do not get lunch breaks and drive for 10 hours day with out  much break. Job in general is a good job. Management is easy to talk to.
bad,I worked for them 21 years. I left because upper management didn't follow through on their promises or wouldn't allow you to posts schedules until they were due in 2 days.
bad,"The manager is awesome, but the district manager will put you off the schedule for a week if you can not make it into work one day. The staff is extremely short handed and there is no one to cover a shift if need be. Also, O'Reilly's frowns upon over time, so don't expect to receive any."
bad,An alright place to make money but not to stay for long. Mangers are hired from the inside so it gets in the way of a lot of day to day task plus HR was a messy.
bad,Awful management. Pay not enough to pay bills. You can find a job doing the same thing somewhere else for a lot more pay. District manager isn’t any better than the store manager. The store manager hates his employees. DM will tell you whatever you want to hear and then never think about it again. Corporate is also impossible to get anything done through. Worst company I’ve ever worked for and leaving was the best decision I’ve ever made.
bad,This is your basic parts job.  Very little challenge and very little interest.  Most customers were ill equipped to ask questions and coworkers were equally lost.
bad,"I only worked there one day and was very uncomfortable with the open use of vulgar language not only by employees,but by management as well. The store manager made several work inappropriate comments while I was in the store."
bad,"It was a fast paced environment meeting and greeting new people on a daily bases. Sadly I learned that hard work did and ultimately didn't payoff in the end of it all. If anything management needed a lot of work, restructuring and improvements. I had those co-workers that where just not interested in bettering themselves there co-workers or the company at all. It seemed at a certain point that I only wanted to go to work to help the employees that actually contributed positively to the growth and prosperity of themselves the people they worked with and the company. I think that's the hardest part of the job dealing with co-workers who are only there benefit there bottom line other then that meeting and helping new and old customers was always a good factor of the job."
bad,"My career was short lived ! Never have I worked for a company that allows manager to cuss, scream and abuse employees on a daily basis. They will write you up on anything and everything even if it's not true! "
bad,"I have plenty of automotive experience, retail experience and was formerly in the military. i am part time (so no more than 28 hours a week) and i get paid $8.50 an hour. How in the world can someone support themselves on that? The comission is a joke unless you are full time Installer Services and already make 15-18 an hour. Most of my coworkers are my best friends from school and whatnot so thats fine, but Oreillys treats their part timers like 16 year old kids who have no billss to worry about. One of my friends got ""promoted"" after being there 2 years and not makes a whopping $9.10 an hour!!! Yay! There is little to no advancement in part time, and it is difficult to get a full time spot. OH...By the way in 2014 they made 7.2 BILLION...and in 2015 want to open 200 new stores and set a higher goal. Tell me again why i cant get paid more...."
bad,Extremely fast  pace employee worked under extreme heat and cold.  Managed by intimidation plenty of accidents
bad,"Well I worked for the company for over 7 years and was just fired on May of last year. I admit that the reason I was fired for was serious but I felt that the company valued forgivness and would have reprimanded me instead of terminating my position. I have seen on numerous occasions that fellow employees would violate company policy and later be disciplined but it would not lead to their termination. I felt that I was going to fall in that same category since I was being transferred so often to run stores that did not contain a store manager with the implication that I was going to become a store manager in the future. I put in the long hours and stress only to be replaced with no notification, how do you think that made me feel? Well long story short, I guess I was not a valued member of the company staff since I was let go and I know people that were missing hundreds of dollars from their till. I wont get into details about why I was fired but it had to do with my driving record."
bad,You come in you deal with customers and time crunching and go home. Management sucks they have a high turn over rate of managers which is a main reason employees never advance or get raises. Co workers are great after all everyone goes through the same struggle.
bad,"Very easy place to learn, you deal with a lot of angry customers but it is your job to be a knockoff mechanic just to fix their problems. Typical retail job but 10x worse"
bad,The people I worked with there are absolutely amazing but some of the higher ups should not be in positions they are in. I would take major issues I had to my boss like theft only to have it swept under the rug without even being looked into.
bad,Pay is low but store discount is great. Favoritism makes it a stressful place to work. most vape right in the store. this is where you work till you find a good job. Thursday the schedule gets posted for next week. changes all the time. can't plan anything.
bad,Would never recommend work at this company. They do not care about you or home life. You are just a number and they want to pay you next to minimum wage to sell their overpriced junk parts
bad,"I was terminated for a ""tip"" called in by a coworker who wanted my position in the store, the district manager terminated me without even performing an investigation to see if there was even a sliver of truth, it is not a fair company to work for."
bad,Management was good and helpful. Some of the workers pass work on to others. Pay was $8.75hr not worth keeping or working when Oreillys don't care or pay their workers well enough to even want to stay. When they learn to pay well they will be competition to autozone or napa. When you go in and nobody knows what they are doing. That's because they can't keep people with automotive experience.
bad,Stressful and management isn't the most efficient. Hardest part of the job is productivity for first shift and not paid when your a designated trainer.
bad,I have spent the last 8 years supervising in three different departments. With the last year spent in shipping which I loved the most. I've spent the first 3 years in receiving and stocking and the next 4 years in City Counter which deals more with City stores and customers.
bad,"Worked there as a rout night driver and found that lower management is the best in trucking... upper not soo sure ...company is trying to squeeze all benefits from employees...(changing retirement plants without consulting employees...same for vacations...cut route pay ..."
bad,"Pay is NOT competitive, O'Reilly Corp treats you like a 5 year old. Promotions never happen on time, raises never given on time except    on yearly review.....MAYBE. The manager I worked for was fantastic and did care for us workers BUT I was lucky to work for a great manager and come to find out a great manager is very uncommon. Moral is really bad, had one worker never recognized for his achievements and did not get a proper raise for 2 years. Called the Corp. 800 number to report a parts driver high AND drunk.....nothing done. Walmart is a better place to work, at least with them you know what to expect!"
bad,"Management including human resources doesn't care one bit about the employees.  You will be disciplined and/or fired for either doing or allegedly doing something wrong, were as management level will be catered to and reassigned for their wrong doing.  human resources exists only for the function of the company they do not support the employee on any matters.  Overall employment at the store level depending on individual management and coworkers is an enjoyable work environment, it's sad that abuse of power had to ruin a great job for me while being semiretired.  They didn't even care that I had a court order decision that what they did was wrong and I was in the right, very sad.  Thanks for nothing O'Reilly"
bad,"Less pay for more work.... Rude customers thinking that we are mechanics. We are not a shop. The employees that been there are lazy. No team work, makes the not dream work. Top of that no rest breaks."
bad,District manager and down was great above that nope. I liked my job alot but when it comes to truth or loss prevention just give up because your guilty no matter what.
bad,They only care about get their rmps counts up .....its a very sexist and toxic place for a woman to work there but they have great benefits and wont pay you for what you are worth
bad,"No comment. Lack of pay raises. Had one manager stealing money. He even try to get a employee in trouble for the money he stole. It was found in the trash can in the female bathroom."
bad,"This would be a phenomenal place to work if there was a better management system. The hours are long for store managers, but if you know your worth, the pay is worth it."
bad,"Have worked at this company almost 5 years. As a whole,  the company is good. Benefits and pay sucks and management is poor. Seems like they will put anyone in management.  Just because someone is good at their job, does not mean they are worthy of being promoted to a management position. This needs to be evaluated more closely.  Not everyone is meant to manage others. My manager manages by fear and intimidation. She bullies those she does not like and lets her favorites get away with everything. Even going as far as to fix their time so it does not show them as being gone; which they are.. a lot. She talks about her subordinates to other subordinates and shares annual review information with other team members.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  She preaches on respect all the time, all the while showing the least amount of everyone in the office. I am getting ready to put in my notice as I received a great opportunity somewhere else and couldn't be happier about getting out from under her thumb. I won't look back. STAY AWAY FROM CORPORATE!  They are more worried about the bottom dollar than the treatment of their lower pay grade employees."
bad,"When you start your shift the previous co-worker depending on how they leave the station you take over can can either have their station stocked or leave it a mess for you to clean up, depending on the coworkers you work with that shift your day could go smooth or rough you just never know. Management needs a lot of work and I learned at this job you pretty much are on your own and you do a lot of physical work for minimum wage."
bad,After working for 4 years with the company the district manager made stuff about me and let me go. The only way you make manger is to suck up to the District manager
bad,"drive around delivering car parts, i learned about different car parts, manager was very nice let you off for doctor appointments , co workers where nice most of the time , driving in the truck all day was the hardest jpart just trying to stay awake,  most enjoyable part was getting to talk to customers and the mechanics"
bad,it could be a good place to work if they would lie AND decive you and by that you know who you are in brownsburg ind. i lost everything because of you thanks oreilly auto parts
bad,I worked there for a hopefully pleasing learning experience to the automotive world. It was not. My supervisor and manager were buddies with eachother and anything I did was met with harsh criticism and my eventual termination. I never learned anything there and would never work for this vampire of a company.
bad,"Work hard, know the culture, keep to yourself, never settle, be on time, supervisor can do whatever, but if your an employee you have to do whatever it takes to be apart of the good old boys club"
bad,"Horrible store manager. She was difficult to work with, not a team player which ultimately lead to me leaving. Training was also computer driven no hands on."
bad,my pay rate and hours dropped after they changed management. i like my job very much really enjoyed the people i worked with. some of the managers were cool to work with.
bad,"Bad working environment, very hostile . Worst management I’ve ever had or seen . Highly recommend to not work there. Way to hard to get any days off , had to work every holiday very low pay . Bad overall"
bad,"You have to fight tooth and nail to get a raise otherwise they could care less if you're dying on the street. Very poor managment, they do not care about the employees."
bad,Managment at the store level needs some serious intervention from upper Management. So many laws are broken daily with no intervention or changes at all. Very few new hires make it here past 2mo. It's getting old.
bad,The company don't care about the employees. They only care about sales. No customer comes first only sales. They feel employees are replaceable at the drop of a hat. I enjoyed working there cause i love cars. I just dont like how they treat employees and customers.
bad,Employees were not treated the same. Some stand around while others do the work. Will fire an employee for a reason while others are gave other positions.
bad,There is so much theft and drama it is not worth it for anyone. And the customers you have to deal with on top of that are ridiculous. Stay away from this place!
bad,They don't pay over time they tell you that you are an over the road driver so they don't pay over time. The management will ding you for any thing so you can not get your pay raise as promised.
bad,"The biggest draw is the management in this dump. And that goes all the way up. When you are being told to sell the wrong part to the customer so that they come back in to get the right part and spend more money it is time to go. I don't even go in there to get my parts anymore, hello red shirts."
bad,🤷🏻‍♂️ If you need a job to get back on your feet it’s the place to go you can get pretty busy and you work with many children can be really stressful at times and there’s a big lack of communication.
bad,"not a good place to work ,very corp minded , plays mind games , no back up plans in case of emergency, had to beg for time off , not enough coverage most time"
bad,very unprofessional always expects their employees to go out of their job description  expects you to skip lunch break due to lack of employees and they expect delivery times to be done in an unsafe an impossible timing
bad,OReilly auto parts served as a placeholder until I could find a job in my field of work. Management is takes advantage of its employees and store is very short staffed.
bad,"Highly stressful warehouse, lots of negativity throughout warehouse nothing ever positive.Management very unfair rules only applied to those they wanted them too."
bad,the hardest part of the job is dealing with know it all rednecks who are oblivious to the correct way of fixing an issue. people expect you to diagnose the noise from their engine over the phone.
bad,I loved the commercial customer they had very nice and patient. However management was poor lack of attention to details and constantly messing up orders. They were also unfair with hours to loyal employees and refused to pay what the deserved.
bad,"not about the customers at all, and u really do feel like your just a cog in a very large wheel, and raises, the most is .30 cents a year....now I always got a full raise, but pay stats at min. so it takes years to make a decent wage...."
bad,Very low pay but very fun loving place. Always had fun with the team members but was just a number. While the environment is fun.. the district management and above need to be retrained or replaced.
bad,"The pay isn't livable unless you live in low income housing, the company most likely doesn't have a culture policy because the warehouse is full of people keeping up mess, like fighting and etc. Not a safe place to work."
bad,"I was sexually harassed by the District Manager and the Regional Manager said, ""You know you're going to have to work with him right?"" I quit."
bad,Its a good place for beginning automotive and customer experience. Extremely patient with customers is needed but sometimes it can teach you a lot.
bad,"They now bring in everybody part time, so they don't have to pay "
bad,O'Reilly is a good company that you can grow at meaning if come to work and get the job done. The work can be tough sometimes and often very easy.
bad,"Overtime, underpaid, no raises or advancements, no recognition.."
bad,"I worked for this company almost seven years and hurt my back because the manager made me lift something we all new was too heavy had three back surgeries and they fired me when I went back I am now in the worse pain every moment of my life, without a job, divorced cus it was so stressful to my marriage ,broke, and homeless because of them and they don't care treated me awful when I came back and went out of their way to make me quit. The company only cares for money not the people that make them it"
bad,O'Reillys was a good place to work for. But I believe the terms on which I was terminated were unfair.
bad,Great co workers management went downhill. The morale was really low when I left.
bad,"Loved my job.  Not the manager.  She posts things I  Facebook about employees without their names attached. Check in freight,  set up shelving and displays."
bad,not the best but it pays the bills. not much advancement. poor pay. and too much to do I am doing a managers job and not getting paid for it not only that they like to bring in new people rather than move people up. I have been there 5 years and I have yet to move up of get a good raise
bad,"If you like waking up at 5 or 5:30 in the morning and working until who knows when, then this job is for you. I did not like waking up the early and hated not knowing when I was going to get off. It made the day go by so slow. I am not very fast, physically and at this job you have to work fast and precisely. Management was great, everyone was super sweet and the pay was good, but not worth it in my opinion."
bad,"Very relaxed place to work, great co-workers. Just hard to move up in the job, but easy to learn. Very easy going on schedule, works well with family life."
bad,They do not accommodate to their employees needs and there are multiple employees who have no respect for anyone else don’t not recommend this job for anyone
bad,"management is unreliable and they care very little about their employees. we are replaceable and over worked. They rarely hire new people to replace the ones they've lost. It's also hard to move up in the company unless you suck up the the higher ups. They find any reason toy right you up like being late because of traffic accidents or even a flat tire, stuff yo have no control over. Most of it's employees lose their jobs cause being late even if it's only on minute. Also once you have any pdp (occurrences) you can not even tr to move to another department to expand your knowledge. they care very little about their employees and we are ""replaceable"" according to the dc assistant manager. Even though they will not replace you or hire anyone new. Not a good job after 2 years of being there."
bad,"I was with the company and was billing out $100,00 plus a MONTH never once was I recognized , got a reward, nothing. I only had 1-2 days off a week while raising a newborn . I called off once for an emergency for my newborn and I got a first and final write up. I eventually quit because I wasn't ""doing my job"" as the DM and RM stated."
bad,This placed sucked. I don't recommend it to anyone unless your that desperate for a job.. and they only hire PT to start off and at minimum wage. they expect you to bust your butt for them and you just thrown to the curb when they don't need you no more
bad,"Some customers like to complain to get a deal from the manager, or the would call the district manager and complain. I am a believer put it in writing, make the compliant and if to be found in anyway false be charged for filing a false report. That could cause a issue with employment."
bad,you will get all the work and no credit for anything. unless you are a woman or a major a kisser. all this under the new woman manager. the new gm doesn't seem to care about anything going on in that store. as long as the numbers are up he won't be around. asst. managers are only there for show only 1 in the group 3 are worth s
bad,"the work day was long and the DM was a jerk .. training was inconsistent. very disappointed with the leadership, not much else to say except if you are interested in learning about auto parts check out AutoZone they treat their employees much better.."
bad,"Rrap pay, only 3 employess out of 15 had benifits and more than 20-25hrs immature high school kids were there target employees awful place if I had to get a haircut that week I had to dip into my saving account....that bad"
bad,Management sucked cut hours on me every week downgraded me bottled said didn't know was I was talking about when I've been around cars my entire life.
bad,I worked at Oreilly's  for two years the advancement sucked I hadn't even gotten a stinking raise yeah I was learning more and more about parts But I couldn't get anywhere with them
bad,"Manager Is extremely lazy not only at the store I worked for but also other mangers in the same company in the valley. Manager is two face, he would say one thing but turns it around at the last minute to make you look bad and fire you. The pay for women is really low compared to the men but yet women know a lot more in the place I worked for. There is not enough family time because of crazy schedules."
bad,learned alot management and so on learned enough to help mu husband work on cars. learned other valuable lessons. had two great managers that i would work for again.
bad,"over used and under paid. No benefits, no flexibility with pay of working hours, if you started working better then employees that were there they wont give you more hours but treat you like nothing"
bad,The store I was at no one worked the counter but me would take a hour lunch on the clock then sit in the back room for 30.min to eat ... a part timer was getting more hours and pay then a full time manager. Would ask for time off and would not get it worked every weekend closed cuz other managers would not work weekends or close .wouldn't go back even if they offered me 15.00 hr.
bad,I really didnt like working here because they never worked with my school schedule. Late nights were the death of me. The managment did not know what was going on half the time there.
bad,This was my first parts sales job. I had one of the worst store managers i could imagine. This store had a very high employee turnover.
bad,"Very low pay will not give pay raises. Must earn any increases in pay by sales commision. But to many employees  working the counter."
bad,"working 100 hours every 2 weeks with most day with no lunch. Everyone else got a lunch but me. I was everything from Driver to counter, traveler, merchandiser, night manager and still made $8.00/hr. I was told i had to improve and he manager didnt tell me what i needed to improve on. No pay raise."
bad,customers are great but management sucks. They lie to you about promotions and they will string you along.They expect you to dedicate your life for 8.25 a hour.
bad,"I work all nights so my day at work starts around noon or 1. A typical day at work consists of myself assisting customers in any way, shape or form needed. I go above and beyond even referring to actual books if I can not find what I need on the computer. I was a partner with my father in an Automotive Service business and I know what the customers need and should get. I feel that there are certain co-workers that be receiving proper training so they can assist the customers properly. A couple of my co-workers are not that familiar with much automotive knowledge at all. I love being able to help my co-workers but I feel they should also have training so when the customer comes in they can assist them and look professional doing it. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everyone on the same page so we work as a team. I am only a night closing manager so I do not have the authority to try new methods I can only relay them to the store manager and let him take it from there which doesn't happen. I do love working people. I enjoy being able to assist them and help them figure out their automotive needs. I enjoy everything automotive and its a passion of mine. "
bad,"So let me start off by saying maybe my store is or was an exception to the other better sounding reviews, however with that said I do believe some have gotten brainwashed by the management and their dirty scheming ways. Do I have your attention yet? If my store wasn't the worst, I bet the others are actually located in hell. My manager has been caught redhanded lying by me and many others. Doesn't matter how many formal complaints employees have made both to upper managers and the so called anonymous ""TIPS"" hotline, he is still working there to this day. In fact just the other day I left the company and part of the exit process is to give me a formal exit interview, well let's just say he isn't one to hear the truth from his employees so he made sure to skip that part of the exit process of leaving the company. He has numerous times been caught taking ridiculously long lunch breaks and then his wife has comes back with him just for them to sit there and actually eat food after his official lunch period which by then was two hours most of the time. I don't understand why he's been able to keep his position and go on like he has."
bad,I've been with the company 3 years now and have worked very hard and learned alot through hands on and classes.but every time review time comes along it's always something holding me back.
bad,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is good to work for if you are in college and just need something to get by. When I got hired in 2014, the management was looking for people that knew what they were doing, when I left in 2019, it was completely the opposite. They are now just looking for people to fill spots. You have to pay for medical and it is a high amount, you can get benefits after a year, but if you go from part time to fill time you have to wait another year."
bad,The other employees were good people for the most part. The store manager has a power hungry kiss her behind attitude ...if you want to get along . i dont know what else to say .. Pay was to small was told going to get more but never did after 8 months
bad,"First off the store manager belittles everyone to make themselves feel important.  Talks down to staff infront of customers.  You can never go to managers because they are too busy texting and snap chatting instead of  focusing on their job.  Management constantly talks behind everyone's back.  Way too much drama for a low paying job that treats you like dirt.  I would not recommend getting a job at this store.  One last thing, the pay is terrible and don't expect a raise without a fight.  They are more concerned with their bonuses and treating you bad than they are about taking care of their employees.  Worst job i've ever had!"
bad,"If I knew then, what I know now, I would have passed on the job. I was injured on the job. I had put in my 2 week notice earlier in the the day. I made several attempts to take the company drug test. I was misdirected on more than one occasion, and consequently, lost my job and my workers compensation. I was not a good situation."
bad,"For my position (parts professional) there was far too much emphasis on sales dollars in regards to placing value on ones contributions to the company. Little regard was is given to the other qualities one might bring to the company I/e: reliability, punctuality, automobile knowledge, customer service, performing duties other than sales. Becausthisthiscultureemphafellow employees hung out around the counter"
bad,If they dont like you they find a way to get rid of you. They prefer male team members. Make sure you get everything they tell you in writing or the wont remember telling you it.
bad,No management leadership. To much back stabbing. Won't teach new hires to look parts up in books went not listed in computer . management at store level to regional is Very poor
bad,"Job is ok just depends on the store manager. Employees are decent but if you have a power hungry employee walk away quickly. PTO does not accumulate, no benefits offered."
bad,I was hired on to be the next assistant manager. Within 3 months I was promoted to a key holder with a small raise ($1.50). Being a key holder meant you always had to work an opening or closing shift. Since both the manager and assistant manager refused to close I was stuck always closing. Never home before 10pm. When the ASM left to run another store they brought in another ASM to take his place. Refused to talk about my promotion. Brought in a second ASM to help with paperwork and closing shifts. Still no talk of my promotion. Refused to give raises even when minimum wage increased. I was working for only $0.50 over what a new hire would make as a key holder. Manager constantly accusing employees of stealing money. When a second key holder was brought on to be trained as another ASM I had had enough and quit. Every store I have ever been to and every employee I have ever talked to hates O Reilly.
bad,At first was a great company but the management sucks and way way to much favoritism and broken promises about moving forward In the company and if your sick or there's a family matter they give you a hard time about it
bad,"cut throat culture, poor management, low pay, heavy lifting ,driving . flat learning curve. would not recommend employment to anyone. low future pay advancement"
bad,Weekly schedule change always. could not make any kind of plans to be able to spend time with your family. When ask to spend time on Sundays for church and Mother in Law ( 91 Yrs old ) Weekly work.schedules would be nice if they were done a week a head of time. This is my opinion based on my work experience.
bad,"Working here depends on the crew you work with. If you get a young manager that thinks your hot, he'll be your friend for a while until you tell him you take your job seriously. Then they'll treat you like a joke and management  will be just as ridiculous as the thieves you work with. I did have the opportunity in working with other stores. And I had a much better experience there than in my own."
bad,"Promises given and not kept- (health insurance)"
bad,they will force you to take lunches 1 hour into your shift so you work 7 straight..Managers dont pay much attention to employees work ethic.. autozone's manager acknowledged my great effort and offered me a better position before oreilly's own manager did.
bad,"Did not enjoy working for O'Reily or the management. "
bad,Worst job I've ever held. The management is lazy and careless. The hours aren't worth the pay or stress. The training is pitiful and doesn't prepare you for anything.
bad,Promotions are given to ones not deserving. You get promoted by who they like not the work they do. Was better culture when kragen was still owner. Oreillys cares more about stock holders than employees and customers. Schedules are not far
bad,"Overall a good company, but not at the location I was at. Manager was never there. Schedule was never made on time and would not work with one with personal issues such as court dates."
bad,The pay is way below average for what you know they higher management that knows nothing about car parts expects them to learn from other members . District manager is all about him self payroll all he thinks about and his bonuses . Skeleton crew what they like to run on
bad,"Hired as part time counter sales, spent more time switching shifts monday id close tuesday id open, zero chance for advancement in this company unless someone gets fired (which happens alot) then your expected to work open to close 4 to 5 times a week while the manager leaves early daily so he can go mow lawns for tax free money on the side if your hard up for work great place to work while looking for other work"
bad,Uses lack of sales as excuse to not pay employees what they are worth.  District manager will lie to anyone to advance himself and the company.  This company used to be more concerned with taking care of people including customers and employees alike.  It does not anymore.
bad,I just needed a higher paying job and take care of the bills that were building up that I couldn't afford so I sought and found a better job that could
bad,"At O'Reilly's they put the bottom line before their employees. Employees are paid next to nothing even with 10-15 years experience in the auto parts field. They do offer insurance but it is not affordable for what they pay. The managers and district managers pick and choose which rules to follow based on how well they like you, and which ones that they don't want to apply to them. There is no room for advancement in this company."
bad,"It's another ""boys clubs"" if you know the right people/manager you can go far, no people of color are in upper management. They say salary but is not you must use your vacation time to take time off,"
bad,The store manager wasn't a good example for anyone and the store was ran very disorganized. The rules were not followed by some but was enforced for others.
bad,"Management is always willing hire anyone to keep overtime down the person may have little to no skills making there training hard for someone to learn. Traning is all computer basiced (this doesn't work for everyone). You spend most of the day looking up parts, cleaning the store and stocking. There is no room to move up even tho they will try and say that during your interview."
bad,"Store level jobs offer no advancement. Pay levels are below standards. Revolving door.  Always short staffed. A typical day includes answering calles from customers pricing parts and automotive questions. Help walk in customers with automotive questions and installing batteries, wiper blades,bulbs and doing various other automotive maintenance."
bad,"If you like a close to set schedule, then being a hub driver would be for you. It stuck within the bracket of 7 AM to 5 PM and that was nice. No room for advancement but if there was something they could have you do that wasn't in your job description, you bet they'd take advantage of that by telling you to do it. It's management, if you tried to argue, they'd just ignore it."
bad,"Although I made it to a management position as a Store Manager, the upper management did not care to assist with problems and solutions with in the company.  "
bad,The manager would pawn off his work to other people and disappear for hours at a time. There is no chance moving up or getting a raise. Because everyone is part time there was no benefits and no holiday pay.
bad,"I was hired to be a driver plus help put away freight..well instead of just driving and doing freight I was thrown on the counter with NO training what so ever just handed a key and told here ya go you're on drawer 2. I was on the counter, helping customers look up parts and find parts also driving and taking care of freight plus answering the phone when I was NOT supposed to be. Management did not care as long as they had someone there to do the work while they constantly ran next door to the store to get junk food. I was left alone on many occasions on the counter with no training and the store would get crazy out the door busy and I'd be there by myself...not right and not fair in my opinion. I don't mind doing work but I don't want to do the work of 8 and get paid for the work of 1."
bad,There was not much to the job. it started early at 6am and usually didn't end until 6pm. First thing in the day you are given a headset and a section of the warehouse to start in. Then once all the orders were filled in that section you went to the next until the trucks were full. Very little human interaction from coworkers. But if there was interaction everyone was irritable and unpleasant to deal with.
bad,"After 6 months of employment I was told that I would receive a pay increase. It has been 6 months past that and still nothing, I was promised a full time position, still nothing. Every retail worker at O'Reilly Auto Parts is expendable and those high up on the food chain know this. That company does not take care of their employees nor give them an incentive to want to excel and seek a more permanent position. Scheduling is a joke, never a steady time for anybody, no room for a personal life here. Plus management could care less if you wanted to take a day or days off, they expect you to give them all your time in return for nothing. Minimum wage with barely any incentive from retail and commercial sales. It seems that those that get promoted have an inside connection almost every time."
bad,"After 11 months of doing the job...being a ""company man""  I was TOLD I was being moved to another store.The store would not EVER do the volumn we were doing.Therefore costing ME to make LESS money.I asked for a raise to make up the difference.What a joke THEY made of that.The offer was 2%.Still way short of my current pay.I was told...Either take it...or quit!"
bad,"I have heard good and bad, saw the bad.... A lot of lies between special friends and upper management, a lot of company stealing, a lot of "
bad,"Micro Management even when your an employee that followed the rules ."
bad,Not a good work life balance/ hard to move up in the company. Not good at hitting overall goal's that are put in place. No communication between management team.
bad,"The management need more training on leadership and prioritizing. The only way that the job would go smoothly, if you was cool with a manager. Not to mention, you never know what time you're getting off. Its not design for people with kids."
bad,Where to start. The facilities are unsanitary. The air quality is dangerous at best. Supervisors are rarely present on the floor when needed. The compensation was terrible. They wouldn't entertain the idea of a raise after doing the job of 3 people for 9 months straight. They will promise you the world and never deliver. Im glad i got out when i did. Don't waste your time at this place.  There are better options on Northfield drive.
bad,Very poorly managed..human resources is an absolute joke..I could never want to go back to work there..they do not treat employees well at all and they would rather make up a reason to fire you than give you a raise
bad,"Good Company The Mangers,District  management not good at running the stores regional Mangers also not good and are not fair to employees.OWNERS need to look into"
bad,"A lot of things are promised but excuses are constantly made to not meet those promises. Use their employees, under paid.  Management not allowed to discipline employees not doing their job. Favoritism is displayed."
bad,"Management was very bad,  they wanted their bonuses, at ur cost. Not available when needed. Very bad equipment,  not maintained. Must deliver product no matter what."
bad,"N/A unavailable"
bad,"I Ioved the job, but the manager who took over half-way through my employment was terrible. She was petty, unfair, dishonest, and took advantage of her position. There was clearly favoritism amungst employees, including the district manager. The ones who work hard get nothing and are taken advantage of while the ones who are lazy and slack off are rewarded with promotions and favored. Do not work for store # 3962"
bad,Lied to me about starting pay.got promotion first day.no pay raise.very stressful enviirment.company does not stand up for employees aganist verbal abusvie customers.
bad,"Management was focused on their favorites and if you weren't their favorite and their favorite had a problem with you, you are screwed. But if you were their favorite you could probably go far in the company."
bad,"Absolute terrible company to work for, managed by people who have zero idea how to run the operation, take responsibility or have any kind of people skills. Only people that stay are people who can't find decent jobs elsewhere. Stay away from this company unless you enjoy working for just over minimum wage and have zero benefits as a part time employee."
bad,"Waisted many years of my life with this company and was 100% loyal to the company but didnt get the same from them."
bad,"Horrible work-life balance and compensation. If you're expecting to get any type of coaching or advancement, forget it. Those things are only for friends of management on the store, district and regional levels. In-service training is a joke. You could learn more from You-Tube videos. And they only hire females for demographic purposes. There are no designated break times, so you have to eat any breakfast/lunch/dinner on your feet in between customers but away from the customer area."
bad,"N/A it wasn't a highlight of my working career. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone as a potential employer. Low pay, long hours, poor advancement. Management makes less than the the hourly pay employees."
bad,"Bad Management "
bad,Issues not being taken care of the way they should. The work load is alot for one person and very negative attitude from other team members. Very stressful place to work for.
bad,"a typical day at oreillys was make sure aii your parts were in totes,if not,i had to go pick them. check your truck, make sure oil gas, lights worked."
bad,"There's no Direction here.  Your not compensated for your time properly.  Always have to be looking over your back.  No job security.  You are told one thing,  but things are done differently."
bad,"Management needs improvement and proper dealing with their own employees. My experience wasnt great. Manager had an ""eye for an eye"" attitude. Personality strong anx offensive."
bad,boring tempermental  conflict confrotntation workplace culture rude. the hardest part of job lifting heavey parts. a typical day at wirk is long and people are juvinal
bad,"Working in the corporate office is like being a bee in a very cramped hive. Management is extremely political and full of their ideas and are unwilling to listen to any sound advice. Any good idea you come up with don’t share it. It’s best to keep to yourself. If the management hears it they will most likely take it as their own and most times will get a promotion for something or someone else’s great idea. People are great to work with. Very skilled in their siloed areas. There are lots of chiefs that agree with each other, yes men. If you are an out of the box thinking, like to try new ways of doing things, or just improving processes this is not the place for you. Policies only apply if they have something to gain from your demise."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you want full time, the pay isn't good no sick time and it's like pulling teeth to get a vacation, and managing isn't good either"
bad,"Pay is not that great. Hours are flexible, manager that got transferred in after my hire did not have a clue on how to run a business and cost us alot of customers during a time when the store was going to be growing"
bad,Great company to work for but the pay is just ridiculous. Especially if you are a store manager. Nowadays it’s just difficult to find the right help let alone pay them a decent amount to keep them around. High turn over rate in this region.
bad,"I was a driver for O'Reilly's and it was just okay. I was there for eight months and the whole time I was there, they were really understaffed and no one did anything about it, the management was terrible, I had three different bosses the whole time I was there because they couldn't handle the job, it was terrible pay, and everyone was so over worked due to being understaffed. At one time I didn't even have a boss because they had to find someone to take the position."
bad,it would have been an ok place to work if it had better management at the time i worked there.if you like working with auto parts then its a good job for you.
bad,Only one survey should be allowed on profile. Especially if the category is retail sales or if the time from the last place of employment is more than one year.
bad,I am trying to leave this place asap. looking for another job as we speak. The management will not listen or they chose not to listen about concerns. Some of the managers refuse to do their jobs and expect others to do it for them.
bad,"I worked this job part time and then moved to full time. The overall daily grind was not bad at all. If you like cars, people and have enough people skills to attract regulars, you can do this job and be great at it. The only part that I hated was the pay and soul grinder of working retail. You're open on holidays and weekends, you don't want to do that if you don't have to."
bad,lazy coworkers that complain about the easy work. i was a closing key holder (not manager) but doing manager work still no raise but stress. manager was a I'm right your wrong person.
bad,I was a merchandiser here as well as the delivery driver and i hated it because it was hurry hurry hurry but don't speed and i understand now they have a gadget on the truck but ya tom was like that bad.
bad,"A typical day at work is random, however I have learned a lot only because I hardly knew anything when I started. The management is unreliable, does not follow through and does not keep their word.  The workplace culture depends on the staff you are scheduled with. The hardest part of the job is getting management to honor what was discussed in your interview. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers, and the problem solving challenges."
bad,"From working 12+ hour shifts to being there at 4 in the morning, my life was terrible. This place really needs a set schedule for employees because leaving when we're done is unbearable"
bad,Favoritism is big part of schedule and pay. No advancement unless you are being liked by the regional manager. Work performance does not matter. As long as you sell parts the company is happy.
bad,Very hard for low pay.  If you have kids that get sick be prepared to get penalized for it.  the attendance policy good be better. When hired as a temp they are supposed to go by seniority among other things to decide who gets full time permanent positions but the supervisors don't do that.
bad,The management to this job is very poor. They will cut your hours with out telling you .  Their schedule is unorganized. Hardest part of job is rude customers.
bad,Too high of expectations on the little people. Upper management does nothing to help anyone when they need it. If regional and district managers cared about anyone other than themselves it would be a fantastic place to work.
bad,"Clock in very early. Morning announcments, stretches.. Than work like robots til break. "
bad,Worked with this company for a few years loved job when I first started but as time went on store manager quit which I took over the position year later no support from upper management pay was enough to get by but worked way more hours then they payed for just a poor region to work for this company
bad,Mostly enjoyed my job bur I had a hard time being assistant manager and constantly rotating through new employees. I felt like the store should have been run differently. Too many politics for a simple company.
bad,i am at a slower store at the moment wait for runs alot slower then the store i came from. I love the location i am a hard worker and love staying busy
bad,"I just deliver parts to shop and I mind my own busy and do my job and more. Co-works are good,  expect better management. Hard part of my work is working with the DM there cause he make you feel uncomfortable"
bad,too low pay for all they expect you to do. unless you want to spend all day everyday here just to pay rent this is not the place for you.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with the in-store drama, nasty and racist comments from some employees. When issues are reported they are of no importance to management. Lack of fixing issues but real good at sugar coating problems. The worst company I have worked for as far as store level, district and area management is concerned."
bad,Work consisted of being professional and courteous to all customers and assisting to there needs. Keeping the workplace clean and organized. Management lacked and pay was low.
bad,"A typicial day at work started out fun, I use to look forward going to work now I do not. orielly do not value there best employess or care nothing about pay raises and I learned that my DM IS RACIST. your opinons in store meetings use to matter,"
bad,get to get one on one experience with hands on and with customers seeking parts that the customer is needing everyday no matter if parts are in town or out of town we still try to get what the customer needs.
bad,management sucks no experience they get fired all the time favoritism big time benefits are way to expensive they are penny pinchers that make millions always getting sued we need to be union
bad,"I had a steady work pace.Management was horrible.I had a couple of friends from a previous job,which was great.this company hires workers for a 3 month period and lays them off,and says when buisness is better they will call you to come back and they never do.They hire new people,and when you check to see if you are going to be coming back to work they tell you to apply again.Most of the other people I worked with where more concerned with drama,and what they can do to another person so they can move up the ladder."
bad,The management is very poor there. For the most part it is unorganized in the back and the pay is terrible.
bad,my time at O Reileys was interesting. The hours they promised me only lasted a few months which was difficult with my school schedule. It was a good experience on how to deal with the changes that come your way and realize that it isnt always going to be your ways. It taught me alot all together it was bitter with the sweet.
bad,"Selling and looking up parts for customers, answering phones, restocking ,testing parts, and cleaning"
bad,I get to travel to a lot of different places and towns throughout northeast Arkansas while delivering parts.
bad,"I start as parts pro,then after 3 year got a promotion, with no pay increase. District mgr. Just kept making promises with never happens. Pretty much oreilly is a company that you must kiss a--. Or you'll never get a pay increase. Most employee just keep saying how much they hate working at oreillys"
bad,If u need a job well working here thats all you will get is that.The pay is hardly nothing and the hours suck.
bad,I found that this company is experiencing growing pains to the point that the management still has a mom and pop mentality. The managers that i encountered were small minded and short sighted and the employee turnover is out of control. The culture of this company is sick from the top down. This company cares nothing about education
bad,If you are not clique  with store manager your schedule will suck. Hourly wages suck to. To many chiefs not enough Indians. Management will not help you move up in company.
bad,"The concept of raises just doesn’t exist. Managers “delegate” but really are just lazy and don’t want to do anything themselves. Also, Management never confronts you directly when they have a problem, instead they just complain to everyone else. Super high turnover as well. In my few years of working here I’ve seen the entire counter staff turnover every couple months."
bad,This companies all about the numbers and if you can’t make them you get cut. They also tried to make me take lunch breaks and sign out but I couldn’t leave the store and still had to help customers. They also framed one of my coworkers for stealing parts! Stay away.
bad,"Will not permit logical improvements to systems. They give the okay to make and Improvement, then ignorant drivers  and distribution center folks supersede their Authority Their system works for them, but not for a thinking person. They're stuck in 1972. The culture has open hostility between blacks and whites.   They think a box of donuts will make up for all of this."
bad,Managers always run with low staff. Theres will always be a customer who thinks you should know more (even if they know absolutely nothing about vehicles). The wage is too low for people who are expected to go outside and install every item purchased.  Get paid just above minimum wage even if you bill 250k in sales a year.
bad,"Emotional leadership, no upward mobility, diversity issues, lack of people management skills, some autonomy to develop continuous improvement tools and no recognition for doing so."
bad,Starting out had an awesome manager. Felt good to get up and go to work. Wasn't making much but we had a plan. Then he got moved and the new manager is just horrible. It's all about sales. It went from a help the customer out to push as much as you can. My schedule is never the same from week to week and it's like pulling teeth to get paid for time off. They do underhanded things to pay you less.
bad,I will never work for this company. Due to the fact an 50 manager acts as a child and slandered my name. Although some of the people I had met at this company were amazing.
bad,Definitely a man's world and many of the upper management had problems with women working there.  The male employees were not really helpful in lifting and carrying heavy items.
bad,Terminated on a technicality. was on a first and final for not having enough sick time to cover an illness then terminated due to saying something in earshot of a customer that they found offensive. wouldve just been a writeup but due to the first and final they had no choice but to fire me after being promoted and giving them 3 years of my life. you are just a number to this company. upper managment has their heads so far up their butts and micromanage everything i wont even shop with this company anymore.
bad,Terrible place. Its run like a free for all. Lots of theft from employees and management rules by fear. Do it or it’s a write up. Pay is too low to hire true professionals and must of the people they do are just waiting to leave. Done locations have over 70 percent turn over rates.
bad,Lots of heavy lifting all day depending on the size of the store. Climbing ladders multiple times daily computer and phone skills needed the company only pays minimum wage prefer to only have part time worker but you get a sales commission
bad,"I was glad to have a job, but I wasn't given enough hours and I had to lift product over the stated 60 lbs. I was glad to get a job but once I was there for awhile it became worse to work there."
bad,"Too stressful to work there. They touch the freight 20 times daily until they lose the orders going to the store. So unorganized.  Most job ever!!!!  Truly glad I'm not working there. Got a new   "
bad,"Good place to get some exposure and experience for someone young wanting to pursue and automotive career. Be careful, their information is not always correct and often dangerously wrong when it is wrong. Pay is way below area averages, and they only promote those that are able to adopt their corporate ""bottom dollar"" mindset.  Absolutely zero value placed on knowledge and experience unless you are lucky enough to find that one rare manager. And likely they won't last long either.... Get some experience and move on."
bad,Was a pretty good job but going downhill fast. Understaffed and disorganized warehouse. They have raised productivity numbers so high you can't achieve them anymore which is very discouraging when you are one of the few hard workers who care.
bad,"Worked at O'Reilly for seven years. Was very disappointed in the change over of co-workers, Assistant, Store and District Managers while I was there. It was a corporate environment of pointing fingers and not valuing good employees. At the store level (busiest location in Lawrence, KS) it began above average with the Assistant and Store Manager working as a team to build confidence when I started while transitioning from federal government parts and inventory to retail sales and service after working at an automotive paint store for four years eventually sold to CARQUEST and for a short time in management for AutoZone. Although I started out as a Counter Pro I was groomed for and achieved some night management responsibilities. Later, after losing my Assistant Manager because of his own high stress to a more promising parts position at a government contractor and another who graduated mechanic school. things began to go down hill. Finally, the Store Manager who became fed up after his ten years and left for a more lucrative position at a Chevrolet Dealership. After losing several good fellow employees after their dissatisfaction and a new assistant who was a hothead and was rewarded with taking over his own store. Soon after, I was ridiculed for my attempt at great customer service and laughed at behind my back by a manager who transferred from Topeka. I was lied to and about by another employee and ultimately lost my job because the stress led to anger. I asked to be put on disability instead of fired but it was denied. My benefits for my family were canceled immediately. I"
bad,Company only cares if you makes sales for them. You have to be insisting to get promoted or more pay. Wouldnt work here if you are a parent they dont work with schedule.
bad,I loved my customers and some of the people I worked with. Management was a joke. They let employees abuse and assault other employees and it was more of it’s not how hard you work but who you blow kind of promotions
bad,Management is lazy they help for what is gonna better them and don't care ppl that work for them. Also don't work as a team... And when I store fails they wanna say or blame it on someone sealing so if your thinking Bout going here for job make sure it is a busy store that way u can make money and don't get blame for sealing when its a slow store.....
bad,"They expect part timers to have no life practically. Pay isn't worth the labor, it changes your outlook on people negatively, also you are expected to drop everything and come in if they call you, or mangament will guilt trip you"
bad,"Management is aweful, district manager isnt helpful either.  The company is alright but it deffinitly depends on the location and most importantly management!"
bad,"O’Reilly was a train wreck of a job experience for me. I experienced uninhibited and blatant favoritism, lack of thorough training, and a manager who could simply care less how well I did my job, and the sad part is that I wasn’t even aware of it. I was never made aware that I “wasn’t making sales” until a week before I was let go. O’Reilly was a job that I thought I could comfortably learn more and more about car parts as time went on, but my management team seemed to go out of their way to stop that. I would not recommend O’Reilly to someone who doesn’t know car parts."
bad,Place is wack. The dont pay much to survive out in this world. Most people have 2 or 3 jobs because this place pays so low. All the parts are junk so you'll have to get use to customers coming back mad
bad,"The store manager was horrible, pay was horrible, she would call at 7:15 am and tell us we had to be there by 7:30 knowing we live 20-25 minutes away. The company was okay, but like I said, the pay was awful, and I can gladly say it was not worth my time"
bad,"First of, I loved the people I worked with.. But management was another story.. You would be openly disrespected and screamed at all the time. Manger would accuse team members of thief all the time even when no one was stealing. Assist manager would milk the clock every shift and collect 30-45 minutes of ot a night, yet no one else could stay even a minute late."
bad,"General manager promised to train me for a management position but he left in the middle of training for a better opportunity. That left a bad taste in my mouth. After the GM left , thats when everything went downhill.. The assistant manager seemed to be unable to handle the workload. Granted, he worked 7 days in a row due to the fact that there are only 2 managers that worked there. One who opened and one who closed. The best part of the job were the discounts. The worst parts of the job were the customers, management and workload. This is a great part time job for someone who is not looking for a career."
bad,"I thought very highly of O'Reily, even took a pay cut. Big mistake! Having reached an agreement during the hiring process if the golds were met and etc..compensation would be revised. I met the the golds, and got acknowledged. Guess what ? Came time for evaluation nothing came thru. Manager, District Manager caught a Mental Flatulence  and did not honor their end. In my case it was clear that its not what you know its who you know. I sincerely believe the company has potential and great product, its comes down to management."
bad,Company pushed this culture of team work and excellent customer service.  Unfortunetly it was all lies and propaganda.  Customers came last and products were inferior.  Management was very poor from district supervisors to store level.
bad,"My days at O' Reileys were stress filled, with co-workers who were very disrespectful. i tried to come in with a positive attitude but would get mocked and treated poorly by other workers and some managers. With that being said I left to find better opportunities where I would be more valued and treated more fairly among my co workers and a better environment."
bad,"At the particular store I work at management is poor. the current manager will give the people he likes the best shifts even if they don't have the knowledge that is required. He even discriminates against reservists and National Guard Soldiers. If your are either do not apply to work here. "
bad,"Enjoyable coworkers."
bad,"This is not a position with the company you would want if your a family man. Some of the DM's for this company are no good and if your not a part of the ""boys club"" they will not give you the help you need at store level. Upper Management really need to take a deep dive and really spend some time training their DM's."
bad,Steady work and pay. Spent a lot of time trading employees that weren't qualified for the job they were hired for. Bad manager at my store. Promote employee based on their sex and not job skills.
bad,"Underpaid for cost of living. No matter how hard you work, you're lucky if you get a 10 cent raise. It isn't team work no matter how hard they push, ""We work as a team""."
bad,This is a college or after high school job don't think of it as any more.  It's very click oriented if you aren't in the DM's buddies you'll carry the load and never get the promotions no matter what.
bad,"It started out as a relaxed and fun environment to work in, but became hostile. Managers were sleeping with employees, I never knew what mood my manager would be in on a day to day basis or even throughout the day. My coworkers were great to be around and we had a lot of fun. Over all, management was very difficult to work with as well as very demanding. I was told at one point that ""we are human and we are going to make mistakes, but we have to be flawless"". I was written up on several occasions for making mistakes such as forgetting a part."
bad,Some of the people are great. The company will tell you what you want to hear to keep you there but never hold up to the deal. The discounts are good. The pay is horrible
bad,"I was sexually harassed and was terminated for sticking up for myself.  They are sexist and dont care about you.  I enjoyed the job, but dont expect them to stick up for you unless you are a man."
bad,"Busy, dangerous, low pay, stressful, dirty. Complaining customers everyday, confusing inventory. Hours of operation was too long."
bad,Team members where amazing and good people. Management left alot to be desired at the store level. First manager quit and left me to run the store for 5 months then his replacement didn't even know how to run a store.  Let alone manage personal
bad,"Working alone is the best way"
bad,"The coworkers I had at O'Reilly were some of the greatest people I ever met. It was one of the co-managers that made this place bad to work at. That and the mostly clueless customers that wanted parts fast, but were hard to get answers out of."
bad,"I do not recommend working for this company, several people quit and being the night manager was forced to work 7 days a week for 9 weeks straight. I never got to see my wife and 2 month old son, in fact one week after he was born i had to begin working non stop. I was told it wasnt their problem, DM did nothing about it and told us other stores were suffering too, they suffered for 6 days where as we were forced to work 9 weeks non stop and it is still happening. Manager and Assnt. Manager made sure they had days off. Where as the rest of us had to make do."
bad,"Let me start by saying that I was a parts delivery specialist. My main duty was to deliver parts to our commercial clients. That being said, there were other aspects to my job. I didn't have a problem with my commercial clients. For the most part, they were all awesome. It was the company and my manager. First off, the manager didn't care about the store or his employees and that's what made it hard to work there but on top of all of that, the company could have paid more than what they did to their employees especially for the job and what we had to deal with."
bad,"The job in itself isn't that bad, hiring and retaining a solid team is almost impossible, almost as impossible keeping your payroll down and your sales up to keep your overlords happy. "
bad,Favoritism and a lot of broken promises here. On top of that you work only 4-6hrs a day averaging 25-30hrs a week while others who kiss a** gets their 40hrs. A lot of ppl there at the time weren't getting advancements nor raises as promised. Management was ok and some were more of a pita to work for and with than others. Again only good thing working here was discounts and some co workers were good to work with.
bad,"The management at my first store was phenomenal but after helping out and relocating stores, I realized in several different stores that the management was extremely poor. They cared more about the employee that deals with commercial customers than retail customers. Drivers were yelled at and badly treated, the employee doing commercial customer service just sat around all day, and stock and merchandisers were pushed to the limits, taken for granted and given bad hours. I was so happy when I left there."
bad,Very poor upper management and unfair treatment of employees with no opportunity for advancement . No flexibility in scheduling and district management is a joke aka (tony roberts). You will pay for thier mistakes wihich in return is very unfair !!!
bad,"I worked in the Hub department and drove on the long runs, I would delivery transferred parts to other Oreilly stores!  We also had to pull part orders and put them in totes to be delivered and help out dispatchers that worked in the hub department, sometimes it was hard to find the parts you needed to complete the order!  Parts not being in the right location!  The Store Management, didn't really understand how much stress was in the Hub department, dispatchers getting the order out for us delivery drivers and the trouble of keeping up with the maintenance on the fleet of trucks and keeping them in good working order!  The pay for everyone should be better that 8.00 dollars an hour!  The Manager, District Manager, are not respectful of the employees they do have and the hard work that most, all employees perform for the company!"
bad,"There isn't a lot of room for advancement, management could be better, and the pay is terrible.  Converting from part-time to full-time isn't very easy, and too much micromanagement."
bad,"Well established company, always expanding.  However there's no ""promoting from within"" like they claim.  They never care about their employees.  The pay is pathetic for the experience you're expected to know and be able to do.  The company expects you to be a mechanic and work on peoples cars for free to the customer and pay you less than any mechanic would ever get paid. They call that all customer service.  I don't have a problem with taking care of my customers, I just don't like being taken advantage of. They pay on commission, not much but it's a nice bonus if you have decent sales.  Internal theft is high, after reporting it it never seems to get taken care of.  Unless you're just really hard up for money, I'd suggest finding a real job.  There's no future here.  "
bad,"typical day at work was stocking inventory, driving to deliver car parts. I had my own register once I was no longer needed for driving in the day, i would help customers in the front"
bad,"OReilly auto Parts was an ok place to work."
bad,"nothing special about this place management puts favoritism over hard work. The pay is standard minimum wage, the benefits suck, and don't bother with management to help you with workman's comp if you have an on the job accident which happens to often especially on delivery routes."
bad,"I've been with the company 3 years now and each year gets worse. Horrible job for career advancement as it is full of empty promises. Upper management wants supervisors to run everything in the store. Supervisors are at maybe 11/hr despite the store making 5 million a year and staffing about 30 people. For 11/hr you are expected to maintain inventory, clean, retail, handle store money and deposits, install some parts, perform audit paperwork, deliver parts to wholesale customers, and babysit everyone underneath you and expect to work 50+ hours cause you have to come in when people call out or stay until 3am when you have to backup the store systems and strip/rewax the floors."
bad,Highs and lows.  Commission not at all great.  Low wages.  Poor management.  Dirty job.  In store technology not up to date.  Although good job to have if you do a lot of car repair.
bad,Would be a good job if I didn't get under payed.  Seems management  only cared about the bottom dollar and not happy employees.
bad,my co-workers were a great group of people. did not care for our new district manager or warehouse manager. Learned a lot about the distribution operations.
bad,customers are all angry people and love to yell. No advancement
bad,they don't care much about there employees. And they don't run it very well there.
bad,Overworked understaffed stores that do not allow the employees time enough to maintain the store and take care oftheir customers.
bad,"This company is no different then any other, there all concerned about sales and having more revenue every quarter to attract investors. Although there is one place where they lag, when it comes to taking care of there employers. I been working there for 2 years and have one of the highest sales in my district and every evaluation at the end of the year i only get a 5 cent raise.  Working in this type of business i seen things that i find unethical to my perspective, and working with these managers and regional managers have given me a different perspective on life itself, more of a motivation to keep going to school and look for a job that has a future so i can make a career out of and expand my horizon to new and exciting things."
bad,The management was terrible. I didn't learn anything there and I did not enjoy my time there.
bad,They treated me badly and never going to that job. The manager only care about himself all the time.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"A typical day would be pulling parts, stocking parts and later doing commercial driving or route driving."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with but, manager was not very professional or good to employees. I didn't get the hours I needed and ended up not making any money."
bad,I've been with O'reilly Auto parts for almost Three Years. I love working with the retail and commercial customers but I hate that they refuse to pay more. I do much more than my job requirements and was denied a raise this year. It's really sad that I work so hard for a company that doesn't appreciate all that i do.
bad,I got hired there before they opened the store. I brought them most of there customers. I made most of the sales. They didn't like to pay people properly. They discriminate. They pick and choose who to write up. They put people as managers who would rather play then run the store like it should be. I do not regret working there. Every idea put to them to get or gain more business was ignored.
bad,"When I needed to change my schedule for a second job, they really worked with me on this. I needed to work an early morning shift and was given the 7:30-3:30 shift to accommodate this need."
bad,I worked there for about 6 1/2 years I can honestly say the job was good at first the pay is not much the only raise they give you is like 5 or 10 cents at a time upper management promise a lot and they do not deliver but they expect you to sell a lot with very little intensive they promote younger kids that know very little and pay them more that the ones that have more knowledge and experience over all will not work there again unless they pay more.
bad,pretty much a “big corporation” sought to make “higher class” executive employees wealthy through the use of high mark up and under paid “lower class” employees
bad,"I would not recommend. I as well as many others get treated horrible, managment even laughs at me. Im constantly bullied and put down. Ive asked for a transfer but they do not want to.  I have been told about promotions and the ability to move up so for me to start learning the position and i do great to the point i do the job without the pay and never given it but given to others i train for them."
bad,"Management is not suitable for what is required of them. Favor is given to people who have worked for the company for many years. They stand around and talk all day, and then complain when asked to do their job."
bad,"My background with this company includes serving as a Retail Service Specialist, Parts Specialist, and a Commercial Parts Specialist. Most recently, I worked at O'Reilly Auto Parts as a parts expert with a diverse group of ""parts people"", where my responsibilities included handling store deposits, open/close a variety of stores, restocking shelves, annual inventory, customer returns, assisting new team members, maintaining delivery trucks and dealing with thieves was very common."
bad,Indoctrination would have a new employee believe that there is a workplace culture of tolerance and inclusive like a “family”. It doesn’t take long to feel the corporate tension and the sole motivating factor of the corporation is bottom-line dollar.
bad,"The pay and benefits are good. You'll also have good job security. However, if you're trying to learn anything and advance your career, get ready for a lot of lying and gas lighting. They tell you about all these opportunities but as soon as you try to ask questions about said opportunities, nobody knows anything and you can't get a straight answer.  They just tell you to keep working hard and that they'll get back to you. Then you've wasted nine months asking the same questions and getting the same run around with no progress made whatsoever. Disrespectful management that has no regard for employees daily lives or goals dominate the atmosphere."
bad,"Poor management, slow, and no advancement. Low pay, they are very cheap. They say they pay you with a discount on parts. Most you'll make is 9-10 and hour. managers probably make 12-15 a hour"
bad,"O’Reilly is a big company there is room for advancement if you're into double standards, pay could be a bit better but the checks don't bounce and thats a plus. I worked with a lot of good people, an a couple of chicken doo ones. Biggest bonus is the employees discount!!!"
bad,dont try and balance a home life and work life with this job. you will spend more time at work dealing with nonsense then you do at home with your family
bad,"Fairly easy job, stressful at times, very easy job to keep (no one that seems to need to be fired, gets fired) 5 store managers in 4 years and the same asst. manager for 30+ years that refuses to do his complete job ( telling employees ""That's not my job"", telling customers that ask for a manager "" there isn't a manager working right now"") Don't expect any raises... Waited 3+ years, just got to $13"
bad,"The stores are very poorly staffed and the management are expected to "
bad,Working their for one year I saw pass by 4 managers. Store is a reck. People would steal money and blamed each other. Lazy management. The store did have potential but the DM puts morons as managers.
bad,"Is a great bad pay job, multi tasks, stressful bad nothing out of control, dinamic, I really liked, but the management is Horrible, they don't have any respect for employees, if no or she management don't like you are you done, you loose your job because they're manager"
bad,I’ve worked at a few parts stores! They are all the same poo pay and everything! Save yourself the headache! Don’t work for an automotive chain parts store!
bad,"Oreillys does not take good care of their employees. Low pay, inconsistent hours, and strong lack of management. My experience started off decently until I got promoted to assistant store manager. I then saw how the company treats their dedicated employees and its forced me to seek work elsewhere"
bad,If you want to work for unqualified store managers petrified of losing their jobs and willing to throw anyone else under thebus to throw the brass off track then this is the place for you.I worked for three other Headliners and left for financial reasons and this company without question lacks employee loyalty the likes ive never seen before.
bad,All they care about is there loads not the safety of the driver. And they don't care if the loads are legal or not. Made you go out in any kind of weather.
bad,"Poor management is rampid in this corporation. Good buddy mentality, extreme favoritism,and hostile work environment. So sad that district and regional managers just look the other way and promote such bad management."
bad,"Everyone actually running the business in the stores are paid trash, while the corporate folks are well compensated for sending emails to multiple recipients"
bad,"A typical day would consist of putting up incoming inventory, while answering phones,taking care of of paper work. Filling orders  for out going parts,while trying to keep a good attitude."
bad,"Upper management is all about advancing themselves. Corporate is not there for the employees. It's all about the money for upper management. That's how they get paid. They tell you what you want to hear, not the truth. Fellow employees were good and hard working. As a driver you are replaceable. After 13 yes and making less than 13 an hour. It's not worth the time I put into it."
bad,"Only hire pt with no benefits, pay is very low, high turn over rate, stressful work environment, it is a good job for high school or college students you just need a small income"
bad,If you like hard work long hours otherwise teamwork and management are not in it for you. If you are liked you're good if not won't last long. High turnover can't keep good employees.
bad,"Very very slowly paced, may be because of the small town feel but also no drive within the whole company. Makes it very hard to want to do good in the store."
bad,I worked very hard for the company and loved my job.  But upper management doesn’t have your best interest in mind.  I worked very hard for what I achieved there and wasn’t truly appreciated for the sales I made or leading the store in sales almost every month.  I was always honest and dotted my “I”’s and crossed my “t”’s and was let go for reporting an issue I had come up prior to my employment with Oreillys.
bad,"Learned a lot about cars, stressful environment but you can make a lot during the summer because of incentive program. Very slow during the winter. Good learning experience"
bad,"Don't expect much, they don't like paying hourly, they claim if you sell more you earn more, at less than half of a percent commission you better be the only parts store in the county and the busiest in the nation. seriously its a joke"
bad,just looking for ways to write you up if your part-time always stuck with closings. They talk abut being a family company but it might be for higher ups but not for workers. Only day that they close is for Christmas.Very stressful
bad,"A typical day day at O'Reilly's is stressful. "
bad,"really bad pay it took close to 7 years to get 2.00 extra an hour including a few promotions.  management is the worse i have seen "
bad,Very fast paced workplace. Cannot take off for emergency unless somone covers for you. They like to pick favorites alot and if you are part time your stuck with all the bad shifts and placment.
bad,"Pay is ok and benefits offered after 6 months. That was a recent change. Environment is dirty,dust on everything. Hot during spring and summer. No air except in office areas. Just fans blowing. Water offered after 90 degrees. Long hours as well during the warmer months. Winter they cut alot of peoples hours. Management is terrible.  Most people would say thats the worst part about it."
bad,I couldn't afford as a young single male to live on my own and work here. I am jewish and my manager refused to allow me to have off for sabot (Sabbath) even after calling HR nothing was ever done. I was promised my own store and management and even though I continuously reminded and asked about it nothing was ever done by management.
bad,"Oreilly Autoparts is a typical retail job. You will have to work odd hours, including holidays. The management is not overly concerned about what their employees are doing. There’s not much to say about the job."
bad,"Don't do it. Any Auto parts store is way more structured, pays better and is much more professional than O'Reilly Auto Parts. Napa or AutoZone is the way to go."
bad,This job was temporary and had issues with the management before I was hired . It’s quite tedious to explain and wasn’t a good environment. Not a learning environment and they allow customers to mistreat you.
bad,"From the moment you clock in you are on your feet picking parts and"
bad,Minimum raise in pay for delivery position. Could improve their method of rewarding and encouraging faithful employees that show up and perform their job duties everyday with no issues instead of making them feel expendable.
bad,"Stressful workplace with no direction, supervisors show favoritism with subcontractors and employees, finding fault in everything you work hard to do."
bad,"It's pretty difficult the first 2 weeks from rushing workers to have the skills, but afterwards its pretty easy. The only thing that I hated was the shady stuff in the background like picking up payments later (sometimes late in the day or 1 or 2 days without a charge account,)"
bad,"Have been told many times that I need to place this company over my family. Never going to happen. The management is lacking and likes to have others do their job, while skipping out early. Upper management is no better as they ignore issues until you threaten to quit, then do nothing to remedy the problem."
bad,I personally had a horrible experience working here. The employees and the job were fairly easy going and enjoyable but a lot of the management did their own thing when it came to the warehouse. You seen the blatant favoritism and how it was their way or the highway.
bad,"You can learn ALOT working here. You meet all kinds of mechanics/shop owners looking for parts you have no idea what it's used for, and they end up breaking down the need to knows of the product. Also the system gives a great description on what every auto part is used for, how to install and un-install parts. Good job LOW pay wage"
bad,I have worked for O'Reillys for almost 4 years. This is a very stressful and underpaying job.The upper management is a joke. They do not listen to their employees at all. If I didn't have a family to feed I would not Work there.
bad,"Store manager didn't know anything, assistant manager didn't do his job. They were thieves trying to get other employees in trouble. you have no social life working there. Literally they always want you to come in and come from open to close. Then on top of that, the store manager was always trying to fire someone behind their backs. Worst company and none of these people are professionals."
bad,"The company lacks the drive to keep up with modern day technology.  Company pushes for better pph every year without investing anything for the team members that are trying to hit the targets set by corporate.  Poor training for any upgrade done to old system example (people from corporate came into upgrade picking software, loaded up new link and just asked us to figure it out because he was also unsure of how it really works).  To get an answer means going to your supervisor who goes to HR who has to got through a couple people at corporate office before you get an answer.   This is either a lack of training or trust."
bad,"There was so much drama and favoritism in this store! Unfortunately, the manager is a non-confrontational personality so the problems were left to fester. Apart from that, O'Reilly's pay is awful, the benefits are too expensive, and I don't feel the company values their employees as people, just numbers. A means to an end, if you will."
bad,"Management is either hit or miss on if they will treat you well or not. The pay is pennies on the dollar. the culture for fellow employees is usually pretty good, as for the company culture they will drill you with how good they are and they are pretty good at expense control and by that I mean they don't pay you well, will give you as little hours as possible, very small raises if any, the benefits are bad and not paid for at all. The hardest part of the job is building up the muster to continue to show up everyday. The most enjoyable part is if you work on cars on the side you get a pretty good discount on parts."
bad,"Poor upper management, who only care about lining their pockets and not the employees who work under them.  Constant revolving door of people you work with along with very little pay."
bad,"O'reilly's as a company is ok, but the store that I work at is not a good environment.  The manager will swear at his employees and throw merchandise."
bad,The managers blamed the workers for their mistake in our inspection and we got punished for that. Our Manager had misplaced the part and had everyone looking for it for about 2 hours.
bad,God forbid if you do not know how to be a functioning alcoholic and/or play golf; you will never advance in that regard otherwise. I can only hope that growth comes from sincere evaluations on all sides...
bad,Not enough opportunity for advancement throughout the company. Low top out rate. Only department that should be on production is order processing all other departments shouldn't be. Company morale is very low. High turnover rate for management as well as regular employees
bad,I have worked in two different stores in two different states and they couldn't be more different management wise all I can say if you want to work for this company don't do it in CA you wont go far
bad,"This job can be rather difficult at times, as finding a lot of parts can be very difficult. The system O'Reilly has is put together in a pretty lazy fashion. It seems unfinished, and like they didn't actually take the time to load things from paper catalogs into the system. "
bad,not a good place to work at. low paying salary and benefits are horrible. not so much growth in company. my store had horrible management and time schedules.
bad,People are great and lots of work to keep you busy but if you hang with the wrong crowd or voice your opinion the District managers will make your stay very uncomfortable until you quit.  Promised a lot of perks before being hired and the day i was hired was told they were not offered anymore.
bad,Antiquated computer system that hinders the employees and customers and has too many barriers for top performance. Need to write more.
bad,"This job offers no incentive to excel.They hire people to fill a void, to try and control the overtime, whether they do the job outlined for 'everyone', but don't try to make sure everyone is a part of getting that job done, basically putting the burden on just a few. The responsibilities are not accepted by all as a part of their job and no one to enforce otherwise. The wages are set with no increase as incentive. Also trying to control the wages paid out by forcing more duties, again, on the few."
bad,"Other than the lack of pay, it's not a bad place to work for. If you prove yourself to management it's easy to advance. Some management ate more flexible than others when it comes to you having a family."
bad,Its a decent starter jib but has little chance of turning into a sucessful career. Its mostly corporate games and agendas its a good job for teens. There is ni chance of a living wage.
bad,It used to be a fun and laid back place to work. But when management shifts and new ones come in. They pick and choose who they like and want to be there
bad,"It has become a ""you scratch my back I scratch yours"" company with very poor management from regional,district to local store management.This company does not pay well at all no matter how much experience you have"
bad,semi flexible work schedule and good people to work with. Fun working environment. easy to learn how to sell parts and deal with people.
bad,People talked behind my back.  People talked extensively about personal issues and didn't get their work done in the office.
bad,"A typical day is ok but when you are an experienced employee the district managers would rather hire and promote the completion's employees other than awarding their own a promotion because they might have to pay them more therefore taking money away from their bonuses. Some district manger would rather hire outside company, pay lower wages other that promote from within and get more sales using team member that has already proven to excel."
bad,"Sexist manager, unfair pay, and degrading management , I work as a parts delivery driver, and do counter sales., I help customers find what they need for their cars, as well as give advice, and help install batteries,wipers, and headlights."
bad,"Typically, my job description is Delivery Parts Specialist, which gives me the opportunity to deliver parts to commercial accounts.  Unfortunately, my boss has taken advantage of the fact that I have given of my time and efforts and I have allowed myself to do many other jobs around the store that have given him the opportunity to take it more easier around the store; putting more strain on myself, because of deadlines.  I never mind the ability to work and learn new positions within the workplace, but I don't like to feel the resentment of having someone taking advantage of someone that they know they are already paying lower than they know they should be getting paid but then also taking advantage of them at the same time.  The other problem is that when I finally find out from my District Manager that I should never have been doing those jobs and that those are his responsibilities and then because he was given a reprimand of the situation, he decided to cut my hours, which as a single mother, I can't afford to have happen.  "
bad,Look for something else close to home no room for advanced all about who you know not what you know they give you water in summer if its over 100 degrees for 5 days in a row the make you work long hours and threat you with your job if you do not work the long hours
bad,"Management does not express any consistency during daily operations.  As a former hiring manager, the company does not offer a competitive wage structure."
bad,"a typical day includes delivery driving to commercial accounts, customer service, putting freight away and merchandising"
bad,place was ok. close to home. store was always extremely busy at all times. sometimes had to deal with angry and irate customers there whole opening and closing policy's never seemed to be very streamlined.
bad,"It was part time which was ok. and 80% of the employees were great u just had one or 2 that just were not good people. had a great store manager but a horrible branch manage. and me being a people person my interaction with the customers was great, even made a few friends."
bad,"Supervisors are grossly under paid. They have very outdated systems and set unrealistic goals, then set a ""bonus"" based upon these goals. You as a supervisor have no control over most of the targets that are set and are reliant on 22 other supervisors to do their jobs to reach those goals. The medical insurance is lousy and the other benefits are not much better."
bad,A typical day is long.  I manager the entire store.  From commercial accounts to retail customers to dealing with all corporate things to do.  I work well over 70 hours a week.  I've learned about the parts end of the automotive business.  The most enjoyable part is doing sales calls to commercial accounts.  The hardest part is the ever changing message and direction from corporate.  My store team is the best in the business.  I am lucky to work with the people that were kind enough to give me the opportunity to bring them on.
bad,"i begin my day by counting my money followed by getting money from the safe for the parts specialist that are on duty,i provided my company with great customer services as well as sale parts and product i supervise up to 4 people per shift as well as cleaning, counting the safe, end of day reports when i close the store"
bad,Mostly did a lot of driving but there were no opportunities for advancement like was told when I got hired that was the hardest part considering I learned more than most and was striving for a better position and the raise I was told I would get. I love working on cars so that's what I enjoyed the most and being able to find parts that other co workers that have worked there 11 yrs could not find.
bad,"Worked hard for over a year and a half, only to have them outsource my job (store installation) to another company who had no idea what they were doing. Got paid less and less the harder we worked because the faster we finished the store, the less hours we got with no compensation for speed. One .27 cent raise the whole time i worked there. Laid off, would not hire me in warehouse (only wanted to hire me as a driver and i didn't have a driver's license at the time) and would not tell me why they would not hire me. Friend was pregnant and working in the warehouse, they told her if she couldn't do her job (lifting heavy objects included) that she didn't need to work there. They do not care about their people."
bad,"This company doesn't care about your life. They are focusing on the business only. They expect you to work al day but this is not told at time of hire. When you are done with your assignment, you have to stay until everyone is done. NOT FAIR AT ALL!!!"
bad,"I loved the type of job, however pay was lied to during interview and was lied to about my raise.  Would not recommend working here if you wish to make money."
bad,"Decent job, more pay needed for the services they want  to provide to the customers. Customers and manager think you are a mechanic and will work for free"
bad,"Working at Oreillys was definitely an experience. I worked at two different stores. The first store was light and fun atmosphere. The second store was a complete nightmare. The manager was a complete tool. A company man through and through. Would not help or work with his employees instead made it harder for them to do their job. And not to mention the pay is horrible. As a ""parts specialist"" we deal with frustrated customers dealing with some serious car problems and we get paid next to nothing to deal with it while the company is a billion dollar company."
bad,Rock the calls a joke. Pay for what you have to endure and do as a parts specialist is a joke. Promote the wrong people. Hire people that know nothing. Rushed to do things. The list is way to long to put on here.
bad,"Racist comments from other employees, lack of respect for female employees. More important for company profits over a living wage. Employer doesn't correct issues let's them run. Lack of education and experience in the management team."
bad,"The individuals that I work with are fun loving and create a fun-loving atmosphere, however, the attitude of the company is that of a typical corporation with very little consideration for the morale of the employees.  Main concern seems to be financial profit for the company."
bad,Long hours low pay will not pay good employees to stay. Even employees that exceed expectations are under paid and underappreciated. Overall not a very good environment
bad,Hard to advance up in the store.  Everyone is very nice and easy to get along with.  Pay wasn't great but the discounts for parts was.  It is a good job but probably not a career.
bad,Working many hours with low pay. Working nights and weekends because  management didn't want to. Working every holiday because management didn't want to. Management needs to work various shifts to see what is going on in all aspects of the store and employees. Making sure that the employees are doing what they are supposed to do.
bad,Main sales associate who dealt with account holders was a bully and disrespectful to the other employees if they didn’t be his buddy and down grade the company. Management wouldn’t deal with him. I was a driver and he rarely sent me on deliveries. Only his buddy got to deliver. I mostly checked in freight and put freight away. He would talk poorly about the customers and account holders. Talk back to manager in front of customers but he was untouchable. So I left
bad,My opinion of being employed by O’Reilly auto parts is the benefits are great but pay raises are very unusual and overall work place could be a little better.
bad,"I had fun the first  3 years at O'Reilly's.  Making the sales go up and dealing with all the shops in that area  But the 4th year the District manager was trying to transfer me to a different O'reillys . For no reason just because he thought he could."
bad,"The management was young people , they played around and didn’t do their jobs as they should have done . Chasing young girl customers around the store . Definitely not a professional work place at all ."
bad,"While working at this company I was mistreated from the start.I was constantly harassed and disrespected by fellow employees and customers. "
bad,"I've done 3 tours( 1995/2002/2010 of this company and the name of the company has changed three times. Despite who owns the company or the name on the door (is: Kragen,CSK or Oreillys) it's still ran and managed by the same people locally. I was present during the ""Change over"" to Oreillys back in 2011 and was regaled with promises of making more money and opportunity, well after everything settled down the local DM came and changed managements pay. They reduced everyone's hourly wage and established if you hit your ""sale goals"" you get a ""bonus"" which basically equaled your original pay!  "
bad,"Not bad but not good if you have any questions please contact me. I do not like this companies idea in the state of Michigan, however I have no idea whether it's the same everywhere else."
bad,Management was not the best store manager was not so helpful in training or helping out with questions in the location I worked at the manager would alway leave for a couple of hours every day
bad,I was an order selector using a computer generated voice headset-hated it.  They would tell us we rocked one day then we sucked basically the next-as a group.  They would refrain or were unable to make one on one judgements on individuals.
bad,"So average day would be answering phones while trying to wait on customers at counter too. Putting up stock on certain mornings,taking out the trash,sweeping the floor. Deliver auto parts to garages listen to the radio. Working part time sucks I can't get enough hours!! No benefits and no overtime. So if u r a teenager a great job for u."
bad,"First of all the discount they give you is actually crazy but they'll be willing to screw you at the drop of a hat. Do not seek this as permanent job or career path, out dated equipment and our district manager got an attitude with me simply because I said I didn't like the style of hat we have to wear"
bad,"When trying to advance in the company, they dont help you move up even though they say they will or do. They underpay and overwork employees. Dont care about employees family needs when it comes to scheduling. Have best discount program for auto parts stores. The pay is terrible. Can go work at McDonald's and start out making more money. They have a great job culture in writing but actually implementing it is another story."
bad,"I worked in the warehouse as a Order Processor. Most days are over 12 hours and Mondays are over 15 hours. Strenuous work with little regard of health of employees. Walking on the grates all day does a toll on your body.  The only good was the employee discount. If you missed a day of work and brought a doctors note you still get in trouble. The most enjoyable part of my day was talking with my coworkers (which you get in trouble for). Between the mean looks and people talking bad behind your back its nice. Amber is the only one holding the place together and she is being worked to the bone, Dont work. Its under staffed and the people are over worked."
bad,The manager would change the schedule at the end of the day and not ask you about the change then when you would come in at your regular time you would get written up for being late. Manager stays in his office and yells for you if he wants you.  Absolutely no management ability. If you live in SW Georgia stay out of Moultrie's O'Reilly's.
bad,"Nothing makes any sense here in terms of how the company is run. Management is a joke, employee compensation and benefits are inadequate. Stores are filthy and ridden with mice. Poor work environment with little respect for lower level employees."
bad,"If you like 6x6 cubicle walls for the next 30 years this is the place for you. If 1-3 percent pay increases sound exciting, this is the place for you. After the trump tax breaks of 2018 O'reilly rewarded their employees with a break reduction from 15 minutes to 10 and removed tea bags from the coffee bars."
bad,"I worked at the distribution center for 4 1/2 years and was able to move around the warehouse to different departments to learn/experience what I was interested in but as time went on the place became a joke and from what I hear its just getting worse and worse. They claim to have all these culture values but management couldn't care less. I loved my job, my supervisors and most of my co-workers and actually really enjoyed going to work everyday in the first couple of years and it makes me really sad that its gone down hill as much as it has. Hopefully one day certain people will pull their heads out and get rid of the worthless people before they completely lose all the great ones."
bad,"Worked there for nearly a year. Went from a delivery driver to Retail Services Specialist. Was supposed to be the Assistant in training. I got paid the very rock bottom of minimum wage at the time which was $7.50/hr. I got promoted due to seniority and nobody else wanting the job. The store was always behind on paperwork because the manager spent all his time at the register cause we couldn't keep people due to it being really busy, huge job learning curve, required training you could never get away from a register to do due to lack of staff. Got accused of stealing out of the blue and laughed at them cause I spent most of my time at the register or doing inventory or handling customer problems as I was usually the manager on duty. Then the store manager comes to me saying he'd been working me too many hours as a part timer. I was working 50-60 hours a week. Sounds great but when you make the least you can get paid it doesn't amount to much of anything. I tried to cut me down to 12 hours a week. I turned in my keys and left. I got along with my manager but instead of promoting me to full time and after all my hard work. I'd be mad to call them a good employer. It wasn't all bad, but what little enjoyable moments there were way too many bad ones."
bad,If your getting into management be ready to give your life to the place. They don't care about throwing you in a store with no employees. Unrealistic that the expect a list to be done in the morning and not have a counter guy there. This company is losing great people daily. If your looking for management with this company I would run.
bad,The pay doesn't match the job requirements and stress of job.They want you to  be security but when you kick people out they just come back during another shift cause no one tells them they can't be there.
bad,typical day at work starts off slow and then slowly gets more busy as the day goes on. learned how to merchandise at this job as well as do planogram resets.
bad,management wasn't good they were always picky about what you wore and you have to be a hard worker and know all your car parts or you will be lost but later get the hang of it
bad,"A typical day as a delivery specialist at O'Reilly's consisted of pulling parts as specified on invoices, driving them to commercial customers, picking up customer returns. Management has changed of the course of my employment and while some of the supervisors are not as enjoyable to work under the general and assistant managers are great. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are not stuck doing and seeing the same people all day."
bad,when i arrived to work first thing we will collect our daily orders to process them for customer who place an auto part order. after processing the order i sent it to the shipping line to be sent off for customer to received the order in time.
bad,I was very stressed out working here. Management was horrible. Changed management frequently and none of them knew what they were doing. Would not recommend working here.
bad,"Management would rather spend time chatting with certain employees rather then being a team player, and helping everyone customers included. it is more is a high school setting with all the gossip, then a professional workplace."
bad,All employees do want they wanted when they want. Rarely are daily tasks performed and customers are neglected. There is a severe lack of management all the way up to Regional Manger.
bad,"i would go in at different times, depending on what route you were driving, maybe you would have to go pick my parts, go drive your truck around ,when all your parts are ready you would load your truck, and start your deliverys."
bad,"Management has to hire and pay minimum wage if possible at all times. Companies believes in not being highest paid, raises come at discretion of district manager no set salary for employees which can result in people getting paid more due to favoratism. Very high turnover due to low wages."
bad,Job was fair in it's work hours but not it's pay especially when you drive to other counties like Livingston in winter the dangers of the road were not worth the meesely $9.50/hr.
bad,"A great place to start working if your young and looking to get into the industry without having to go to school.  Advancement is easily obtainable, but will not pay much in the end."
bad,"Would not refer to anyone,unfair compensation, hours are unpredictable.I found that favoritism place a lot in this company and its all about who you know!"
bad,"they changed management and it all went down hill after that."
bad,It’s a good company just have the wrong people in manager position I just learned that my recent manager was the first black manager at oreillys because at For they didn’t want black managers
bad,I  loaded parts to be delivered to others Oreilly stores . Hardest part of job was no protection from weather while loafing parts.  Most enjoyable was my co workers.
bad,Orielys auto parts makes it seem like they want to promote from within but from what I have seen really dose. They will hire a parts specialist justbto make them run deliverys around to get around the driver backgoround check
bad,I recently worked for Orielly part time I don't believe management knows that the help on the store makes money while on clock at the store I have e seen employees install water pumps in vehicles i am 59 I worked there part time I had very little assistance ttyl.g to learn the systems the worse part is the trouble trying to find parts that's even if it is there  I DON'T need that stress and the foul language the associates used is out of this world very low professional additudes        this store is in Sandusky ohio
bad,"A typical day at work I saw management give favoritism, to certain employees, and let them do whatever they wanted. I learned that you customer service is 100% important and to sell related items. "
bad,"Management at the Helena store is bad. Among other things, they believe in punishing employees for simple things like not answering the phone exactly like they want. A demeaning attitude from management towards employees. Don't like to give time off. Never a word of praise from them."
bad,"Good place to work if you are first entering the job market. They do offer advancement opportunities, however those are dependent on your relationship with district managers and regional managers instead of job performance. Seems to be more like a ""good ole boy"" sort of system."
bad,Poor management at the store I was at . No leadership. Got yelled at by District Manager becausee work was not there and numbers could no be met unrealistic sales goals for the area
bad,"really nice people in the store, yet an upper managment that seemed to really not care about their employees, or their lives, demanding schedules, with an understaffed store makes for hard work"
bad,This place is for high school and college kids that need a part time job. This was a temporary job for me until I found a better paying job. It's not a place to pay your bills.
bad,"If there wasn’t a lot of drama in the workplace then it would be a great place to work , I love working with my coworkers, I just don’t like the customers who blame all there problems on us we just sell them parts , and help to our best ability but when we can do something then it’s bad customer service"
bad,poor management not enough hours for the hard working people that does their job plenty of hours for people that lean and do nothing a lot of people in one register
bad,"Compensation is salaried but required to work up to 50-60 hours without additional compensation."
bad,Not a good job for anyone with a family.  Hours aren't constant or are changed at last minute to suit others.  Management is poor or some people are promoted before they ready of the job.
bad,Good job to work for but they need to change the  Management and supervisors  at that job to much  Favoritism going on in the warehouse with friends and family
bad,Had been with the company almost 4yrs. Dm and rm dont have your back. Corporate is slow to take care of situations. Upper management needs to mature. High turnover rate. Dm and rm like drama. Worked every other day doubles and weekends and barely got to see my kids. Managed a severly failing store and turn it around and to hear month after I left its failing again. No support what so ever. Learned alot about what they are looking for and I was better than that.
bad,"Good management experience but that’s it, poor pay and no real advancement, pay increases don’t motivate you to move up. Good employee discount and semi good automotive training"
bad,"Not bad for a driving job \, a little underpaid. Management is rude and selfish. It was fun to meet all the different people we did business with. From small accounts to big companies it was pretty nice."
bad,"Training is key, Oreilly is starting to became a retailer rather than focused on wholesale. Retail is easier and cost less to service but the repair shops need someone they can depend on."
bad,"Good place to meet Kool people, hours are long during the begining of the week but cut down to 6 or 7 hour shift by the end of the week to meet 40 hours or less(during slow season). 40 plus hours during summer.  No AC for workers unless youre supervisor with office and barely any heat for winter.  Terrible supervisors who pick and chose employees for easier jobs and higher raises and excuses(Alot of favoritism).  Decent vacation that builds up with time but expesinve health care.  Enjoy working here because of the coworker but very repeative, unfair management, could over work you without help and almost like a high school setting. That's why people come and go often."
bad,not a long term option. too laid back. not enough structure. lackluster management. good team members. not the best pay for how much you do and what you deal with.
bad,"The company is good. Decent benefits, but hard on location of managers and their stores. The Regional managers and District managers listen and give advise as needed. Also great parts and customer service."
bad,"RSS is far too stressful to get past. You will have a pretty bad schedule. Very long days. Expect to be there for 9-10 hours everyday on the weekend with no lunch breaks. You will certainly learn about car parts over time but you will also learn that you're just a number. If you want to see something for your hard work then look elsewhere. This company is constantly chewing through employees. They just can't keep the good ones. If you genuinely love parts and can never know enough, then go to the competitors. Any other store will have better hours than Oreilly."
bad,"The store is poorly managed with a manager that will take advantage of you as an employee. The people working there are very rude and discourage job advancement through hazing. It is hard to get a raise and when you do get one, its only a .10 cent raise. You learn to develop thick skin. The employee discount is good but that's about it. The benefits are terrible, especially the heath care plan. The company pays poorly as a whole and has a high employee turnover rate."
bad,Hours and not very effective for a work life balance and the compensation for the amount of work preformed is not adequate. Management has little control over incentives and team member acquisitions.
bad,job changed completely from what I was hired to do. did the job of 3 people. was hired as a delivery driver then was weaseled out of that by other hired people.
bad,it was ok working four o Reilly's I had to put up car pacts it was easy some time then it was hard make you want to say I need a new job asap be it was ok
bad,Give you discounts on parts.Oreilly have good benefits and 401k.They have good workers there parts are quality.Some are the supervisors are good people
bad,i would say it had to be the most boring job. you stand around talking about car parts and some people come in and dont even know what kind of car they drive or even the part.
bad,"The job itself was easy enough. It is a warehouse....so hot in the summer, cool in the winter. The management could really care less for the employees. I would not work for this company again. I do not recommend anyone this job. Now they only hire part time so you don't get benefits."
bad,Would not recommend unless you really need a second job. But the Management can be hectic at times. With constant schedule change. It's really only good for money
bad,I was assistant manager with a manager and district manager above me and I could not take the underhandness that kept going on. I stayed for over 5 years but I just became unable to keep the things that were going on to myself and I left to pursue another opportunity
bad,Worked as a cashier and thats all there is to tell also knowing a couple of things about cars would help. Was a good part time job to get me to the next job.
bad,I enjoyed working there until my boss tried to make me go outside and pull weeds from the cracks of the parking lot and that's when I took it upon myself to talk to another manager and try to find another job
bad,They refuse to promote people that deserve and would rather bring in incompetent managers. They also dont give employees raises in which they deserve.
bad,"Supervisors don't do anything. They just assume that you will be doing your job correctly, but heaven forbid that you have a problem with one of your coworkers but if you do, good luck with them doing anything about it."
bad,"Warehouse work is warehouse work so just do what you can to make some money and find something better, otherwise you will be stuck for a while. Other than that, oreilly wasnt too bad. Great discounts on auto parts and cool management team."
bad,"Most days were typical of any automotive parts retail store. I would come into work and get my day started. I cleaned the counters, stocked the shelves, on truck day, put the stock away. When we had a commercial customer call for parts, I would deliver them. I was promoted to an RSS, Retail Service Specialist. My job was then to work along side the manager to raise the sales at night, also to close the store and make sure it is ready for the next shift in the morning."
bad,"going into zones and picking products needed"
bad,"When I first started O'reilly Auto Parts I loved it. Things went smooth. I was told I was going to be moved up to assistant mgr., also receive my own store as well and received everything except the title and my own store. They feed me lies about moving up, and took me for granted. I wouldn't recommend working for them to anyone anymore. At least the store I was at (1970) 600 broad street, Sumter, SC.  "
bad,"I had a drunk for a manager and a district manager that cared, but never did anything. The culture here promotes high turnover and hiring of people that are only bilingual, even in neighborhoods and areas that do not promote it. It is a serious turnoff to work for a company that does not care."
bad,"Was a good job while in school but the hours are very inconsistent and compensation is mediocre to average. I'm sure management in other areas may be better but very poor in the Columbus, LaGrange, Phenix City, and Opelika area."
bad,"The hourly staff at the Kansas City DC are very dedicated to their jobs!  About 1/3 of the supervisors also are dedicated.  Very poor leadership on the part of the DC Manager, with no desire to ensure adequate training for newly hired supervisors, and no desire to provide leadership development to those supervisors and managers who struggled, or were there to draw a check.  Failure to recognize when someone goes beyond minimum expectations in various sectors of what needed to be done, but concentrated on what didn't get done.  Strong tendency to regale certain employees because of race."
bad,Barely get paid above minimum wage and will rarely see any kind of raise.   Customers are a lot to handle because they think you're a mechanic because you work at an auto parts store.   Only benefit is you get a really good discount on car parts.
bad,"They barely pay there employees and managers and honest wage. The stores are clean however and nice to visit. Overall a decent place to work, but not to make a living."
bad,"The job its self is a rewarding job,You meet many very good people ,but as far as the coroparte ,the company was sued for not paying over time and honestly will push you like a horse to work women as well."
bad,"Sad, 1/4 of the people are absolutely great.  The rest well, u figure it out.  The training is non existence  and in some stores you have your little clicks, and if your not in that click just move on.  Majority of the people there will sell you out in a heart beat, luckily that never happened to me but letting anyone know that if interested.  The upper management have wonderfully and carefully know how to keep everything profitable by keeping everyone divided."
bad,"All I did was stock parts every day and ring people up. It was a fun at yes because you would get customers that were always nice and respectful. Management has changed so every thing about the store changed, our hours were less and well there were no benefits. The co- workers were so fun to be around, nice and it made it feel like areal fun place to be that is basically the only thing I miss of the store."
bad,"Manager does not know is job,  no communication,  does not treat customers right, a lot of partiality, poor wages"
bad,"if you need a steady job it is just for you!"
bad,Typical day of work is go in at 10 pick orders and put away stock by myself while everyone else stands around. Take out my hub delivery at 12:30 get back around 1:30 while warehouse still isn't done while everyone is standing around talking and smoking in the backroom. Go back to stocking by myself and pulling parts till my 3:45 hub delivery take that out get back around 5:30 finish warehouse and go home at 6. Hardest part about my job is trying to stock and pull orders while trying to be on time with my hub run while not getting any help and when we are suppose to have two hub drivers cause we have two routes and being the only driver so I have to do both routes while every store gets angry over me being a little late cause I have to take both routes that is two different ways and then get cursed at when I get back by the boss on why I didn't get there on time and be called  names when it's not even my fault.
bad,"A day at O'Reilly was always rewarding for myself. I always met productivity and had fun working by side many of people. The hardest part of this job was seeing it go from one of the best warehouses that I have worked in, turned into a bad place to work."
bad,"The job itself wasn't half bad. The management on the other hand was one of the worst I have ever worked for. The store manager would push his ""duties"" off on his employees, these were of the management position. I would not have minded it so much if I was getting paid to do it, but I was stuck at the pay rate of my position."
bad,"The typical day is basic retail operations. Employees may additionally perform light machining on brake rotors, or charge and test batteries and other automotive devices. This job was not a great deal different than my position at Discount Auto Parts, with exception that at O'Reilly's, no raises were possible at my job level even after multiple years of superior service, no promotions were locally possible, and extremely limited benefits are available to part time employees (the company standard in O'Reilly retail locations became part time with the passage of the Affordable Care Act). Managers I encountered were essentially caretakers of the stores, but had severely limited authority within the company structure to include their own stores. Coworkers were generally quite qualified and applied their knowledge to their respective positions. The hardest part of the job was the dead end experience represented by the corporate promotion freeze in my district and the lack of capability for advancement from the position I held. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction and assisting customers with their vehicle questions."
bad,"While the pay is adequate, the work is hard. The supervisors are often disrespectful and higher management doesn't care. Half the people who work there work really hard, while the other half slack off leaving the rest to do all the work. There is no air conditioning and the building is often in the 90's and humid. The break room is comfortable and has tv. There is a nice selection of food to buy if you don't bring your lunch. Lockers are offered for free and needed as some coworkers will steal from you if given the chance."
bad,"Although I was given an early promotion, only 6 months after hire, I then spent the next two and a half years waiting and wondering why I wasn't being trained to advance to a higher level all the while others were being promoted on what seemed like an incredibly biased bases. As the company grew during my employment, they left the family like culture they preached to become more and more about numbers and profits and less about values and ethics as it pertained to employees."
bad,"Start your day of with stocking the store, learned how to stock clean merchandise sales and customer service.  The management is what will kill this store . co workers are great"
bad,"The store ran pretty lean everyday, which was great for payroll. Everyone in the store had several responsibilities and knew what they were and how to complete them. My store management team was pretty inexperienced, but we managed together. I learned that listening to customers is the most important trait to have in customer service. The hardest part was trying to interpret what rules were in effect, because they seemed to change  quite often. The most enjoyable part was seeing the faces of satisfied customers and talking to them, and building work relationships with them."
bad,This job has the typical interaction with customers as in any retail business. I have worked hard including giving up days off and the rewards have just not compensated me for my dedication. It is a good job for a student or retired person but not for anyone who needs to make decent money in order to provide for a family.
bad,I enjoyed working with parts for vehicles learning new things every day and helping the customers. The co workers we a bit disrespectful and hard to get along with at times but other than that it wasn't bad. Management was the same way. The hardest part of the job was having to talk with un-happy customers.
bad,"Well rounded place to work for. Good people to work with."
bad,O'Reily's Auto Parts was a productive place of employment.
bad,nothing in this company make any sense they dont treat there empolys right at all
bad,"Not a bad job if you're young, not much of a career choice beyond that. Management is pretty all over the place with a terrible turn around with employee's, I saw 4 new employees in just over 2 months at the start, no real enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"good place to work if you are single and want nothing more than to work for little pay. Upper management does not believe in diversity or equality, so if you dont fit the mold you dont progress up the ladder or they will set you up to fail with no support"
bad,easy work. not enough to pay bills. and very hard to move up......
bad,Average paying job with a serious need of management overhaul.
bad,Would be a better work environment if management cared alittle bit more about the well beings of their employees.
bad,Upper management needs to learn more on people skills in managing employees.
bad,"They put effort into trying to explain what an awesome culture it is at O'Reilly Corporate, but when it comes down to taking care of their employees, management cares far more about the financial bottom line than their people. When legitimate disputes with management become apparent and are brought to the attention of HR, HR regularly and arbitrarily takes the side of the company/manager rather than impartially investigating the issue. Retaliation is common in this case being that there are few actual checks to managements power. "
bad,New Management was brought in april 2019. He was not a team player. He was a slacker in disguise. Fellow co-workers seemed to follow that. The new assistant manager was great though.
bad,"I’ll be honest: I don’t know a thing about cars so this was the wrong job for me. That said, I was a delivery driver so product knowledge wasn’t that important."
bad,"Your experience will vary from store to store. Some managers are easy going and have the leadership knowledge to help you and your store succeed. Others were placed there to fill the position and nothing more, and the store performance reflected that."
bad,They still pay min. wage. It is next to impossible to get a raise and if you do it is very little. Job is good for teenagers (1st or 2nd job) or those that are retired looking for something to do. No opportunity for a career unless min wage is ok for your household.
bad,"So many people working so hard with so little and for so little. Good employee discount and okay benefits. Expect your lifes work to be judged by how many packets of snake oil you can upsell. Great people at the store level as with most places. Not much appreciation or room for advancement unless you don't mind constantly kissing higher ups rears, are a minority, or sell $50k+/mo."
bad,"If you are looking for a job that will give you some extra income while attending school, O'Reilly Auto is for you. Given that this a retail store/customer service job, prepare yourself for customer ignorance."
bad,Manager needs to talk to his employees better. He would discipline employees in front of everyone. Needs to do it in the office. They need to closely look at people who try hard and hep them move up
bad,"Most men customers always need confirmation from another man your giving the the right part .Want to make fun of the questions you ask."
bad,"Management would constantly cancel essential store duties for stupid tasks that didn't matter. Instead of getting plan-o-grams finished, it was more important to the manager to be at the sales counter while the store was empty. Getting called in for a shift an hour before you're supposed to be there on a day you requested off. Last straw was getting written up for missing a shift because I was at a family members funeral."
bad,Poor management. No advancement opportunities. Low raises. Only benefit is cost of parts. Little to no overtime depending on department. Some departments work more overtime then you want (weekend work).
bad,"Poor and unfair management"
bad,"The pay wasn't enough to support an average lifestyle. The management throughout the company, at least locally, is a buddy-buddy system at its finest."
bad,As a Retail Service Rep it was very high maintenance Low management Skills. ive learned that you can learn alot of things if you are a junior with cars.
bad,"It was great when i first started at o’reilly auto parts, but once the new year hit there was a lot of changes made to the company that made the job extremely stressful. The management wasn’t always the best but they tried to help the best the could with everything. The one big thing that was a huge pain was getting weekends off to make plans or do anything. It’s very hard to do extra things with anyone/thing with this company. the schedules are never consistent and they change on a weekly basis"
bad,"If you want to take a stepping stone into sales and retail O'Reillys might be the place ti start. The company offers the opportunity to develop new skills in sales, customer service and can help you train for a management type role."
bad,I wasnt very happy with the work environment. When i was hired i was promised a certain salary amount that i never ended up getting so i ended up quitting after 8 months of asking and waiting for the agreed salary amount.
bad,"I was injured on the job and management kept wanting to have me do more work, they would try to push me more than my doctors notes allowed and when I did not do as they asked i was verbally assaulted."
bad,"Enjoyed working with my peers, and customers. Cars are my hobby so being able to work an environment where i was learning more about car parts was enjoyable. The only down side or frustrating part of the job, was management."
bad,Short handed almost all the time. Staff was over worked and the turn over was to high. For most part the staff i was in control over we worked as a great team
bad,Good parts no benefits I like classice autos so I enjoyed tjat part of the job but they micro manage everythihg push you to key holder to fast no training to move up
bad,"During my time working there we had 4-5 different managers. Work wasn't fast or stressful, it mainly came from the manager. Pressured on doing work that wasn't ours to do. One main focus for the job was customer support and making sure they were satisfied the first time. Had inside company competitions for gift cards for certain sales."
bad,I felt like I was doing everything. Little training at start of job. My little knowledge caused customers to get frustrated and leave. The manager would leave early every other day. Co workers would leave me to run the store while they take a smoke break. Assistant manager appeared to have no experience or ambition to do anything. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
bad,"If the hire ups would work with the culture they drill into us, this would be a 5 star company.  If you are salary, they will abuse you.  The company itself offers a lot of training and resources to help you be successful"
bad,"Great side job if you work in the auto industry. The job can be stressful when all the customers come in at the same time. Also, the job has way more responsibilities than listed in the job description."
bad,They went through so many people sometimes it was very hard to deal with other co workers cause they think they are their own boss. But most of the time it was fun . I liked all my customers that I had to deal with
bad,Sometimes I felt Management could have been better far as moving parts around for more space are even hiring someone one for a position. Had a big turnover ratio and a point system no one can work with.
bad,"Several years in this company and they are trying to get me to quit. Manager is described as ""child like"" because you have to remind him of everything and if you don't then he will forget and then yell at everyone in the store. Watch what manager you get.. Not all of them are good..."
bad,"Good company to work for. All holiday's off paid and weekends off."
bad,high pay made the 10 hour days bearable. easy work but hot warehouse in Texas summer. undue pressure was placed on employees to compensate for under hiring. lack of direction from multiple managers made work inefficient.
bad,not the greatest because of pay and corporate but the environment made all up for it. great place to meet new people and help people out in the process
bad,"Too little time , not real breaks or time to eat lunch ,i learned more about auto parts but to many different managers, more chiefs than indians , not enough pay for the ammount of responsibility"
bad,"This is a company I do not mind it was my location I worked, management stole money; blamed workers. They would call me at least twice a week to cover a shift a hour before I had to come in, very unprofessional ended up leaving."
bad,Very stressful way too much drama pay is below poverty level and can't keep employees and arguing among managements. Promised my schedule back I'm still waiting. I'm a merchandiser doing management duties
bad,"My manager at the southwest Topeka blvd store was horrible, he was a lazy slob that rarely showered and would sit in his office and play on his phone and computer all day and when a customer would have a question I couldn't answer I would ask him and he would become angry."
bad,"The typical day at work is you enter clock in my job is to put up stock. Make sure everything is front faced, planogrames, just looking to better myself and advancement ."
bad,"Worked here for over a year, full time, with no raise on my anniversary date, and no vacation time as promised. Turnover is high, and they run you to death for no money."
bad,"Not a preferable Company to work for, Work loads overall not extremely difficult. But very poorly managed, with a negative work place environment. If you are not well perceived by higher up management, retaliation will be reflected upon your schedule; regardless of work ethic and production."
bad,Was in need of a job so this is where I work but know that I am capable of much more so in search of a different job with better pay and benefits for my family.
bad,"The O'reillys manager bestowed me with the honor of the closing manager duties after working there for 3 months. I didn't get a raise, and he was awful at scheduling. "
bad,"I still work there, but long hours and no respect for the job you do."
bad,"This company nickel and dimes everything. Very outdated tech, horrible software, terrible benefits. Raises only happen if you use standoff tactics. Pay is nowhere near competitive. They will move you up if you want to take on more responsibility for a galling 2% raise, by the way this is also the recommended annual cost of living raise within the company. The 401k for the company has lost money every year for the last 3 years. Very outdated business practices. The stock keeps going up and they keep growing but the company is suffering from a serious staffing issue company wide."
bad,"The job culture is ok, but raises are none and they expect you to work more for their profit. They may preach employee and customers come first, but that is not always true."
bad,I was a man team member and sometimes had to work by myself and never felt as if they appear to knowledge the hard work
bad,"Great job for the time, straight forward work schedule, systematic, decent coworkers. At times over complicated easy jobs, terrible management and leadership, and alot favoritism which makes the environment very stressful, no loyalty toward employees."
bad,"This is not a good long term job, it's an okay job to get you back on your feet until you find something new. Management is so lazy, you'll be lucky to see them two times a week, only there enough to make the  schedule and to point out what you did wrong and not right. At the location I worked at the employees smoked cigarets all day while only very few worked"
bad,"hot and stuffy in summer cold in winter pool table in  cafeteria"
bad,Very competitive company. A daily shift began and ended normally with no overtime. Most disputes between team members with management and corporate office was over wages.
bad,"Unless you have a store management title this job is a waste of time and the pay scale is that of the great depression.  There's absolutely no reason to work for this company unless you are given a management position right away, because there aren't any perks for the grunts below."
bad,"Would recommend to high school or college students. But if you don't want to work in a retail environment then you should avoid this employer. Opportunities for advancement are slim. Unless you want to be a store manager, which means working typically six days a week and a lot of hours."
bad,"After many years of service, did not have the support of acting upper management."
bad,"Let me start with some positives about this company. Oreilly auto is a decent workplace. That is the only positive that i have to offer in my three plus years of employment. However oreilly auto parts provides little to no room for advancement. Instead of promoting employees such as myself and a few others to positions that require acknowledgement within the industry, they decide to hire regular people off the streets as ""strategic hires."" The fact that I have to help train a new hire off the street to fill in a position that my co-workers as well as I are completely capable in doing so."
bad,This is not a good company to work for. They require more than 60 hours per week and have no support structure in place. Salary is not competitive to the industry at all.
bad,Fifteen hours a day as a supervisor was terrible. Learned not to trust everybody. Management was terrible. Co workers were difficult to work with everybody was stressed. Working with team members and management that didn't have your back as a supervisor. Changing the order processing standards to make it easier and better for the team members.
bad,"a typical day is waiting on customers and stocking product."
bad,"fun place to work if you like cars. Pay could be better, its a good first job."
bad,I appreciated my time at O'Reilly and learned a lot although having some set backs I still overcame and did my job well. I have taken away a lot from working there and will apply the skills I now have in future jobs.
bad,"Overall not the worst job that I’ve had. If you are under good leadership you’re set but there isn’t enough of that there."
bad,It was a decent company to work for but it isn’t worth the pay. The customers are great and so are the employees. They just need to raise there starting pay and give more pay increases to the employees who do everything asked of them.
bad,"High turn over rate. You are not important or appreciated for the hard work you do do."
bad,They seem to step over dollars to pick-up dimes. They are not willing to pay a decent wage to keep longtime employee's there. Seems like the Walmart of autoparts. No valuable training in the auto industry so counter people often have no idea what they are selling.
bad,The job was fine.Worst part was poor management and corporate rules that hindered your job.The transportation supervisor (last one) was one of the worst they ever had at O'Reilly.
bad,"They dont appreciate anyone, everyone is replaceable. And if your willing to work inconsistant  hours with minimum pay, thats the place for you. There is alot of turn around with help at stores but cant seem to understand why... Smh tou have to pay the one who knows their head from their rear, and oreilly won't fork out the $$$"
bad,"Not all that great when your are manager, and don't have have your own boss support you with the other employees decisions. anf no family time for the the pay"
bad,"The company leadership is comprised of individuals that have been with the company for 20 -30 years. Most of these individuals want to run the company like it was when it was only a handful of stores, even though we have approx 6000 stores and 80,000 employees. "
bad,"Mid Management and lower are treated fairly but paid poorly. Upper Management is paid well but not treated fairly."
bad,"pros: discounts, friends at work."
bad,"O'Reilly was an ok company except if you were a previous Checker Auto employee.  In which case were treated differently, and in most cases were phased out."
bad,"There are always ups and downs to working at every company. This one, though, you get discounts on products and work is generally relaxed. However, management is incompetent, and political. Even breath in the wrong direction and someone in management will write you up. There is so much workplace drama, they revoked a promotion I had because a delivery driver was a close friend of the manager and got it instead. They don't like their employees becoming friends, especially outside of work."
bad,"There pay is not the best and they dont not give fair cost of living rasies, some stores are better then others but this is managment, takes years to grow with company"
bad,"I worked at corporate but for the warehouse. Had to constantly listen to a guy talk about topics that I asked numerous times to stop. Management didn't care, when you go to HR they look for a reason to fire you instead of who was causing issues. They don't care about hostile work environments, harassment, or osha's standards. If they can find a way to cut corners and not get caught they will. They preach about culture and values but have none. You have to agree with your managers opinions no matter what or you will be made the bad guy."
bad,Show up early and do about 25% of managers paperwork while answering and filling commercial customers orders. Route commercial deliveries and dispatch drivers. Review accounts and sales trends with outside salesmen. Balance cash drawer at both beginning and end of shift. Inform customers of promotional items. Handle and resolve customers complaints.
bad,"Working at O'reillys was a very stressful time for me not knowing day after day would be the day you will get fired. The rules are changed daily. They have supervisors that rotate departments that don't care about the ""TEAM MEMBERS""  and if you're a person of color please don't put in for a promotion because its just a waist of time you're not qualified! They choose who they want to choose when you put in for transfer within another department."
bad,"The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the idea that management, and upper management, treats employees with little respect."
bad,"To Start working 8 hours in whichever position they told you to. Learned merchandising and about parts. Management was pretty laid back,  yet fast paced place to work. Hardest part of the job was merchandising, moving and replacing shelving and stocking new product according to plan design. Most enjoyable part of job was delivering parts. I enjoyed  interacting with the customers both in store and the ones I delivered to. I learned a lot of directions and knew where most places were by memory within a couple of weeks."
bad,"Keeping up your stamina to keep going. Especially if we had to work past our 8 hour shift. Specifically difficult 5 days a week, clocking on your shift by 5:00 a.m. everyday."
bad,"This company is okay to work for. Personal advancement opportunities in the company are limited and the pay isn't competitive. This is a good place to work if you're in high school, but not a career job."
bad,You do not have to know a lot about cars to work here but by the time you leave you will have learned enough. Good part time job for those going to school.
bad,"Employee's help each other...deliver parts to other O'Reilly stores for low pay, no advancement, no raise and supervisor is only looking out for herself."
bad,Will be working only all day for little pay. Multitasking every day on the job no breaks no support from  management
bad,"While I did enjoy my employment with the company. I did have moments that I found myself thinking, ""What type of company am I working for?"" I mean, It takes forever for those who really deserve and need the money to receive a raise, the responsibilities of other team member jobs are often fall back on other team members, and the commission incentive isn't worth it. The Pro is, you get a decent employee discount. I did gain a management position with the company but I was not compensated as management."
bad,This was by far the funnest job I have ever had. That being said the company is ran on the retail side by complete imbeciles.
bad,"i learned how to deal with customers,to get along with others,most of my co-workers are as nice and will help out.management takes alot of patience and time and a good attitude."
bad,"I was not trained in several aspects of my responsibilities. I was not trained in customer service, or in proper inventory intake methods. However, my co-workers were very friendly."
bad,Team lead Order- filler of the Red Room maintained a high level of production and accuracy.
bad,"I loved working for Oreilly auto parts..Then  The change began with upper management,So I do believe its the region not the company.I have been told by other employee's that have worked for oreilly's  back east that it is ran and the oreilly culture is very different..There is a huge turn over in the west coast region not only with part specialist's but with store managers and asst store managers."
bad,"I left as an assistant manager making barely enough to survive. horrible hours. it was an easy job once you learn what to ask the customer. I would regularly curse some of my regular customers. the customer feels that the customer is always right and in this case that is not true. what i really hated is when the customer would come in and act like they knew it all. they would supply the info about the automobile and it would be incorrect information, then when they came back to get the right part, they would try and blame me. and i didn't take it. i would talk back and curse them especially if they would curse at me ;) have fun hating that job"
bad,"While the work environment is some what safe and easy , There is no job security or defined options . They like to leave everything up in the air and nothing in writing ."
bad,Very laid back place with fun people to work with. Very flexible hours.
bad,"If you like to work with the public, you will meet tons of people."
bad,"i learned alot about automobiles.i didnt really have any automotive background when i started.a couple of guys there really helped me learn alot.that was the store manager when it opened and a few months later the new asistant manager that helped me.what i didnt like wa the general manager was and always is looking to can someone for nothing.he would take up for one of his budies which ran the commercial side of oriellys.he was always covering up for him because he caused this employee to make a mistake on his application when hired,so to keep him happy he has to cover his mistakes now so neither of them get in trouble."
bad,When it actually comes to working for the company it wasn’t a overall bad experience. Only thing that hurts the company is the lack of growth when it comes to actually moving up positions
bad,First off the manager promised all the women working there that they would never have to work a Sunday. It gets tiring working every Sunday for a year.
bad,Working 10+ hours daily and consistently moving. Always stayed busy and there was always work to be done. Work life balance is very hard to keep even. Did have weekend off.
bad,O'Reilly is a decent place to work if you have fluent knowledge of automotive mechanics of small engine like lawn equipment and larger engines like semi diesel engines.
bad,"I went from a driver to a RSS, I was a devoted worker and was promised to be an assistant manager. I did the work for four years before i was really given the chance to have a interview as a assistant manager . Pay is horrible their raises  are horrible. Great learning experience but uper management needs more work and they need to pay attention on whats really happening and ask the employes toto see whats really going on in the store with the managers .see what is"
bad,Fired because boss was being investigated for sleeping with an employee. She thought I was the whistle blower and filed a report saying I created a hostle work place. Glad I'm not at that store anymore.
bad,I feel they lost their best employee. I was very dedicated to the company and tried my hardest to make improvements in the store. My district manager liked me a lot.
bad,"I pray that oreillys gets better ,first they need to pay there employees more are at least pay more for selling parts ,two they need to review all managers and evaluate them on how they treat there employees because its sad and just disrespectful, third i understand that customers come first but what about the hard working family employees that bust there tail when will we be respected and honored"
bad,"Even being a shift manager my pay is 9/hr. Recieving customer abuse is frequent. They expect ASE certification and would like you to be mechanically savy, but arent willing to pay you for your knowledge. Anyone off the street seems hireable. Management is different at every location. My current location manage is hit or miss depending on the issue."
bad,"Working at Oreilly as a parts specialist was very stressful, I would get there around 3 and work until 10 which is when we closed. Management and The commercial department would leave as soon as I got there and me and one other person would have to run the whole store by ourselves. We were so busy and management always got mad at us for not having the place spotless the next morning."
bad,Fun and productive work environment. Paid holidays paid vacations after being promoted to full time after a year. Even after being promoted to full time I still don't get 40 hours.
bad,ORielly pays on time sometimes early .. you always get a bonus even when you aren’t in the register. My store manager was awesome. The store manger wanted to advance me but the general manager who was sexist did not want me to have advancement. You work for a short period of time none stop and certainly without a drink of water or a simple bathroom break ORielly needs to be better employers.!
bad,After working for Oreilly many years I find that the culture and employee treatment has not grown with time. I believe it has a little catching up to do as far as compensation and employee culture.
bad,This company has low wages and poor management. The advancement opportunities are not accessible as they were perceived when hired. The wages are below that of other places.
bad,It was a good place to work till new manager came and was taking things made it hard on all of his team members .and he is a nice guy just dont care as long as his life is allgood but if u have to work everyday u have off he dont care as long as he is off and no matter what happens with ur family if it wasnt his he dont care
bad,Constant work coming through the doors. You will learn about customer service and automobile parts and organizational skills and you will do a lot with parts inventory.
bad,"Oreillys auto parts is not a good place to work to make any money I was there all most seven years and I received all my raise but one in the seven years and I left making only $9.47 an HR plus commission which isn't very good it's 1% of your sales. but I enjoyed working there for the most part, meeting all different kinds of people. My manager was a very good person to work under. But the company only takes care of the higher management and treating the  ones making them the billions profit . At one time a long ago they said it was a family oriented company. But not any more"
bad,"O'reilly Auto Parts is a place where there is room to advance, but the compensation versus the expectations is very disproportionate. Full time employees have a hard time getting 40 hrs per week, and work schedules can very widely from week to week."
bad,"Constantly cutting hours even if your full time if the entire district is down for sales. Split days off. They will milk the system whenever possible (example: work two 12 hour days and cut you the rest of the week to not pay overtime) low pay, constantly upgrading the parts look-up system and growing their stock market but yet they say they can't afford the overtime."
bad,"Tge management is the biggest problem, they do have advancement opportunities but you'll have to bite your teeth a lot. The pay is not worth the amount they don't value their workers"
bad,"Very poor scheduling, High level of technical knowledge is required for very little pay. My annual raise was a quarter. If the store isn't making enough profit they will cut your hours back below 40 even though you're full time."
bad,Most of the people are fun to work with. Hours can be really rough and sent home early most days. Management is weak and not alot of promises are kept.
bad,I've been with the company for a short time period so far while some things are great others are not so much. the pay is on the low end of things so don't plan on trying to save unless you live with roomates in a low living cost city.
bad,"Sales parts to commercial and consumer customers"
bad,Labor intensive with little to no move up potential. Deliver parts to commercial accounts and check retail out the register.
bad,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a power house in the industry and provides many opportunities for advancement. They have strong culture values and most distribution centers throughout the county models the culture values.
bad,"A team based work environment, keeps you motivated towards daily and quarter annual goals. Everybody has a job, despite having the same position title. I've learned about keeping inventory in order, organized and safe work environment, transactions and charge accounts on credit with wholesale retailers in the immediate area, and more customer service experience."
bad,The pay is low and the district managers and regional managers require more than what they pay their employees. Pay raises are rare and most management is terrible.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of condensing totes and sorting bulk. I have learned to move quicker and faster since i have started there."
bad,delivery of auto parts to other o'reilly stores got to see friends at other store did not learn any new most of the store mgr were great and so were the people i worked there was nothing hard about the job the best part about the job was driving.
bad,"Working ethics were always violated. Lack of management, lack of training and always understaffed."
bad,Clock in at 8am scan and stock all parts for one of largest O`reilly  Auto Parts warehouses in south texas store #620 fill orders for city wide distribution.would get off at 5pm
bad,"Working with O'Reillys gives me the ability to help customers face to face, which is rewarding and challenging at the same time. While with O'Reillys i have become more resourceful. My co-workers are awesome! I helped train a few of them and watching them progress on there own day to day is a rewarding feeling. The hardest part of my job for me is finding something new to learn everyday, which is also the most enjoyable part of my job as well."
bad,most enjoyable part of the job was solving customer problems and getting them the correct part for their vehicles.
bad,Got passed up on two job opretunities that I was more then capable of doing. An you cant go in thinking about getting full time. THEY ARE A STINGY COMPANY TO WORK FOR!!!!
bad,Didn't like it they don't teach you nothing. They want you to finish work asap they don't give u a chance
bad,The Company does not value or appreciate employees as evidenced by the extremely poor rate of pay. Average employee turnover is 80% per year. Employees are not actually reviewed on overall performance but rather the job description for which they were hired.
bad,The work place went downhill and even the management left the company. I do my work and then some. I even have to assist the manager on occasions.  Just to much stress in this environment now
bad,"Not a bad place to work for entry-level parts.  Management positions are very heavy on the workload and hours, as well as very sales driven pay.  Not bad for part time work."
bad,Depending on the manager and higher ups you could be in a awesome work environment. One that coaches mentors and helps you grow. Or in a rut that won't let you grow or advance. That won't take into consideration you have a family or life out side the corporation.
bad,"The bosses themselves aren't bad but they grade you based on how many sales you make that contain a related item, so if you sell oil try to sell a funnel, which makes sense. But they don't take into account that a lot of customers don't need to buy an additional item every time, especially as a closer for the store. past 6 pm or so, people want to get their stuff and leave, not to listen to some stranger tell them to spend more money. The district manager and regional manager spend too much time nitpicking the little stuff instead of focusing on big picture like someone with their job title should have."
bad,"I was employed when they were Kragen auto parts before they got bought out by O' Reilly's . I loved my job and I worked hard to get where I was until they brought new management in from another company then I lost my job after 6 years . I wad told they would schedule according to my child care , but lied I then started getting scheduled hours I couldn't work on purpose to cause me to be a little late on certain days. I was treated unfair and let go for poor reasons even unemployment agreed. I traveled to different locations in the district and did inventory and got cheated on mileage reimbursement had to end up contacting HR and I used my personal vehicle for errands. No job seniority what so ever. Overall I love the company, but that location has poor management and too much favoritism."
bad,"It's a low skill job with low pay, most of the people I worked with couldnt breathe without thinking first. If you are smart and skilled there is plenty of room for advancement, if you are smart and skilled you can get a better job."
bad,"Working for O'reilly Auto Parts can be enjoyable if you do not intend to keep it as a career. You get an awesome discount on car parts, but dealing with rude customers and being grossly underpaid doesn't make up for it."
bad,"This is not a job that you can make a career out of. The pay is low and they will often give part timers 40 hours and full timers 32 hours. Corporate management is not trust worthy and will tell you what you want to hear, giving you a false sense of advancement. They would rather take employees  from competitors or transfer them in from other cities before they promote from within. If you work at a small store, you will be expected to sell parts, stock parts, deliver parts, act as a manager, clean bathrooms, answer phones, be the commercial contact, do returns, open the store, close the store, come to the store when the alarm goes off and even count inventory at other stores...all for $10 an hour or less."
bad,"You came in morning and scan in parts that came overnight, and "
bad,Ok unlike the last review i give this place was a bit... well let just say i have something to say about everything on the right . A typical day was hard and i mean hard. The hardest part about it was having to pick up the slack for others everyday.I can say i love knowing i was staying in shape by the end of the day.Management had its up and down's to the point i was even asking myself is this a place i really want to be working at but if its anything i learn there it was never work yourself to hard cause you could hurt yourself
bad,"I worked here for 7 years, and received a very small pay increase.   I had a few good managers, and a few bad managers.   You are expected to put up with a lot of b.s. there, though."
bad,"a typical day at O' Reilly Auto Parts working long hours "
bad,"I got my first job after the military "
bad,Worked there as a cdl driver. Good place to work for but way behind on pay.  We're talking about a billion dollar corporation.  The pay should be way better.
bad,"This was my first actual job after college, it was just a normal runing the mill kind of workplace, good for a part time job, or a side job, but not a lot of room for growth."
bad,"Not a career job, unless you're a soul less corporate lackey."
bad,"I worked here for a year and enjoyed working here for the most part. I helped customers troubleshoot problems with their cars and stocked many shelfs. After about 6 months they started training me to be a retail store supervisor, I did all the supervisor requirements and activities but never received a pay increase. The hardest part of the job was being a part-time employee working 45 hours a week and going to school full time. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and customers. There was hardly any sort of management which made the company very hard to work for."
bad,It was an ok job for someone that was still in high school but I personally wouldn’t go back there. The company didn’t like to take care of their employees that much and the pay wasn’t good enough
bad,"Wasn't in the store as much as I was delivering parts to out of town clients, but when I was in the store, I dealt primarily with bring in the new parts, double checking the invoices to what was ordered to make sure we had gotten what we ordered and what our clients needed, then putting the stock into the computer and on the shelves."
bad,"A very difficult company for a woman to work in. Stereotyped by employees and customers, even if knowledgeable about automotive. If you can fight to prove yourself then advancing is possible."
bad,"rude customers, inadequate training, under staffed nights and weekends makes for a hectic and stressful environment.  Management seems to be more concerned with sales outside of the store then helping customers and employees in the store."
bad,Many employees are fired over drama and supervisors not getting along with employees. Most supervisors play favorites and have vendettas againt regular employees. Its a great environment at first but it quickly becomes hostile between employees and theb supervisor always picks the favorite employees side.
bad,"I would test batteries, starters, & modules. Install wipers & batteries. I enjoyed working with the public, stocking shelves, ad changes & planograms. I left because of management turnover, not honoring the ASE pay scale & training my boss. GREAT BENEFITS, but management is stupid!!"
bad,Different stores have different atmospheres but poor management is what destroys staff morale. It’s fun and fast paced at times so their always something new to deal with if your up for a challenge.
bad,Oriellys would be a good place to work if they did not over work you . If someone calls in you have to pick up the slack . Management will not step in to help they just sit in the office calling out orders numbers still needing completion . That made me Furious ! So you leave work late everyday . They also did not tell us your be walking 8 miles a day in the heat for 5 days a week for only 13.40 a hour ! The people there are hard working and should be making 17 or more .
bad,They try really hard not to hire women. They use a closed computer program and anyone can operate it. A woman can operate a computer the same as a man
bad,"No one enjoys working here. The asstiant managed is horrible and you will constantly passed over for advancement by new employees. The manager is good, but she is so hands off that the asstiant manager has basically unlimited power. Employees constantly dont do their job and just sit down in the back. I will be leaving the second I get a better offer."
bad,"The pay is ok and if you are lucky enough you will have a relay route. Most of the drivers work nights.  Management is poor.  Most days it feels like you are working in a circus.  They claim to have modern, well maintained equipment but that is not true.  The trailers are very old and break down often.  Penske is their contracted repair facility and they are terrible.  Many times you practically have to beg to get items repaired.  Also, you will be expected to drive in unsafe conditions. ie Even when the main mountain pass is closed because of poor weather they expect you to take other unsafe roads.  Delivering parts is more important than driver's safety.  The other drivers there are a great group, nice to work with."
bad,Work hours never set. Never a set work schedule it fluctuates between workers and you availability. Work on weekends and holidays. Sometimes it gets really busy.
bad,"Work is easy, employee relations cause work space to be stressful. management is poor, causing good employees to leave and the rest to not care about their work."
bad,"i worked for this company for several years and i would never recommend anyone to work here they allow workplace harassment, company misconduct, improper promotion of people before they are even close to being trained for it, and very unreasonable rules and guidelines."
bad,People there have nothing better to do but talk about you and it creates a bad working enviornment and the supervisor does nothing about it. Breaks are not enough and lunch
bad,My days at Oreilly are up and down. I would encourage people that want to work for them only do part time if you wanna work for the company. They only wanna pay you the minimum and they barely give out raises
bad,This was one of the best places I've ever worked at. It's fasted paced and I like working eith all my fellow employees. If you work together you excel together.
bad,this job is very repetitive and prettt cutthroat. Repetitive because you have to stock the same thing every night and usually sell the same things every day.  Cutthroat because you have a set amount of money you have to sell and that's usually doesn't move so you have to meet that goal
bad,"A typical day of work  for me is mostly full of one on one with customers. Making sure that i'm listening to what the need and want to make sure that i'm giving them the best service and the correct parts they need. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the difficult customers, but it come alone with my job.The best part of my job is working with some of my team members  and having fun while being the best at our job."
bad,I liked working at O'reilys until they changed management and accused me of something i didnt do. I usually delivered parts to the same companies in fact they would ask for me by name. I enjoyed working with the customers who came in to buy parts too because i have been a mechanic since i was in the 8th grade and i could direct them to the right parts that they needed and would offer to help them if needed.
bad,Very short handed.  Worked six days; sometimes seven days a week.  My management was not very helpful when I need guidance.
bad,Great job but too hard to rise in ranks regardless of performance. Seems they pick unqualified people to move up to RSS and assistant manager.
bad,"A solid starter job, unstable work conditions. I am looking to expand my work experience and feel that a company such as this would not allow me to work at my full potential."
bad,"Left to focus on School and lack of opportunities to move up. Didn't have an opportunity to, all the while I was being told there was position specifically for me by my store manager."
bad,"It was terrible all around from the supervisors, benefits, the pay you get for driving equipment. Start at 11.25 if you drive equipment you only get a .25 cent raise just because you drive equipment. You get hired FT you have to wait one full year from the date you got FT to get your Time"
bad,"management did not have any experience what so ever, other employees did not do they job right because of this. fun place to work and always busy."
bad,"Fun place to work with supportive management . not all about the numbers but  how you grow personally and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
bad,this job is really easy and fast pace. i really enjoyed this job and the co workers. the job is VERY physical and consists of alot of walking and lifting heavy items
bad,"I love my co-workers we all get along well, but the pay could be better and also the DO'S and DON'TS should stand for everybody including the DM, CEO, and everyone else that falls in line."
bad,"Overall a good company, but they do not always follow through with hiring agreements"
bad,pick parts at a fast pace paperless company some hard woking people u move alot never in the same place some management nice other not helpful never get a thank you always make u feel like a machine
bad,looking for a stable company to have opportunity for advancement
bad,Not a bad but not a great place to work. For a delivery driver job it pays decent. Hours are questionable at times.
bad,"I started working for CSK Auto who got bought by O'Reilly Auto Parts. The upper management of CSK was carried over into O'Reilly, and if you didn't play golf or hang out with your District Manager or Regional VP, you weren't going to go anywhere with this company. Performance hardly mattered"
bad,"After clocking in you would get started on the morning paperwork, count out the tills for the other team members, get the deposit ready, and check all the the emails. Once the doors opened I would help customers, get paperwork done, and make sure that the depot was running correct also pull the parts for the other stores that we supped in the district."
bad,Working with customers with their vehicle problems. People complain about aftermarket part problems. Was a fun job if you are a mechanic and can pass knowledge to other customers
bad,"I have worked here for 3 years and i have been treated very fair. The only negative thing i have to say is that the income is very low and if you were to take a very small raise, the amount of extra work that comes with it is not worth it."
bad,Designated to deliver parts to commercial accounts threw out the Tucson metro area however I find myself working the front counter as a cashier everyday and less driving
bad,"Wish it was how it use to be, Management got bad lost a lot of good people cause of it but it depends on the store you work at. The work is easy though and it is easy to move up"
bad,The fact that they give weekends off mostly to the old timers and always have the students close and work weekends and not having time to work on your homwork is the only thing I did not like about it. They do not really work with your schedule.
bad,This job is honestly not for me. It gets way too hot in the warehouse and they don't do much to accommodate their workers here. The management isn't very good as well.
bad,Love it very good place to be awesome role models very friendly always will teach you anything the best people around it Disney get any better would recommend anyone
bad,"A retail job involving a bit of knowledge to be successful at. Auto parts are constantly changing and customers expect you to have their answers. Management is alright, but aging with less talent on deck. The pay is bad, especially given an unpredictable schedule leaving no room for another job, it's hard to defend corporate. Looking forward: the company is starting to struggle against growing online auto parts retail."
bad,"You are not a person, just a mere number with this company. I would not, nor would anyone at my location recommend this company to anyone to work at."
bad,"Over all I like Oreillys as a company. I enjoy workingg in the automotive industry. "
bad,"This is one of the better companies I have worked for in my life, but for the time and effort you put towards making sur everything runs great I feel they do not value their workers. There is little room for growth, and I feel as other establishments compensate better for the work that is being done."
bad,"A very nice place to work honestly. All my co workers are nice people and I have learned a lot but I don't like the compensation. It's not a hard job but the potential for lucrative financial growth is unapparent. Also the advancement is weird, the train first and then promote and that creates room for a person to have to do a job that they aren't being compensated for but besides that, a cool place to work."
bad,Not a good company to work for doesn't play pay employees what they but they should pay them no matter how long they have work for the company very low pay
bad,Working here is fun especially when you have a cool crew.Management is not pair on your salary it's who you know not what you do for the company.They care only about numbers.......
bad,Great benefits yes but with such low wages how are you going are going pay for them pay s bad   and the spectrum of how much people make is crazy one guy 15.00 The other 10.00   And it dosent matter the position either they pay the least they can I was offered a promotion for an extra 1.00 An hour 20 min away while the same position for another person they were making 15.00 Dosent make sense and with stating wages averaging 12.00 An hour they need to stop being greedy before they dont have anyone left to man these stores
bad,"It's a decent job that pays okay, and offers a great discount and incentives to employees, but most stores are often very short handed for a better part of the year, creating a lot of overworking situations."
bad,"At work I have daily activities such as taking care of customers and helping them get whatever they need to fix their vehicles, I also do alot more of other responsibilities in the workplace such as clean up the store. I count our inventory daily as well as go to other stores per month to count inventory. I make deliveries daily for the store to the local shops around and I assist my managers as well as my other team members where I can or wherever they need help throughout the store."
bad,Working at O'Reilly auto parts is great for the most part. My location is rather slow with buisness and I spend most of my time doing extra training on the computer or go out running part deliverys. The job is great but you definitely won't get enough hours unless you are key holder which is a shame. I put on my application that I need 35 hours at the minimum and only get 20 a week..m
good,"I am a single mom. I have a special needs son. When his school would call or I would need to go check on my son, my manager made it seem like I have to choose between my son and job. THEY ARE BOTH MY JOBS!"
good,Was good place of employment experience for me was in maternity at the time so I was let go because of my children have certain times and I ws5unable to work evenings.
good,"Their checks cleared, an they held up their end of the bargain. As usual management is lacking treading"
good,"Environment was hostile. Location manager was racist and an idiot, when he was even there. He and other employees like to make racist comments. He would leave for hours at a time without explanation leaving us to try to do his job. Training was poor. Expectations crazy. Pay terrible."
good,"my day in the mornings consist of waking up at 5am to be at work by 6:30. Do paperwork and opening procedures by 7:30am. Unload shipments and scan into inventory, manage sales floor with 1 employee ubtil 12:45pm when you can take your only break. by 3:30 you would go home."
good,"If you dont mind feeling bullied sometimes, and feeling very Unappreciated then the Oreilly Florida Market is for you. If you can kiss butt really fast and  sham out of work or your job responsibilities you make it there and go far. If your mind set is that you have responsibilities and your going to work hard and do your job to the best of your ability, then don't apply at Oreilly Auto Parts, pass them by, and keep looking."
good,This is a great job if you do not have any scheduling conflicts or don't have children. Delivery Specialist hours are usually Monday through Friday. which is a good thing.
good,"Management was poor, hours was poor, they say your part time but make you work full time hours. If you have a family they will not work with your schedule."
good,The manager would take his frustration out on his employees they would also favorite certain employees some employees were disrespectful and would take their anger out of other people
good,"there way or the highway. they will over work you until you can't no more I've seen people let go because they can't ""meet"" the standards of their system that isn't quiet accurate."
good,they barely compensate their employees. the benefit are below average. the commission is lest than half a percent. the only upside to working here is some of the customers and great discount on certain parts
good,"the mgr/upper mgr is inconsistent lack of empathy,trust i cant speak on other store or Mgrs just were im located at pay sucks for what they ask and the commission is a joke"
good,"I was getting part-time pay, yet they were working me full-time hours. I was a parts delivery person, yet they also had me doing inventory, merchandising, cashiering, training, vehicle diagnostics and installations. The old manager was way better, but the new manager was the reason I left the company."
good,The store that I worked at was extremely poorly managed as well as the employees were extremely unprofessional. The store was constantly changing and was never organized.  And the computer system was absolutely absurd
good,Management always played favorites and was very inappropriate about personal life and sharing. The workers were very childish and had cliques. If you don't smoke you don't fit it. Was told I would be working a certain numbers of hours in a contract and they werent held up at all. No instruction was given for job training. unsafe work enviorments
good,"It is a great job if you are a person who just work and have no personal life. The work is not hard at all, and you only advance if you are cool with the manager in charge."
good,i am not open to writting about it at this time. Where will this review get me or Oreilly auto parts? i dont want to share! i will not share!!!!!!
good,"if you like to multitask,work hard and never get raises or recognition for the things you have did for the company , than this company is for you."
good,always trying to get ahead of competitor you can learn about auto parts if you pay attention to video Cd's. Co. said they care about employs but in realty they don't. sales on commission is low so you have to cut other employ's out most are low paying. co. said it stands behind it's employ's but it only stands behind the manager they will cheat you out of vacation pay and unemployment the co only cares for money crunchers and they have a lot of stealing going on within the co. because management is usually behind it. they just need to learn to take care of their workers.
good,they have a good set of rules and guidelines. Great training programs but they need to work on getting managers that care more about there employees then there numbers.
good,"Associates do not have any opportunities to grow within the company,. They only care about profit and do not believe in rewarding associates for they time and labor invested in the company"
good,"There are really wonderful people who are employed with O'Reilly. Unfortunately, the management team I was working under was not these people. I was very sad to leave my co-workers at O'Reilly but, the stress and the workload was just too much to handle without the pay being there. Also, men do not have as much of a hard time there, a definite man's company."
good,DMs overly micro manage your life and store.... If I had to do it all over again I would have not left my previous job.... The grass was not greener on the other side.
good,Could have been a great job except for a supervisor who had no people skills and got rattled over a little stress. He couldn't handle more than 1 thing at a time without coming unglued. He was condescending and just plain rude. Also a rat. Went to the manager over little stuff as he didn't know how to handle people. Soe people shouldn't be in positions dealing with subordinates. Hewwas a good
good,No room for advancement without compromising personal morals at the  expense of line employees. No clear goals and no consistency. Favoritism is the only way to get ahead.
good,"lots of the time you get to work you go straight checking customers out and helping them with finding parts. "
good,It was just a pay check. It was a very hostile work environment. When you would go to manager and report a problem they would laugh and not take care of the situation.
good,Not a hole lot of options/ opportunity for advancement all around not exactly the best place to work not enough money for the time you put in and You don’t get enough hours so you feel like you are not welcomed to work
good,i do not recommend working here the managers do what ever they want to do and do not care about there employees they show favoritism over cert on people .
good,My time spent here made me feel like a waste and a feeling of being underpaid for the stress and conditions of work where to far for me to continue there . Maybe it’s differnt for other but if it’s your first job look maybe somewhere else the consideration they have is low
good,If you like agreeing to working 48hours a week  and it turns into 60-70 as a salary manager this is the job for you.   they will put you in a store that needs alot of work.. alot of the things needing to be fixed at the store comes off your commission although you did not create it. they will tell you as a manager do not work holidays but then get your payroll in line.. so you have to work holidays.
good,They still owe me 7.000 dollars from vacation and commission check when they first open they were a great company over the years went down hill no advancement
good,Been with this company and they don't care about the employees stores stay being robbed and they absolutely refuse to hire security. Pay is trash the expect you to bust your but for little nothing unless your a certain race then that's when the dollars roll in.
good,"Typical day would start of for me in the afternoon, the morning shift was suppose to have all stock up before they go home since they have the slowest shift. I had the busy shift and would have to get all of the stock they left out put up while having to handle customers etc. I learned a lot about certain makes and models of vehicles from the technicians who would shop there. The store manager was a racist, the assistant manager well he should have been the aactual manager because the other guy is very unorganized. Tries to  treat grown men like children and make racist remarks. My coworkers were ok no complaints except one. HIs breath was horrible. Hardest part of the job was working with the old guy who kept talking to customers for 2 hours while the line wrapped around the store. The most enjoyable part was when it was time to go home."
good,As I arrive a prepare the travel sheet and inspect the truck that I will be using for the deliveries. I receive the invoice by my manager with the auto parts I need to take out to deliver to the auto shops. I learned that I should not be treated as dirt and a slave. The manager did not care about my school schedule.  No rise after a year not even 25 cents. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving.
good,"I started at Oreillys back in 2014. I had to train in St. Coud and that store was amazing. The people were friendly and loved working there. Once we got to Palm Bay fl, everything changed. The people management everything. I was promised 40 hours a week and got cut back to 8 hours a week. Lost all respect for the company."
good,Give too many task at the same time. Have not learn anything and no advancement. Co-workers are great which make my day better.The most enjoyable part is when I go in early before rush hour
good,"This is a job that provides me with the ability to maintain life. The environment at O'Reilly's is one that has potential to be enjoyable. The management is not very experienced, but they are learning and it is coming along. The most difficult part of the job is not knowing when you will work the following week due to schedule release being on the Saturday before the week begins on Sundays."
good,"On a typical day I will run deliveries from 9 - 6 to different, local mechanics and dealerships. I am in an out of the store, I communicate with our wholesale customers and fix any problems they have; whether it be the wrong part, or wrong price ect. My co-works and manager on the wholesale side of the store are wonderful, my co-workers and management team on the counter sales side of the store is why I strongly dislike my job."
good,Most days I stay very busy and on the road a normal day i driver roughly 150-200 miles. Everyone has a good work ethic and we all get along very well and have a fun enjoyable time while at work.
good,"A typical day includes not knowing what you will be doing that day due to the high volume of call offs everyday. I learn how to deal with rules and regulations changing every day that was not written in the handbook.Management maintained  a very high turnover I had seven different supervisors,and four  operation managers within six  years.My co-workers are awesome to work with.The hardest part of the job is getting management to assit with any problems that may occur through out the day,"
good,"I have worked at Oreilly for 6 years, adapting to all of their changes, with few rewards. With the new ObamaCare fisaco, my hours have now been curtailed to 13 hours a week, because my ""part time"" hours average too high."
good,When i work at oreillys the type of work and knowledge you can recive is great but the store manager and his key holderes are lazy and unhelpfull they will hide in back and leave 1 or 2 none key holders on the counter to deal with all incoming custmers while they hang out in back and try do fleet counter or just sit back there and talk inatead of being upfront teching and helping the underdogs they leav they they leave stuck on counter
good,"Fast pace, learn something new everyday but not meant for long term growth. Management differs from store to store, upper management is where things get kinda interesting so I would mind my own business."
good,The management is so poor. The store managers cant get their employees to do the simplest of daily procedures. So all the work falls on one or two employees.
good,Want you to go above and beyond but they don't. Ok pay but could be much better. They have a attitude where they are always right. Favoritism is their culture.
good,"Customers and employees can lie on you, then management finds you guilty until proven innocent. I enjoyed the home time, however their pay needed to increase."
good,"Managers never paid attention to what was really wrong in store, and always praised and gave credit to the wrong people. Hardest workers in store were the drivers but they never get recognition only scolding while everyone else got bonuses and praise."
good,"There have been changed in the company while I have worked there.  They used to put people first, now you are just a replaceable body.  Leadership is non-existent in most departments."
good,"I want to say that things were fun and great. And while I worked there I met many good people and great managers."
good,It’s a job. A lot of the employees are there because they have to be not because they want to be there. Management is horrible. There’s definitely favorites. Some people can get away with stuff that others can’t. Employees aren’t held to the same expectations.
good,"As a person that likes to learn and be depended upon, this employer didn't care about the morale of anyone that was trying to be better. I would never recommend Oreilly to anyone."
good,"Must be willing and able to multi-task between in-store customer service and telemarketing customers. Be ready to work the phones, clean the store, stock shelves, and run deliveries."
good,"Working at O'reilly's, i experienced bad management as they were lazy and did not want to work with the exception of one. we were paid low other than when we got commission once a month. we were always low staffed as well as we were staying past 11 at times when we close at 10. people gossiped all the time and it caused drama throughout the store. the most enjoyable part of work was the customers. most of us didnt get breaks at times."
good,"A man driven company, but advancements were slow for women who could do the job,"
good,"Great if your straight out of high school. Only problem with that is, the customers need people who actually know what they're doing. Managers don't work with home life, it's all about the bottom line. The job and the people are amazing. It's a very easy going job if your manager isn't a lazy guy who hides in his office all day."
good,"As with most corperations there is not a lot of love for their employees you are treated more like a number then a valued team member, they are very unwilling to let you learn new skills and advance with the company"
good,"O'Reilly Auto parts is a good company, with a solid business plan. "
good,"not a bad company to work for, the management was a little poor but it can be over looked with the great co workers all working together to provide a good experience for the customers."
good,The job was ok nothing special. The management also had favorites who would get pay raises and other positions and weekends off.  Also they had a limit of who could be full time.
good,"There is no fair treatment of employees, pay and benefits are far below the norm.  hours are cut on busy days to compensate for slow days prior and full time employees often only get 34 or so hours."
good,Low pay and not enough hours for the work you do it's no wonder they are all ways hiring. It's a low stress environment where you deliver parts to auto shops around town management is to laid back and the long time employees can get away with pretty much anything.
good,"If you are gonna work here, you might wanna think twice it's not a bad job for a teenager who lives with his parents in that case you would be making decent money but for someone who lives on their own don't expect to be paying all your bills with this job you work full time hours but get paid and treated like a part time worker"
good,Work is not as the past looking 4 future an better  positions. Enjoy delivering 2 my customers who   enjoy my accuracy an speedy delivery of thier parts.
good,I had the chance to learn the ins and outs of the parts that consist of a public and commercial bus. I worked primarily alone. On the phone most of the time.
good,employees don't get many hours unless in a management positions and most of the managers don't deserve the right to be managers. other drivers and rude and childish when they don't get there way
good,"Starting in a male base job was a great experience for me. It taught me to not give up on working to better yourself or your career. I got my feet on the ground, learning alot from everyone."
good,"Turn over rater is at 90%. There is a huge lack of communication through the entire company and unfortunetly anyone who works in a store vs TM,DM,RM gets treated very poorly. They refer to anyone as replaceable. However, i do enjoy my job and my customers just dont care for the company in the least bit"
good,The company in itself isnt at the top of my list for advancing in life. Too much to do with too little pay.
good,"The upper management has no connection with the stores unless it is underperforming. The managers are used up. They need to realize that those billions they make are because the people in the stores work so hard for it. There is no support other then the district managers. They constantly dictate how the stores are to be run but, do not allow the people in the stores to have any say in how the store operates. Managers and store personnel have no say in hiring, store inventory, the store setup or store hours. All they care about is payroll and how it can be cut"
good,If you plan to become a manager or better you can make good money but as anything less than a manager you will barely make anything... They will only increase pay every year and its only a percentage. Expect about .30 raises maybe .50 but not much more
good,Only thing good is the discounts the job sucks hours and money is no good . The upper management doesn’t stand behind their rules or employees in any type of situation.
good,I loved my job at O'Reilly auto parts but i loved it for the people i worked with they where all friend's to me but they all moved on including the manager i loved working for and after 3 years of loving it all the replacements people are good at the job but treat everyone badly new manager doesn't care and employees just want to bad mouth every customer they see its nolonger the company i loved working for.
good,I loved earning the customer trust and business. I learned how to coach teach and develope team members. as a  manager I lead by example. the culture was mixed.hardest part of the job was asking grown people to do something over and over
good,It was great working there unless you had to clean and didn't have the proper equipment like a broom or vacuum. I met a lot of good shop owners and car collectors.
good,Worked there for two years after first year promoted to assistant manager proceeded then to be taken advantage of. Received low pay Worked over 55 hours a week and no help from upper management due to low staffing
good,Oreillys is a job for beginners. Don’t expect to come in and them give you what your looking for. It’s hard to advance in a company like this. They would rather bring in outside people.
good,"Most of the work shift at O'Reilly's involved working with customers and the OCAT computer catalog to find the right part for their vehicle.  We also installed wipers, bulbs and batteries.  "
good,"I was very through when fronting and facing things in the store especially the brake cleaner and things in that area. i was told i was being let go because i didn't front and face that part and the picture i was shown looked like someone just leaned into it with their arm even when i had a co worker stand up for me i still lost my job. would not recommend. also i was hired in as a third key, and found out that the normal part time employees made the same as i did an hour."
good,"overall oreillys is a good company, but their wages are far too low and hours can be very irregular, my location was understaffed most of the time, and had an impossibly high employee turnover rate"
good,"Work atmosphere is relaxed.  No basic qualifications required.  No overtime is allowed.  Does not pay enough for job duties.  Very stressful driving in traffic all day, especially in bad weather."
good,Easy to catch on didn't take long I was scared I thought everyone was made when I made mistakes bc I didn't get the proper training skills or tools so I had to work my way up to key holder
good,Was a great experience and wish I could continue to work there but the fact that I had to resign to be able to take my pregnant wife to the hospital was very upsetting. Other then that it was a great experience and I hope to do it again one day.
good,Could have been a great place to work but the management there needs improvement and better communication skills. They don't communicate well with each other.
good,It was a job that i was able to have during school in order to get bills paid. I do not see this job as a long term future for me. I delt with plenty of conflicts raising my daughter and management not understanding the need of a single mother.
good,"If you like politics and over working with little pay, this is the place for you. The hours are long, always short handed with more things to do than there is time in the day."
good,"great place to work till you start out selling the manager, commercial manager and they drop your hours from 35 down to 4 hours a week, that didn't pay the gas to drive to work and home."
good,"I loved helping the customers in every way possible and giving them top notch service. I loved delivering the auto parts to various places as I got to meet lots of new people, drive the company vehicle, and listen to music all day."
good,"If the area i was in had better management i would love my job. The customers are fun and awsome, fun to work with and most employees all share the same standards for the company."
good,Super easy job but then again it only pays 8.50 an hour. Even people that have been there for years don't make but like 10 bucks an hour. Its a chill part time job and I really enjoyed it. I worked there off and on for 6 1/2 years. Its super flexible and the discount is really awesome.
good,"If you enjoy working hard and delivering excellent customer service then be prepared to be the only employee who does."
good,It is a great job to work if your single and have no family. It’s Mon-fri work while maintaining weekends off. The management doesn’t communicate well.
good,"They don’t pay very well at all. The hours can be erratic. One week having 40, the next week working less than 30. The benefits are a joke. The discount is about the best benefit you get but how often are you buying parts for your own car? They focus on how many related items you sell and how many rewards customers you sell to. Got to get that phone number and sell that little pack of brake grease! It doesn’t matter if you beat your sales goal every month, if your related sales are down, you will get written up."
good,"Productive job.  Enjoyed working with everyone, and enjoyed many of the customers that came in.  I also learned many things about vehicles, and also how to look up items that customers requested."
good,Breckenridge location was a cool place to work. There was really no on the job training. You just learn as you go. We helped people troubleshoot problems with there vehicles.
good,"O'reilly is an okay place to work if you're not looking for a career. Management is terrible anywhere else, I got lucky in that department, but I've heard horror stories. "
good,"Went down hill horribly "
good,"If management likes you: you're invicible."
good,"Good place to work part time if you need discounts on parts.  Not  recommended  for long term employment.  Hardly any pay to begin with and they don't offer raises worth calling them raises. Tell you during interview ""we will start you out at base pay $ but you can expect to make $$ with bonuses and commission""  its all bs, never made a commission check worth $2 and never see bonuses or pay raises.  Been with company for 2 years.  Sad thing is, the company keeps bragging about how they are on track to make billions of dollars but cant afford to pay their employees who bust their butts for that to be possible."
good,Training new employees o feel needs to change ..and more of following the oreilly's culture should be implemented.also to much favoritism which does not make it a good place to work
good,"Alot of office politics.  Upper management has hidden agenda and not the same rules apply for all Team Members.  Pay is not aligned with demands of the job.  "
good,"A delivery driver is not something for everyone, it requires you to drive from shop to shop all over the city delivering auto parts."
good,Kept changing Managers every 3 to 4 Months. The customers were great. But the employees would never help out on stuff like stocking shelves. Or putting up inventory.
good,"Find a good location is very important I was hiered in management  low resources hard to relocate it really just depends on who's bottom "
good,"I worked for many years there but I would see other employees working to better themselves and after a time, they would cut their hours or they would make it real hard on an employee to stay so that they could hire someone else at lesser pay."
good,"I worked for an oriellys in Lancaster Texas. It was a good first job, but definitely not a career. Minimum wage, rude customers, store was robbed several times."
good,"Stringent policies with little room for situational judgement calls. The turnover rate is horrible, motivation is slim. Management's attempts at problem solving is laughable, yet depressing."
good,The manager was very rude and obnoxious. He said somethings that should have got him fired an was terrible about promising you days off then would not back it up.
good,"You don't receiver raises. You are stuck at the same pay that you get with you start. The turnover rate for employee hiring is bad. There is favoritism, as well. The turnover rate for management hiring is bad as well. If you do get a good manager is a good thing, it's like a needle in a haystack."
good,"I worked there for coming on four years and have taken on the RSS position but was later told that we do not get paid on titled positions nor do we receive yearly increases.  It was a job I took on request of a friend, wage is greatly based on sales but there has to be someone to be accountable for stocking, and making sure inventory is controlled and available, along with reset of store new stock and cleaning. I took this on not realizing how much I would loose in wages and be kept financially struggling. When I took this job I thought it would be the job I stayed with till retirement. Full time employees should be wage based to not have to have second jobs."
good,"Very busy productive environment, Hardest part of the job was not knowing all the time what the customer was looking for when it came to parts. Did learn many things when it came to cars and parts. Management at the time, nobody was ever really there to supervise everyone always did there own thing. Co-Workers were great mainly men, really funny and always helpful. The most enjoyable part of my day was knowing i got everything done on my list, and helped customers on own by learning."
good,"I enjoyed the customers, and helping with their problems. Was not crazy about management ,district supervisor. I learned to try to build rep. at a new auto parts store ,was not as easy as i thought.my co-workers were not very knowledgeable about cars, seemed to just want to play around."
good,"Always an opportunity to be productive, great customers, and helpful coworkers. Poor Management and human resources."
good,"I didn't mind the job it was fairly easy the problem was to much favoritism, decscrimination, and very little to no advancement opportunities for older workers. plus during the winter months our hours would drop to 20 hours a week and sometimes they would give you the opportunity to go home because there wasn't enough work for everybody, Pretty sad for a company that has one of the highest stocks on the stock market."
good,"I have learned a lot working there, and met some really good people. The hardest part of the job is trying to deal with all the non essential demands of corporate. Too much paper work for a parts store with minimal payoff."
good,Work was of a reasonable amount. hours decent no real advancement opportunities . No company loyalty frequent layoffs.
good,Great people to work with as long as long as you dont have to deal with management.
good,mostly people just needing a job. No intentions on keeping it as a career. no help from upper management. Cut throat.
good,"I learned a lot about the parts on a car."
good,"Well this will sum this up quickly. O'reilly Auto Parts store workers' are under paid and over worked.  Also a lot of thievery.  If you tell on an employee, they get a raise and you get fired."
good,well we stock the store in the a.m. then check our online orders then my team and i start the day working together to make every customer as happy as possible. The hardest part is when we don't have a certain part a customer really needs.
good,"Was brought in from the competition as a ""strategic Hire"" and promised comparable wage and benefits. I worked there for one year, never received promised payment and I was sexually harassed on a daily basis by another employee. I reported him to corporate, my manager, my DM and nothing was ever done. Great place to shop, but not to work"
good,A typical day at work would consist of me assisting customers with their different needs throughout the day.
good,"If it is morning shift is put away stock, pull any over stock, answer phone, delver parts, do a planogram if any, clean if slow, cycle count inventory. put on wiper blades and install a battery."
good,"When I first started the job, I enjoyed it because of what it was doing. But looking at the management side, this company is a joke. They are full of empty promises!! They promised me a promotion to RSS and pay raise in July of 2012 then they had me transfer to the a new store that opened on Jan. 2, 2013 and they promised me my raise and promotion again that I never seen. Managers belittle their employees, as well as take advantage of them. They falsly accused me of something that never happened, and didnt allow me to go in the store 7 miles from my house, and they wanted me to go to the store 45 miles away from my house. If was in the other store, i would get wrote up at my home store. I am so glad I am done with them, although it sucks being jobless right now."
good,Fun place to work but offers little advancement opportunity.
good,The company as a whole is a good company to work for. The majority of the people that work here will bend over backwards to help you in any and every way possible.
good,O'reilly is a good part time employment opportunity and has helped me to get through school.
good,The company differs from district to district I worked in the KC area for 2 years and the Springfield district as well and the district manager in KC was 10 times better at employee relations and for that got good results in the stores but the district manager of the Springfield district was all about the profit witch made for alot more stressful work place which brought the kids in that didn't know any better and lost the good workers to other companies
good,"The problem you start noticing is the dark underbelly. They talk culture all the time but is it culture or cult .Just like  a lot of jobs I get in you have to be in with the in crown. But once you play closer atteintion your working everyweekend while the in crowd is out with the dms and rms oh and once you start noticing the audit and how there is a skewed grade other things start to hit you. Yes be very careful if you have an establish market share all they want to do is disturb the market call any market and see who is still there and not napa replace or replace by a non ethnic .."
good,Managers like to promise people promotions and then months later still not follow through. Make people do trainings and relocations for promotions and then never actually promote them. Was running a store as the assistant. Complained to upper level and just got transferred to a new store to do the same thing
good,The younger guys or girls are it there is a Cap to the money to be made and you can only half way survive on the salary without a added income the older guys barley making in except for the boss the store manager but for the young guns who like the manager badge it's a fun place to work
good,worked in O'reilly auto parts for 7 months as a parts counter sales. provided excellent customer service. sold parts. counted inventory..assisted customers with parts in purchase.
good,"A typical day at the store wasn’t to bad the coworkers besides the manager treated each other like family. I honestly learned a lot more about newer cars than I had knowledge of like misfires and simples things like that. Most enjoyable part of the job was going there and being treated like family, no one disliked one another or anything and people would give you the shirt off of there backs for you. The hardest part of the job I would have to say was dealing with the upset customers when they did not get what they wanted."
good,Orielly distribution is a great job to have outside of some of the people in management. The company offers competitive pay and runs a fairly easy shift. My problem with O'Reilly was with the supervisor of my department. She doesn't repr
good,"Were considered the lowest rung on the ladder."
good,at first everything was good then this had to change and that had to change districts changed upper management changed. then a fresh new lazy drunken manager came In and the store fell apart
good,Althought my time waa brief with only 2 years i did learn alot from this job however policy could use some work i would like to thank ed chapman for being an amazing boss
good,"Good place to work if you truly have a jack of all trades mind and used to work with your dad in the shop and actually know the names of car parts."
good,It is a good company to work for especially if you are in IT. They are not as family oriented as they claim to be. If you know someone that works there or are related to someone there it tends to play a part in whether you get a job or advance in the company.
good,Poor management and they do not care about their workers. We work 10 hrs a day for 6-7 days a week. Never get positives news for doing so good at work
good,This company preaches on promoting with in the company but i have seen them go outside the company a lot over the past few years. need to focus on the people that help build the store to promote
good,"Worked at a big store. Management sucked. Customers were great, co-workers were great. Because the store was so big we never had to order much of anything."
good,"Good, clean. Good parts. Good prices"
good,"This review is not for all the stores it’s only for the one that I was last working at . Management wise it depends on the store you are, because the last store the manager was great manager."
good,"The one ok the worst companies for women to work for. 90% of their Store Managers are Men, this explaines why there  is very little to No opportunities for career advancement for women."
good,it is a multitasking job that it is fast paced. customer service is the more emphasized topics in focus. basic car knowledge is preferred. hands on job
good,Not to bad to work for I would recommend for someone wanting auto parts experience. The Manager is very cool and will make the scheduled to fit your need if your in School or have a second job.
good,No one there wanted to put away merchandise. It would just sit there until someone came in that would put it away. Job was easy. Mgr would say nothing about it just let it happen day after day
good,"Very un professional management at his store. I requested a certain day off 3 weeks in advance, and my manager said I could have it off. The reason I got it off is because it was my band's album release show. An hour before the show, my manager texted me saying that I needed to abandon the show and get to work at that minute or else I would be fired. I told him that this show was very important to me and I couldn't continue to work there if I couldn't play the show that night and he texted me back saying how I played myself."
good,"Salary is low. Cant support 1 person on salary even after being employed there for years. ................."
good,A majority of the upper management team was brought in off the street with a serious lack of training by upper management. The company relies on training from team members.
good,"This is a very fast paced store, or it was. It could be very overwhelming to the unprepared. We had a great crew that was like a second family. I looked forward to going to work each day. The manager cared for his people. It changed!!!!! Upper management makes promises they have no intention of keeping, blow smoke up your butt to keep you in your place."
good,"This review is for their distribution center, not their retail stores. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job would be the route, your time on the road to deliver even though you were not allowed a lot of time  "
good,dont recommend if you are a clock puncher and expect your 40 every week....to many days that were slow where between half hour to 4 hours cut to make the daily numbers with no way to make up time...constant every week....usually lost on average a quarter of what you were scheduled ....especially if you opened... usually no warning or heads up that you were going home early...just sorry numbers slow go home....dont know if that is still the case but how it was for me....also if you werent in the favorites column with management life was tougher...immature inexperenced assistant managers that play petty games or went out of their way to play favorites or hose employees that they didnt like....best of luck....least the paychecks didnt bounce....
good,"Recommend to someone retired and needs little extra income.  Low pay."
good,Ok job not big on rasies it seems the more you try and be a team player the will walk over you and if you stand up to it they try and cut you effort after two years it get to be enough
good,Competitive commission makes it a fast paced and stressful work environment. There is room for advancement if cataloging and relationships with management or professional customers is done correctly.
good,I did not like working there at all but my bills needed to be paid and that’s all I could find at the time. They are somewhat sexist to women in some stores and they have a lot of favoritism going on!
good,"The people are really cool to work with , loved the competitive atmosphere, Fun proactive place to work at . One thing I did enjoy as well , the productive work force ."
good,I delived auto to auto repair shops throw out the day in a timely manner and injoyed learning about the parts i delived .  I also picked up the parts they did not need
good,"There is too much to do and never enough people to do it. Constantly under the strain of meeting frequently needlessly aggressive goals. Performance tracking is either too small a sample (one phone survey per month and overall performance based on 1 call against literally thousands), or tracked wonky such as driver safety measured by vehicle count as opposed to miles driven. Company is performance based so high performers compensated fairly well as managers and above. All other team members grossly underpaid for workload and skills required."
good,Atleast in my area the managment is terrible. In three years ive been threw 7 managers. Who are either gone for disciplinary reasons or they left because of upper managment. You do get benifits and a discount. But you are not paid for the amount of work they want you to do. Store managers work 70hrs a week alot and get paid zero over time.
good,"The companies that I delivered to were upset sometimes because sometimes the parts they ordered were old or wrong. They complained a lot because some people didn't like some people. Nothing was never organized. Being the only female at that location, had to hear things I didn't want to hear."
good,They allowed a commercial specialist to harass female associates on facebook and then did nothing about it except moved him to another location in East Albany.
good,"Store managers and below don’t get paid enough for all they do that keeps the company going day to day. "
good,"The store level is nice. Sometimes it hectic, sometimes it's dead. But the company will never pay you what you're worth, but they will jerk you around with promotions and raises and take forever to deliver certain entitlements. They want you to give 110% and will say nice things, but when it comes to rewards they just give the 10%."
good,"Upper management lets the stores only run skeleton crews, which wreaks havoc if someone calls in. I like the company ,A lot of good people work there, But the job responsibilities kept on increasing to the point of my resignation"
good,"Day consists primarily of delivering auto parts to a specified area. Learned customer relations importance with face to face of large number of customers. Management is good, works at being consistent, knowledgeable. Workplace culture is fairly low key. Hardest part of job and most enjoyable part of job are the customer contacts, most are great to work with, some, not so much"
good,Very fast paced. Not enough staff covering shifts. Which means you are always shorthanded when customers walk in. Very stressful but you get great discounts in parts.
good,Okay job but management is bad poor Inspection of store discounts are ok but they get after you after using it a couple times not fair pay everyone slacks off
good,"No room to move up unless your a favorite. Very poor management and lack of professionalism. Decent starting wage for a non-union warehouse, mediocre top out. Low stress environment, often get to leave early in winter and options for overtime in summer (often mandatory)."
good,Oreilly would be a great place to work if the managers didn’t show favoritism with their employees. The company allows certain employees to grow in the company by whom they like other than that they are a good company to work for.
good,"I was part-time and the job required full time dedication. By this I mean that the work schedule was not set and could change at a moment's notice, as the store was perpetually running a skeleton crew. It proved impossible to schedule anything outside of work very far in advance, and they wanted 2 weeks notice to schedule a day off. Working both days of every weekend was also non negotiable. The pay was far below what someone with my troubleshooting experience and technical background should be. Also, the management is rewarded for keeping a high disparity between gross profit and overhead, so very little gets invested to improve the store. No one will get a good eval there, and evals are used as a way to belittle your worth as an employee, and bully you out of asking for a raise. But on the sales floor management will salutaciously compliment your performance.  Also, on-the-job-training is about as terrible as I have ever seen, and it is absolutely necessary for any new employee to function. In my view it is an unsustainable leadership strategy."
good,last choice to work if your experienced. Low pay and no reguard to employee satisfaction and or retention. no rest breaks offered or allowed High turnover..
good,"This work isn't technically the best or the worst. It's good if you need the money, there is so much to handle though, and they will not pay you fairly."
good,I do say that they should give it more on the security . Amd when hiring they should do a background check. I actaully like on the amount of time whem they do evaluation.  Other than its a fun place to work you not only attend customer but meet more people and learn about vehicle parts.
good,i love working with cars and such and i loved my loyal costumers but company was not good to work for they have very poor management like the district manger and even regional manger
good,Very busy with calls and walk in customers. Hard to place inventory onto shelves due to lack of staffing. Orielly's does not place education for certifications like Checker Auto had. I loved working with my customers that I built with my trust of knowledge. O'rielly's forced a pay cut in hourly rate and bonus when they bought out CSK Auto.
good,Some stores are busier than others mostly friendly coworkers and calm environment during most of the day unless you are delivering parts around the area
good,"The management that was in place atlas when I was there was complete garbage, the assistant manager was two faced and corrupt, brought several major violations committed by him to the DM and the DM didn't do anything about it. The management did not take care of their people."
good,"Great place to work at, for your first job. You do get to learn a lot about car parts while working here. With that being said wish management was more on top of things for example  training new hires."
good,"The job could be lot better, the only good thing that i have seen is the dicounts which even with them the prices are still high. You don't get any benefits unless full time and only 2 people are considered full time."
good,"very dirty, very hot in the summer, cold in the winter, some heavy lifting, poor management, management wants to come in and make changes but nothing is done."
good,"fast paced customer based company...great work enviroment with great people, just needs to have upper management learn to support the lower tier management teams.  fast advancement for those interested...pay not what should be for advancement"
good,I liked working here at first but they hire and fire so quickly and don't screen people well enough for the job.  Had so many people stealing and since I was the merchandiser they tried to put it all on me.  Luckily I am smart and I wouldn't take Ford parts for a Chevy.
good,A great company too work for. The company is willing too work around your schedule both noon and night. Management is very knowledgeable and willing to allow you to reach any level that you want.
good,No opinion on this company because I was terminated due to false pretenses. It was solely based on hearsay by other employees 1 of which was absent on medical leave during said incident.
good,Customers were usually grumpy when they entered our establishment. Most of the employees did not really like working for the company. The pay was not sufficient enough to provide for more than one person and the career path was non-existent.
good,"I have learned a lot about management, inventory control, other things regarding sales and supply chain."
good,I don't have much to say. I don't really agree with some of the things they do. Need better managers. Worked for the company twice and the last time I got screwed over by the manager.
good,"take care of walk in customers and professional customers, by selling them car parts. Open the store do management paper, check in stock, do end of day paper work, close store."
good,"Logistics is good; but the inventory maintenance is bad."
good,Allow flexibility to selected individuals to cross-train between departments.  no promotions upward.
good,The situation depends on the location. City that I'm located in offers no true growth for advancement. The store has been so poorly managed in the past that the current situation is in limbo with no true advancement toward a fresh start or improvement. The staff is in constant rotation of new faces and many employees are afforded special schedules which leave the burden to carry the load of responsibilities on a small number to often. Leading to constant morale issues.
good,"My services there, had many thing to keep me occupied. My crew, was the best that i could ever Ask. if not within the store, i did enjoyed driving around the city for my deliveries. it was always busy,  there was always something to do. But in the way my salary met with my duties, was unbalanced."
good,I worked in the company for three years where i was an order selector trainer and new store team member. I was attempting to become management then the unfairness and equality became a problem.
good,The store manger is a total joke. This place is a joke. Get new management and i think they would have a chance. Working here at first was nice and i really enjoyed it. But then i got swamped with hours. i worked 3 months straight 60 hrs a week no days off. They treat the employees like a joke.
good,"every day a new challenge,every day you learned something new, management is management, co-workers in there special way a interesting bunch, the hardest part of the job is a unsatisfied customer.the rewards of the job is giving customer satisfaction and in return they know you by name"
good,Great Job for students wanting part time work.  Full time doesn't pay enough to live off of or make a career out of.  Commission pay is too low for the amount of effort a good sales person puts into the job.
good,"I enjoyed working with my customer , helping them find what they was looking for. Also i had the best crew in the world working for me ."
good,"A good place to get your feet wet in the ever changing auto parts market, I also learned alot about the RPM software, and I also got to handle customer relations and problems on a one on one level.."
good,"okay company wont work around schedule, nobody seems to care about their job and things were very unorganized in the stock room."
good,I enjoyed working at oreilly auto parts. I like to help customers solve there automotive issues. Getting the right parts for the customers. Building relationships with customers.
good,This company enhanced my customer service skills. It was a very hands on position where a certain amount of sales was expected. It was definitely was a great way to be more comfortable engaging customers in conversation while opening dialog in regard to the companies products and services.
good,"i didnt like working here because the management sucked, the manager always left and wasnt there. co workers were slacking off too much."
good,This place was very productive. Gained a lot of experience with identifying problems with your vehicle. Great team to work with.
good,When i worked there the training was not good and the management would never work with if you had a schedule issue they would always give me a hard time about it or if I had a question they would say they would get back at you and never did they only good thing is the associates you worked with
good,You start the day by getting the start amount for your cash register and they ring people up all day then at the end of your day you count your drawer and clean up the store.  I learned how to ring people up on a computer and rather quickly at that.  Our manager was pretty much your average manager I did not like how him and one of my co-workers would fight all the time.  My co-workers were easy to work with well all but one of them she got impatient quite a lot.  The hardest part of my day was getting through the day without letting people steal from the store because after all the store had no cameras.  I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and fun co-workers.
good,Brought issues to not only store manager but district manager about drugs being sold in the store. Nothing was done about the issue and the employees still work in store. Would not recommend employment.
good,"i found working at o'reilys to be over all a good place to work, although i do believe they could have  better management staff at the location i worked at."
good,"I worked at O'Reillys Auto Part store for a year. When I started I was a parts specialist for a month then I switch positions to a inventory(Stock Boy). About another month and week I became a driver. Then another month and a half I became a parts specialist. Then a month became a Manager. Doing these time I work with this company there was good and bad. Well the Hardest part of my day was fighting with customers with warranties and used products. The good part I learned more about parts and how they work met interesting people. During the time I was working for them the employees that I work with were lazy, to friendly and did what they wanted to do"
good,"Flexibility in schedule was problem, Hired as part time working full time hours with no benefits"
good,"A day at work, with my staff in particular, is never typical. Daily job duties aren't evenly distributed, and tyranny levels are through the roof. I happen to be the youngest employee of my crew and for as long as I have been employed here, I feel as though I may be considered the scapegoat."
good,"Worked in a warehouse stocking inventory, place orders for shipping and receiving parts. Some customer interactions."
good,u are nothing but a number in this place. people care about money not the employee
good,"My reveiw, I enjoyed some of the people working there. It just seemed to me there was no advancement and pay was not great. It seemed to me that I had to wait on all ""the crazies"". But that could had been cause of the area."
good,"customer service, answer phones, help customers on floor. I enjoy helping people and meeting different people."
good,"this is a company for younger people and retired people, some can advance but you really have to work hard, and be prepared for your life to change, your weekends are gone, and you will have to work nights in some cases, and its cut-throat, dog eat dog."
good,"Order Specialty and stock parts,Day End-Report, Balance Drawers end of day,Prepare and secure deposit for next day,Computer Shut Down,Lock up at end of day.I learned a great deal on ordering specialty products and billing also on managing my time. Management helped me aquire a basic insight on office management skills and prepared me for to be able to succeed in secretarial jobs anywhere. the hardest part of the job was all the nights away from my son. Learning new things everyday and knowing my customers."
good,always interacting with customers
good,I liked working where I deliver products to customers and having a nice vehicle to work out of. Where fellow employees are friendly and fun to work with.
good,"If the supervisors dont like you, you wont get a raise or get helped out to move to a different work crew. Its all about favorites there. You stop getting raises after u make it to 17hr."
good,"As a store manager, I found myself having to learn as I went. My district manager kept pointing me to my subordinates that had been there for a while to answer questions I had. Ultimately the 80hr work weeks and lack of help from above ended my time here."
good,Didnt get along with the manager. Otherwise liked working there. There was a conflict of interests that happened between the manager and me and I decided I would walk away from the job.
good,Self insured. Dont get hurt. I was forced to go to Dr of their choice. Poor results. Have been for three years fighting to reopen injured workers claim. Employer spent more on attorney to fight proper team member care. Decent medical /dental/vision plans. Pay is based on position. So working there for 4 years is same pay as new guy.  Physically demanding . Often seniority prevails not quality.
good,if your a kid straight out of high school this job is ok to start with but dont plan on staying long. The favoritism is so blatant that is was funny at times there are people who work there and maybe work 10 hours out of the week and spend the rest sitting talking to their friends. Management will pretty much never listen to you and will say they will fix something but will almost never leave their office
good,We would have waves of people come in with short staff. We were responsible with customer service and satisfaction along with house cleaning chores after the store closed.
good,Learned a lot about vehicle parts and how they work together. Learned also the main parts to replace and keep maintenced to keep the vehicle running properly.
good,"a good company ,"
good,One of the most unprofessional work environments I worked at. But this was mostly due to how the Regional Loss Prevention guy would profile employees and try to treat workers poorly. I would have sued for the treatmemt but the little pay that is being earned isnt worth all the bills for court that would need to be paid.
good,productive and great pay learning different departments is fun. working at O'reillys is all about who you know. Staying to yourself and concentrating on your work will get you to succeed.
good,Worked for oriellys is lay back just depend on what store u work at. They are very flexible with your work or school schedule. They do not paid enough to put up with the customer service from the customer.Their raised or not but a few cents.
good,Not good in leadership nor advancement. Coworkers are nice. Shifts can be long and demanding. Becoming full time takes a long process even if you apply for full time.
good,Flaws in way store level management do not have control of hiring directly. They have to go through bunch of hoops to hire or to promote employees. Otherwise a helpful manager.
good,"I enjoyed working for O'Reilly's. I started as a part time Driver and in 3 year worked my way up to Assist Manager. I enjoyed helping customers with thier car problems and finding the parts to get them back on the road again."
good,"Under staffed, underpaid, to much responsibility for low pay. Terrible location. No training. Nobody applies at this location because its a small community and its just that theres no pay really. Its sad that the local gas stations and burger joints around here pay more when you dont need knowledge to work at those places opposed to needing automotive knowledge. You just do not feel appreciated at all"
good,I usually stock parts and products as soon as I clock in. I help any and all customers that come in with all their auto part needs. The most enjoyable part of the job are the great people I've met and the great things that I've learned while working there.
good,"Expect to be busy. As usual, there are a lot of slackers that are happy to hide in the bathroom and let others pull the lions share of the work. That's generally fine until your manager comes down on you for not completing your own work on time and you have to remind him that you stood at the counter all day covering for others. Everybody goes nuts when there's the threat of a store audit (usually because they've been remiss in doing their paperwork etc for some time) and it's usually for no good reason as he very rarely walks through the door anyways."
good,Most of the managers are fun and willing to work with their employees.  They have a great work culture and teach their employees how to grow within the company.
good,"Had been working there for three years and switched between stores to pick up shifts and maintain my hours, not much had been going on then i get fired for being 5 minutes late a couple times when the rest of the crew was already doing that same thing..."
good,"I spent almost 7 years working for this company. In the beginning it was great, at least it seemed that way, I was just happy to be working again after I came home from college and had been on my job search for quite some time. As the years passed I moved around in the company becoming apart of the front counter, where I was a cashier but played more of a parts specialist role then went on to working the third shift which was the worst last nine months of my life. That nine months showed me that this job was no longer for me, there is no advancement and when there is a problem with other employees, management will NOT do anything about it no matter how bad it was and to get ahead you will get thrown under the bus! I HAD to go!"
good,"Orders come in from all the stores in the area that they do not have, they either come from our DC or our store and we pick and load them 5 times a day and deliver to each store. 3 runs 3 people "
good,"I worked for this company for six years, I started has a driver worked my way up to asst manager. I lost my store manager the Dm at the time noticed my hard work and gave me a store management postion . I ran a store with out asst manager for two years I ran a store way to long without asst manager. I worked 60+ hour a week as a manager I was salary pay. I got burnt out of my job i enjoyed working here at one point in time. I did something wrong by them so without hesitation they fired me. In the same time frame they let another manager go. Every year they bring up high turn over rate stop letting people go and pay more. When i started for this company six years ago my starting pay was $9.50 hr tell this day they still start people at that wage.I have nothing against this company they have policies to follow."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but district manager and upper management don't have a clue on how to run a store.  Job isn't hard to do, but demands on your time and duties is nuts.  You have plan o grams, cycle counts, paperwork, sales calls.  Way too much."
good,"It was a good job but, management was not really on the ball about making the schedule sometimes they wouldn't make the schedule til the last day of the week. I guess they would also take things to personal and start acting petty towards you if you didn't agree with everything they decided on. and the pay wasn't as good as I would have wanted it to be. I don't know if it was because management wasn't knowledgeable of their training but, they would tell me to do one thing and then get mad at after me for doing it the way they told me and then tell me to do a different way."
good,Good people to work with. Don't enforce company policies. Poor compensation for the amount of work expected to be preformed by each employee and make it very difficult to advertised services to the retail customers.
good,"it was a bad place but no advancement, and the people were good , but the amount of product coming in was insane! they couldn't handle the volume of material (lack of shelving) and DOT was giving them a hard time, couldn't get enough truck drivers so they ended up closing."
good,There is a new culture of fuel injection and most of the people there understand it but for carbureted engines most employees are lost as well as anything built from 1960 and older and modification is required
good,Job is easy. Lot of pass the buck going on. Not enough employees if someone gets sick. No room for advancement. People who come in expect you to work on their cars. I just sell auto parts.
good,I started never working in a parts store I learned a lot different became more knowledgeable about cars. Would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about cars.
good,"When i first started working everyone was very welcoming and nice.Some people got along and some didn't has the days went by, My work started speeding up and i started getting better and better no management said good job or nothing so the started making me help my supervisor but never gave me a incentive or anything such as ""Good Job"" nothing. The work place was a mess no one cleaned up the restroom but me and no one cleaned up the break-room neither. One thing i did learn was more about cars and parts for my car. I also enjoyed talking to some of the older people that been worked there and i love to work with them."
good,At the store I worked at the manager over the drivers was very disrespectful and yelled at everyone while doing her hair. When she wasnt there it was a great job. We took parts to customers and learned about car parts and things. I really enjoy driving and i learned the area like the back of my hand. Hardest part was putting up with the one employee.
good,A typical day was being stacked with alot of odd jobs on top of your regular job and management was less then ideal.I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
good,"A decent job for a kid in high school, or maybe a second job but the wages at O'Reillys is low and a normal person just couldnt live off of what they are paying in my area"
good,I enjoyed working here. I felt like I should have earned more that $10/hr. I felt differently when I found out that the employees at both locations were dogging me personally.
good,"They do not pay near enough for the cost of living in my area. It would be a great job for someone that is retired or a student, but not someone with a family to support."
good,"The overall facility has went down, from management to the employees. They really don't care about the employees that work there. The morale is low and they put a lot of stress on there workers. You have a top out pay that's different in every department. There always changing things not always for the best. It use to be a stress-free, family oriented place to work but that has change."
good,"i would not recommend working here they take and take but don't appreciate any of your hard work. i worked as an assistant manager getting payed 11.50 an hour but had to run the whole store because they moved our store manger and left us without one for a whole year. you really have to kiss you know what to the district manager if you ever want to move up in the company, they expect you to over work yourself for very little money.. sometimes you can't take a break cause you are so busy but they still take it out your paycheck"
good,"Great place to work , meet great and wonderful people on the daily . But no room for proportions and pay .... you learn more about your customers needs"
good,It is a fast pace job and you haft watch your numbers on hour worked  to the amount of sales you did. If the sales are down for long you lost some pay off houry wage.
good,"On average, the job tasks are simple but are things that when mastered, can make anyone a well-rounded person. If you enjoy talking to and coaching people then this is a job for you."
good,"i would say the stores i have experienced are in need of management upscale, could be very great if management cared equally about employee as much as the cared about product movement."
good,I sometimes would open and close the store. I held multiply positions and was expected to get the job for a few people done myself. Required more time than i was really willing to give. Pay was not awful but would have been happier with a bit of an increase.
good,The manager at Oreillys did not care about emoloyees. Never listened to employees thoughts. expected me to do more then I was qualified to do and would be upset from not knowing what to do.
good,great place to learn about car parts other that its not a very good job its good job if you dont know anything about cars or parts they do have good management
good,"Long hours for salaried employees, no accountability in upper management.  First week consisted of sitting in the back on the computer all day long watching 1995 training videos.  Lack of company references and tools."
good,The job that I worked was very stressful and the pay was not making it for me to succeed in my life. I felt as if the employees are just a number to others. Again it was just a stepping stone
good,Sadly it is one of those retail companies that only look to provide criticism instead of guidance. They rarely promote and only do so when the potential to lose a quality employee to a rival business.
good,"Not a fan of how they conduct business, seems to be a ""good old boys"" way of doing business. Work environment was relaxed but promotions seem to hang on who you know."
good,"Depending on both the season as well as the day and weather, and the location, a day can be pretty slow, with people only showing up maybe once every twenty minutes. Other days can be nonstop business with lines of customers. You are expected to stay friendly, deal with purchases and returns, handle cash, cards, and checks, be able to use a computer catalog as well as a paper catalog, and be able to do specific basic work on customer vehicles."
good,Ive been working for Oreilly for a while now and overall it's not that horrible of a job. I've learned loads about cars and get a really good discount but I really wish store management was better.
good,A typical day is sometimes slow to being busy. But some employees are fun to be around and helpful. You also get to meet new people everyday. I leaned more about car working here too.
good,O'reilly is a competitive place to wôrk. The pay is not good and the hours are short. The benefits were average and so was managemeñt. Raises were hard to come by.
good,Could be a lot better. There needs to be more leadership and control in who they hire as s store manager. Because right now ours is basically a paper weight for a chair. Laziest worker/ manager I've ever seen.
good,While I was employed there I was overworked and under paid because my co workers didn't like to come in to work so I was there go to person because I was dependable
good,"A typical day at work, will be consolidating of totes, scanning parts, fluffing, wrapping, and loading route. I learned to load and unload trucks and complete the necessary paperwork properly. Management was pretty cool to me, along as you came to work and did your job. Work place culture is very hot in the summer, fast pace environment,and loud. The hardest part was the lifting of the batteries, and routers all the time. The most enjoyable part was working with my team members."
good,"This is a very enjoyable and fulfilling work experience, under the right management. Most of the more  experienced managers have been driven out by the current district manager. This has driven down the morale of everyone and now the company is going downhill in Tucson. It seems almost impossible to advance in this company without the proper amount of brown-nosing, hard work gets you nowhere. They only focus on the negative things that happen."
good,the manager was great but the job was for little kids.  It had to be because it didnt pay anything.  And because it payed nothing people didnt take it seriously and treated it like it was somewhere they just needed to show up to every now and then.
good,it was good nothing intersting except it depends on the people you work with and you get to learn more about the automotive car parts. It does help you get to know the right people that knows the right car shop repair to go to.
good,"The Company itself has the right idea. But don't expect help from management, co-workers, or human resources if you are being bullied or treated like garbage, especially if you are female. I complained and HR showed up, only to ignore everything I showed them and took the words of the males who were holding down the counters and management who was too busy yapping with the commercial guy about personal stuff to help out on the front. Plus I was told I have a bad attitude. I really would like to know anyone that WOULDN'T have a poor attitude after being treated like their personal maid and not receiving any help when you asked... repeatedly....."
good,It's a wonderful place to work if your career is in the automotive industry . They work together to solve problems and give the very best customer service possible!
good,Come in morning count draw and wait for shipment to be received in. once ready stock the shipment and then answer phones and then help customers who need help
good,"I have been working there for almost 2 years and barely received a raise.  Started out at $9 and now I'm at $9.38. For being a supervisor and a key carrier i have been given a lot of responsibility and not the pay to match it. Also I had been given a lot of empty promises.  I just had enough, need more money and a honest employer."
good,Fun place to work normal bull tjat you have any other place i have no home life i work 11 am to close 5 days a week only monday and tuesday off and a new manager comes in and gets day ours and weekends offl
good,"OK place to work for. Good benefits, Management is tolerable. They do have a culture but some is followed at times others its not. Started off good but slowly decreased my spirit to work there."
good,"To be a ""promote from within"" company they sure do hire a lot of NAPA and Autozone rejects for higher positions... Even in situation where someone would quit and I'd take over the position for a few months just for someone to be hired in to fill the spot I was already filling instead of just giving me the promotion I had earned by that point."
good,The hardest part of this job is the demand for service with a not enough employees to work the counter. Management is new so don't feel he could see great employees when he had them.
good,"Management at the distribution center in Brownsburg, Indiana make it very difficult for career growth.  There is also a class system in place between material handlers, equipment operators, and management."
good,"Unfortunately i never got to see my family. Dealing with over 150 commercial customers. Multitasking is a must, phone lines, managing delivery drivers."
good,"everything is disorganized and a wreck, the regional manager doesn't care for people for absolutely no reason. Love my co workers but the higher ups need to get it together. but Im treated well. not currently getting enough hours but they are constantly complaining about needing help...."
good,"Co-workers did not follow a team-based environment. I learned very little regarding customer service. The management was friendly but did not see to it that their employees went above and beyond. The hardest part of the job was the lack of attention to personal needs, gave no leniency at all on scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the regular customers that came in."
good,I learned a lot about auto parts from this company. The training offered was very good. Management was not supportive in crisis situations. A typical work day consisted of working stock from warehouse and assisting customer needs with auto parts.
good,Check in merchandise from our morning delivery. Then verify what customer. Print out receipt for the items for each customer before loading items into delivery truck.
good,People are not always nice there and the management doesn't care if you work or not.  They expect you to lift heavy objects even when a doctor tell you that you can't. Just not a very happy place to work at.
good,This job is ok if you have nothing else to do with your life. The one im at is always short staffed leaving me working other peoples hours
good,Was a fun place to work starting off. Now it's becoming a dead end. No room for advancement really. If you go into management there is room.
good,Great to work if you like customer service and meeting people in the area but communication is poor in management. They were always short staffed and I was getting burned out covering all the hours. Parts of management were not supportive of of mine and other employees medical issues.
good,I was needing more hours to support my family. I am also looking for something with insurance. I did enjoy working there.
good,The manager is very young and inexperienced as a manager.  He lacks leadership skills that would make a comfortable work environment.
good,"I have worked here for a little more than 10 months, and have offered do a management job that they needed filled and they give me the run arounds, and keep putting it off."
good,"Some of the people are nice, and your starting pay is 11.00hr. In some departments you are off on the weekend. The hardest part is the long hours and not knowing when you will clock out to go home."
good,"A great place to learn a lot from cars to dealing with all type of "
good,Overall good place to work but they are not competitive in their market as pertaining to wages.  Many of the same local trade industries pay quite a bit higher and have better benefit packages.
good,"busy store, fast pace, lots to learn and a lot of different tasks to do all day. Very hard work but its fun to learn all the new car parts."
good,I enjoyed working for oreilly auto parts the first few years. In 2014 the store manager after working there for 11 years was replaced.
good,"Answered phones and helped customers with parts and any question they may have."
good,"the work is pretty easy, just get ready to clean up after everyone"
good,"Good job if you are a student or like auto parts and must have a good driving history to be able to deliver their parts."
good,"Like any retail sales position, you go in stock selves and sell things. Low stress environment at the base level. Loved working with my co-workers"
good,"Although this company seemed like something great from the outside, it was VERY different on the inside. I experienced being held down from advancing and benefits. I experienced disorganization and selfishness."
good,"A typical Day at work consists of the phone's ringing off the hook, Not enough People To cover lunch breaks, and lines of irritated customers. "
good,"Employees get transferred from store to store to easy and without consideration of their opinion. And if an employee wants to get transferred, it becomes almost impossible. No job recognition. No appreciation."
good,management was not helpful when it came to helping employees file necessary paperwork for on the job accidents or just any paperwork in general
good,"Typical day would be clocking in, checking out customers, putting away the massive amount of back stock the morning shift failed to do in the evening shift that I closed. Management was very lazy and I saw them take advantage of so many new hires that they all ended up quitting. There is absolutely no pay raises- at least at my store. Every parts specialist that I worked with that had been there much longer than me were still at starting pay. I learned that work is work and no one at work is your friend. My coworkers would constantly tattle on each other about petty issues and it felt more like a drama battle than O'Reillys. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts and the least favorite was dealing with adults that acted as children."
good,"I had this job before I got into plant work. I could barely feed my family, and I was actually almost constantly training my own replacement."
good,"Login to computer, begin production of data, review any communications that pertain to productivity. I learned a lot about cars, and some database information."
good,People I worked with/for at the level I was at were great.  Can't say the same for some of the upper management.
good,come in check in stock go count discrepancy then put up stock and recount to make sure that the day before parts were returns were accounted for while helping customers and answering phones and pulling parts and cashing customers out cleaning and any small maintenance like ballasts and light bulbs and air filters
good,Work was always simple and hands on. The management is okay as well.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is a good place to work. There is great retail and managerial experience to be gained at this company. However, compensation is poor across the board."
good,"Our manager had favorites, which caused other to succeed and me to ""fail"". I learned a lot about parts and support. Solving issues and Planograms. I loved every customer that walked through the door."
good,"Was never time down, always busy helping customers. Managmenbt was ok to work with. my co worker were team players and would help every chance."
good,"Looking for this company was nice overall, but they don't pay enough and I have family feud so I didn't stay long. Also I had health issues that made it hard for me to maintain expected work loads."
good,company only as good as management which changes all the time. some managers are good and some not much..worked there over 5 years was refused a raise for not very good reason. was top in sales in district which made no difference ????
good,Shows lot of favoritism . Benefits aren’t all that great. Flexible hours if needed. Will work with schedule if need be but if your not one of the favorites . Good luck
good,the discount was great part of the job when I needed parts for my project cars and when my close family needed them. also the stability of the job was great.
good,"There pay is not the best and they dont not give fair cost of living rasies, some stores are better then others but this is managment, takes years to grow with company"
good,"That’s the only way I can excuse the managers treatment to their employees!  Always “guilty before proven innocent”, try to explain issues while manager walks away laughing at you, everyone is treated like a teen-ager (I’m older), you begin a project without being told and manager immediately takes credit for you stepping up, etc"
good,This is a great starter company. The hours are kind of hectic but pay is reasonable. Under the right management you could make a great career for yourself.
good,"I was delivery parts driver, I was responsible for answering the phone,.pulling and delivering parts. Greet customers as they entered the store and to help ensure that they were sold the proper part to repair their vehicle."
good,workers should be heard...workers are the ones with knowledge of employee contribution and work ethic.  lazy management finds it easier to play favorites resulting in low morale throughout... far from being a team
good,A typical day at O'Reilly's would be I punch in to the system than I would get my drawer key from my manager. Than I would stand at the counter and sell parts to customers that came in or did diagnostic checks with a handheld computer.
good,"You encounter individuals that are at their most frustrating period of their lives, because their daily driver now is broken. Knowledge of parts and cars help. If not, you will learn quick."
good,People are good. Work is good. Hours good. Socialization is good. Communication is okay. Management is okay. Helps if you know youre tools and car parts.
good,"The jobs not hard, dealing with the customers is actually fun it just doesnt pay enough for you to be there all day everyday. They are very competitive as well."
good,Recently in the last 6 months hours were being taken out of all workers checks without actually getting breaks. Scheduling was poor and so was how understaffed we were.
good,They need to work on the family to work ratio. Its appalling to say the least. More time was spent at the store and not at home. If they were to change that and work with you on the hours it be better.
good,"Warehouse is hot in the summer and cold in the winter. Employees always complain and try to find ways to get out of doing their job."
good,"restricted delivery area so not many customers , store manager was excellent upper management was so -so , stores don't work together very well , expect you to work when there is none"
good,The climate at the workplace is horrendous with the temperature reaching many times over  100 degrees while working 10 hours or more a day. The starting pay makes it worth it though for a student.
good,"First things first, at the time I worked at O'Reilly's yes, the management was poor, but since that time, they have had a change in management and a big change in employees, so they have undergone a big atmospheric change in the workplace. That being said, my assessment of the workplace would be inaccurate if I were to go off of when I was there rather than the present day. As far as a typical day of work, a lot of inventory work was in place, as well as a big customer service factor. If you are willing to learn or already know, mixing paint is also a possibility. I learned a lot while working here. When I started, I knew enough to get myself by, but when I quit, I knew enough to help others with the problems they might have or possibly have. As I said previously, the management has changed so, if I were to give an assessment on that it wouldn't be valid for the present day management. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance work and school (at the time I was full-time work and full-time at college). That was simply because I hardly got the time to be able to do the work I needed for school at home due to my hours, and I hardly got the time to do that work and be able to focus on it at work as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. I enjoyed their company and they enjoyed mine. We had each other's backs and everyone helped each other."
good,"I liked working for the company until I got transferred to another store. And then they accused me of things I didn't do."
good,"most of the time u stand there and wait and answer the phone,  when it rains no one will come and if they do they will ask for wiper bladses and ask you to put them on"
good,"Understandably, you cannot pay unexperienced employees top dollar. Although, someone with experience can make decent wages, if they do not see you fit for those wages, they offer bottom dollar. You have to suck up to move anywhere in that company, otherwise hope you're content where you're at."
good,"Daily sales calls on commercial accounts.  Review currents programs, specials and introduce new products.  At the local store, everyone is very nice to work with. One of the hardest part of this position is helping each customer to grow their business by offering the best product at a competitive price.  We offered the best service, but sometimes price can win over."
good,They let the stores get really short on staff and won’t help cover the shifts. They work you until you don’t have a personal life and on your only day off they call you and expect you to come in. They let you work 13 days straight before offering to help cover
good,"Already summerized, not a whole lot more to say. Nothing matters there except your monthly sales. Coworkers are rough at first but after a while they come around if your a hard worker."
good,Lack of skills in management hurts O'Reilly Auto Parts. Good company but some people lack the skills or know enough to get promoted without having knowledge or people skills
good,"This job started out good great management good hours decent benefits, but the level of stress that the upper management puts on store staff is rediculous for what they are payed it was a fun experience because of the people I worked with but o wouldn't go back for love or money"
good,"When I first began working, my store had an amazing manager. He got promoted and left within a month of my hire. Next manager was pretty good, though employers were bitter cuz he asked a little more of them. Not too much, mind you, he asked an appropriate amount. He got promoted and left, so a third manager came in. Again, he was alright, no problems. I changed job positions and moved to another store. Management was alright, though butted heads with each other. Store was slightly divided, but working ok. Got my last transfer to a store with the worst management I've ever had in my entire life, and I've been working for 15+ years. This job was horrible, and the store was falling apart - but the managers were patting themselves in the back for ""fixing it"". No job is perfect, but O'Reilly's was ruined for me because of bad management. My best review is: if you have bad management, talk to the higher ups about it. O'Reilly's is a great place to work if you have decent managers. Pay is fine, hours are fine, work load is ok if you are ok lifting and doing busy work, and if what they have doesn't suite you, there's probably another O'Reilly you can work for."
good,"Hours were not consistent, they expect a lot out of you but there are never enough hours to give the employees in order to full fill the job requirements. They make promises they are not able to keep"
good,"I would arrive early to work and have coffee, from the previous night I prepared beforehand. Sit among co-workers and talk about the day ahead. Clock in and begin to put up stock that arrived the night before. An order would come in, and it was our job to pull the correct part and deliver to the customer unless it need to be sourced from another location. From there, I would acquire the part and expedite it to the customer, logging in time, mileage, and monies, if it were a cash account. This happened repetitively throughout the day."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at this facility. However, the corporate side did not take good care of its employees. The focus was on how much money could be earned by each individual location and cutting payroll whenever possible."
good,"as asst manager the pay was a joke, 1 review and rais in over 3 years and it was 17 cents, management is a joke as no one has to do as instructed by management, just do as you please"
good,"Work every day, off weekend, morning shift, up to 40 hrs a week good benefits paid holidays overtime availability training for any position available able to transfer to another position after 6 months"
good,they would expect you to do all the morning producers and your night duties. its not a fair environment at some stores others are fantastic everyone is there putting in their fair share of work I wish that the Store managers were trained a lot better with delegating and dealing with team members .
good,Management is not understanding that 50-60 hour weeks become too much and impossible to balance life and work when working graveyards. 4 day weeks would be a viable solution.
good,"The workload was crazy for those who did the work, for those who didn't, weren't reprimanded. I got hired on at 8.50 an hour and stayed that way through a promotion and"
good,They were not a good place to work for someone who was use to working along and out in the field at businesses in the area. But I had a daughter in college and it helped.
good,the only good part of the job was the culture. no other company can duplicate this. other than this they did not provide any reimbursement for using your personal vehicle for the job and the cost of gas i was spending each week made it like i was paying them to do the job.
good,"Got hired on outside the company and was warned about it being sexist from the beginning. I didn't let that sway me and was paid okay for my position as the Asst. Mgr. However, in time it became a hostile work environment for me."
good,no opinion job is very stressful needs better management supervisor was very good to work with understanding and very helpful his hands were tied unfortunately.
good,"The Job itself is okay, but the upper management is what ruined it for me. Every store manager I had was great, but the District Managers make it really difficult to enjoy the job. They have a tendency to promise the world, but under deliver. "
good,Overall it was a pleasant place to work. I had 7 year's ind that place & not all was bad just towards the end of my journey started to fade away. I had my fun days in there as well.
good,This job taught me a lot about customer service and the importance of maintaining a positive outlook. Also required me to work competitively with other co workers because of the incentive that was offered. The auto part knowledge that was required doing this job is very plentiful and quite enjoyable.
good,Deliver auto parts to professional installers in a timely manner. Pick up warranty and new return parts  Local delivery stops. Scan in coming parts into parts system every morning while waiting for delivery's to come in. Stock new merchandise onto store shelves.
good,"O’Reilly Auto Parts has a rich history founded in a solid culture.  Unfortunately, this culture has began to die in recent years.  We have started becoming an average corporation in America."
good,"Its a job that can work at locally. It is fairly lax, but a lot of rules and training as is necessary as one would work around a lot dangerous machinery, chemicals and equipment."
good,It can get stressful when busy because of a low number of employees. It has a good manager but the distric manager only cares about himself and will belittle your career choice if you arren't wanting to move up in the company.
good,"Lots of driving around, delivering parts to different places in the city, make sure you know the area because you are not allowed to have your phone with you and are not provided with any GPS."
good,"When I signed in I would inspect my vehicle then I would check my delivery's. I would take my delivery to the designated place and go back to the store and check to see if I have any delivery to make if not I would stock the items needed to be replaced and refill. "
good,"Although O'Reilly has many positive attributes, communication as a local level is not one of them. Many times directives are expected to be followed without proper training or direction."
good,Didn’t get a raise after a year even though they told me I was doing a good job. Had to get to certain places fast managers didn’t care if you were stuck in traffic.
good,"A typical day at an Oreilly auto parts store is like any other jobs, it has its good days and it has its bad days. Good days consist of people needing help for a vehicle problem or improvement, most the time the parts person has a solution and the customer leaves satisfied. On the bad days the customer demands the parts person to fix their problem and well that can go wrong fast with impatient customers. Here you will learn a lot customer service skills., learn about vehicles, selling skills, team work (in some locations), Clock management, the list goes on. It all depends on what you want to learn. The management is not consistent its stressful when management doesn't do anything. If you have a week manager the team will be week or in some circumstances the team holds up the store while the manager take all the credit. All in all this is a ok job to get familiar with auto parts and customer service skills. Seeing the customer leave with a smile in their face can make your day."
good,"this business was a good running business. everyone had a set schedule to do, which made things easy for work. at the time i was working two jobs with city nails and i was paid more there."
good,"Working for the company had its good and bad moments as would any company, but my overall experience was apositive one. I learned about parts and the function of most of them. It was fun getting to know the vehicles and what people were doing to fix them."
good,"Managers put in way too many hours and the amount of what is expected to do is unimaginable, most people couldn't perform at the pace a Store manager does for this company"
good,"the culture was laid back, the pay was not a lot but u didn't do that much, i was a night manager and i didn't like the hours . the hardest part of the job was the turn around on people  and it looks like they hired anyone"
good,"the managers don't know what they are doing. the work atmosphere is stressful, and you can tell due employees showing up late and lacking effort on the job."
good,"-Competitive"
good,Your day at O'Reilly is varied due to deliveries. As a delivery driver you would be making deliveries to auto repair shops within the Medford area as parts were ordered.
good,"You are required to have some kind of automotive knowledge without being able to expect good pay. Minimum wage job and no appreciation with no real hope of ever making good money. With specialty knowledge required, the company should be more appreciative than they are."
good,had its stressful days with certain coworkers but it was pretty much a laid back job and i only intended on being there for a short period of time. it's an awesome job for someone who is just graduating high school.
good,"Management seems pretty easy if you can exceed 20,000 dollars in sales every month. If you're not good at that, then get ready to close the store almost every night."
good,"As an Outside sales manager I had 5 stores to promote. Everyday, I would meet with the store managers and wholesale managers, going over numbers and new promotions. Once that was accomplished, I went out and visited target accounts in the areas, fill their needs and then report back to the store."
good,"Good company for the most part, too bad the pay is so low even for experienced parts professionals."
good,Fun place to work if you have the right manager. Wages are not the best doesn’t like giving raises at all. Doesn’t try to match competitors for wages.
good,"Very relaxed work culture (sometimes little to relaxed)"
good,"just not a good starting job, would recommend somewhere else. the people there are just trying to compete with you to get more sales than you because the pay also has commission pay"
good,fast paced work. some long days. good pay. a lot of walking. good place to work overtime. great start time. it is good that the job is a monday to friday work week.
good,I liked the customer aspect of the job.However the manager culture puts them selves far above the rest of the team.They tend to treat employees like they are disposable.
good,"Performed Daily pre-trip safety inspections on all vehicles and preventative maintenance."
good,It all depends on which district you work in depends on how much you'll make. It's primary a job that is based on sales whether there's a job advancement or not. It's not  a hard job at all and it could be more enjoyable if there was pay scale  to determine how much everyone is to be paid.
good,Oreilly's is a great place for a technician to learn about different vehicles and parts. Fun and fast paced meet all kinds of new people. Training modules for the employees. retail.
good,"Your base pay was low, then told how much you could make with incentive. Incentive was based upon a figure that corporate wanted the store to achieve. This number was not a realistic number based upon the size of the market and the number of other parts stores in the area. The incentive bonus wsnalso based upon personal sales. This resulted in all employees trying to get to the customer when entering the store."
good,This is a wonderful place to work if you are a guy....The people are nice but standoffish if you are a female. Overall experience was ok but not great for longterm.
good,"The networking and relationships I have gained are irreplaceable. The people that I have worked with are some of the most dedicated, knowledgeable, and amazing hard workers in the industry. However, when it comes to daily operations, skills are an afterthought."
good,This was a great company until Checker Auto and O'reilly joined forces.  Got to meet a lot of solid people inside and outside of the company.  Things did get a little ugly during and shortly after the merge as many Checker employee's were left looking for new employment.
good,AGM and DM were horrible. Rode you like a horse to line there own pockets. decent money. downfall is they like to hire teens with horrible work ethics
good,Managers are just people that know parts. They don't get actually good managers because anyone that knows how to manage well wants to get paid more than what they're willing to pay.
good,"Needs to train their mannagers on motivating team members. They hired too many and give them too few hrs. Not ready to hire full time."
good,"Lots of opportunity in the company but stay away from the store in Hurricane UT."
good,I did enjoy working for oreilly's the only problem that I may have had was i was only getting about less then 20 hrs a week. Ridiculous. i was paying for my transportation only
good,Great opportunity because no one stays very long. Values were great but the company has turned away from them some. Don't pay enough at store levels but too much in warehouse. Management can be easily obtained but just keep in mind why it may have been easy... money is the number one goal!
good,Pay was low and I worked a lot of hours. Management did not care about anything other than money. The most enjoyable part about the job was when I left.
good,Benefits/compensation were terrible. Have to work two years in order to get benefits. Poor advancements and job security.Management did not help out employees for pay raises or advancement
good,"I loved everyday meeting new people, i enjoyed my regulars. I delivered parts and loved helping out the business owners"
good,"Lots of standing, learned more on parts and diagnosis, hardest part of the job is learning the software. The people are funny and good to get along with."
good,O'Reilly was a good place to work.  I learned a lot there and liked the employees. I have a lot of knowledge about cars so working with customers and around the automotive environment was satisfying.  The hardest part was making decisions I wasn't qualified to make when  management wasn't available as a closer.
good,"they are very strict,  they do not allowed a minute late you can get fire if  you late 3 times."
good,although it is a great place to work while is school its hard to make a living out of it. depending on locations the hours can be very flexable.
good,"Overall, working there is fairly relaxed, and the work is easy. Not a lot of salesmanship is required since most of the people coming to buy car parts need the parts for their car to work. As such, the job is a lot of looking things up on the computer, grabbing them from the shelf, and completing a transaction with the customer. Stock-keeping, housekeeping, things like that are also part of the job, but it's a very minimal job and pays, honestly, more than it should."
good,"long hours"
good,Good second job. Flexible hours and set your own schedule. The employees discount program is nice. Deep discounts on parts.
good,"Good place to work, and it continues to grow. The place needs more opportunity for advancement.The coworkers work as a team most of the time , however there needs to be more discipline among management and employees for those who fail to adhere to protocol."
good,"Morning are generally busy, customers are steady all day long. We have a lot of mandatory activities that must be completed before management can leave for the day, therefore sometimes it is an overwhelming amount of work.  The key to success is hiring competent and reliable workers and drivers."
good,They do not want to pay for extra help. Nor pay more money to the help they have. They only care about making a profit by any means necessary.
good,fun people to work with decent hours. it was most fun for me because im a very hands on worker and i can work in a fast pace enviroment. i dont like to be real slow because im used to working at a decent pace
good,Everyone plays their part and things get done. Some people are overloaded while others do not have enough to work on. Fairly strict on dress code and stingy with vacation time. Days are very boring and most people seem to be content to sit there and get it over with.
good,It's a good entry level job to understand customer sevice. Help locate parts for vehicles. Help customer locate any products they maybe asking for. Help them by understanding how each product works.
good,"The fast pace work environment and constant challenges of learning a new job on the fly was the most enjoyable part of my job. The customers made me love going to work everyday."
good,"I did enjoy working for this company, during my time as a full time college student.  The store hours are early morning to late night, so if your schedule is not a typical one, this is a great option.  This company does not like to pay above minimum wage."
good,Good entry job for anyone looking at making some extra money. The computer system for looking up parts is a little difficult. Its easier to look up parts on the internet than looking them up on company program.
good,"I have worked at O'Reilly for more than 3 years, and have barely moved up in ranks. In fact, when I received my position and title, I got no added compensation AT ALL! Other, less productive people have been hired at a higher rate of pay, and have been promoted over me...ALL after I was working there. So, there is no seniority, very small raises if at all, and pretty much everyone that works there is miserable."
good,"It is a fun and great work place. Not great on communication and advancement. Needs more concern about employees then pro accounts, More team work"
good,"Every day is fairly paced and keeps you on your feet. You have the opportunity to learn something new everyday. This company's management is terrible though; constantly changing and constant whirl winds of different rules.You team members are incredible though and really know how work together. The hardest part of this job is over working with no real compensation, credit or good pay. But the best part is the customers we work with and the incredible staff."
good,"I run the Will call/ delivery counter for O'Reilly's distribution center. I found there that I am a natural problem solver and have excellent customer service skills. I field a multiple line phone system while assisting our route drivers and order selectors.The hardest part of my job is that I try to do too much and I have very high standards. I am utilitarian, very flexible and appreciate a positive attitude. I love my team! They are the greatest group I've ever had the pleasure of working with and will miss them immeasurably. The ONLY reason for my leaving is the salary cap, which I've been at for 3+ years. I'm extraordinarily responsible yet have a creative mind and a desire to learn and grow in all areas of life. I have learned a lot since working here, both in regards to my occupation and myself, and that is invaluable."
good,"Sell automotive parts to customers, perform daily tasks as instructed, count drawers and safe, stock shelves and prepare returns pallet."
good,management isn't the best but co workers were awesome and loved the experience. and loved the discounts and the feeling to beable to help customers with their problems
good,"at first i really enjoyed working but after a few months things started to come unraveled and most of it was that management would not hire enough people to fill all the positions, so that meant all the other people had to fill in and it put a strain on the team."
good,They'll schedule you 20-40 hours but then choose to cut your hours just to save the company payroll regardless of if it is screwing their employees. It makes everyone dislike working there which is why they have such a high hire/quit ratio.
good,"Day at work consisted of parts sales, managing co-workers, bank deposits, balancing daily reports, parts ordering, inventory, stocking product, cleaning & any duty necessary for store appearance & profit."
good,Mondays are the longest days of the week you work anywhere from 8-14hr shifts that day then the following week they like to cut hours. I got my certification in many things here. Co-workers are okay.
good,Like helping the customers.  It's great knowing most of them by name.  Best part is impressing new customers and having them come in and ask for me by name.
good,I liked most the people I worked with but I was promised a lot of things that never happened. delivering parts is a lot of fun and running the counter can be fun also as long as there are customers coming in.
good,Uninteresting - nothing learned - management is nice but immature - co-workers lack motivation - hard to do because of boredom - enjoyable only after I clock out.  No benefits other than employee discounts and a small monthly bonus.
good,They were lacking with support for the manager in my area at that time. New personal has came in and I was told that a lot has been changed.
good,"Customers are awesome.! Have gotten to know alot of them on a first name basis.   Certain managers have a very self centered attitude and are  rude to employees, and sometimes customers.  Have gone to upper management to resolve these issues.... but nothing being done about it.  Pay is low for what we do. Best thing is our customer base... they rock !"
good,"It's a Ok place to work for ,but the management is not good at all.It's suppose to be a family oriented place ,but it's not. They don't treat their employee fairly or right."
good,"Decent job for a kid out of high school, most employees were unhappy most of the time but have bills to pay and figure their stuck"
good,"Had to work weekends due to only positions available at time.Single parent working only part time was hard.No benefits for part time employees,stressful environment but made the best of it anyway. No full time positions were available at time."
good,"A typical day at work consist of answering five phone lines, routing delivery drivers, managing ten other employees, helping customers, by fixing daily problems that may arise. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers. I've know most of them my entire lives, so we had a really good relationship. I enjoy working with people. The hardest part of the job was trying to fix other peoples' mistakes.Sometimes the customers were very rude, upset, and hard to calm down. But we usually came to an agreement that made everyone happy. I had a lot of training relating to customer satisfaction and it really paid off during situations like that."
good,"Got to meet many people. "
good,My job is very demanding...I cover about 3 team members jobs. I have attempted to move into a supervisory position but because I'm the only one in my position and I do it very well...they won't advance me. Co-workers are a struggle to deal with...very immature people. My favorite part of the job are the friendships I have made with the drivers that check in all day and the dispatchers I talk to on the phone. You become close with these other companies which makes working with them much easier if there is a conflict that needs to be resolved.
good,"the management team that were there when I was employed as a driver has since either left or been arrested due to embezzlement, including the district manager."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers, cleaning, cash handling, stocking, inventory, and merchandising. "
good,"Workday was an extreme challenge because the store is in a high crime area and had very little to no security. as such the had been robbed at gunpoint at least (5) times (twice while I was on duty). I learn to be very diligent and attentive at all times which made me suspicious of everyone. Management seem to be indifferent to the the problem and issues going on at the store, there-by most of the time it was a struggle to keep morale up in the store. Most employees treat the job as a temporary stop as opposed to secure employment and did not give it their full commitment. I do most definitely enjoy working with people and being able to assist them in fixing a problem they may be having with a vehicle."
good,"The work wasn't hard at all just some of the people you work with. A person that works there needs to know about cars... Management at the store i work at was ""terrible"" but the guy they put at the position was not qualified to be a manager, he was a good worker but not manager. some co-workers where excellent and others were not."
good,"Nice working environment, nice staff, the work load can be extreme at times but overall a good company to work for."
good,This is an okay company to work for. During my time there on thing that really stands out to the positive is how the tried to instill the culture.
good,"I liked the work environment for the most part, but the book keeping practices need more than a few adaptations to be anything close to sufficient."
good,"what you do not know about cars you will get the chance to, great if you love cars. job was easy customers were fun just the pay was low."
good,"I rather enjoyed this job, all except for a co-worker I had. The management doesn't watch the employee's very close or care what they joke about or say in front of customers. There values could honestly use some major improvement. I did not feel safe here, I felt very threatened the last month or so that I was employed by O'Reilly's. I was sexually harrased, and as far as I know they never did anything about it."
good,It was very slow pace and i didn't like that plus it was a joke working there
good,I would only work there again if the company has a better policy on Harassment in the work place.....
good,"If you don't have team players who want to work, it gets frustrating and stressful. DM's do not give deserved raises and focus on sales only, not the store or individuals...just what you produce. When shops tell you its pricing and you notify the DM, he seems to think its not and its about our customer service even when we go over and beyond to satisfy. Hiring freezes were put upon a store with skeletal staff and this causes great stress which bleeds into customer service, and also customers don't want to wait until you finally are done with the people ahead of them so they walk out. Nothing you did, they just get frustrated with the lack of assistance too."
good,Working at O'Reilly is a great and fundamental work environment for young adults to develop their working and acquired skills in the automotive industry. It is an ethical and fun environment with opportunity to grow as a person and in the company.
good,They are for the most part very flexible if you are working part time but if you are wanting to move up and make any amount of money expect to work all kinds of hours and possibly 7 days a week.
good,"Management was the worst. From sealing product, to allowing other members steal. Also allowing management to come in drunk and refused to believe it when many of us reported it. I got hurt on the job in front of him and he flat out denied he saw anything."
good,"In general a typical day would be stocking, cleaning, and helping the customer. Per usual responsibilities increase depending on title. While there I've learned a great deal about both cars and customer service. The workplace culture is about said customer service and money plays it's role. Management, I suppose it's like any other company, some are good and others are not. One con to note is this company has a ridiculously high turnover rate. The job can be demanding and pay doesn't always match what they ask of you."
good,"Benefits are good, culture is great. Everyone at the store level gets a bonus every month. Company offers training to keep up with product knowledge and offers classes for techs that's employees can also attend."
good,"Poor management.  Sales is suffering from lack of management.  In the retail environment, you have to have excellent customer service abilities in order to retain customers.  I feel that the manager doesn’t treat customers right and in turn the customer doesn’t come back."
good,"i would say its a good job for anyone working there way through college."
good,the manager are great and the employees are good and also they part are great and they help everyone with they part and what is wrong with it also they have every part you need
good,It's a good place to work if you need flexible hours and if you enjoy being around people and  you enjoy customer service than this is a job for you but the hours are long in some spots and you will have to stand for long periods of time and you get employee discount on parts and if you are a young person it is a good way to get into the automotive industry if you have no experience you will get the experience
good,"Some of the people you work with will be great, like anywhere I imagine, but honestly they just don't pay enough or fairly. For example I was hired at the same time as another person, I'm also bilingual, which is something they desperately needed as half our customers speak spanish, however I was paid $9.35 while the guy hired with me was paid $10. Even after working here for almost 2 years I'm being paid $9.97.  The company here has some issues. I've already been told that if I dropped out of school and worked full time I'd be paid a lot more. There are never enough employees as the company doesn't seem to know how to keep their employees happy. They also don't stick to their no tolerance rule as I have recently come to know with a drunk employee that bothered some of the female emplyees simply got switched to another store instead of being fired. It's very boring work. It's also dangerous driving all day in Utah."
good,"Knowledgeable coworkers willing to teach."
good,Had a fun time learned a lot about car parts met a lot of good people allso feel good about helping customers find the right thing management was a bit questionable
good,"Pay was as promised and very good, The job was easy, never had a problem getting in any of the stores and the people you dealt with at the stores were all friendly,  all the equipment was top notch."
good,Oreillys doesn’t pay that good of money but I worked a lot of hours. The manager was a shady person and weird stuff kept happening. I left not wanting to because I have bills and trying to get a house but being there wasn’t worth my time nor efforts if I’m the only one contributing.
good,The atmosphere at the work place is sometimes very toxic. There are times you get yelled at just because someone else doesn't do their job. The district manager let me go because I didn't meet the requirements to keep my job. Apparently I was falling short when I repeatedly asked for help.
good,"I worked @ O'Reilly Auto Parts for about a year more or less, and it was great, until they threw in a new manager that had never worked with us. He was a tyrant, and completely did not respect the work/life balance. everything was about work, numbers, and making sure we hit quota's so he would get his little bonus. he went so far out to make sure payroll was low, and in doing so, cut valuable hours from other co-workers, and myself, to make payroll numbers work, this short handed work space caused customers to stop shopping with us, and made our sales go down, which in turn, made him not happy. "
good,"I enjoyed working here as I was consistently learning, and held a high level of sales quickly after starting. I do well with customers, and a large selection of them were consistently agitated because of the issues with their vehicles. I had interpersonal issues with my manager which led to me leaving, which I would gladly have a discussion about if you are interested in learning from our mistakes with each other."
good,"Other than most of the empty promises, that are given. The place isn't a bad place to work. I do wish they paid more an hour though. I feel this place is a great stepping stone to get back on your feet."
good,"To many crying people, to many young kids that know nothing, disrespectful employees. Way to much drama and talking about others in the store. Management takes sides and no disciplinenary actions."
good,A lot of work a lot of things to learn they don’t pay enough they need to pay more if they ever wanna keep good employees ..............................
good,"Experiences will all depend on the store, management, and team members."
good,"When you first start working for O'Reilly, they make you train first. The training is on a computer. If people don't know much about car parts, shouldn't worry as they teach you that as well."
good,"They treat you very disposable, as in they don't pay you enough and management stated that they don't pay you enough. So why work for them when you can look for someone that does?"
good,Nice place to work if you like to  slack off and not go any where in life. The pay sucks if you don't want to do something better in life then this is the place for you.
good,make sure your draw is correct then fix up the front counter. then straten up the iles in the store.Take care of the customers that have questions about their car
good,"It's a starting point for someone who want a part time job but if u in management specially store manager very little time for yourself! Demanding position with no thank u , good job, or well done! Just sale, more money"
good,"work usually had stock to put out."
good,"Enjoyed working in the parts environment.Enjoyed meeting"
good,"I loved my job at O'Reilly's. The actual job was easy, fast paced, and you were learning new things all the time. However management won't bat an eye to completely throw you under the buss for anything they do wrong. You have to practically beg them to do anything actually helpful. Delivery vehicles were poorly kept and in winter months were dangerous to drive due to bad tores, worn brakes and worn down wiper blades. Also during winter we had a level 2 road closure, meaning only be on the road if you have to and get home. Worried that if we hit a level 3 we would be stuck because then only emergency personel is allowed on the roads and I had a new born at home we called in and asked if we could close up at 8 instead of 9 after having no customers for over 4 hours. Our district manager refused to let us leave telling us it wasn't his problem and he was busy at home with his family and hung up on us. So my store was a disaster but I know not all of them are that bad. You just have to find one where their management actually cares."
good,Easy job not much expected of you easy to move up but all positions are well under paid. Sales are easy but the incentive pay is not even worth the effort to try and sell a lot. Over all its a good starter job for beginning in retail or automotive market.
good,"Helping customers get what they need. Wide variety of items to choose from. Customers are great, warm, understanding, and friendly. A joy to work with."
good,Just come in learn something new it's a fun job you learn a lot by being in the store. The company has some knew items that are coming soon and if your a people person this job would be good
good,"Good company, Good staffing really enjoyed working there and making friend with new people and talking with people about cars, Good opportunities and learning experiences"
good,If you don’t like OT don’t work here. You don’t have a set schedule so one day you could be there 5 hours the next 15. Management is lousy. No one seems to care if you have a problem
good,"Ok for just pocket-money, corporate only cares about sales and income. Hours constantly changes, Do not apply at O'Reilly if it will be your only source of income."
good,District manager didn.t want to listen to anything said about customers and there feelings about anything. customer was always wrong . and didn't want to hear about it. I was  put down as a no rehire for disagreeing with district manager. but others were rehired even for more serious things.
good,"It is a job  but The WAGES are not near subsequent to the work performed. Drivers are risking their lives out there every day. When not  driving, we stock, put signing, zone the sales floor and assist customers. Auto part retail is a booming business. Turnover rate is high because of LOW WAGES. It's hard to afford benefits."
good,Company is a commission based fast paced company. Store is always short staffed because it affects district managers pay. District manager is about 80 percent why I left. Management does ok for pay but entry level is paid lower than they should be.
good,"Begin days preparing employee cash drawers and lining up tasks for employees shifts. Handle daily operations such as waiting on customers, locating correct parts, diagnosing vehicle issues and minor part instillation."
good,"It is a decent starter job that will help you learn the basics of car parts and the different set ups. the hours are not consistent from week to week, and you will not get a schedule very far in advance."
good,"Good job, but doesn't pay well. You get a good discount on parts and store products. The coworkers are usually friendly but always helpful. Team work is definitely needed."
good,It's a good start to learn about cars and retail you get to learn more about cars from working here. It's a great way to get work experience from working here
good,Organized and operated as any retail environment. Basic benefits that can only be afforded at a managerial salary. Knowledgeable employees maintain upper sales positions and unknowledgable move up into management. An environment where knowledge is kept in sales and those lacking become management creates a hostile and chaotic environment.
good,easy to do fast pace at times but slow most of the time. Will have you work full time hours but will only have you hired as part time so they don't have to give benefits
good,"Good Ft job if you are easily satisfied.  If you are seeking a career consider this a stepping stone.  Work normal hours = No $ Bonus, Major hours required to be successful."
good,If you are not a store manager of above you don’t make enough to live off of. As a store manager I didn’t think I got paid enough to have the responsibility’s and the stress it required.
good,This company is all about favoritism in the local district. If u wasn’t a yes man or woman they wouldn’t acknowledge you but I was always thought that numbers do not lie but men and women tend to. So if they didn’t know you and you’ve out performed another team member that’s been there longer it doesn’t get acknowledged and then friendships take over but o well I’m in the better things.
good,"It was nice working here for three years. I worked here for three years, loved the discount workers got. I wish they would offer more benefits to part time people."
good,"I witnessed many times a bad/lazy manager be saved from being fired because they golfed or had BBQ's with regional or district managers. I was in the manager training program and because I told a store manager he needs to be doing his job and not leave through out the day so he could take naps, or have another employee open from him because he was partying the night before. I was then told I needed to change stores and was no longer part of the training program."
good,"I enjoyed working with co-workers, my only problem recently is poor management work load is not spread out among workers evenly, makes a long day  for some."
good,"management is the problem at store i worked at. we had several in the year i was there. one wasnt up to the task. second was too nice.  people arent judge fairly. its a game, if you no how to talk and win over the right people you are in., and then that person is able to make or break you at oreillys. unfortunately it seemed like the truly hard workers didnt get the title or recognition they deserve. And then when they do wanna acknowledge your hard work , they wanna put you on salary and work you like a dog. no time off. so the good smart people wont take manager jobs. sad."
good,Oreilly auto parts is a good place to work other than certain people letting someone use shop accounts to get discounts and then they come in to get you to find a warranty on something then give you the wrong information about a vehicle then call and complain on the person that waited on them. For 1 if they would give the right information then we could find a warranty. Then for 2 stop customers from using shop accounts if that shop isnt the one doig the job on your vehicle. When the manager was told about this they acted like it was no big deal. And it is when customers can't tell you the right information or phone number the warranty would be under. Never have a life outside of work due to no set schedule. They always expect you to come in on yours 1 or 2 days a week you do have off.
good,"unprofessional, harassment, lack or respect,  there is a lot of casual attitude, employees feel free to speak unprofessional, high turn over, the hours are flexible"
good,"My typical day here was to take of customers and stock the shelves and put the truck away, I also had paperwork to do when I either opened or closed the store. The management here was okay but not very supporting to their employees questions and concerns."
good,"There are some really great people in this company, but my experience was that you are overworked for the salary they designate, and underappreciated for the results you produce."
good,"they start at 9 a hour. oriellys should hire and pay by what the employee is worth not 9 a hour. "
good,Wonderful job horrible pay. Very flexible with scheduling but the pay is very low for experienced employees. No matter your experience or position pay stays at the same rate.
good,"Pretty Lame. low Pay, boss was Unfair. Hated my time there, But Loved my customers, that's why I stayed. Hated hated hated hated hated it. The customers are what kept me going"
good,Vary friendly environment .I got more knowledge about auto parts management and coworkers worked vary well as a team nothing to hard I couldnt handle .
good,Very fast environment for customer needs an auto parts. Parts were delivered on a daily basis to satisfy customer needs. Computer knowledge was a must.
good,When I first stated it was a fun place to work at. Now its more stressful than usual. Management tries to micromanage my store. No coverage when I get sick
good,"Wouldn't recommend it, unless you have no option or don't want a life. Always short staffed, sending people home if sales are down for day. Every store is always tryign to find more people to work at their store. TOo many tasks to get done for a team of no more than store can have working."
good,"Having an Associates Degree in  Logistics, and working at an O'Reilly's store as a part-time driver, I saw many things that were never taken care of well at all in the store I was in and decided the take care of things myself. Such as:"
good,"for a parttime job i would refer someone to work there. Store short staffed, I learned how to work with out lunch break for 3 years, because of under staffing, hardest part of the job is taking care of multiple customer at one time cause of being short staffed"
good,"I enjoyed working there but the management sucked and they didnt like when i couldn't work because of school, and they fired all of my coworkers so i left."
good,Stop low balling employee better Commuication  Security  at Hub store its impossible to work with customers and watch for thieves  short handed  oh if your gonna have cameras watch all area not only the cash register
good,loved working there but the management was the only reason why i left. they were never able to work with personal issues (kids) . the department that i was working in was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"prefer not to, as a part timer my view is not a fair one for the company in general. My local manager is knowledgeable and great to work with. Corporate is trying to create a part time environment to avoid offering benefits."
good,"got to meet a lot of people there. but management is what killed it there. Toniann is a huge jerk. my store went through 5 different managers before this one,"
good,If your supervisor likes you then you can advance easily. It is not climate controlled so it is hot in the summer and cold in the winter. various animals come inside also.
good,"Hired me part time, gave me initially 39.5 hours a week, now down to less than 20 with zero opportunity to raise my hours?! I cannot live on this salary and can't find a second job due to the strange hours. Fun job, bad management. Don't keep me at an average 33.5 to 39.5 hours then out of no where drop me to less than 20! Now I'm behind on many bills and O'Reilly's simply does not care for it's employees"
good,"Store manager was a really great man to work for. I was a hub driver so they kept me pretty busy being on the road. Between driving and stocking the shelves in the back of the house I kept pretty busy. I also learned a lot about car parts, how to look up car parts. If it wasn't for the low pay and low hours...I'd work for him again."
good,I enjoyed helping customers and driving the parts to customers and putting away inventory. I liked meeting new people every day. most of the day was good.
good,Good overall company. Management was poorly executed. The environment was not for kids due to poor worker attitude and foul language on a regular basis.
good,"If you are looking for somewhere to start and help yourself gain experience, this is the place. I would not recommend this business unless you are shooting for the stars here or you work at one of the central hub stores."
good,Best part of this job was not much overtime and only worked every other weekend so home life was good. Bad part of this job was poor wages and weak management.
good,"If you enjoy working with cars and people it's pretty decent.  The people are a mixture of fun to be around or terrible, depending on the circumstances.  The hours were flexible and I could just about always get time off when I needed or pick up extra hours."
good,wasnt a good experience to much gossip going around and alot of drama with all the workers not everyone got along and always trying to fire someone new management that sucks would not recommend.
good,"I liked the management and the people I worked with, but the pay sucks.  I began at $8.50 per hour, and after two years (and a positive evaluation) my pay was raised by 17 cents to $8.67 per hour."
good,It is a reasonable job to have if you don't have dependents or the desire to move forward in your career. Otherwise the job can be learned easily and advancement to front desk is easy if you aren't a good worker where you are. You're kept in place and what you have to offer is held back due to how well you do your job.
good,"Engaging with the customers was the most enjoyable thing about the job. Prior to working for O'Reilly's Auto Parts, my automotive knowledge was limited. With the help of upper management and my colleagues, I left the company with a wealth of knowledge."
good,I must say that I did learn a lot from working at O'Reilly's Auto Parts the experience was one of a kind the culture was well but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend or anyone for that matter.
good,"A good place for student or people just out of school.  Salary is capped after 3 years so it is a good transition job.  I did not see any associate advance beyond a general warehouse position,"
good,"check in freight, put up freight, change planograms, deliver parts to customers, inventory, travel to do store setups. Clean , mop, order parts, return items that wasn't needed, created a back stock program for overstock items."
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace of this job, it made the day go by faster, the only thing I didn't like was taking all the test every week, employees was fun to work with"
good,"If the management is good (differs from store to store) it would be a very good company to work for, although I don't like to be downgraded in work-hours, especially when you have proven to be a good salesman"
good,"A typical work day here is filled with customer interactions both on the phone and in person."
good,"High turn over due to Seattle minimum wage.   Some stores fall right outside Seattle and the company won't pay Seattle minimum wage at those stores.  Even though they can drive 3 miles and get employed in Seattle for $4.00 more per hour."
good,"If the pay was decent i would of stayed, only $8.hr,. Every other weekend had to be worked. Skeleton crew for drivers, so you can burnout quickly, high turnover do to driver pay. Fellow employees great people. Health care cost high,  discounts on auto parts, great for car enthusiasts."
good,"Was brought in to be PBE salesman for South Georgia,  area manager told me he had to bring me in as assistant manager until PBE opening came available."
good,"Orielly's is a very good starting place for anyone looking to get into automotive parts sales. Each store does have its differences in management, but overall a good place to work"
good,"It is a good position for someone just entering the workforce with a decent amount of knowledge about auto mechanics, or someone looking to make some extra money. The pay is nothing over the top unless you plan on making a career out of it."
good,"Strict attendance and disciplinary policies with will hamper efforts to advance or move to another department.  The culture is very relaxed and lackadaisical, sometimes too much."
good,It is more for people who have an interest in cars and have a tolerance for people who work on projects they do not understand. Otherwise it can be a stressful environment.
good,Its all about making a buck. Don't spend over your budget or the store won't be profitable at the expense of employees attitudes and customer service.
good,"I had an awesome management team, they were always willing to work with the individual employee on whatever the issue was. Its definitely not somewhere to work long term as the pay is barely above minimum wage and the benefits offered are fairly pricey."
good,"constantly pressured to sell things that the people don't actually need. Store managers are encouraged to give lower than deserved reviews in order to provide lower than deserved raises, with a salary cap set lower than the industry standard."
good,"Standard schedule for a manager is mon-fri and every other saturday. As a manager you are expected to make your schedule, run your store as an individual entity of the company. Review P&L. Motivate your team, Interview and hire your team. perform sales calls to drive business. Attend managers meetings. Complete a daily to do list of tasks. Check in stock and perform returns. Put up stock. Check emails. and plenty of additional tasks. Obviously your in retail so checking out customers and dealing with any complaints or issues. O'Reilly's has a culture that all team members are supposed to abide by. The company as a whole is a good company, they try to keep it like a small, family type business. The issue they have are some of the upper management doesn't stand by the culture and abuses its workers. Hours are long, 10-12 hours a day or more. You have to take up any slack in the schedule which includes working open to close. Or if upper management dictates, they expect the managers to work extra hours including additional days on weekends to make payroll % better. Upper management has also taken away some of the ability of the store managers to run their team the way the store needs, dictating specifics on schedules and essentially pushing out team members the manager had hired."
good,Some days we were sitting on our phones all day and hours were cut other days we needed extra hands. No communication in the store and poor attitudes.
good,"Normal work day consists of walking the store prior to opening looking for store theft and any open holes that need to be filled with stock."
good,Learned different sales techniques from coworkers . Constant boss changes with managers an district managers. The benefits made up for companys lack of if its not broke don't screw with it..
good,"i had to leave O'reilly's as i was the primary care giver for my wife , she passed away in march of this year. "
good,over all this working for orielly was fun and I learned a lot about vehicles and knowledgeable about different car parts but the growth in salary was very disappointing. I could handle anything at oriellys. I miss the job but not the pay.
good,"Fast pace, low pay scale and co-workers not pulling their weight. Extreme micro managing. Can't trust upper managements word. High turnover. Inexperienced coworkers common."
good,"selling parts doing inventory delivering selling to commercial accounts "
good,"The supervisors are great but the management team was horrible. i able to learn a lot of different departments. They have company luncheons, moderate,"
good,"depending on your manager, you could end up being stuck with incompetent coworkers and have to do their job as well as your own."
good,"murrays was a good job. the associates worked together as a team should. they helped each other and made me feel like i was apart of a team. the pay was not good, i went two years without a raise."
good,"Supervisor talk to you any kind of way, its nasty need to be rebuild , no air inside the job, lack of communication, not enough time to eat our lunch,"
good,"It's a decent starter job. They don't like to pay a living wage and advancement is slim to none. The micromanagement is also a drawback considering that there's about 6 managers above your manager. The employee discount is nice, considering that you pay store cost for things you buy."
good,if you want to get into the automotive field this is a good place to start. the pay not that great but it can get your foot in the door to a lot of different places. if you stick with the company they can help you with school
good,Learned something new everyday whether it be from customers or coworkers that have been around longer. The hardest part or the job would be dealing with the customers that don't understand when we can't get a part. Management is different at every location but my manager seemed very knowledgeable about vehicles and the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the regular shops that come in and be able to build good trust with them.
good,"Stocking, blocking, providing customer service and learning the computer system/store layout is all pretty easy. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at O'Reilly's but I think the district managers should spend more time getting to know the store managers."
good,"the work at Oreillys was not hard and back breaking.  I worked in air conditioning and it was in the heart of town, so I was able to see family on lunch breaks."
good,Ok company. Low pay but not a bad environment. No real price savings when you make purchases. Must pay for your own uniforms which are worth anything when you leave unless you just like the name on your shirt.
good,My experience with the upper management is that they only care about how YOU make them look towards THEIR bosses. Above and beyond work is not rewarded and however seems to be what the upper management expects.
good,"As a driver I work 9 plus hour shifts, making only $8.50 an hour. moving fleet batteries and fleet drums as well as 55 gallon drums by myself becuse the other drivers have health issues. They make the same pay to sit in the back while I also help customers.Plus working 9-6 on a regular makes it hard to have a life. I am only scheduled for 4 days but often I am called in to cover for the other drivers and sometimes Im covering for both at the same time, putting the whole load on me. I don't get paid enough for the load I carry. The mananger gets mad if I tell her I can't cover a shift for them and takes it out on me by cutting my hours. The other people are great to work with because they are younger and pull their own weight around the store and they are really good hearted people and I love the customers and commercial accounts I deal with, but I rarely see any commission. The disscount is great, but how can I use the discount when I can't even rely on the job to at least help pay for a car or car note?"
good,Company has done an excellent job gaining market share through acquisitions and top notch customer service and product availability. Oreillys as a company is managed very well and has proven to be very profitable.
good,Very hard to abvance your pay.  They have given me several more jobs with more responsibilities but I havnt gotten one raise from the company.  The job is good if you can handle the pay
good,"working for OReilly was very stressful, one summer we had no AC and they still expected us to be dressed in uniform, I worked 6 days week and inventory and plan-o always got behind when asked for a higher wage I was told yes and it never showed on my check. and then I was told if I was serious about the promotion they will give me 30days to prove it.. and I did my sales and other numbers were so high and they just like ignored it and kept avoid me we always have high thief it was so annoying dealing with that daily and some customers were rude but i did like helping people when they needed help by making sure they had the right parts or a trusted shop to do the repairs."
good,If you like minimum wage then this place is for you.  Great employee discounts. Offer benefits after 90 days of full time employment i would notreccomend working here unless you have no family
good,A typical day at Oreilly's isn't at all physically demanding. Management was friendly enough. However it was made painfully clear that there was no opportunity for a raise.
good,"deal with customers, handle cash, stock shelves, clean store, install battery, wiper blades, light blubs on some cars when needed. locate and order parts"
good,Coworkers are friendly and easy to work with. Some lack of professionalism but overall a good place to start out at. Would be better if part time employees had some benefit and more hours.
good,I like to keep busy driving all over Galveston/Houston area  scheduling and delivering merchandise to customers. Putting up stock and cleaning work space area.
good,"The job is a non-stop working environment with a very simple job task, you'll learn how to use industrial equipment if required. The management is very proficient with caring for the employees. Little socialization between workers because of how busy job is, but it isn't non-existent. The hardest part of the job are the hours and work load, and the most enjoyable are the employees you'll meet and the rewards."
good,"THey have a good inventory system that can tell you what products or in stock at all times, If it isn't in Greenville store it can tell you if any of the other O'riley stores have it."
good,O'Reillys provides an open environment to pursue career paths in the automotive industry. With that said the opportunity provided is more experience oriented with slight financial compensation provided only after higher management levels.
good,i enjoyed working at Orielly auto parts for the most part. The best part was learning new things about vehicles and what caused them not to work. But the Clute Orielly auto parts is poorly ran the manager takes advantage of the employees he didn't give lunch breaks even on 8 hour scheduled shifts and he was down right rude to everyone that was not his friend. I would not recommend working there.
good,"There is a lot of repetition with each job position throughout this company. I learned how to do other people's jobs, that was not in my job description and was not being paid to perform. Getting a raise was a rare occasion, and had to be fought to receive. Management could use some work regarding the treatment of their customers, store managers and employees. Workplace culture...what workplace culture? The hardest part of the job was trying not to get sucked into the negativity lingering on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to deal with customers, and the end of the shift."
good,"Living in Missouri, there is good opportunity for advancement in thier large IT department.  They have a variety of IT teams, and the growth rate of stores is promising.  Company stock goes up & up!"
good,I have been there almost a year. The pay is okay because you get commission once a month. I've seen things that I as a manager wouldn't allow. Corporate knows of things going on and yet does nothing about it. I have learned a lot about vehicles from working here
good,"Learned a lot working at Orielly's auto parts.  Knew little about cars, but gained great experience.  Enjoyed helping people and learning from others."
good,"I've been working for Orielly's for almost a year. During  this time frame I've managed to learn and grow as a sales associate, but even though I've gotten good reviews and feel I'm a key player in the team, I still cant become full  time or even get a raise. Due to my store not having ""enough sales"" and ""RPMS"" being too low."
good,"I liked working here. It was a nice High School job. Although, there was a manager who was not well-liked, due to lack of leadership."
good,"The only thing this job has going for it is the ability to create your own schedule (to a certain extent.) If you are looking for a place to move up in, don't work here. It won't happen. If you want full time work, this isn't the place for you. It's a very laid back job, but they do play favorites within this company. Otherwise, the job has it's moments. If you like t drive and listen to music all day, this is the job for you, but don't expect to get out of the truck much."
good,"I was very ambitious and Learned a lot with machinery like the conveyor belt and forklifts, but the manager in my department lacked with his communications skill. Coworkers are amazing hard working people that I've learned to respect and enjoyed to work with and would love to work with people like this again."
good,Its ok bc they will work around your scheduled. The People that buy parts are usually great. tough to move up in company. Alot of turn around employees
good,I started off as a part time driver. I worked my butt off trying to get on full time. When I did start full time more things were added to my plate. I didn't  mind because I liked keeping  busy. But what bothered me is when another driver gets hired on full time and all is asked of her is to work up front on the counter more.  That's what makes the job difficult. I think you should treat people equal. What's good for one is good for the rest.
good,I enjoyed the customers. Some of the people I worked with were great. Helping customers was fun. I liked it when I made them happy. Management often lied about things.
good,"hours vary , not always sure what time you will leave."
good,"it was my job while i was in high school, after graduation i left for new work. I did not have many tasks at this job , it was easy too easy to work comfortably. i did not feel challenged enough"
good,"Typical day would be clock in, daily team brief, collect the daily or weekly work orders. Then do a daily walk around the warehouse to see what's new with the equipment and/or conveyor."
good,"I've worked for the company for over a year and never got a promotion. People who just got hired, got management over me days after walking in the door with no experience."
good,"the store i work at has very poor management and all the employees just do as they please.. over all the company is a good company to work for if you have the right manager, the first manager i had when i started working there had everything under control untill he stepped down and brought someone else in"
good,"the people were easy to get along with and i dont have any complaints about the work environment however it was very hard to get a raise past 950 and virtually impossible to get more than a week off, if you could even get that and then only if you requested months in advance"
good,OK job for starter ! Pay rate sucks though ! Stores are very clean and their training is great . asfdasdffasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
good,"A typical day went as follows."
good,"i was a shift manager, and enjoyed my potion as a manager and the customers. the problem arises when the company would not work with my school after i tried to work with them and brought it up for 3 mounts and they still refused to work with me."
good,"Very difficult to get hired. Things changed alot from when I was hired, such as, the way they measured productivity, they made a change but it was for the worse and are still trying to fix thier mistakes."
good,managed and ran the store on a daily basic. took care of payroll to insure that the store made a profit monthly. managed the money coming in and the bank deposits on a daily basic. did the interviews with all employees before they were hired. did the releasing of employees if they did not work out. did all reviews for team members and evaluations. kept up with all inventory. took care of all complaints and good issues that may have accured in and out of store with retail and commercial accounts. worked 11 to 13 hour days 5 days a week and every other Saturday.
good,Fair company. Very structured and specific in there approach to operations. Compensation was mediocre at best for the required duties. I was involved in a medical crisis that required my removal due to absences.
good,Most of my day consist of helping customers who have car problems find what they need. I had to learn about the various parts that go on cars. I also do deliveries throughout the day. The managers and co-workers are all good people who make it a fun environment to work around.
good,O'Reilly is a great company to work for but I spend more time at work than I do with my family.  The employees are easy to get along with for the most part.  I enjoyed learning about vehicles and how to work on them.
good,"The pay is the worst thing about this place, the only thing that made working there worth it was the benefits. The management was okay."
good,"Learning parts for automobiles in today's industry is very challenging."
good,"learned a lot, worked well with others, company not pay well to those whom are dedicated to the company ... busy environment which is good, paying for your own uniforms was a downfall ,"
good,"Loved working here too, Chub O'Reilly was still alive when i first started with Team Green. Just seems upper management  at home office does not seem to care about the lower paid staff. They placed some of the wrong people in upper management here in columbia,mo. They do not lead by example."
good,a typical day involved finishing the job .ive learned more about auto parts.management was very unorganized.my co workers were very helpful nice people.th a hardest part of the job was finding items on the right part of the shelf.
good,"I worked at this  company while going to school, they are very flexible  typically what you would expect in a Retail job. Although you have to handle alot of grouchy and rude people."
good,"Place is based upon a commission and sales position, even though I  was a driver I was still forced to make sales. Even though the store does not make enough money to provide enough hours, we still worked hard for very low minimum wage. Found myself unhappy and that is why I am looking into a new job."
good,putting up freight and then the customers come in and it can get busy. Besides selling parts to go outside and change a battery or light bulbs etc. hardest part of the day is when its slow. I get along with my co-workers well. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customer.
good,"You kept busy, there was lots of things that needed to be done. Management was poor and co-workers were so unfriendly. People liked to talk behind your back. The best part was the customers. The prices were good though and they had good employee discounts. Plus military discounts."
good,"Honestly the company didn't care for the employees, My typical work day go in at noon cashier if needed, front and faced the shelves until the delivery truck would come in then I would check in the merchandise hoping I didn't get hurt from the dangerously stacked Auto Parts such as batteries etc, I spoke to my Manager and the district Manger about it, they just said it doesn't matter nothing will be done about it, The First I was a full time employee then I was told my job wasn't important enough so my hours were cut to 23 hrs a week."
good,"as a whole the company has good values and actually cares about its employees. When I started I knew little about cars and by the time I left I had confidence in helping customers along with my own vehicle."
good,"Start out with lots of daily paperwork, followed by getting the store ready to open. There is a lot expected from the management and not nearly enough compensation! Very crazy work schedule, co-workers are young kids (seriously) hardest part of the job is dealing with people all day long."
good,"The management at O'Reilly is a little difficult to get along with; they don't get to know or understand their employees or the importance of them being around and working as hard as one does. However, the co workers are good and sometime courteous. Hardest part of the job is, ""Teamwork"". That is the only thing that makes my job hard; because the company asks so much out of you, but doesn't appreciate your hard work and dedication. What I do like about my job are the benefits, far as insurance and the bonus earned each 6 months."
good,As a pregnant woman I was harassed by management at the store I worked in and corporate did nothing about it. It continued and my hours were dropped for no reason which eventually led me to seek employment elsewhere.
good,A typical day at work at oreillys is pretty decent I have learned that Oreillys doesn't have much of an opportunity to advance in the company i never had issues with co workers the hardest part of the job was so much work for so little pay but i did enjoy the time i spent there
good,"Responsible for opening and closing store. Delegate tasks among staff to effectively manage my shift. Checking in truck delivery of merchandise and stock product. Complete opening and closing duties.  Assist commercial and non commercial customers with product, customer service , and diagnosing problems. Complete all plano-grams and sales promotion projects.

good,I would come in at a certain time clock in and get started on my online training.Finish my training take the trash in the entire building out to the dumpster.Then start sweeping around the building and parking lot.Come in and work the register for 3 to 4 hours.Pull parts for the HUB (Delivery drivers) and made sure they went into their designated bins for the drivers.Put the freight (new parts) into alphabetical\numerical order and made sure it was the right spot.Helped the co-workers if they had a problem and asked for help when I ran into a problem.In my opinion hardest part of the job was doing returns and warranties on products.Most enjoyable going to the gas station right across the road to get lunch and drinks for myself and my co-workers
good,If you enjoy working with customers everyday and know your car parts or are willing to learn. This is the place.
good,Working with O'Reilly Auto Parts I've learned about cars and parts that has been very helpful over the years. I enjoy helping customers that have frequent questions and problems with their car. It feel great to know that I am somebody a lot of the customers come to with questions because they know I will give a positive answer. Knowing that your customers trust you and will always come back is a great feeling working for O'Reilly. Co-workers are of help and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is when holding a management position is when your asked things that you do not have the answer to and you have to overlook yourself and search for the answer.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a great place to work if you don't have a degree.  Out of all of the minimum wage jobs I can think of this place is far superior.
good,"Pull parts to make deliveries to mechanic shops around the area. Answer phones, assist customers and put away freight as it comes in."
good,"Working the night shift for 3 years with no opportunity for growth, minimal intellect used for job. Need mind stimulation."
good,"Good benefits, good HR department, Good staff at central office in Springfield MO."
good,I worked commercial for several yrs as a customer service rep. All accounts that I had back then had a understanding that I can find any part. Computers are just a key and  books should be utililized... I worked in addition as the asst manager for approx a yr.
good,Its a Job.. Get Everything In Writing... Some Stores Have Great Mangers Some Have  Fair Mangers...
good,overall it is a good part time place to work but there is no room for advancement they would rather hire someone off the street then promote from within 
good,It's warming up and the warehouse is getting extremely hot. The most enjoyable part about the job is my co-workers.
good,Very nice mangement. They do know how to properly train you as well as the other employees are very helpful. It was very fun interacting with different people everyday as well as the usual cusomers.
good,"Just another retail job. Co-workers are great, sometimes company lacks in professional managment skills. Overall it is not a bad experiance working there. Benefits are decent, as well as the vacation time. Hardest part of the job is the the customers is always right even when they are wrong."
good,Don't have to much to say without back lashing ! The shop I was at was enjoyable to work at besides some parts of management skating on the job. Lack of Leadership from DM-RM .
good,This job consist of matching letters and numbers. It is a pretty laidback work place long as you are getting the work done. The best part of the job is break because you get to play pool with your co-workers.
good,The job was very busy at times. The pay was good just not enough hours.

good,Working here is not great. This company give you no time with your family and your pay sucks.
good,Decent job however pay was not sufficient for job duties. Also management lacked proper skills to perform their job correctly.
good,"The overall job is laid back depending on your position, but there are too many problems to list. The warehouse is outdated and over-staffed with under skilled personnel in vital places. The most enjoyable part is friends and family day, it's really nice. The management is more concerned with keeping payroll a 3% than actually achieving it's goals, instead they would rather cut hours and work those who want to work to death."
good,The company seems to micro manage their manager by not letting them manage their own stores to maximum potential.
good,"This is a great job to work if you are in a two-income household, and if you enjoy meeting new people and working with mechanics and autoparts it's a fun job."
good,The pay is great. It has a decent atmosphere. Could improve management. High turnover. Strict about certain things. Supportive team members. Not much else.
good,"work with customers. Help customers meet their needs.Good job, but needs to be more appreciative to their workers. Need to increase pay when evaluations are done."
good,"I, and many of my coworkers, feel that we are very underpaid for the work we are expected to do by corporate, and we aren't able to negotiate wages. If we work harder on anything other than trying to up-sale customers, there is no benefit other than making the time go by faster. It doesn't make a difference if you are doing the bare minimum or working as hard as you can, its all the same money at the end of the day. However, they are very flexible with your schedule and willing to work with you. If you go to school at the same time and stay up late studying, they will still let you come in and take the day slow while being paid the same amount."
good,I’ve been working there for seven years and it sometimes gets overwhelming because they’re low on staff and expect you to do it all So you tend to take on extra work
good,"The hours were great, but the management and pay wasn't very good. Anytime a part came up missing I was immediately blamed because i’m the one that put up parts even though there are multiple employees who handled merchandise"
good,"Flexible shifts."
good,From what I have seen this can be a great place to work. And there is plenty of room for advancement just depends on you.  You will also need to know how to play the corporate game or your gonna have issues in management.
good,"Not caring "
good,"working at Oreilly's was an adventure.  enjoyed most of it, dealt with all of the left for me and the ones after i got hired.....the biggest problem was hiring....noone in Moab wants to work in a parts store for 12.50 per hour.  I have been known to be a work horse....love to work....not afraid of it, but when it got to be 14 hour days because there was noone else ti work, kind of got out of hand.......with all of my military i strive to #1...not #2......"
good,Was a decent job but they need better manager over all and not many problem get solved it sad they good with customer then once you work for them you stop feeling welcome like you did when you first came in
good,This company used to be so nice to work for but they got all corporate and only worry about their quarterly numbers. Everyone is treated as a robot. Do this task or else. It's hard to find good team members to work with you because they are bent on playing the employees the lowest amount possible. If you get a good manager this can be a good job but most dont care any more.
good,"Management team at the store was more worried about bonuses than helping customers, and giving their friends better treatment and hours."
good,"It's not a horrible place to work, It's very chill and laid back for the most part. Management in my opinion does a good job, he tries to work with you and for the most part does. The other employees are diverse and nice. My only problem is the pay. Actually everyone that works there complains about pay. They do expect and require you to do "" a lot "" for the small amount they pay. If they paid better people would stay. I've seen people leave to other places of work strictly because of pay. ( Including myself )"
good,"The manager who hired me was the best manager I've had in the past 20 years. The district manager did not fit the stated company culture, and so clashed with my manager. Eventually my manager was demoted and transferred, and a new manager was placed in the store who knows nothing about the company culture or teamwork. I want to work in the culture O'Reilly claims to have, not the one being practiced at this time and location."
good,"Work work work! The pay was ok as long as your store was selling a great deal of parts every month. Have a down month have a down pay check. Have a problem with mechanicals in your store, your store paid for it. Your driver gets into an accident, your store pays for it, 5k minimum. Its like running your own business but your not allowed to do much of anything unless you havepermission."
good,"The people at Oreillys were good to work for. The store manager was great."
good,The job itself was a good Disciplined occupation. It wore you down till your ankles hurt. It has its opportunities to work in the automotive field by building relations with commercial accounts such as shops.
good,"Constantly putting items away on the shelf and picking items to customers. Answer lots of questions about products I don't know anything about. Customer don't want to read the labels.  Young inexperienced  team members fighting with each other, playing on phones and work at  a very slow pace."
good,"Fun to deliver parts.  Co-workers are quirky, but nice.  Shops to deliver to are hit and miss when it comes to rudeness to delivery drivers.  Overall, I would stay there, but is boring at times."
good,Good place to work straight out of school or while in school. Discount is fantastic. There is potential to move up in the company. Downside is company doesn't pay well. Managment was so.ewhat helpful. Corporate was a joke.
good,Your coworkers can be a great part or can be the worst part.Management can be difficult depends on what side you get on. Not much room for advancement
good,"I worked there for 3 years, and the raises were minimal for everyone. The bonuses are hyped up, then blown apart. It takes forever to advance.  And promises are easily forgotten or broken.  This is not necessarily from the local level but the corporate level as well. I would never go back!"
good,Corporate sucks and they lie for their own benefit. After 3 yrs of service I was only making $9.15 an hour and I went above and beyond my job description in other departments as well and was let go due to a workman's comp error from the doctor. The company sd they talked to the doctor about my case and never did or I would have never been let go!
good,Work load can be very stressful at times and don't feel upper management takes notice of it. Only tells you what you want to hear. Some days feel like only a number and just another person or body to fill a spot .
good,Loved working in the Bradenton location all good vibes there a lot of hard work in that store but everyone pulls there own weight great manager transfer to Sarasota location to be close to home the manager in that store was no pleasant to work for he would not own up to his mistake and like to blame others for his wrong doings
good,"While the pay rate is nowhere near reaching livable income, certain benefits and discounts are not bad.  This is definitely a job for a car enthusiast and not anyone else."
good,"I wouldn't give this place a negative or positive review. It's just a job. There were bad days, but even the worst day there was better than a bad day in the military."
good,"pays commission but it's only worth it if your at a big store it's based or store sales or personal sales which evers higher, that being said the pay isn't great and only raises you get are yearly evaluations which is at the managers discretion so you may not even get raises,most benefits are full time only so if your part time theres really not a whole lot there, and in all honestly you would get paid more just about anywhere else"
good,"I agree with everyone else, PAY is to low for a multi-billion dollar company. At what expense to the customer service is it costing us?  Pay a better wage = retain better people. "
good,"Good place to work , great store manager , great crew however corporate was a different story . But loved been able to help people get the parts and the knowledge to get they're cars running ."
good,"From a business standpoint O'Reilly is a great company but working for them at any retail level is when you see the nitty gritty. There is a corruption that goes on at that level that will make you sick. They don't use a good way to measure how good an employee is so even if you are the only one people want to see because you have top notch service, you are never recognized because you didn't sell them extra stuff they might not have needed for the job or already had."
good,"I got injured on the job from working really hard and really long hours. After I was horribly injured I was placed on workers comp and they still wanted me to work when I should've been at home healing this has been almost a year ago and at times I still feel the areas where I was injured. they ended up letting me go with no notice by telling me that my tempt to hire term was up, which I felt like was a easy way for them to say ""your fired"" and the sad part was they used me the last day I worked to help them finish on a Monday  which is usually the most be  busiest day of the week.."
good,It's a great place if you're in high school or need a good job while in college... But I can't imagine someone trying to make a living while working here. the pay is too small.
good,It will pay the Bill's but no room for advancement unless you wanna relocate. Easy job if you have some knowledge about the automotive field and customer service
good,"from my year and a half experience with O'Reilly, I can conclude that it is a decent job as the environment is positive but the pay is not worth the work. management is often lazy and unsupervised. the hour lunch break is great but you dont get paid for it."
good,O-Reilly's auto part is a pretty good reliable job if you are a full time student. They are very flexible with hours. I've learned a lot from O'reilly's auto part such as be a better retail seller. Their management is great is above average. The hardest part from O'reilly's was having to learned my car parts. The most enjoyable about O'reillys was having such an amazing discount.
good,The company has good culture values but they are not followed about 1/2 the time. The management put production and  profits over value.There has been a lot of turn over both with the hourly employees and with management.
good,I loved my job. what i did not like was management and pay wages. i loved the customers. i grew a bond with alot of the customers. they would come in and want to deal with only me. if i wasnt there they would come back when i was there. it pays to be friendly to customers.
good,It was ok... would have stayed longer if i was getting full time with benefits and more then 25 hours a week... but they wouldnt give me either so i left
good,"High expectations, low wages. It’s time to find a legit career, I see no bright future working for this corporation. Only a back up job if you are young and going to school, old and retired, or want supplemental income from a legitimate career. Devoting a year of your life, while earning the company hundreds of thousands of dollars for a .22 cent raise shows their care for their employees."
good,"Title says it all; average at best."
good,Everything is great when your running great numbers but once anything happens where you are not making numbers you go from a star to someone they try actively to get rid of so they can replace you with someone who makes less money
good,My manager was awesome and went above and beyond for his employees. I left less than a month after he left the company. The store went downhill afterwards.
good,"They cut back on safety issues, to stay competitive. They barely ever, maintained their work vehicles; in order to save money. I drove hundreds of miles, in vehicles, that I felt were unsafe."
good,I learned a lot working for this company. I also met a lot of great people. They believe in hard work and their is opportunity to grow. They also were flexible with my work hours.
good,"The pay sucks, hours aren’t bad but overall it’s not a bad place to work for a paycheck that can get you by, my bills get paid and I’m not homeless so there’s that"
good,I love working in the automotive industry and would love to work their again. The company was strong but I feel the management was not I did not get all the training I was required
good,"The job at oreilly was fast paced, however any down time you would’ve had would be filled with managers telling you to find a broom. Customers expect you to be a mechanic while also not wanting to pay for a mechanic."
good,At O'Reilly Auto Parts it is stressful everything get dumped to one person. Manager is poor and unwilling to understand the O'Reilly way. The worst part you cant talk to no one because if you do or say something things get worse and make it harder to work at O'Reilly. Hourly pay is poor and can not expect to live off of what they pay you at all !
good,It wasn’t that hard but the district manager I had disliked my store because of the distance he had to travel so he basically didn’t help us very much. The coworkers were fine other than they would call you on your day off to work or ask questions. There training program they forced you to do was beyond simplistic.
good,"Im an ISS (installer service specialist) and a normal day would be checking in freight and answering calls to our wholesale customers, but when the store is lacking in moral and employees the work load is tripled. "
good,"Being a parts delivery driver for Oreilly Auto Parts has its benefits in that is it easy and fun and pays fairly well to help customers by driving, listening to your radio, and deliver parts; however, if you are looking to advance within the company, then this job may not be for you.  I was hired part-time with the understanding that I would be made full-time within a few months when the commercial department got busier.  Eight months later, I asked my new manager about going full-time and he explained to me that full-time is not an option because the company does not want to pay the benefits and insurance for a fulltime associate and that he was in the process of hiring two more part timers to carry the work load instead.  I then asked my manager and our district manager if I could transfer to another store that could use a full time associate and it was told to me that this is company wide.  The company has decided to freeze hiring and IF they do hire, it will be for only part-time positions.  I explained that I have a family with four children all in school and I need full time hours and benefits.  Then I reitterated my desire and also explained how much I actually love my job and that I took this job because I would have liked to one day be management; however, in order for this to happen I  would need to start by workiing full time.  Nevertheless, the answer was  no.  I told them that because of my family and our needs I would have to start looking for something else and that's when I was told ""Well, you will be remembered."" So much for a company that cares for it's employees."
good,After a certain point at this company it runs out of gas says you are topped out in pay and for the knowledge you could have they do not want to pay for it
good,Good place to work if you need a job. But not for building careers. Very good company. Depending on which district you are working in. Pays enough for basic living but not to thrive on. Especially if you work front counter
good,The manager did not care about what was going on with the delivery part when it was what brought in the most profit.   Drivers took their time and stopped for smoke breaks when not allowed.
good,All I can say management needs to be moved around. Working with employees at all time getting to know all your employees. to be equal with everyone do to there position status.
good,"Strating pay is not great, if you can learn and advance then it becomes ok. Management is where the money is made but you sacrifice being able to break away from your job when you go home. Upper management doesn't show much concern unless you begin to fail. They only care that you have the store covered at all times either by an hourly counter salesman or yourself who has already worked 50+ hours that week"
good,"Nice place to learn and help customers with car related problems. flexible scheduling but all depends on the store you are at. also, you can negotiate pay."
good,"The typical work day started with paper work , a variety of reports and cash balancing, before opening the store for business. As the day progressed, activities changed to checking in newly shipped merchandise and creating a returns manifest to ship back to the warehouse.  I provided guidance to the hourly employees in their daily training and tasks and assisted on the front counter to help customers with their needs and create a friendly sales environment. "
good,The new manager the store was given after the previous was given a promotion had no business being a manager anywhere. But especially not in a place that is supposed to pride themselves on customer service and other cultures that that person can’t perform right. Instead being promoted on merit the lead of another store just sucked the shlongof the DM enough to have his troublesome assistant moved to our store and left our store to fail.
good,"It has its moments "
good,"Route driving is easy work, except for the occasional heavy lifting and navigating traffic.  If you pay attention to your paperwork, and have good organizational skills, it's very easy work."
good,"For me it wasn't a good fit. I was spending too much time at work and not being compensated appropriately. For me "
good,I enjoyed being able to help customers find the product they were looking for and checking them out. Keeping track of your own cash register could sometimes be tricky. The hardest part was delivering to customers but it was also very enjoyable. It was hard driving because of other drivers on the road.
good,"As long as you have a decent manager, this is a good company to work for. I, unfortunately, did not have a good experience due to management. The pay was not worth the harassment I had to endure."
good,"My time spent at Oreilly Auto Parts was a good experience for me.  I was able to perform several different tasks in a work environment that I wasn't really accustomed to.  The slow pace at times, however, sometimes made for a long day at work.  I would do it again but not unless I just had to."
good,"It's just as I said, alright. It's a job that you should only do short time before moving on to a better job or school. Theres not much else to say on this."
good,Decent job to work at on weekend or when my other job was slow and had lots of unpaid time off. Would not have as my only job as it did not pay very well.
good,"It definitely can be fun depending on people working around you, and could be competitive amongst other stores. Overall it's a relaxed type of job most of the time"
good,"I enjoy working here, it has its perks. Great discount, decent people at least at the store level. Day to day is generally the same. Put up stock, planogram changes, upsell items help out customers. The benefits are decent, but the health insurance is way to expensive for an employer with the amount of employees they have."
good,"Lots of opportunity to move up to take a store, pay is OK if you live in a cheap area, not so good for a higher cost of living area. Corp. does not understand that a city with a 15 min wage will need more payroll than one with an 8 min wage. Last couple years more younger people have been promoted in company to high levels that do not have old guard ""family"" mentality. Much managing by spreadsheet, not understanding the market, just pushing numbers around"
good,"While I am still an employee of this company for now, I have had my fill of this job. Although I am a part time manage I receive none of the benefits but cover manager's shifts and duties."
good,"i like selling auto parts to people. i like working on cars. very knowledgeable about them. i don't like how they pay us, or how the manager gets all the money while we have to do most of the work."
good,Need to know about cars and how to diagnose issues to give customers the best knowledge on how to fix their problems. Must have a flexible schedule. Likely to move up to management with max effort
good,The job was cool but there's not much room for monetary growth...job is more for the discount anyway. As with any job your manager and co-workers are what make it what it is. I had a great manager but in my opinion it was smarter to focus more on school and enjoy my weekends off.
good,I love that work place! It is a time consuming plan e that's why I would prefer student. The only  down part is if you ha ent finished your orders you would not be able to.
good,"I loved working there and was always complemented from the companies I would deliver the parts too,and then I was told by the store manager that since I was doing so good that I would get a raise,then he went on vacation for two weeks came back,and he never gave me my raise so I needed to find a higher paying job."
good,"you have to come ready to work, you must be in some kind of shape with some kind of stamina and you cant be afraid to get dirty its a dirty warehouse full of box dust"
good,"They are a promote from within company so you can receive advancement in the company pretty easily as long as you work hard and learn your job, give up a social life and believe their lies."
good,"Good place to work while attending school. Flexible hours, fun fast paced environment. Good benefits when you become full time in the company. Non-discriminating environment witch makea everybody comfortable in the workplace"
good,"A good place for college kids to work, flexible schedule, management not so great. I worked at a very slow location. You learn lot on the job about cars."
good,I have nothing negative to say about O'Reillys except that they could afford to pay the employees more.  I have been an employee for more than two years and I still make less than $9.00 per hour. I work very hard and I know my job well.
good,I was happy to work for this employer with the team of workers there. I took a pay cut to work there full time. Unfortunately I have found myself in a position personally where I have to seek employment with better pay.
good,"Very easy going and quick to catch on. This job included very limited customer service but a large amount of hands on work. But, can be limited on growth with pay increase."
good,"o'riellys auto parts is a good place to work if your younger, still in school, or just need a side job. you have to have somewhat flexible hours, and be willing to work late."
good,"A typical day is answering phones and pulling parts for delivery.  On occasion I would personally make deliveries if there was a rush. Customer service is the key to both our retail customers and our commercial customers.  The store works best as a team, if one stumbles, it is up to the rest of the team to carry the weight."
good,"Personal opinion of my experience with Oreillys has been poor. Management is constantly fluctuating. Stores will explain your job title and requirements but then demand more. They fail to schedule full-time workers full time hours consistently. They require F-endorsement for driving vehicles, however, will demand you to drive without one even if you have not been hired on with the company with a Delivery Driver title as long as age is not an issue. They demand you travel or relocate as well under certain job titles. There is an ability for knowledge expanse and training."
good,O'Reilly has been an excellent place to work for the past 7 years. If you want an introductory to management then this is a great place to try. All training is given to you but if you are not looked at as important enough you are not really heard. I have been passed up for several roles within the distribution center by people with less tenure or even people with documented Forms of discipline. I have kept culture alive with myself and my team as well as receiving excellent reviews while employed. Unfortunately i have seen too many people come in and prove to me that it is not about the hard work or culture values exhibited its more about who you know. This is an absolutely great company that is being ran by the wrong people and choosing the wrong leaders to lead our company in a positive direction. Lastly there is too much upper management favoritism and it is a reason for my career change but most importantly your advancement will come to a head and you will be left wondering when you will be chosen and no one will even give you the slightest hint that you are doing well or not.
good,only hire part time doing away with benifits like all other big companies not hard work but require you to work weekends and hate to give earned time off
good,"This was a good job for a single person or someone working through college.  The pay was very low, and the hours aren't consistent.  I would not have left, but I needed to make more money."
good,"Needs to have the managers looked at especially when it comes to their employees"
good,This company is a good starter job. It is good to gain experience for new driver looking for night shifts. You will gain customer service. Hardest things is working nights and not having appropriate security.
good,"My experience with O'Reilly Auto Parts has been pretty positive for the most part. The only thing I will say is that they are very demanding of their management staff and upper management is often unavailable to assist you. They practice and preach a specific culture and expect you to trickle that culture down to your team members and get them on board with all the metric drivers. The issue with this is that O'Reilly Auto Parts is not very competitive in their pay in my opinion. Having friends that work for the competitors I do know that as a store manager, I am underpaid. I also know that my team members are underpaid. It is very difficult to manage and balance a team that is underpaid while monitoring everything else going on in the store as a store manager."
good,My job was simply to drive around and deliver parts. Even with that simple of a job my manager always had something to say which made it not very enjoyable.
good,"Coming from Napa for 20 years,it was hard to adjust to the culture at O'Reillys,at least in my store in Mt.Vernon,Ohio.Staff was much younger and less mature than Napa,upside is you dont have to argue about prices with every bubba that walks in the door like at Napa.I refused to install parts unless I am getting installer pay,but I would do wipers and batteries.It doesnt suck as bad as Auto Zone,but just barely."
good,"The manager I work under is brilliant at her job, overall everyone is  pretty good about team work, but the company is horrible about the pay and getting hours, unless you're in a higher position .....part timers do not get any benefits, except stock options 401k, ( no match) after one year of work this will kick in, they do give employees a great discount on auto parts, I also enjoy driving the different routes their s some freedom in that, no one breathing down your back."
good,From day one i was able to notice the inequality in the work place. The higher ups would just stand at their counters or pass jobs they didnt want onto the new comers. The attitude you would get if you asked for a manager to come type in their code was unbelievable.
good,"Fast paced environment, gained vast amount of knowledge on interacting with individuals, task delegation, adapting to less than ideal situations on a daily basis.This company has a great culture in place, which is sometimes not displayed well by certain individuals. Hardest part of the job is the mental stress it causes, but I enjoy the interaction with other employess, family like environment in store."
good,It's a good first job for a high school student or someone in college. Or maybe a second part time job. There wasn't much of a chance of moving up or getting a pay raise or getting better hours.
good,Poorly managed. Too much favoritism. Not equally balanced for productivity. Would recommend a department other than City counter. Was not well maintained.
good,A great place to work if you're able to have a great management team and to if travel pay for training was better.  person can learn a lot about the automotive industry and gives the chance to get certifications in the automotive industry.
good,"Delivering parts at this job was a breeze. Sure we had deadlines, but it was better to be cool-headed and relaxed on the roads than to be rushed. Even when running behind, management had your back. They even tolerated the occasional mistake, only resorting to punishment if it became a regular occurrence, which is a good management style for the job itself. But they also took a completely hands-off approach to interpersonal conflict. And because the low pay and part-time only positions tended to scratch the the very bottom of the job seeker barrel, we ended up with quite a few less than desirable employees: In particular, several outspoken racists and sexists. When the 2016 election rolled around, I had to quit because their rhetoric was unbearable, a few were advocating for taking criminal action, and the company was complacent with all of it."
good,Assistant manger was not what I expected trying to advance my career in this establishment. Unfortunately I did not want to pursue management just because of my last employer but they gave it to me either way.The sad part is working so long in one company you can see new faces come and go just because you knew people were not enjoying it.
good,"I really enjoy my job at OReilly's, it is great to work for the company and help people solve their problems with their vehicles.  Over the course of almost 10 years, I have learned how to manage inventory and source parts."
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts was the only job that allowed me to advance within the company. I received two promotions within a year. The company is very good when it comes to keeping its employees involved with the O'Reilly tradition. It wasn't until I got a management promotion that I realized how much responsibility came with a minor pay raise. The worst part about the job was the fact that we had very few employees and I was required to fill all uncovered shifts. I would go several consecutive days working more than twelve hours a day.
good,"It was always enjoyable to be able to help customers when they weren't quite sure what they needed. The pay and benefits was not very good, however the discount was great."
good,"Not a bad place for a first time job, get to learn a lot about cars."
good,Working at Oreilly can be very timing consuming especially if you have no knowledge about cars but at the same time it could fun because it gives you the opportunity to learn things that you never knew about. I really enjoy working there learning new things and meeting great people
good,Easy going is how I would describe the work place. They want sales people who have experience in field or have a lot of automotive knowledge however they highly underpay and undervalue the experience that they do have. Often the job attracts very young people that lack experience or work ethic that can make the daily tasks harder. They are good about trying to advance people and encourage them to make a career out of the job.
good,Constantly understaffed and overworked employees. This leads to high turnover rate and lack of motivation for employees. This business does not schedule appropriate 15-minute breaks for full-time employees in accordance with Nevada labor laws.
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the customers.  But, the corporate office only sees their employees as a number.  They don't have incentive to want to advance and make the company a career"
good,Not a good place to work.Team members are always belittled by upper management.They are always being told that they can be replaced for cheaper wages.Cutting peoples hours that have been there for years and tells them they are fxxxx worthless.
good,Provides  a good discount but bad pay. Will not get a raise unless you ask for one. if you become a night manager. They will most likely only give you a quarter raise. Overall stingy company
good,I enjoyed working for Oreily's.  It's conveniently located in the heart of town.  The work is not intense and is easy to do. My only complaint is that the work hours are also on Weekends and nights.
good,a typical day will start by checking in delivery trucks making sure all fluids are good.deliver parts to customers. I have learned how to find parts effectively. There is really no room for career advancement. the workplace culture is good. the hardest part of the job is putting up with management. the most enjoyable part is helping customers and finding those automotive parts no one else can locate.
good,"bad pay, weak benefits, trying to phase out the union, many internal problems since oreilly took over kragen. kragen was awesome. but oreillys left a rancid taste in my mouth. management is downright incompetent."
good,"Help customers find the right vehicle parts, deliver parts, put up parts"
good,"Oriellys auto parts is actually a good place to work, they train and retain. this is an important to any company culture. with operation training and employee incentives makes it kind fun to work there."
good,A nice opportunity to gain experience. Spend most of the day interacting with customers and trouble shooting their issues with their vehicle. Was a manager and only got a 75 cent raise
good,"LMS is a foolish system.Th engineers who developed it should actually try doing the job the are building systems for before implementing. Beyond that, it's good place to work."
good,"Pay not commensurate with responsibility. But it is a fun atmosphere and down to earth culture. Low stress job and fun culture of car parts and ""Gear Heads""."
good,"Working there was a lot of fun and my coworkers were great to work with. As I am into cars and motorcycles, It was a great way to help others find what they needed to repair their vehicles. Unfortunately the manager that I worked for was a petty individual and I ended up finding work elsewhere."
good,the hardest part of the job was always dealing with rude customers and especially the ones that didn't think you actually knew what you were talking about
good,good company don't expect to move up the food chain fast it will take you about 7 years to be a assistant manager but its ok money for the work done on a daily basis
good,Upper management relies solely on computers to make decisions. They do not care to listen to employee suggestions. They care only about numbers and not about employees
good,Some employees get away with a lot and are not held accountable. While harder working employees are not rewarded either. Good starting out job but not really a career.
good,overall it was a great company to work for treated everyone fairly just doesn't have enough hours or pay enough for me to stay. the employees were mostly friendly though it did have a couple of people that weren't the best to work with like every other company does. this would be great job if you can get on full time but would be extremely lucky to get that.
good,"The company has good things overall but in the particular place I worked it was out of control. favortism and supervisors saying rude comments to workers, need retrainning."
good,Easy job easy money but bad management. People who work here tend to do whatever they want instead of following simple orders.job is simple if your a hard worker. Management claims to be helpful in certain situations but they're just blowing smoke up your butt. I used to love this job and you can if you have good people working with you but if they hire horrible people it'll make your job 10 times harder. Good benefits.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts was a fun place to work. The customers were very nice as well as the people I worked with. There were a few issues with management because the manager was still learning but overall it was a great place to work.
good,"not a bad place to work and learn things, customers are usually great. corporate kind of screws the whole thing up with not giving their managers the tools and staff they need to be successful but all in all everyone works together and gets the job done."
good,"Ive worked at a couple of stores now and each store runs differently depending on management, but its pretty fun especially when you already like cars. There is always something to do whether its helping customers, restocking, cleaning, or checking inventory."
good,O'reillys is a wonderful workplace for anyone that knows anything about vehicle parts. Although it is not for someone who has little to know knowledge of vehicle parts. There are many things you need to know before you go in there and think you can run the place. You need to have great knowledge of vehicles and there spare parts. Not much training involved or devoted to you upon arrival if I must say so myself.
good,its a decent job for a young kid with now spouse or life they aren't very flexible with schedule. depending on the store half the managers shouldn't have been put in their position most of them don't work and take all credit from their employees to make them look good in front of the district managers.
good,"a day will be attending customer with their automotive parts needs, i learned to be faster on gathering info on parts, management it depends who you get usually theirs good day and bad days,the workplace is fun and energetic, hardest part of the job is to stay on time from clocking out, most enjoyable part is attending the customers and receiving a thank you."
good,Warehouse needs major improvements besides that this is not a bad place to work. 2 paid breaks and 1 unpaid lunch break. Work is not that hard to do. Management could ne a tad bit better.
good,"The management really likes to pick favorites in their employee's. Hesitant on giving full-time employment to anyone. Tight budgeted when it comes to tools and computers for looking up parts. But overall is a decent company to qork for, nust may not suit most people."
good,it was an okay job. I guess it depends on the manager you have because I got treated unfairly at my last one and thats why I quit but hours kind of suck and some managers take advantage of you.
good,Pays not the greatest and if a higher up does not like you for any reason you will not enjoy working here. They have a tendency to send you to other places without asking.
good,"Starts Focused, Stays Focused "
good,A dead end street for most of the people that choose to work here. The regional level has their goals to meet but unless one is capable of handpicking their foot traffic there is little that one could do about it.
good,"I worked for this job for almost 12 years and once it was bought out by O'reilly Auto, the morale left.  The company does not promote within.  If you do not fit in with the ""in crowd"" all forms of management will shun you.  Bi-lingual is a must but they do not tell you that (per laws) and discriminate against those who are not fluent in Spanish."
good,"Check fluids on trucks. My co-workers are nice, understanding, kind and caring. Pick up payments or returns from business's. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customer's.  I have learned how to be patient and run systems on the computer a little faster then I could before, answer phone calls back to back."
good,Personally I love the job. The people I work with are super helpful when you need their assistance. The manager there is full of information and can solve just about any issue a customer has.
good,"This company didn't provide a good balance between home life and work. I barely had anytime with my young daughter and was always having to work including 4 hours on mothers day. "
good,"The best part of the job is that I get to be a delivery driver. Employee discount on car part. There's two sides of it, commercial and retail. Not a big fan of dealing with retail. I would rather deal with the commercial sides and helping the commercial customers."
good,Had alot of team member turnover and it left too much on me to complete. Need a fresh start. Ready to try things and see different opportunities. Overall the work was ok
good,"O'Reilly is a great company to work for if you don't have a family in which you need to make a pretty good bit of money. Its a friendly environment, but may not be suitable for the average woman."
good,"Hardest part of the job is having to do work of 3 other people. Store usually understaffed. Long hours, not enough pay. Management expects to much, the most enjoyable parts of the jobs are days off."
good,O'reilly is a great business if you know your vehicles and the basis skills of working a computer. O'Reilly lacks a  way to move up quickly in the business and the pay is less than par for some employees. There is sometimes too much work to be done at one time and not every team member pitches in to help.
good,i enjoyed working with the public a lot and the things I did at my job. The manager was a hard person to get along with and was not willing to help his employee advance in the company.
good,"Working at O'Reilly's was very...interesting. I did like the people I worked with, but management wasn't very good and there was no promise of me advancing."
good,"A typical day at O'Reaillys starts with you coming in and gathering as much information as you can about how the day has been going. If it has been slow, busy, ect. While doing this normally I like to find out what the night shift is expected to do that night and if there is any specific people coming in for parts.  "
good,"Put the truck up, and pull orders to take to various garages and take test to get more knowledge on new parts. Fill orders for different store."
good,I thought it was decent employment.  Did not believe the pay was enough to offset required hours.  The hardest part of job was keeping the employees motivated despite the wage made.
good,"A place that keeps you in your feet, with repetitive assignments that are expected to be completed quickly and effectively"
good,"I would open the store, do the morning paperwork, do the morning inventories. Open the store at 7:30 help my team members put up the stock that came in that day. Start on returns that get sent back to the DC while taking care of our customers. Customer service is a priority everyone should be greeted with a smile. My co workers some good some bad. I'd give out and follow up on tasks. Hardest part of my job would be getting off at 10:00 pm. Best part of my job is dealing with customers all day, I love talking to people."
good,I would do daily deposit and paperwork then open store for customers. Daily task of freight and returns along with taking care of the customers.  Watching payroll verses sales to keep the store numbers in check. Tried to make a pleasant work environment for my employees. Problem solving was a fun but challenging part of the job.
good,"This is a good job for somebody attending school or who is retired. The pay is pretty low. A little more than minimum wage. You do learn a lot about automotive. The training was good for someone who didn't know much about automotive parts. Kinda flexible if working around another job or school. Management stinks here. I wish management were more positive when coming to work. You know that saying, ""A company is only as good as its management"". Well, that applies to here."
good,Upper management made it hard for the employees to really flourish and show the areas they where strong in because of senseless demands that where set.
good,"There was always something to be done during normal business hours. Evenings and nights were quite the opposite, very rarely were there more than 10 customers from 4:00pm to closing time. Lots of politics. Not much opportunity for advancement. The best part was the (generally) relaxed environment. The worst part was dealing with the lifetimers who have been in the automotive industry since the dawn of time and tend to be excessively stubborn and rude. As an assistant manager it was almost impossible for me to take time off as there was nobody to fill my role."
good,"A typical day at work includes managing all aspects of the business. I start completing reports for the previous day's business. Afterwards, I process returns and prepare to check in the stock order for the day. I also prepare the deposit for the bank. I usually have two team members in the morning of which I assign them projects to complete. There's a lot to get done depending on the agenda. Most importantly, I go over goals and expectations with the team members as it pertains to customer service. It's important to make sure that they know what's expected of them."
good,Good place to work if you are only looking for part-time employment. Also great for learning about customer service and auto parts.
good,Typical make delivery runs to take parts to local dealerships and repair shops to replenish inventory. I have learned to mange time. Management is a very important to have a strong work team and company . The most enjoyable part of the day is looking at a satisfied costumer
good,"I learned much about cars and retail sales management."
good,"On an average day at O'Reilly auto parts the day was focused on customer support whether it was over the phone or in person. We spent time cleaning and stocking shelfs. We would focus on commercial accounts in the nearby area."
good,Worked For O'Reillys  for 9 months I loved my job every day I got to learn something new  about cars. also a great place to network for automotive service's for your vehicles.  The only real problem I ever had was good help was hard to keep.  Which in turn put a very hard work load strain on all of the employs. Pay was not the greatest ether but manageable. Not to mention in the 9 months I worked there my store went through 3 General Managers.
good,Working with cars is fun. You get to learns lots of things. Parts are sometimes hard to find if they arent labeled good. Lots of things go missing.
good,"Overall I have liked working at ORLY.  It is a good place to start but not a good place to stay if you want to grow."
good,"Deliver parts, bill customers, handle money, inventory supply and control, responsible for effective merchandising of product for saleability, other duties as assigned."
good,"The job itself isn't bad. O'Reilly has some good people working in it, but my store in particular was slow, often hit by shoplifters and drug users. "
good,Management works well with school schedules. Customers are friendly. Too bad this place got shut down. Would've been a great school job.
good,better than most companies i work at before but not their yet. the healthcare is really poor. a lot of travel and little regard for employee family life.
good,a day at work was ok I would go in talk with the managers for a while do my job then help clean and close down the store. While i was there i learned more about engine maintenance. management was poor and couldve done a better job. hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the rude customers. not really much to enjoy.
good,"Arrive at work "
good,"A typical day for me at work is a slow day im not use to a slow day that means you can move at as lower pace than normal but im so use to going fast till its hard for me to do sometimes.ive learned how to manage my time wisely what i mean is i know how to go with the flow of the job if calls for fast i go fast if its call for slow pacing i gradually go slow to work that needs performed.Coworkers their the normal on every job different types of attitudes to deal with good bad but overall everyone comes to do their job.Their really isnt a hard part to the job once uve mastered everything but i can say dealing with supervisors can be hard sometimes,but i enjoy the work i do and the people around me cause im a peoples person so if ur around me your happy."
good,"A typical day at work would involve my assistance for helping customers find the parts/accessories they needed. "
good,Ive learned that in the automotive world there is always and will always be newer and greater products. the technology is never ending and always evolving. to better our experiences with motor vehicles and keep us safer on the roads.
good,Clock in. Get vocollect headset. Signout power equipment. Go to startup meeting. Get power equipment. Get order tickets. Go pull all order tickets. Take all pulled materials to sorting area. Repeat until work day ends. Clock out. Go Home.
good,"dealing with customers in person and over phone"
good,"Days at work are enjoyable. Management is one of the more difficult things to deal with. If management isn't there, nothing gets done. If management is there, nothing gets done. O'Reillys believes in treating people they way you would like to be treated, but this results in never letting anyone go or firing anyone (even when they destroy and damage over $15,000 worth of equipment). There is also little room for growth. The best you can do is become a regional manager. If you want to work for corporate, which I would like to do, you would have to pack up your life and move to the middle of the country."
good,"A typical day at work allways interesting every day is new experience.Every day you will learn how to look up different ways to look up or cross reference parts.The store manager is a fair guy,and my co workers are allways ready to or help when needed.The hardest part of the job is finding a part with minimal information the most enjoyable is finding the right part the first time."
good,"I enjoyed all areas and duties of my job as an Assistant Manager / Training Safety Coordinator but the staffing and policies were horrible. I learned a lot because I applied myself and wanted to learn the company. I started as  Merchandiser, Certified  Parts Tech, Key Carrier, and Assistant Management."
good,"O'Reilly wants to be great but doesn't quite get there. "
good,spent more time working then anything else they kept you at a low pay rate so you would have to take more hours to make ends meet they expected you to work Holidays they would call you in on your vacation raise's were few and far between
good,Overall working for O'Reilly Auto Parts has been a great experience.  This employment has given me a new sense of understanding what is expected in the working environment.  I have the distinct pleasure of working with many friendly and knowledgeable people.  The hardest part of my responsibilities is trying to provide quality customer service to every customer.  Being a part of the management team at O'Reilly Auto Parts is exciting and I personally enjoy watching the store grow through the hard work of each team member.
good,"My occupation consists of all types of customers on a day-to-day basis.  I get customers that don't know a whole lot of what is going on to customers that know what they need specifically to what we have.  Sometimes customers will take their aggression out on us because they know we would lose our job if we react.  On the other hand, most of the customers actually help us out.  Most of the store is unorganized,  while our job is to go through the store at any specific time and organize it, others like to throw the merchandise around.  With that being said, I am constantly moving and always have something to do, because the store is somehow never organized day in and day out.  The team I work with is very comprehending and motivating, but there is hardly any advancement and low income.  The lower ranks help each other out as well as management as much as possible, and the management tends to work with everyone's issues."
good,good place to work.good friends and good people tryiing to learn more.
good,"Boring work same thing everyday , no advancement, Retail hours and situations,"
good,"Develop relationships with a lot of different customers."
good,A work day at oreilly was fun cauase its what you made of it . I learned to work with different supvisors and team members. Management was alright sometimes but they had they're favorites.My co workers were fun poeple to work with. The hardest part was when business got slow and they start cutting hours. The most enjoyable was getting overtime.
good,Great co workers however general not permitted to be staffed well enough and manger must work very long hours to cover what is not covered by hourly positions. Compensation does not meet hours required by any means. No work/life balance.
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers, vendors, and outside suppliers as they increased our parts supply chain.  As a manager, I was accountable for the day to day performance and productivity.  The most common metric scale that was used to determine level of productivity was/is revenue.  Although, there was an indirect emphasis on Profit, it was something that would only be addressed very seldom. My direct supervisor was a district manager (DM) ,  we experience turn over of 5 in just under a year.  Having to adapt to different expectations was difficult and as a result several store managers ( like myself) were either demoted or terminated. There is a collective incompetence at the above-the-store level.  Most managers were getting  ""right"" by chance.  There was also conflicting messages about priorities. "
good,long shift and no way to advance.  Co worker and mangement was great.
good,"I learned a lot about cars, customer service, and sales goals. Worked all week and then have to work all weekend."
good,"20-30 hours per week only, no openings for full time employment and no benefits................"
good,"Typical day at work requires me to pull parts against an invoice and place them in proper totes. Verify parts, load truck, and precede to local and long distance stores and customers. The most enjoyable part of my day was when i was out delivering parts to customers because I'm on my own without supervision. The job was fairly easy because i had previous experiences in warehouse duties."
good,good place to work pay is not that great though but advancement is possible
good,a fast paced working environment with slow increased at pay.
good,"Typically, you answer phones and wait on customers by providing them with automotive products and services. Im constantly learning something new everyday, whether it be slang, uses of tools, etc., but I admit that I am a novice at best when it comes to automechanics. All of the management that I have come into contact with is very easy going and personable. They want you to progress as a person of course, but they set reasonable goals and work with you to reach them. The hardest part of the job, for me, is dealing with customers who dont know what they need, or customers that are very cost concious. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, learning new things, and doing so in a laid back environment most of the time."
good,Management is not concerned about employee safety of company truck reviews.
good,"The company promotes from within, but the wages are low. The store I worked in the schedules were normally consistent. The company has good standards for employees. Unfortunately not everyone lives up to those standards."
good,"Average warehouse environment, great supervisor (no longer employed there), Laid back, relaxed work environment, Some downsides:  Semi-frequent heavy lifting"
good,Good company to work for has some ups and downs but the company is good they offer discounts on parts and bonuses from time to time. Have paid vacation after a year of working for them
good,"It pays the bills when hours are not cut"
good,"learned a great deal about vehicles and how to help customers with their needs for the vehicles"
good,"Fun workplace, easy Job, great for someone starting out in the work force, or perhaps someone who enjoys cars. they have good benefits if you are full time."
good,"Customers were not always the easiest to help. Coworkers are not always the easiest to work with, but high turnover rate means it won't last long anyway."
good,"Was a good job for those who need a part time job or a beginners job. Discounts were good, but the pay doesnt match the stress that comes with it. Needs to pay more than minimum wage."
good,I loved working here but in the end it's a business. Everyone is helpful. There isn't a person I worked with that I couldnt count on. Great folks!!!!!
good,I learned a lot of stuff working here and met some really great people. Management was ok to work for he delivered a lot of parts even though I was there.
good,This company is a great place to work and they will work with you. You just have to be careful because there are people who work here that don’t want to see you succeed
good,Honestly I've been with the company 9 years now. Worked in several locations and worked my way up to a store manager position. That's the first position you actually start making any real money. Before that is honestly sad what they pay anyone. It's not enough to even scrape by.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and how to deal with customers . I also learned a lot about car parts and basic need to know stuff about the vehicle .
good,Very educational jo. You learn something new almost every day. Tight knit group of people. I enjoyed it here because it has somewhat of a family atmosphere as far as coworkers go.
good,Good experience family friendly work environment id go back with no doubt had no problems very well pay and hours guarantte over time always needed days off u got them
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, projects and duties were usually done as a team effort, keepin the store clean and stocked made it easier for customers to quickly find what they need."
good,I liked working there my boss was great there was a good crew we all got along then they hired new management and  a lot of us left because of new management
good,It's ok place to work at. I just feel like it impossible to please people though. I don't feel like I'm accomplish anything though. Other than that it is a swell place to learn parts and money handling.
good,"A yearly evaluation is the perfect time to set clear goals for your professional development. For example, if you want to progress to a higher level, you will need to take on extra tasks and prove that you have what it takes."
good,Love what I do but the pay and benefits are not very good. Company does not make employees want to help them grow. Low pay and few opportunities to advance
good,"its great , It has its ups and downs just like any other job. I came from a store in California that was ran a whole lot different then the one I transferred here in Oregon to . So its defiantly taking some getting use to"
good,Started out as rss with low pay. They are the lowest paying automotive retailers I’ve worked for. I increased my hourly pay by selling.  they are also the only commissions based auto retailer I have worked for
good,O’Reilly has help in make it to my goals. They are flexible with my hours so I can focus on my studies and produce artwork. They people are friendly and helpful.
good,My personal experience is that management talks to much. You can not go to them with any problems you may be having as they will tell everyone. They are not supportive and they do not compensate you for the things you do.
good,"Pay too low and offered 30 cents after I worked a whole year and all around and had knowledge overall the company, when I decided that I wanted to work as a part timer (just Saturday and Sunday) they just fired me with the excuse that I had a ticket from last year and they didn’t say nothing personally, what I mean by that is that I received a letter at my house it was a background check saying that I couldn’t work for them because of the ticket."
good,My employment with O'Reilly's was really a good fit for my skills and level of comfort with groups of people. However personal problems kept me from continuing.
good,This has too much corporate control and restrictions. The pay is worse than unskilled jobs in the area. I have done this type of work for many years and have been compensated a lot better than here.
good,The only real issue I have is the low pay scale. I’ve worked there for 3 years with perfect reviews and just recently achieved $10 per hour. Easy work for the most part. Aside from a unpleasant customer on occasion.
good,Good place to start off working to gain retail sales experience. You will have to work and apply yourself continuously as well as deal with coworkers and customer life
good,i like working there but management wasn't great but the people i work their with i got pretty close with and i started to like working their a lot more.
good,Good management. Decent coworkers. Low pay without commission. Decent benifets. Will work with awkward personal schedules. Small amount of room for growth. Meet new people.
good,I dont plan on returning to the company but it's a good for someone who dont mind the pay so if you just need a job with good benefits this is a good place to start.
good,I learned a lot of different skills by being able to work in different departments are well as help/ learn from them. The most enjoyable part of the job was my teammates and our ability to always work together to accomplish the company's goal daily.
good,"alright place to work, just depends on which location you are at. Some managers have their pets who only works weekdays dayshift only and who do whatever they want."
good,Good place to work if you know about auto parts or anything else idk what else i can say about this job but its a good place to work okokokokokokomokokok
good,"Oreilly auto parts is a great company to work for, it all depends who you work under.  That being said, if you are looking for a job in a store, be prepared for not great pay and taken advantage of.  If you are looking for a corporate position you will love it!"
good,"Working at O’Reilly is for the most part a pleasant experience. I began working at the DC mid 2017. I’m not gonna get into the job functions because it’s general warehouse work; you’re either good at it or worthy of kicking rocks. I have a few gripes about work here though. Firstly, be prepared to get your lungs checked out after a month or so because every part you pick will most likely come with an exaggerated amount of dust. The parts look like they came straight out of death match between Sandman and a tornado. Another complaint I have is team members with power equipment are often incompetent on how to use them. They’re either taking up the whole aisle while you’re trying to get your work done, crashing into random things, parking them in inappropriate locations or hogging the good equipment meanwhile others are stuck with equipment from the Paleolithic era, far too old for use. All in all, good entry job with decent benefits, great discount and the majority of the people are fun to work with. (But seriously be prepared to inhale more dust than the vacuum in your closet)"
good,O'Reilly auto parts is a good place for someone in school or just out of school to further their career. I would recommend this business to anyone interested in customer service field or automotive.
good,"It was a good experience overall. When upper (corporate) management changes, culture changes and so does position expectations. You can suddenly not be of value to them."
good,Not bad job but slow to give raises great discounts good work environment not great pay but laid back work environment paid vacation and benefits aren't bad
good,Good job to learn about car parts and how they work.  Good way to get retail and sales experience.  It was nice getting a portion of your sales back in your check.
good,"Store managers are personal shoppers for retail and professional customers alike. With long hours and little thanks, this job is not for everyone.  "
good,"I learned valuable management skills, and a very friendly work place for young people who doesn't have a lot of bills. After all i gained driving skill as well I achieved sells and lots of customer service ability but most of all i gained a wonderful work family that i would never forget all of the work experiences that i will never forget. Hard working effort that made me determine to always strive to great in any work place rather it's working from home or in an actual work place. Hard work does pay off."
good,A great company to work for as long as you are in school and don't expect a lot of pay. There insurance is not the best. Will work with you on scheduling
good,"The people and work are not so bad. I was the only person that worked on the floor. No one wanted to help me, so I did what I Could and deliver parts to our commercial accounts and stock shelves."
good,"O'Reilly's is a good company to work for it doesn't pay much , great opportunity but not enough for the pay, I don't think works deserve 16 cent per year for a raise"
good,It was a very good job while I was in college looking for some extra money. though there is not much chance of making a career out of it with out going to management. It is a very good first job for young people or retirees.
good,I was a hub driver at O'Reilly Auto Parts. I went to different O'Reilly stores picking up and delivering at minimum 4 times on a timed schedule. You go there and back for the entire shift. I loved the job but had a bad injury to my back and have been in physical therapy for several weeks. The pay is very low for the amount of work. Less than any fast food here or Walmart.
good,I was unhappy with alot of things. They dont care about what you have going on in your life. If it didn't help them they wouldnt put up with it. They got rid of multiple people for no reason. The management team is terrible.
good,I learned a lot just in a few months . I thought I wouldn’t get the hang of it but it was easy. I learned a lot about car parts and how they operate. The culture there was great
good,Every store was different from the last.  The one major difference was that when the store manager didn't care it was hard to get work done because other employees felt that they didn't have to do anything
good,Injured on the job to find out that they only pay for the first day of injury as far as Miss days worked and then after that it's on your own they pay for mileage back and forth to appointments and your prescription and that's it kind of sucks
good,"Wasnt the best job, was stressful at times but would be good for someone just out of high school or part time for someone in college. Would not recommend as a career."
good,i do not wish to place a review. this job was a simple job and i enjoyed being there while the time lasted. it did have good benifits and discounts on parts.
good,"O’Reilly’s is a great place to work for. Especially if you are a teen starting out, college student who needs extra money, or retiree wanting something to do other than sitting home. O’Reilly offers great benefits for temps minus medical and life. Full time employees get great benefits discounts and offers. Depending on the location of the business, the pay isn’t all that great if you are a part timer or a retail sales person."
good,Cut my pay $3 and hour when I was told that would not happen to me after transferring to a new location. It was great when I had the impression I was respected and valued. Clearly that was not the case.
good,Great place to expand your knowledge on vehicles and a nice work place to meet new people. A great place to move up business but start pay isn't much and raises are small
good,Pay was just terrible and management of the place wasn't able to make it a priority to get the money for the best workers. Most of the time the good people end up going somewhere else
good,"This is a place to work when you are getting out of high school. If you are looking for a fast moving environment, then expect it to be either the phones or the delivery drivers. Because it sure wont be a pay raise!"
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts can be a very stressful environment. You are not paid for the work you do you also are expected to do more than just your own role without a pay raise or compensation for the work you do. You are never recognized for the work you do.
good,"Management was awful, I was not properly taught and had to learn on my own basically thrown to the sharks. Most employees were awesome and friendly and others were not very pleasant."
good,It was a good job I worked very hard and everyone I worked with were always great people and it was a great work environment I also enjoyed my benefits
good,"Job was enjoyable, relaxed atmosphere, fellow employees were easy to get along with,some times fast paced store manager was willing to listen to problems and help solve issues promptly"
good,"This was a great job in the beginning; the manager was respectful,  trained you well,  didn't micromanage,  was friendly, and approachable. You get the hours you were promised,  and pay is ok with the work you do, which isn't anything crazy and out the way.  The only thing that made working there very difficult,  was the change in management and he began cutting my hours for no reason,  not being approachable,  was punished for wanting a break,  was expected to walk in the rain for two miles to work when he refused to send a ride when I didn't have one.  I had the highest sales of the cashiers and was expected to keep my results with only 15 hours a week."
good,Shifts aren't great. Managers work when they want and don't recognize hard work from employess that have been there for years. Hours aren't distributed fairly.
good,company is a good company to work for but a lot of it depends on where and who your working for. I think a manager that works in that area should have more respect for his customer's
good,"Co-workers were fun to work with. They knew their business. Management refuse to manage. They were concerned in making there bosses happy. The first inventory they took while I was there they came up $7,000.00 short. Gives you a good idea what kind of professionals they are."
good,I had a good time there the  customers really love when I was there a lot of the people work there is nice to be around just the  management is not the best
good,Working there was fun at times but so many times management lack of skills and other employees conduct makes working there stressful at times in to much. There policy on this is not kept up with thus pitting employees against each other.
good,Working for O'Reilly is okay. I work in the hub. It's the biggest O'Reilly in Memphis. We deal with alot of expensive parts. Driving is part of the job. So please have a clean driving record and f endorsements.
good,Enjoyed working here and the people that I work with but the hours and overall treatment was not what I expected and need for my family and I if there where better hours available and more pay then I would be more than willing to stay much longer but that's not the case
good,In the 5+ years I had worked there was great! Towards the end of my run with them I saw lots of changes. The company in a whole is ever growing and expanding. They have the right idea when it comes to auto parts and know how to dominate the market. But....however Tucson! Has the wrong upper management running Tucson. I felt there was no appreciation for the employees nor the store managers. There was no room to grow or breathe being micromanaged and no trust.
good,It was a very exhilarating experience I actually love working at O'Reilly's I never really had a job that I loved as much as I loved O'Reilly's the staff the employees are very helpful and friendly. My only problem was the pay rate was not livable it was under $9 an hour
good,O’Reilly Auto Parts was a fun place to work. I enjoyed helping people find the right parts for their automotive issues alongside some of the best friends which I met while working there
good,"great team to work with, an overall great environment to work in. basic commutation skills great customers. easy tasks such as welcoming customers, picking up phone calls, placing orders, and help checking people out."
good,Certain positions had room for advancement. Company was somewhat built on who you knew in the company and not as much as your knowledge of auto parts although if you did good work you could advance.
good,"O'reilly's has its upsides and has its downsides. The only that would be pertinent to bring up is that advancement opportunities are hard to claim, and the company fights you tooth and nail on any raise even yearly evaluation raises."
good,I was unhappy with some of the corporate politics that were taking place within my district. And it made it unenjoyable to work for this company. ....
good,I used to drive and deliver auto parts to Santa Barbara and milpas In Santa Barbara it was a fun job I got to meet great people that I worked with in different  locations
good,"Lazy manager who never makes the schedule on time, yells at everyone for something he brought to himself, and never actually stays at the scheduled time he made himself. Would leave whenever he felt like it. Managers should lead by example! Also if Oreillys is so family based then why are they open on Sundays and some of our major holidays? Greedy much?"
good,Worked with commercial customer to trouble shoot their automotive care needs. The most enjoyable was solving customer problems and assisting co-workers.
good,I got management training and do management task but never got promoted to a management position. I was always brought down by other member of management.
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to understand what some people want because a lot of people think you should just know and understand what people want.
good,"The role of a Parts Specialist is driven by a commission incentive, so the more you know about parts, the more money you are able to make. Be prepared to get dirty changing batteries in vehicles, wiper blades in the rain, an occasional headlamp/tail lamp, or by getting down on the ground to access an OBD port on an older vehicle. "
good,"Good place to work at it's just barely any raises especially when the company is making more money every year. They do play favorites at times, and they seem to move people up that truly don't deserve it."
good,Very relaxing work place.  Too bad they didn't offer better benefits and insurance since the pay wasn't that great.  Also working on holidays is kind of lame.
good,"This job is not unlike any other retail position available anywhere. Normal work, normal management, normal pay. I would not recommend anyone work in retail."
good,they don't follow company policies or culture. there's no equal treatment within the employees. there's favoritism with those who are friends to high managements.
good,It was alittle better working at oriellys. I was payed a bit more than minum wage so that was nice. It was pretty payed back. Since I worked nights it was slow but great.
good,The rate at which you can move up in the company was great. The pay is what was lacking for me. Full time work here can net you just enough to live at the RSS level.
good,Job is fun and challenging at times. But the pay could be better for the job that is required of you. You are pushed to make sales every month which in turn gives you a bonus but that is what they justify as to why you get paid so little hourly
good,Learned customer service from working on the counter helping customers and being a delivery driver I got to me and assist some of our local shops get their parts in a timely manner so they could keep their customers happy as well.
good,depending on what attitude there in will be how they talk and act towards us. Some are completely unbearable but have to be nice to them. also keep up
good,"Good energy dependi g in who you work with, but that's everywhere. Laid back, and the manager is good to work with. Honestly have nothing more to say in this section."
good,"Lots of room for improvement."
good,The other employees I worked with were wonderful. It was the store manager that had an attitude problem with the workers. We all tried to avoid him.The company itself is pretty good overall
good,"They hire some people that aren't to bright. it can be difficult dealing with people and sometimes it isn't run efficiently. it is just an okay job. Nothing more, nothing less."
good,"It is a great company to work for. The work is challenging but productive. The hours are demanding, how busy the store is really relies on the area that it's in."
good,"this is the perfect place to have a heart attack or stroke. stress stress and more stress. "
good,"It is a nice company to work,They do not have permanent schedule,The company have good insurance benefits.They have profit sharing and retirement programs. They have 410k for employees"
good,"One of my first retail jobs,  and I must say , it was a good place to learn about cars. I had very little experience with cars. After working there for 3 years, I became an expert in automotive parts."
good,"getting discounts on car parts was pretty cool, it was also pretty funny when people would ask for a male employee and the guy would ask me whatever the customer was asking."
good,"The O'Reilly IT department offers a great work/life balance however, that comes at a bit of a cost. While most of the people there are good people, O'Reilly is an exceedingly conservative company. That means that the IT department is viewed as a sort of second-class citizen in the O'Reilly business model. That means there are no ping-pong tables, no common 'bull-pen' areas, etc. The technology used is frequently outdated, and the wages and benefits are only about average or slightly below average. That's not to say the company is a bad company. Quite the contrary; for the right person, O'Reilly can be a dream job but it is important to understand how the company operates. Personal reviews are much more of a 'this is how much we like you' type of review rather than a reward for individual performance. The job is easy however and it is very rare that you would ever have to stay late. Raises happen about once per year and generally are about equivalent to the cost of living increases. Promotions do happen, but O'Reilly seems to promote people more as a means to transition people to a new pay rate as opposed to how well someone may actually perform the job. Again, this is an example of promoting the people that are well liked. Along the same lines, O'Reilly seems to have their own way of doing things that is frequently bizarre. Again, not a bad thing, just something to keep in mind if rational reasoning is your thing. Not to put too fine of a point on this but the saying that is repeated around the office is that ""there is the right way, the wrong way, and the O'Reilly way"" and"
good,Upper district management is not worker friendly. Fun dealing with the customer base. Built a great crew who knew their jobs and enjoyed working together.
good,The employees are fun to work with and you get the opportunity to meet new and interesting people who could one day become valuable connections someday.
good,Making relationships with the good customers. Some of the customers were bad. The company is going down because under staff. But I still enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,Work load is kind of crazy for the little pay the company pays. Decent employee's but management could use some help. Favortism seems to be an issue no matter what store you go to.
good,It was a fun place to work fast paced especially during tax season really enjoyed working there but it was time to move on really friendly customers and employees
good,"The store has its handful of customers that come in, but alot of the time it's just standing around and waiting for customers to walk in. Only paid 8.50 an hour"
good,its alright     not great pay or hours. but its not the hardest job. you need to be a store manager to get the money and benefits. open to late for auto parts.
good,"Analyzed the operation of the department and provides technical assistance to the employees of automobile parts."
good,It’s an ok job.  I wasn’t happy with the management.  The overall workers were pleasant. Any complaints made to the company never get taken care of. They seem to cater to management instead of employees.
good,"Worked hard, not appreciated. The customers are sometimes rude and management does not stand firm with difficult customers when needed. The sale was more important."
good,"Several managers were there in my time of employment. The last manager came in with a chip on her shoulder and didn't want to follow through with how things had been running and tried to change everything all at once. She basically had a ""it's my way or the highway"" attitude."
good,I worked 6 days a week about 96 hours every 2 weeks last time I had a vacation was 2 and a half years ago.  I kind of got stress out with the job . I started to take it. Out on the drivers. They had to let me go
good,a typical day at work is helping customers answering phone calls and delivering parts. i would sell customers the parts they needed install wiper blades
good,Ive been with oreilly for about 3 Years with a small gap between year 2 and 3. The job is fun and your coworkers are generally decent people with the bad apple thrown in. Your pay is up and down based on the location of your store and how busy it is due to the job having commission. However the pay still sucks no matter what. You can usually make more money flipping burgers are McDonald's than you can make working at oreilly.
good,Welcomed me in with open arms even though i had little to no knowledge about their products. Offered great opportunity to advance in within the company.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a public trade company. Therefore they set high goals for their shareholders which becomes a challenge for all store managers to meet goals.
good,"The clientele were top notch.  For the most part, the management were great.  However, because i was a knowledgeable woman in a man's world, the district manager seemed to be threatened by me.  He tried to fire me quite a few times and my store manager wouldn't let him.  Eventually he fired me and wrote up the store manager for not signing my termination papers."
good,"This location was one of the busiest in all of Oregon. Averaged over 300k/month in sales with a staff of only 14, including drivers. As assistant manager, I was rersponsible for opening the store, bank deposits, employee issues, etc..."
good,"Basically focused on driving more it was busy "
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is just like any other retail store; your hours are going to come with how busy or slow the store is, you're going to struggle to get time off for family or personal issues that pop up last moment, etc. That said, I've worked in three different stores and for the most part the environment is pretty chill and most of the people you work with are going to have personalities that are a lot like yours."
good,"I worked at Oreillys while in college, they did not take my schedule into consideration when creating my work schedule even though they said they'd schedule me around class."
good,Upper management in some districts do not seem to have the same core values and job culture that the company promotes. They can make it very hard to work there.
good,typical work day is hard I had to be there at 5:30 clean up any mess that's in the work area then set up for the first truck that has to be out before 8:00 management was ok not really great hardest part was trying to get trucks out on time with little help
good,"Don't expect management to fight for you, but other than that, they were a great company to work for! Good place to work for the right person! Would recommend!"
good,"Working is fun , meet people good place for a car guy or girl , lots of knowledge by team members and customers. great discounts on quality products and most things given a money back or replacement guarentee"
good,"Productively busy workplace up beat , great pay and ability to move up .The company offers good benefits and bonuses .The opportunity to learn other departments"
good,"O'Riellys does not pay their employees enough to do what they do.  Their management structure leaves a lot to be desired.  Not the managers themselves, but how they are treated and paid."
good,"Its a place to work. Period.Managers frequently trash talked other managers and departments."
good,After dedicating myself to O’Reily’s for 6 years I don’t even make $9 per hour.  If management was more willing to fight for its dedicated workers this would be a good job.
good,"I've worked at 5 different stores and as long as you have a good team, experienced and fair managers its a great fun place to work. Like any retail job there are customers that can be a challenge."
good,"very good working environment, the team members are very helpful and assistant to one another, the company offer great benefits and stock options. jobs are transferable."
good,Orelly is can be a Very competitive and lots of over time. There just wasn't much room for advancement. Other than that it was a pretty cool place to work.
good,Oreilly's was a great company but the location I was at did not have the best management nor stability. People were constantly coming and going making it hard to have a stable work environment at the time
good,My job was to make sure that all of the inventory in the store was correct and if not to find the merchandise or fix it in the computer and write a statement to corporate if there was theft
good,Very slow paced. Customers can get on your nerves with being rude. It's a flexible job. Easy being a cashier. Late hours can be a drag when no one is there.
good,"Paying for warrantys, ungrateful customers, lost parts. Job placement is a joke unless your a master mechanic. Friendly staff. The customer isnt always right!"
good,Not ever very busy and most of the time the customers already know what they need so finding the parts they need is usually pretty easy and straight forward.
good,"My love of cars made it very easy to work at O'reilly, The workplace was familiar and the people were for the most part easy to work with as well. The managers and employees were very personable as well."
good,good workplace for high school i would like to move on the management sucks at this time and i have no bearing on the decision making even though i have been there longer than everyone but my manager
good,it was a good place to work but didnt pay a whole lot but good people to work with at the time i dont think i would go back tho the staff there now are not to friendley
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts intends to overwork its employees for low pay and has the highest expectations in its field. The employee turnover is among the highest.
good,"At my location no room for full time position. It was in a farm related community , so handling hydraulic hoses for farm equipment was anall new learning experience. Retail sales was my biggest accoplishm ent. Overall good place to work"
good,"They did not pay you for what you gave, I should have been paid a whole lot more for the jobs I did , extremely fast paced , part of me is glad to get out"
good,"I started my employment with promises to have opportunities to advance. I learned many things very quickly and was recognized multiple times. However, I have never received any type of raise in pay nor position, even though they were requested and recommended several times. A lot of discrimination and harassment happens from the District Manager and he has forced many good employees, including but not limited to Store Managers, to quit instantly regardless of being with the store for 8 to 10 years. Not a great place to work. Stressful, fast paced, demanding environment with very low pay or respect as human beings."
good,"good place to work for beginners learning about cars. the management can be a little lack luster at times, but other then that, good place and good environment"
good,My experience at O'Reilly auto parts was temporary and a different experience outside my 20 years in automotive repair.  I took this job to see what it was like being on the other end of the phone i.e selling parts rather than ordering parts.
good,"Everyday was a different challenge but in a good way, helping customers trying to fix there car problems. I had the  privilege of meeting some good coworkers Working at this company that I’m still friends to this day"
good,"learned how to deal with multiple types of personalities, and how to give the best customer service to the customer in a timely fashion. Also learned how to rely on my coworkers to help me with rude customers."
good,Understand the work ethnic of team work and customer service. Helps you explore the knowledge of automotive and meeting customers needs. It is a hard working pace.
good,"In the beginning it was great, good fun people to work with, lots of hours, plenty of work, not the best on pay although, after 5 years of hard work and dedication, and plenty of praise for it, I quit because of the fact they would not pay more than 9.75 per hour"
good,always busy fast paced place to work good management learn something new everyday. build great customer relationships. advancement within company is always encouraged. team players
good,"As a delivery driver you have a set schedule 8 hours a day sometimes over time is available, weekends off. Easy system to work with, but the pay rate is just to low."
good,"its a good start for younger people to get experience as to how the world works, getting contacts and setting up a work history. my positing isn't really set up to live off of."
good,Very educational for those wanting to get into the Automotive industry and a fast paced work environment. Benefits are very good but the pay is not very good. Commission is pretty good if you sell a lot and stay focused.
good,"-	Auto parts Delivery "
good,I enjoyed helping customers find the products they were searching for and giving them great customer service. Stocking shelves was interesting and helped me learn where the parts were when someone was looking for them.
good,"Typical day consisted of: opening the store, checking daily and weekly sales numbers, managing commercial accounts and hiring/training new sales associates. Hardest part of the job was being forced to hire under qualified parts specialists. Best part of the job was the discounts."
good,"Wasn't there long enough to make a comment on the business. I would recommend them for part time work. easy to do, kind folks to work with, you know the routine."
good,It's a nice place to work I just did not agree with how the general manager would talk to my co-workers. I never experience the problem but I witness it a few times. I would love to work for them again if they would offer more pay and full time position.
good,"Since former CFO and CEO have retired I feel the company is taking a different direction which contradicts the current company culture.  O'Reilly has been good to me and my family, I hope that with this new leadership they don't forget what has made this company successful over the years.......it's people!"
good,if you need a job for a little bit its a great company to start with. if you like it and want to stay with them for a long period of time theres a lot of different positions to work for
good,It is not a bad place to work. The only issues i have with this particular location is the climate control is kinda difficult during certain seasons and also the HR manager is not professional and is very rude.
good,"It was alright I guess. Where I worked, my manager never really wanted to provide me work hours, he just told me he would call me. So one time, I decided to show up and he got mad at me for not calling him, and told me to wait when he calls me. So I decide to wait until i got a call from him, he hasn't called, it's been almost a year"
good,"Relatively easy work. The retail environment could be moderately stressful when understaffed. Overall, would recommend as a part-time job for students."
good,Hard job to work at. You better be ready to lift bend stack and stand for hours.  knowledge is important here at this job. If your limited on auto knowledge this is not for you.
good,"people i worked with were friendly but never looked out for our best interests, management was nice but promised things that could not be given in order to try and keep people happy"
good,This was a fun place to work and learn. The customers were great most of the time. Co-workers were decent. The management for this store was lacking in certain ways.
good,"O'Reilly is a great place to work. They have great culture values and great people. However, the salary pay is ridiculously low for how many hours a store manager puts in. The goals and expectations are pretty much unattainable, we try hard though."
good,"Fast-paced environment at this location. Customers usually lined up waiting for doors to open. High-volume customer base with heavy customer service needs. Ability for unlimited commissions based on add-ons and up-sales. On-going educational opportunities via weekly on-line training modules. Good arena for honing multi-tasking skills. Store management approachable and skilled at delegating and designating job requirements and responsibilities. Team members worked well together, for the most part, and were willing to assist one another as needed. An updated computer system would be an asset allowing for easier access to customers' prior sales records when dealing with returns and warranties. Interacting with large numbers of customers makes the day enjoyable, but also makes the day seem to pass all too quickly at times."
good,"Nothing special about the company. Tho the discounts for parts working there was nice to help me finish some car projects at home."
good,Good company but management would do their job had employees that harassed and bullied and screamed at other employees and the manager would no do anything about it
good,Excellent equipment fun day at work management could have been better more cooperative salary could have been more had to move to help a sick relative with their own business
good,Oriellys is an auto part store. In the right location can recieve a good about of customers. It's a somewhat simple job to have. With the right management the store can run smoothly.
good,At first it's awesome to work with the company. When it comes to discipline they suck. Advancements are not garenteed and neither are pay raises. When promised something they wait 6 months to a year before following through.
good,"this job has its ups and downs, it is stressful and really depends on who your working with. some management is good, and some management should not be there because it is harmful to the work environment. i don't feel like the company takes it rules and regulations seriously and is constantly trying to do someone a solid by helping them keep their job when they don't deserve it."
good,"This may be specific to Greenville NC, but the pay of the people both above me and below me was abysmal. The District Manager at the time was trying to pinch pennies and was putting a lot of stress on management to pay less and less. In my time there I barely got a cost of living raise and was frequently given more and more responsibility. That being said, my manager at the time was one of the best I ever had. I learned a lot from him and did not blame him for pressures placed on him by upper level management."
good,Working at O'Reilly's was an enjoyable job except for the fact that I was working more hours than I could handle. I was a full time student who was sheduled to work part-time but I ended up working 50+ hours per week.
good,"a typical day: perform vehicle maintenance inspection - keep truck clean inside and outside. complete truck log and maintenance book."
good,The culture here is very good. The management and pay are not where they should be. If your a slacker and stand around this is the place for you. If you have standards and a good work ethic it will frustrate you very much.
good,unknown end time to shift
good,I liked working there because of the fun interactive environment that existed there at that time. It was always nice to spend a day helping customers to make the best decision possible while learning valuable management skills.
good,Only good as temporary job. Too difficult to move up in the company. The actual work is nice as long the people you work with are good to get along with.
good,I love the people that work for me and the people I work with.  I no longer like who I work for.  The company has culture values example honesty excellent customer service expense control ECT. It would be nice if they actually live by them.  The raise are a joke for supervisors and there is so much inconsistent.  It was great place to get the experience and take it to a company that will pay you for how well you really do.  They say people don't leave companies the leave their supervisor but in my experience I'm leaving both.  I really hope they can turn it around it was not always like this.  Start doing what you say and say what you mean.  Raise the pay for supervisors and treat people with respect and you'll be great again.
good,"This was a very fast-paced work environment. On top of regular pay, you did get paid a percentage on how much sales in parts you had for the month. This was a very nice perk."
good,I worked afternoons shifts and I asked to be switched over to Morning shifts and they told me I wasn't  able to go in morning shifts because to many people working morning at the time so i switched jobs
good,"Eh, it's okay. Easy work, but they do not have anything together when it comes to management and employment. Do not expect to have a life, unless you're a driver or management position."
good,While I do like helping my customers the lack of support for the lower level team members by the upper middle and upper management is quite disturbing.
good,"They hire anybody with a pulse weather they have auto parts experience or not, Im actually not sure how some of these people get jobs here, or anywhere for that matter"
good,Productive and opportunistic environment. Organized layout of both sales floor and stock floor. Everything was easy to find to better assist customers.
good,"I has just retired from working in the Racing circuit, and was actually looking for work that suited my skills more than an auto parts store, so it kept my mind occupied while I looked for more appropriate employment."
good,"Took care of customer calls, orders for delivery. Took care of customers in store for looking up parts ext. Everyone should be able to drive for company in case delivery driver is out sick. Excellent health care benefits but low overall wages compared to other part stores."
good,i enjoyed working there but due to a shoulder injury i was not able to go back to work there and was trying to recover from my shoulder surgery i did enjoyed the work
good,Provided customer service through the safe and efficient delivery of parts/products to     professional customers using a company provided vehicle. great place to work
good,"Good place to work for beginners in automotive industry, discounts word great paid vacation sick pay everything was offered really appreciate my learning experience there."
good,"Could be a fun place to work, but not really a place you can call your future career. It's a good place for someone who's beginning to work, but not for someone with work experience. I'd say the pay is okay but could be better especially if you've been there long enough. However overall it's a fun place to work and very flexible schedules are offered."
good,Cool every day meeting helping customers getting the right products to customers to best of my ability and learning how to speak different languages is great.
good,"the customer always came first so sometimes i would have to stay later tan usual to tend to them, this is somewhat of a retirement job so i has to work with people who were well over my age."
good,Putting time and proactively on employee makes their situation even more overwhelming and stressful especially when we are experiencing a tough time at home.
good,"Come in at work, wait for commercial accounts to call and place order for auto parts. Then take and drive auto parts to commercial accounts across the city. Learned a lot about auto parts and the auto part industry. The hardest part of the job is when the weather changes and inclement weather causes issues on the road. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with fellow drivers."
good,"On a typical day, expect long hours. 10 -14 hours a day.. The break room is state of the art. The people are family orientated. Productivity and attendance is big in order to getting raises."
good,"this company does not pay well, an when you try to leave they tell you what you want to hear but they do not follow up on their promise,this company is good for kids that are still living at home or some in school an needing a little income, not for someone trying to make a living on their salary.."
good,"This company sells car parts, short and simple.  Their biggest profit makers are the people behind the counter looking to push the most profitable items simply because the average customer doesn't know any better.  As someone who has had to do drastic things to save money while working on their own car, I was able to pass that knowledge onto the customers.  I was not kept around by the company as I was not one that brought in the dough to the high-rollers."
good,Good place for new employees to gain work experience in the automotive industry for selling automotive parts in the retail business. Good opportunity for advancements.
good,As a short term job Oreillys is perfect but if you are looking for a career then look elsewhere. The hours are crazy and the pay does not justify the amount of stress that this job carries.
good,this job is very goal oriented. if u love cars and know a lot about them this would love to work with this company. with this job you are able to move up with init.
good,iam not typing anything in this box.I think that the box is not needed for what i considered this for and not typing a reviewlsorry not going to happen
good,Oriellys is a fun environment to be in. There’s always people around you to help you understand things if you can’t get the hang of things. All around real good people.
good,not a bad job if you are looking for something that is fun and you get to meet a lot of different people. the only problem with this job is the pay its not enough for what they want you to do
good,ok place to work. great discounts. customers are dumb though. and its hard working with people who know nothing about cars LOL my coworkers were no mechanically inclined.
good,"Long days for managers, some time there are call offs and no people to cover that shift. so the manager had to cover the shift. worked every other weekend."
good,"fast paced environment, automotive experience needed, management is fairly ok but not the greatest and excellent customer service and being a people person is a plus"
good,"Great job if you like to deal with jerks. Upper management don't really care what you say or think, as long as they get their work don't. I loved working there but I got messer over at the end"
good,"What ever you think. Too many questions. Do you want me to come to work or not. Not sure I understand any of the Questions, Just typing stuff to fill in the box."
good,A great place to work fast paced lots of great people always something to do never a dull moment so so pay leaning towards a great future this is the place to work.
good,On a typical day you go in and help finish stocking the shelves from the freight that day. Help customers both in person and on the phone. At the end of your shift you count down your register. My manager wasn't very good but my co workers made up for that. The hardest part was definitely the freight because at my particular store the merchandiser was terrible so there was alot to be done. The most enjoyable part was definitely the discount.
good,The department I worked in was very high stress with an overwhelming amount of work to do every day.  It was difficult to get time off or be sick.  The company just didn't allow much sick time so employees came to work sick and spread it around to everyone else.  Most of the people there were friendly enough but management was not.  The managers had their favorites and if you weren't one things weren't as pleasant for you.  The companies idea of perks was allowing us to wear jeans on Friday.
good,"opened store"
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Sale associate job is really demanding and fast paced answering phone calls while helping customers in front of you, delivery driver is fun driving to commercial shops helping them out on what parts they need and of course not inside store all the time."
good,"I worked with some great people there.  They really don't pay that well at all.  You sure can learn a lot, and I did, but there isn't much room for advancement.  Also they put most of their employees to part time to not offer benefits after the healthcare reform act."
good,"Ok place to work . Alot of lifting heavy auto parts such as car batteries, boxes of motor oil etc.  Driving alot.  People can call in on you when driving,  because of 800 number on back of vehicles and their not always honest when they call in."
good,"good job, atmosphere not to bad pay is poor, managers are hit or miss. customers are cranky when they need parts. i have nothing else to say but  need charterer requirements."
good,"O'reilly as a whole, is a good company. The parts are greta and prices aren't bad either. But the treatment of employees and others is another story. The store and district experience that I had was not good. the hours are very inconsistent and the pay was not worth the stress of the job."
good,during the  time i was there i was able to learn alot and as a driver i didnt get too much pressure. the people i worked with were very helpful and worked as a team. the hardest part was the traffic but other than that its very simple.
good,Oreilly is a nice job from a benefit stand point but the pay is low and at the local I worked at upper management wasn't helpful. Only when upper management is gone do you feel like part of a team and tasks actually get accomplished. I do enjoy the discount on auto parts and the customers. Always hear interesting stories from customers.
good,Good hourly pay for simple work. Routes are set for most drivers so you know what to expect each night. Poor communication skills from management. Top down communication needs to be improved to keep good drivers
good,The customers are the best part of the job. The management has their ups and downs like any job. Most of the coworkers are like family. The computer systems are easy to learn but finding the parts is the hard part.
good,"better training before a person is put on the floor to sale and ring up sales, better staffing needs to be in place at all times, better communication."
good,its a job. You know what is expected wich is nice. I dont know what else to saw but aperently i need 150 charecters so i will continue untill it lets me get on with my life because why make me write more than i want but hey thats life these days huh?
good,assist customers in locating the correct auto parts for their vehicles. balance end of day receipts and make out deposit slips. keep shelves stocked with merchandise.
good,".Management is required 50 hrs in the week and not flexible, Hours are long and not flexible. Stress level is not worth the level of pay given for management."
good,I had this job to basically keep me from getting bored. I did not want to sell auto parts for the rest of my life. Everyone I worked with was so friendly and helpful. This would be a great position for a high school student.
good,Good place to work. Pays decent. People are relaxed. Good benefits. Part-time position and full-time position. Easy to transfer from stores. Plenty of positions available.
good,"Just started with the company.  Have not been there long enough to give a solid answer."
good,I have in auto parts for thirty years I like helping the cust9 and learning about the and working with my coworkers you can learn a lot from emplo9 and customer
good,Stay focused. It wasn't as bad as you may think. Coworkers were fairly nice and easy to work with. Work conditions were good and the workload was fairly reasonable.
good,Very slow paced place to work meet a lot of people from the community in which you work great to learn all of the computer skills and parts that you sold
good,"there were some good days and there were some bad days. there were times that I felt like I was being treated unfairly, but it was a job and I had mouths to feed."
good,"i worked there for 6 moths but after that i needed a faster pace job, i wasnt satisfied with my position at o'reillys so i left and found something that would suit me best"
good,"just delivering parts to customers on a typical day and getting to no people,management was ok nothing hard about the job,enjoyed working with others while there"
good,"Good job to work, I delivered auto parts to all types of auto shops meeting different people everyday. I had good coworkers to work with around the store"
good,It was a job that got me through school but eventually I got pretty bored. There wasn't much room for advancement and the raises were only 2% (2% of $10.00 is only $0.20 and at 20 hours per week that's only and additional $4 a week).
good,"Very little advancement, no opportunities. Very poor payment. as management there is no work life. Commercial management is underapreciated, unvalued and underpaid."
good,Not paid enough for the amount of work we had to do. We were forced to work almost 50 hours a week because we were shorthanded because they refused to hire except for certain positions
good,open or close  the store help customers find the parts they needed. restiock the sheveles . Deliver parts to customers. made sure store was clean.I had good coworkers to work with
good,It's normally slow but can be hectic at times.  Can be a fun place to work but takes a year to get full time benefits. That's the only downfall. Overall I like working here.
good,"You only get a raise when your store manager feels you should get one. Stays pretty busy, but also can be extremely slow at times. Pay is not for someone who needs to provide for a family UNLESS you have life long experience in the parts business. Men get paid more than women and women do the same work if not more than men."
good,Oreilly's is a good workplace for anyone that is interested in an entry-level job that is incorporated with the automotive industry. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with and customers are generally not rude at all.
good,"When I started four years ago I did't even know what an alternator did. The teams throughout my time here have been good and bad but overall a workplace where everyone helps you to succeed whether in parts knowledge, applications or running store functions."
good,"The customer traffic depends on the day and area. besides the needy customers, its an ok job, no complaints, Steady pace, May have to go outside some times for customers. They let you have a credit line with them if you been with them for over a year"
good,Great pay. Fast past work environment. Lots of advance ment opportunities. People are great to work with. Always stay busy no matter what day it is.plus a lot of benefits.
good,As a manager you are expected to complete more tasks per day than there is time for and it makes for a stressful environment. entry level positions are underpaid so there is a high turn over rate.
good,"At my store, there wasnt enough bodies to fill in when someone needed a day off. This was not a hard job at all, had plenty of fun working there. Unfortunately being in the customer service field you had to deal with all sorts of negative, and angry people. They could have more decent employees if they paid a little more."
good,This placed Changed after awhile from friendly to sales quotas. doing returns from other stores cost you commission and the upper management really didn't tell you what was going on.
good,One of the best jobs I've ever had I liked helping the customers and the regular job duties  the discount for parts is good as an employee also pay could be better
good,"This is the perfect job for a student with a bust schedule, the compensation could be a lot better. However, this is not hard work or technical so it is understandable."
good,"* busy day for delivering parts"
good,"This ace you can grow at, do your job work hard and be consistent and you can move up as far as you want too, people there are helpful and will guide you how to move up"
good,O Reilly is a better competitor in auto parts however it does feature pros and cons. You are expected to sell sell sell. Environment is stressful and you surely need to be knowledgeable. Longer work hours than competitors. We are open later. Take it with a grain of salt. It's not a forever job in my eyes.
good,Job was temporary and I need stability and job security in which I could not get at this job. It was a great workplace but I just needed something full-time.
good,"If you are interested in automotive and want to start getting a deeper understanding on how a car works this place is great! Although, it can be High School all over again having and maintaining a specific crew in favor even if your not part of it."
good,"A typical day at O'Reilly Auto includes hard work and dedication. Everyone is included in the day to day activities including sales, cash handling, freight check in and putting away. It is a great place to further your career in the sales of car parts if you are willing to put in the time it takes."
good,"A typical work summer day its more busy then winters. In the summer it can get so busy sometimes you might not want to take a lunch break, specially as a delivery driver. Do to delivery's pilling up. Employees are very friendly and helpful. Management is very helpful and reasonable about schedule's. Also what's hard about the job is you do get new stock everyday and sometimes a lot of it. Also employees must be able to lift at least 60lbs."
good,"I enjoy oreillys, great company to work for, a large corporation with a small town feel, great upper management and good programs, great incentive options as well"
good,"It's an auto parts store. High speed, high volume, with plenty of customers to keep you busy. Usually too busy, as upper management (Regional) throws higher and higher arbitrary upsell pitches to you, when dealing with this area's customers, they dont want to spend any more than they absolutely have to."
good,"It was a flexible job, it did not give many hours which was not good, the management was not organized , the store needed more inventory in order to get more clients"
good,"If you want to learn about car parts, this would be a good opportunity to learn about what each part is and how much they cost on average. You can also get into contact & network with mechanics to better learn how to properly manage your car. Once you learn the automotive lingo, you can then proceed further with how to better suit your car with specific parts and or brands."
good,Good place for retired or your first job someone with a lot of patience good automotive experience and computer skills part time or a second job this would be great for you
good,i gainwd a lot of knowledge of auto parts at this job. was able to apply much of that knowledge into problems outside of work. pay was not the best best for responsiblities put on employees
good,"O'Reilly's is a good job to get experience within customer service. They expect you to commit 100% but they are difficult to work with school schedules or special accommodations (ie, kids)."
good,"I really cannot comment on how this company is now. I'm sure with the changes in management in each store, the environment is much more pleasant than what I had experienced years ago,"
good,"Loved delivering parts. However"
good,"wont ay you your worth, wont offer full time, never staffed right, managers act like its a party center, not a great job but enough to get by, good luck"
good,Can be a good place to work if the managers know what they're doing. Generally they don't though so it makes it very difficult to get anywhere in the company without personally half killing yourself.
good,"I enjoy working at O'Reilly Auto Parts and my co-workers are some of the best I've ever worked alongside.  I would recommend it to someone looking for part-time employment, like a student in college."
good,"Runs like a well oiled machine, though I wish I could say that for  the vehicles that are used. Focus more on the money instead of flowing safety procedures"
good,Is a team based job where is doesn't take you long to feel like you are part of the O'Reilly family. Fast paced day that flies by and you get to get out of the building when you are a driver.
good,"This job was very laid back, not to the point of no work getting done just the environment was laid back. I learned a lot about cars during my tenure and have furthered my knowledge since."
good,"pharmacuetical production line, fast  paced, meeting quotas, management was awesome, always inquiring, always showed concern,  mgt was very professional. the work place culture was awesome, all walks of life was truly treated equal and respected. nothing was hard as long as you had a team that was on the same page as you. the most enjoyable part was just doing my job."
good,The jobs of fine but the paid could be alittle higher. Sometimes it seem as if we are under staff. I don't work too many hous. I only work nights and when I work it isn't busy.
good,Had a good time here but made the mistake of transferring for more money. My location was also a factor in my move.  There were no stores near my wife's place and we decided she was better to stay at here position than me.
good,"At first it was an enjoyable work environment. It quickly became unsettling and exasperating. No sense of direction by management, favoritism highly caused many problems and the environment turned into hostility."
good,did not care for the company. no promotion was giving and minimum wage was base pay. a lot of changes in the upper office that always caused problems which caused issues
good,"If you know vehicles, this is a very easy job. The hardest part is having to deal with the public community.  If you have a competitive approach to sales, then you are able to make more based on commission."
good,This is a fun place for most people to work. My experience as management is that they pile on more work that can be done in the hours that we are paid for.
good,Usually co-workers were good. Upper management sucks. This place is a revolving door for most people. The job is pretty easy-I moved up fast just because I'm a hardworker; I didn't necessarily know everything about cars.
good,there was a few times the managers got in fights with some of my coworkers and it was all very immature but other than that it was very nice the pay wasn't very good though
good,Was offered more money to work at O'Reilly's coming from Auto Zone but was given no chance of advancement. Manager of laughed when I asked about the promotion
good,"Great benefits retirement plan and discounts. Cons: limited home life, you end up pulling other people weight, favoritism and not enough accountability"
good,"Not a bad job if you like physical labor, days can be very repetitive though. Great people to work with minus some management. Compensation is low for the amount of work put in. Plus scheduling is based on shipment volume so you never know how many hours you'll be working."
good,I only worked there for a month so I don't have much I can say. The people who worked there were nice enough and if you know what you're doing you can get a lot of commision
good,Long hours on your feet few breaks.Hard to get your lunch in after 1st shift has left for the day.Dont follow through with promises. Low pay.Good place for young people to start.Not recommended for experienced personal.
good,not a bad job if you like searching for parts. coworkers were fun to work with management was easy to get along with its an alright place to be but not a long term career
good,"In Fairbanks, work was busy and constant. Opportunity to learn new things were abundant from staff and several regular customers. I started being near completely ignorant of the workings of most vehicles or how to identify particular issues. After the time spent with the staff of that store and some of the locals I've become quite comfortable with the tasks at hand. I don't know everything there is but navigating the process is smooth and teachable. Its difficult to work with.. Entitled Staff, but there are many tasks to do day to day. the most pleasing part of the job is having a set of regulars pleased with with performance and adding business to the company."
good,Delivering parts and picking up invoices for payments. Learned ho to help on the counter and find parts for customers. Did not really enjoy the other employers much.
good,ok job I love it I was a delivery driver I delivered parts to different shops got to drive all day the best part the management was great friendly people always made you feel welcome. learned to be greatful
good,oreilly auto parts is a great place to learn and grow if you are trying to get into retail automotive.  They train you well and dont expect you to be able to build a car from scratch like some other auto retailers.
good,O'Reilly aim to please their customers. I have learned a  little more about cars parts and cars. Management  and team members work so hard with the customers. The most enjoyable moment is when you can help people
good,Management is underpaid and over worked. Often this results in lashing out at employees that are not completely to blame for a particular issue. Lower employees are often thrown under the bus to make a customer happy even though the employee was following company policy.
good,"Loved oreillys until new management took over, ruined the whole atmosphere for working for them. but besides the new management its a fun and friendly environment to be around"
good,"I would have had a better experience if my manager would have been better to be around. Management was a drag. But driving was nice, liked the auto shops."
good,It's really calm not too crazy like any other retail stores. Hours are really good. Commission really great when it comes to selling the products. Starting pay is fair.
good,They are a locally owned family business. They overall are a great company but are not fair to employees. They have great food and a great reputation.
good,They make you work long hours with not such a good pay. They  make you do more then what your job description is. Management is not the greatest. I would not recommend for long term employment.
good,"Oreilly is an ok company to work for, but as with any retail company they tend to take advantage of the good, hard working employees. Though I am happy there it can be very stressfull."
good,Unstable management ruless seem to change based on current management questionable if you will get your lunch or not or max hours unless you are assistant manager or higher
good,Working at this place was a blast.. You meet new people everyday and things will change at a drop of a dime so be prepare for change...
good,"Allowed to take initiative, gives acknowledgement for achievements and rewards employees regularly.  Reliable employment. for years to come.  Concrete company"
good,"Not a difficult position and coworkers were friendly, however, poor management made for a not so inviting work atmosphere."
good,"When a shipment arrives I unload the shipment, scan the products into the store inventory then stock the shelves.  One frustrating point is when the products are not secured correctly or damaged in transit, then it is harder to organize the product while controlling the inventory process."
good,Time of arrival is the best day. Just to be able to go to work and learn new things. Working at that company will teach you the meaning of warehouse end parts specialist
good,"If you produce revenue your job is secure, failing to hit targets severely impacts your check. Strong culture, good delivery system. Scheduling can be an issue"
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and employees, delivering parts all day long in decent company vehicles. The management team does need to be overhauled and they could offer uniforms."
good,"From the time I was there, 6 months, you only get to move up if the Store Manager likes you. If he doesn't like you, you'll work harder, get sent home early, even if there is work to be done, will have one of his associates call you an hour or so before your shift to tell you not to come to work."
good,"They have nice hours to work during the day, I learned more about auto parts and cars and trucks and what it take to keep your vehicle running good, they teach people how to keep job safety and proper stock in the work place. Theirs nothing really hard about the job, driving around the city and enjoying the outside air and dealing with the nice customers is the most enjoyable time I had on the job."
good,"Deliver, order and sometimes pick up parts from warehouse or drive to other locations. Set up and rearrange displays in store."
good,It was a vet fun experience I had the best co workers but my magnate was very bad at schudeling me I would be at the hockey rink and he would ask me if I was coming in and I have him a calander of when I was in able to work and he would still schudule me over those days
good,"management need simprovement"
good,Company is a solid growth company.  They have a promote from within philosophy.  Typical work day is hectic dealing with the general public.  Great Team Members.
good,"Worked with great people, worked 8 to 5, delivering auto parts, making noon runs to Chico, the hardest part of this job was lifting rotors, there isn't much to write about this place it was great the people were great sometimes I miss them and the job"
good,wish they wouldnt have been changing the companies so much as they where changing inventory go worst but the schedule was nice worked with good people
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the smile and sense of happiness on the customer's faces after the work was perform. Just entering into the parking lot let's us know they trust us.
good,"busy fun and fast past meet new people everyday, facing cleaning stocking get new and different inventory every other week. deliveries are mad on time"
good,Was a decent job. Long hours. Little pay. Little responsibility. High turnover rate. Very little employee direction.
good,"objective was customer service, stock orders daily, light janitorial work, management pressure to up sale, co workers very helpful"
good,"Excellent training. a good job for hourly employees."
good,"I particularly enjoy the merchandising aspect of the job.  The way O'Reilly's maintains its inventory, customer purchases and rewards its employees is exemplary."
good,"Sales People tend to be somewhat ""cut throat"" some more than others. Management was willing to work with personal schedule most of the time."
good,Work life balance cannot be a priority if you work here. Weekends are the peak time and if full time you will work the majority of them.
good,You can learn a lot about cars there and they are very willing to teach. Good people at the one I worked at though the higher ups such as DM or higher can be annoying at times.
good,"As retail goes, its a good company. As with all retail environments, it depends on the individual store manager. You can climb the corporate latter, but there isn't much compensation increase as you climb"
good,job duties are pretty fair but i constantly feel pressured to meet sales quotas as if my job is on the line if i dont meet epectations.
good,"a lot of work. little play time management sucked and very little pay"
good,Learned customer service skills. A typical day at work is merchandising and answering telephones to assist with customer needs. Management is flexible with scheduling.
good,"a typical day with costumes that make your day miserable sometimes "
good,"Always had an exciting day at work, there was never a dull day that I can recall. I learned a lot about retail and about automotive because they trained me on those things in a way that was easy to understand."
good,"management is crooked, does not price match like they advertise. not a very fair company. customers can no longer just buy parts, were forced to pester them with rewards cards and have to sell them a related product with almost every purchase"
good,Good job for customer service and helping those in need. Hours are reasonable but the pay could be more. Good Benefits including the employee discount and the ability to make connections with the local garages to find help to fix your own vehicles.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, however the company could not offer me enough hours to stay with them. The job did enable me to get more acquainted with the surrounding areas."
good,Job security has been good can transfer all around the county. You deal with lots of different kinds of people not only in coworkers but in customers. Not all my experiences are good but over all there are worse places to work.
good,It's a ok place to work you can learn a lot at a place of auto parts. I like to see people happy after I have helped them find what they where looking for .
good,"It was an 'okay' temporary job. I liked being a delivery driver but it was hard sometimes because I didn't get trained well, or shown where to deliver parts."
good,a good company to work for in which allowed employees a chance to be promoted & learn along the way. I likes the work uniforms in which are very casual. The Orielly tech team was always there to help when any problems occurred.
good,used to be a good company to work for. to many hours and very stressful. seemed you had to be on call 24/7..If someone called in sick you had to cover. the company expected to much from one person.
good,good place to work fast paced and like every job you have you funny moments get to know car parts what they do and what are they for
good,"I would recommend this job to any car enthusiast because it could be very educational. They seem to offer some sort of account you can purchase your parts and pay down the sum over time which is nice for the employees who qualify for that. They also seem to be doing wonderful advancements and from what I have seen it would be very silly not to invest in their stocks. However I would never recommend this job to anyone who doesn't have a ""thick skin"". Generally management and the employees are very kind however there are kinks in the system. Some people can be very rude, and often it is hard to get management to step in. It seems to be the company policy to take anything anyone says ""with a grain of salt"". The work isn't hard, just frustrating when you can't find what you're looking for or dealing with a rude coworker or customer."
good,delivering parts or putting product on the shelf's. I deal with a lot of different customer. some can be very difficult.
good,"I worked hard, and typically did not have a minute of being bored. I like how face paced my job was because I like to keep busy because the day flies by."
good,"Started off my day by waking up early in the morning for first shift, which started at 4. Once I got there all employees had to report to our department and have a team meeting before actually starting to work. Once we finished with our team meeting, we'd go to our trucks and start unloading different car parts they'd bring in, such as, car batteries, totes, and miscellaneous items."
good,Learned the difference in cost of named brand and  non-named brand parts. Got along well with co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was pulling the correct parts and delivering them on time regardless of traffic conditions.
good,"Fun work place, fast paced, growth, great customers, long hrs, not all about the numbers, upper mgt cares about employee needs and concerns."
good,"The job had some perks, everyone got along well unless the manager was in a bad mood. ""Obamacare"" put stress on our hours, reduced hours and pay. The place was ran fairly good, coworkers made the day go by, by helping each other out. Personally, I covered all positions of the job, warehouse being the most strenuous."
good,"i only worked here for about 3 months. Got my hours cut constantly as they hired new employees practically every day. The co workers were very friendly, maybe a little too friendly if you catch my drift. I could not take it anymore, so i left the job and became unemployeed"
good,Loved working there. Learned a lot everyday. Great company to work for. I enjoy working with the public. Co-workers will forever be my friends.
good,"I went into this field knowing nothing about auto parts or anything to do with auto parts and when i left i had a general basic knowledge of car parts. A typical day for me was basically do what my ISS person instructed me to do. Places to go and parts to deliver. The hardest part of the job is on a busy day, as with any company, and your understaffed constantly and you are slacking getting your job done because your having to accompany others in picking up the slack of the underemployment. It's just typical company stresses. Overall it is a pretty good place to work."
good,"great job and fun, just far away from home. manage time on delivery safely. Keeping record of deliveries including: company name, time of delivery, type of payment."
good,"A typical day would consist of going to work, clocking in, assisting customers, answering questions from both customers and co-workers. Breaking down change for the tills when needed, filling out the daily deposit and taking to bank. Handling day-to-day store operations and assisting store manager. Working there I learned how to do the deposit and track down any cash discrepancies, I learned how the company operates on a daily basis, I also learned how the company does it's inventory audits. The staff I worked with were ok, I did have to constantly fix mistakes made by the assistant manager and the other closing manager. The hardest part of the job for me was distinguishing the differences between the outside vendor protocols and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting and interacting with different people."
good,Answered phones and helped customers with finding parts for their vehicles. Management was very nice to work for. They had a very flexible schedules working around other scheduling conflicts.
good,I loved the fact that I could learn something new every day about automobiles and their different parts. I only wished that had been able to give me a full time position like I had been repeatedly promised while working there.
good,"good overall,good company to work for.too many weekends,pay increases not often enough.nice people to work with.oreilly culture neat."
good,"A typical day at work included stocking shelves, unloading freight, tending the cash register, and counting out your drawer at the end of your shift. The manager was a really cool guy, but he is no longer at this O'Reilly's. The hardest part of the job was listening to the two older women there try and establish their dominance over the other in their pretend Matriarchy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around people that I enjoyed being around, helping cutomers out, and getting to do what I enjoyed."
good,"A typical day at Oreilly Auto Parts included, but was not limited to, locating parts for customers, restocking shelves, answer phones, and assisting customers with easy automobile fixes.  I learned how fast-paced a job of this nature is.  I was able to increase my search engine and computer skills.  The management was stern, but fair.  If you did your job correctly your day went well.  If you incorrectly performed tasks a swift talk and work ethic change was swiftly administered.  The communication was poor between management and other workers, sometimes making it difficult to complete tasks.  There wasn't a hard part of this job, except maybe locating rare parts, but being in the Army Reserves I've learned to push through the hard times and to adapt and overcome.  The most enjoyable part of that job was seeing my customer leave with exactly what they needed to fix their car.  Whether it was physical products or knowledge, it was all satisfying."
good,"Fast paced environment, easy to get along with co-workers, and we all work quickly to get our shipments out. We focus on accuracy to maintain our customers happy. Our management team is always helpful when questions need to be answered."
good,"Relaxed and fun work place."
good,Very fun and learn new things everyday. Help customers out with there needs. install batterys wipers light bulbs. very fast paced. Love it!
good,learned a lot of auto parts and how to fix cars thanks to working here and how each part of the engine is like a puzzle it won't work right with out the other.
good,Typical warehouse job. Management overall not so bad but didn't know what they are doing. All they really did was point fingers. If you did your job and came to work you were fine.
good,"Managed multiple departments through distribution process for seven states.  Meetings, reports, and training.  Long hours little reward."
good,"Although the management at the store I was employed at was sub par, I did enjoy my co-workers, as well as customers. had it not been for them I am not sure how long I would have lasted"
good,"busy everyday "
good,I loved driving and working with the public.. I learned alot about the automotive industry and would work for another company like this one.
good,Hardest part  of the job was shift changes and early mornings. Some supervisors didn't really care for the employees. Lack of leadership. I enjoyed working with people in my department.
good,When I was working at O'Reilly. I was learning to work with parts. How to explain to customer what the parts do. And to fix the problem they had on there transportation
good,The job is easy to pick up. Doesn't require a lot of experience in the field. Responsibilities are manageable and do not cause too much stress.
good,It can be a interesting place to work but sometimes co-workers or custumers can be difficult. The frequent changing of managers can be stressful.
good,"Overall, the experience is not any different from most other retail jobs.  One sees a variety of personalities during the day, and being that this is a business that deals in the automotive arena, there are numerous occasions in which a very unhappy customer is going to have to be dealt with.  That is probably to most difficult aspect of the job, communicating with angry individuals, particularly is there is a perception that something we employees either did or provided did not meet with the customer's expectations, regardless of any other factors that may be involved.  On the other hand, the customer who shows true, genuine appreciation for our efforts makes it worthwhile.  If you are part of a team that supports each other and helps each other, (a true team) then you are in a good situation.  Management is concerned with keeping the company profitable, which is the bottom line, but even in that regard, there are no negative issues and/or conflicts."
good,"oriellys is an absolute great place to work at if you are going to school in the automotive field. you will learn quite a bit. otherwise it just another job. i said job not career. oriellys wont move you up unless you have been with for a few years, also hard work and merit don't matter, its just all about who you  know over there."
good,You do a lot of standing around during day shift but night shift is more busy. There are a lot of complaining customers but that's because the younger guys don't know how to diagnose anything.
good,a typical day for me would start with my first couple of deliveries in the morning. and it varies on from there. other than that you just basically drive all day long. delivering parts to the local mechanics or to a company mechanic. The management is ok. Hardest part is lifting some of the parts because they are to heavy. the enjoyable  part is the learning of different parts and meeting new people
good,"Great employee discount, great training program My coworkers were the best part of working there-management not so much."
good,"customer service, which includes answering phones, multi-tasking, resolving customer concerns, handling payments for wholesale customers,setting up delivery routes, ordering parts, checking in parts."
good,"Before working at O'Reilly's , I had basic knowledge of auto mechanics. But afterwards I gained more knowledge about the auto business.  Also, I learned about and able to fix hydraulics hoses; weather on a piece of machinery or on a tractor.   My experience there was fun and enjoyed my customers.  Most of my time was spent on the road delivering parts and filling orders to the customer. For example: Going and pick up a set of rotors(vehicle) and turn them on a lathe.  Sometime I would have to help with battery changing for the customers, too."
good,"from the moment i clocked in to the moment i clocked out, i was constantly busy, even if it wasn't helping customers."
good,"The management and coworkers a good people, but it is hard to get enough hours to work a ""living wage"" as they prefer to keep their employees only part time."
good,"Each day consists of checking in and putting away freight, adjusting price labels, finding auto parts for customers in our computer system or books, money handling. As a manager I make warranty calls, manage payroll, approve price matching, and count deposits at the end of the night. Since I've been with the company, my knowledge of automotive diagnosis and repair had broadened and I have also learned how to do diesel repairs. The hardest part of my job is maintaining my life outside of work with my hard to guess, crazy work schedule. I work 40+ hrs a week but I have no benefits and have not gotten a pay raise with my promotions. I'm still making the same amount as the first day that I started almost a year ago. I have a great following of customers who make my day go by quickly."
good,"Was hired with promise to handle wholesale repair shops but after 2 months of no significant training from management have been working 25 to 32 hours per week, primarily evenings and night with no contact from district manager or answers to my question about when I am to perform actual position I was hired for. Have not been told one thing at this job the has been the truth"
good,"it was an okay place to work. company was a good company not all management were good managers, but there were some good ones also"
good,"* A typical day at work, is opening the store making sure the night crew did everything needed to close the store properly."
good,School was very open with happy students. Good teaachers and staff. But principal was thief and rude to students
good,"A day at work at Oreillys Auto Parts was fun but long and tiring. The job was fairly easy but uneventful and unexciting. There was a few times where I felt at competition with other workers, or that I was pulling others slack. The most enjoyable part of the job was the one on one relationship with frequent customers."
good,"I learned about auto parts, as well as heavy equipment and tools.."
good,Auto parts was not my field of choice. I was subject to indecent harassment.
good,a typical day consists of delivering parts and putting away parts
good,"I learned so much about the business world because i had the opportunity to advance through different positions. "
good,Low paying delivery job. I did this type of work as part of my recovery from open heart surgery. Management and co-workers were OK for the most part. Please examine my work history previous to my heart surgery!
good,not a fun work environment was a lot of hard work but I learned a lot by moving into all departments in the facility. not managed very well.
good,I didn't really always see eye to eye with management. They would schedule you even though you would ask for the day off weeks in advance. Benefits were not really that good. I did like having a discount for auto parts.
good,Lots of customers and I'm very good with sales and making people smile.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and helping customers with the best customer service we can provide. While at the same time putting the freight that comes in everyday away, answering the phones and ensuring that we can get our customers anything that they need. on slow days we find things to do, like keeping the store in clean working order. Inventory is sometimes needed, as well as standard training knowledge to keep on the ever so changing auto parts world. "
good,worked as a team to find parts for customers. also made delivery runs for companies.
good,I drove all day delivering several parts to various stores in a company vehicle.
good,Oreilly Auto Parts helped me learn more about cars and parts to the car instead of just the model look of the car
good,I really enjoyed working for oreillys. I learned a lot of great people and a lot of great things while working there. oreillys its a great company to work for.
good,"A typical work day consist of helping customers and delivering parts to different mechanic shops. I learn about different car parts and functions everyday. I like my management team they are willing to help me if there is something I may not know. I love my co-workers they're the ones that make the environment a warm family like feeling, I enjoy coming to work with them. The hardest part of the job is when it's busy, at times I have to stop and take a breather but I love when things are in fast motion. It keeps the time moving and the day interesting! The most enjoyable thing about the job is making the customers happy, I love to leave the customer with great quality service and most of all a smile!"
good,O'Reilly itself is not a bad company to work for. But the managers can get frustrating. All levels of management. A lot of times you have egos clashing which can make for an uncomfortable work place.
good,"Great place to meet a large number of people from around the world.  Local management-not friendly-crude.  I learned the importance of dependable, on-time, job importance."
good,I have learned about Auto Parts. I have computer experience. I have years of retail sales experience. My co workers at Oreillys are really nice. I really enjoy my job. I enjoy providing excellent customer service. I am also Bilingual. Over all Oreillys is a good company.
good,helping customers find the right parts for there cars and helping figure out the problem
good,"I start as parts pro,then after 3 year got a promotion, with no pay increase. District mgr. Just kept making promises with never happens. Pretty much oreilly is a company that you must kiss a--. Or you'll never get a pay increase. Most employee just keep saying how much they hate working at oreillys"
good,A stable company with a positive work environment for retail business.
good,"I enjoyed my time behind a parts desk. If you can deal with the general public, it's a great place to work."
good,"Not a bad office.  very old school mentality, but I enjoyed my experience overall"
good,"Always working with customers on the phone, and face to face.  Checking in stock merchandise from a distribution center and putting it in the correct location. The guys I work with are enjoyable to work with just gets old being the only girl. I'm always getting picked on. I have learned to just let go of rudeness and jokes. The customers make my day sometimes just by saying nice things or making me smile."
good,"plenty of work,awesome co-workers,awesome benefits&discounts."
good,The interacting with other employees and the face to face customer service is to be experienced in person is great.
good,A typical day at work would be busy. Starting with training while watching for customers and cleaning with spare time. Every day there was something new to learn from dealing with auto parts to watching my manager's work style and learning to be a better salesman. The management style was dictating the workers and there was very strict rules. My co-workers were always great to work with. The hardest part of the job was memorizing all parts and systems of vehicles. Learning about different vehicles and parts was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Stable company to work for, great upper management team. This company is all about training and coacing."
good,"Making sure the customer who order on line has the  correct order before it goes out."
good,I learned a lot about management. and how to manage a business.
good,Average work environment. The job itself was enjoyable. The job was physically demanding and required strength and stamina. The team as a store was pretty good.
good,"Service customers with product questions or concerns as well as  assist team members with various job duties. I have learned alot about the automovtive industry and the functions of  a motor vehicle."
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job is being able to drive around to all locations through out the town and realizing how much you would meet good people out there and also running into people, friends and family on your routes."
good,"A typical day at the job would be entertaining for the whole day, because i would deliver parts all day and meet new customers all day coming in and out of the store. I learned alot of customer service and to help people find the parts that were needed for their vehicle if not a boat or trailer. The management was good i was never really around them much because i was always in the truck delivering parts so i was out of the store for the majority of the day.Co-workers were very nice and got along with them all i am a very outgoing person i like to communicate with anyone to let them know i am willing to do my job. The hardest part of the job was not really anything cause i have been around parts and people my whole life, and i like to help people. The enjoyable part of the job was being able to find the parts a customer needed and answer any questions they needed . also i enjoyed delivering the parts to all the mechanics."
good,"Pay is weak, hours are good, management good.Enjoyable job."
good,"Make deliveries to dealerships, check in inventory, stock items, face the shelves."
good,"A typical day would be me standing behind a counter, helping customers find the parts that they needed to fix there problems. Some times i would assist customers with checking engine codes and installing batteries. Management was pretty unorganized, couldn't keep things tidy. Hardest part of the job would be helping customers who didn't know what they were talking about, they didn't know names of the parts. "
good,"-Very fast paced environment"
good,"Working for a national retailer of this size was exciting. Here I learned what it is to be a supervisor as there were challenges on a daily basis. Supervising 3 employees every day can be challenging but it also has its rewards as you are responsible for developing young employees to meet sales goals, provide exceptional customer service, and store appearance standards every single day. this is where I sharpened my skills as the tasks required me to follow up on delegated tasks, inventory control, cash handling, and my document organizational skills as well as understanding Profit and Loss reports. I comfortably found myself in a leadership role here every day. I didn't succeed every time I was up to bat but can guarantee that the next time I was up I was successful."
good,"A typical day was never a typical day. From one day to the next you never knew how busy you were going to be. It could be very demanding but fullfiling at the same time. I have worked with some of my customers for 20 plus years, dealing with them was like dealing with friends and some family. You always wanted to make sure their needs were meet. The hardest part was dealing with customers that didn't know what part they needed to repair a vehicle and they expected you to diagnose the problem over the phone. Most of the time I could understand the issue and help them resolve their parts need but at times their understanding of the problem wasn't enough information for me to resolve the issue during the first phone call. I would continue to help until the vehicle was properly repaired.   "
good,"In a typical day I unload two trucks putting that freight onto pallets, I then haul that freight a few hundred feet to my UPS area and unload it onto rollers. Then pull all paperwork which are the packing slips and I key in the data. After that I process all the freight. "
good,"A typical day at work is from 5am to 5pm with non stop. You could try to get a lunch but you are always on call. What I have learned is that this job is not for someone with a family. You will have to spend too much time at work and if you do not manage to grow your business for any reason, you just wasted you time. Management is a mixed bag. Direct management will tell you one thing and then you sales management will tell you another. It feels like you are caught in the middle of two divorced parents and they will not stop yelling at you to do what the other is saying. But if anything goes wrong the blame falls on you. The hardest part of the job is honestly the hours you put in for the pay you receive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to cut up and goof off with the account and the other Team members as long as it doesn't interfere with job duties."
good,It's a fun place to work as most staff gets along well and it that makes a great and fun enviroment. The company provides great training in all positions and flexible schedules.
good,I had a good time working with OReilly's. The only con was my manager which im sure you won't have so no worries. Other then that it was great and advance my knowledge of cares by 10x. I enjoyed my co-workers a lot and some I still talk to today.
good,"Going to work everyday was enjoyable. I loved my co-workers, and they were always willing to help each other. The hardest part of my job was trying to understand the proper names for the parts and how to look them up. The most enjoyable part was my customers I delivered the parts to. They always made my work day better. I still talk to a few of them even though I don't deliver to them anymore."
good,Different in its structure and operational standpoint but is very similar to the normal warehouse atmosphere. The Co-Workers were very great individuals whom wanted something out of life and treat you with that southern hospitality
good,During my time with Orielly's I was able to expand my personal knowledge both personally and professionaly. Being in this company provided considerable mechanical and technical information as well as adding to my managerial experience.
good,provided exceptional customer sevice.
good,My time at O'Reilly Auto Parts was great I enojyed everyday I was employed there. Being enrolled as a diesel technician student at the time it kept me current and in the knowing of things.
good,i did not get to learn there system enough to be efficient.policy was never say no but you could not always find parts in the system.
good,busy as soon as you walk through the front doors
good,"Same stuff most days, with ups and downs."
good,"Was treated great by everyone including management during my first month there, after a while, it seems as if me being the only female in a male dominated store got to management."
good,"stressful but fun,new company to this area, growth is not as fast as company would like, but all in all I love my job, just not who I work for!"
good,learned a lot about cars - staff was friendly - i liked this job
good,i learned alot about automobiles and parts...management was really good more like a teamember than manager....my coworkers were the best with out them i dont think i wouldve learned alot...the hardest part of the job was handling frustrated custormers even though i never lost my patience...my most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the right part at a right price when they couldnt find at any other autoparts store
good,"A great company, unfortunately some management personnel put personal ambition ahead of safety and integrity."
good,The company never paid their employers what I think they should of been paid. For all the responsabilitys they had they should of paid better.
good,It's ok if you're into number crunching and trying to reach unattainable goals. My time as a manager was horrible. Was not getting paid for all the hours put in.
good,Work life balance is not existent and the compensation is miserly. They want you to work like you have a 300 hour schedule but want you to have a minimum of 270
good,It was a Great company and workplace with a lot of room to grow and opportunity to clime the ranks. Its very goal oriented in which customer satisfaction is number one goal while reaching yearly sales goal.
good,"I just don’t see myself moving up in the direction I desire to be at with pursuing this company. I would also like to use my degree in some form, meaning an HR department of some sort."
good,"I enjoy my current job, the only problem right now is the non flexibility of my hours and the pay I'm getting so far, even if I get overtime my pay is still about the same as regular hours, but that's not the reason why I'm looking forward to another job, I'm young and I'm trying to learn anything I can as of now but I'm trying to look for somewhere stable where I can rely on my time and money."
good,"I have worked with O'Reilly Auto Parts for more than three years. I spent my first 18 months learning the parts system and building customer relations while increasing my knowledge of automotive maintenance and repair. Since my promotion to Installer service specialist, I have been the leader in commercial sales and established a loyal customer base while encouraging others to do the same."
good,The customers keep you on your toes and laughing the different personalities always keep your customer focus skills improving daily.  You'll certainly learn something new daily
good,I have learned so much about the retail side of customer service I never really had. How to listen more to people in general. How to handle situations that can blow up to bigger issues. How to deal with employee issues personal and work related. I now have a better understanding of how the retail industry has changed and how to flex with changes.
good,"A typical day at wok was so busy that it would be hard to find time for lunch. I did learn a lot about vehicles which will definitely help me in the future. Management I think at times was very one sided when it came to its employees, nothing was really done to make the store I worked for better. The workplace culture was very laid back and the employees didn't seem to care much for their jobs. The hardest part of my job was working with a lot of men who did not want to take authority from a woman. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was busy working because it made me not look at all the other work that needed to be done."
good,Fairly good place to work can get busy and stressful but the customers usually were nice and patient. Everyone there was a team and helped each other mist of the time.
good,"Easy to learn and do just needs better pay. Management is good people, and supervisors are awesome people. The hardest thing about this job is i drive seven hours a day."
good,My friend got me hired me assistant manager from day I was 47 all other employees were younger been there longer and didn't like being assistant manager and disrespected me wouldn't listen some quit some staying and very working with.
good,"You have to work for the company 1 year to get PTO or a raise. As a driver your starting pay is $9. I did SO MUCH MORE work that I should’ve been paid for. They give promotions to literally anybody. Coworkers were great. Delivery customers were horrible. I’ve been harassed, grabbed, and nothing was done about it."
good,"I would start the day by either driving in a truck to deliver parts or by checking in the daily freight, depending on the day and by how much items we received"
good,Worked here for a year and half. Was impressed with the company. Loved the place I worked in. Just wasn’t any advancement for me. I was looking for more of a commercial position
good,"The DC in SLC is almost always understaffed. This results in heavier workloads and more overtime, so for those with a more delicate work/life balance preference, this is not the place for you. So if you are someone who does not mind working overtime (50+ hours a week), the pay is decent for the work as well as the benefits and discount. Overall, the culture here is exceptional. Everyone seems to get along with each other. Lastly, most of the supervisors are friendly and build good relationships with their teams."
good,"fun place to work at. You leave at scheduled time after you have finished your wok. You learn new things if your interested and ask questions. do your job and you go home. Favoritism,  if you know people there"
good,Anybody needing some part time money or wants to try and move to manager can have a chance to work here. There are plenty of opportunities to go around
good,"Although I enjoyed my time working here, management seemed to move away from their customer-service oriented atmosphere, to simply money focused advancements. The company became set on opening more and more stores even though they were struggling to staff their current stores. New stores were built down the street from existing stores, lowing sales, while still demanding higher sales than the store was producing before the new stores were built. Management seemed to focus on promoting and retaining sub-par team members and pushing out productive team members."
good,Store managers are alright most management above that expect the impossible. Blame the workers when customers dont show up at the store like your the one making the terrible sales promotions.
good,Really fun place to work if you enjoy cars. I learned a lot the first couple of months. Not much opportunity to grow. Job can be difficult at times if management is not organized.
good,"just work they noticed "
good,Has not kept up with the trends and starting pays is low. Drivers make minimum pay with little chance to make commision. Counter pay is based on sales not skill level. Pay could be better.
good,Be alot better if they paid their employees that want to move up better and not push them away. Help if they did work to promote within instead of pushing people away for better jobs
good,Relaxed work environment. Extensive knowledge of automobile mechanics helpful. Stocking store very intensive. Can get hectic at times due to answering phone while waiting on customers.
good,I stayed with this job for over 1 year not a bad job for I was only a driver for store 1509. The pay wasnt really enough and I needed higher pay for the amount of work me and the other drivers put in for road time. The companies employee discounts were worth it and the respect given by my coworkers was both great and bad depending on the day. I was stressed occasionally when it was just me driving on busy days and co workers would come in late for there shift or oversleep which made it hard for me to function by myself.
good,"need to improve on when you can get a raise. people are friendly most of the time. very flexible on hours to be worked, many students from different schools begin at the delivery stage."
good,"Good company to start a career with. Good place to learn about parts and about a retail operation. Starting pay is low. I enjoyed my time here, but to me working in these store is a stepping stone type of job. It’s something you do for a few years to get into a field. I’ve learned so much and am grateful for that, but I don’t want to work 60 hours a week for 40 hours worth of pay."
good,"Supervisors need to be shown how to run a department. Too many times have I gone in and the supervisor isn't around, doesn't pay attention to the daily activities, and will justify punishing you by sticking you somewhere that generally nobody else on your team wants to go or won't even bother making an effort to help you. Not all supervisors are like this but their is one in particular who loves doing this and heavily show favoritism in other employees."
good,"Assist customers with optional reasons as to why they entered the store."
good,"Can very quickly turn into a fast paced work environment but can also quickly slow down."
good,The company had a strong mission statement and culture and after they bought a strong retail competitor they changed the direction of the company moving to more of a profits first instead of mission statement based operation.
good,"Good place to work part time, as a second job. Schedule is rotating, with optional overtime. Good benefits, vacation time, discounts, and incentives. Great place to learn about parts and customer service."
good,"Just stay busy ,pay attention to detail,must have a positive attitude and outgoing person,learn as much as you can... promotion are the but or course it's all up to you"
good,"Oriely's has a great, fast-paced work environment. However, the pay rate is not enough to cover the current cost of living unless you can volunteer for overtime."
good,"Compensation does not match the hours expected. Goals are often unachievable. O'Reilly stresses culture, but sometimes falls short on their end of the bargain."
good,"Show up at the time you where told to show up, help customer with auto parts so they can fix their vehicles, take an hour lunch, come back and help customers and try to stock product when it was in, and then count down your drawer and leave for the day."
good,"I Managed the Hub store in Wichita during nights and weekends. Its the largest O'Reilly's in Kansas by far so naturally its far busier there than other locations would be and there is 3 buildings connected rather than just one. Store level management is excellent but Corporate level management is severely lacking. Corporate does not see or know the finer details on the store level, to them you are just a number. Most demanding retail job ever period. Also the least paying retail job.. you get paid commission but its really not enough to compensate unless you ONLY work the dealer desk. you learn a lot though and the employee discount on parts is nice but the customers can be pretty rough to deal with sometimes..as with any place in retail..only have the customers are angry and stressed because they have no working vehicle.."
good,Learning the routes is easy. Working in the heat is the hardest thing. They celebrate everyone birthday. Celebrate all holidays. The  has a high turnover rate but over all is ok. Need to pay more money for work load.
good,"Its a great place to work."
good,It was good and have me the opportunity to use my managment skills and work with the public and use my customer service skills to the. best of my ability
good,"At the entry level 3 positions pay is competitive and work is rather enjoyable."
good,"Alright place to work , okay pay employees are always out going . They do good with promotions but not with raises . I would recommend as a starting job to build you resume."
good,"You get to meet alot of people, some of the customers you will see everyday. Teamwork is the key in auto parts. Commision is a great if you push your sales."
good,"Not well paid, even in management roles, great continued training, great communication within store management, culture always a high point. invested in their employees"
good,cross training is the best thing you can do. show up and work . just worry about your self. unless you are management. learn everything you can about what goes on a daily basis
good,"Not boring, but not fun either. Lots of training and low pay, even full time it is not enough to provide for just one person living in the Louisville area. Every employee is kind and patient generally, and management does work with you for unexpected delays or absences."
good,It’s a fun place. Get to meet a lot of people and you get to learn a lot. It’s a good first job but if you intend on moving forward in life it is not worth staying at for so long.
good,"O'Reilly had really excellent training programs while I was there, and that was the best part about the job. Materials were written for someone who had no knowledge of cars (as is often the case with new retail hires) and made learning more about all aspects of the industry VERY easy and accessible. I made a lot of friends in coworkers and customers, many of whom I am still in contact with years later. Long store hours mean the opening shift arrives at 5:30-6am and the closing shift leaves around 10:30. This means that shifts are very flexible but you may end up working some extremely long days. Pay is lower than what it should be- profit margins are razor-thin because employees are paid next to nothing for the amount of work they are expected to do. There aren't a lot of corporate positions available outside of Springfield, MO."
good,"Manager took a chance with me, who was unexperienced and newly retired from the military. He gave me a chance to show my worth. Great experience and employment for someone seeking part-time work."
good,"Being there for 13 years from kragens to oreillys I'd have to say that I miss the kragen days I feel that oreillys expects too much with low pay. I did rack up a lot of vacation time. As well as sick time although it's so rare for me to call in. Oreillys always transfers employees, managers and even district managers around too much. My co workers make my day go by fast always fun always make me laugh witch I'm always happy and positive. As for my regular customers I'd have to say I have a lot that I'm glad I got to know them not just by there face but by their names."
good,Working at oreillys can be a good start for anyone into the business. Don't expect much though they arent promoting many. Best to learn then get a raise at another Auto Parts house.
good,I enjoyed working here I did so with my best friend. The only real issue I had was some of my co workers and I was not allowed to get full time even though I worked the hours most weeks.
good,it was a good job. Part time to get me through college. I liked the relaxed atmosphere and you were giving the ability to help people and use your automotive knowledge.
good,The store was a good job while you are in school. But for a job to support a family it wasn't ideal. The people who i worked with everyday made the job enjoyable and made me not dread coming in every shift.
good,It was my first outside sales job it was difficult at first I got the hang of it alot of driving and seeing new clients fast paced and very competitive
good,"It was a busy day everyday. Between merchandising and delivering auto parts to customers. The management was good, and I was able to bring my own ideas to the store to make it a more productive work place."
good,"I feel like Oreilly is starting to lose the culture that made it successful these past 60 years. It seems less important as the years have gone by.  Senior Management seems less connected to store team members. I still have faith that they will get things turned around but it will take a hard look at the current senior management in the area. Some do not even participate in team member training like they use to. Some of our meetings did not even begin with culture stories anymore. Sad, they seem to be harder to find examples of them these days I guess."
good,Way to much drama they promise you things but never follow through with what they promise enjoyed working there but they just need to find betterangers to manage the store the assistant manager knows more about the store then the store manager does
good,O'reillys needs to hire more women there are so many men in that business including there customers that they are ready to kill each other once more women move into that business that are not fools things will go good.
good,"I left to finish college and chase $. The ""boom is over so no new stores are going up, meaning you stay where your at. The formula for commision is very very very unfair."
good,"My experience at Oreilly was not what I was hoping for. When I started, I knew I was starting from the bottom. In our first meeting, the board stood before the new employees and told us how well people advance and promote from within. That is the reason I decided to work for them.  That was not going to happen. I applied for and had several interviews and they always liked me but hired from outside the company for each position I applied for. I enjoyed the work. I was very busy all day. Management was not much help. Oreilly is a very fast pace work place which I enjoyed. I was able to learn a lot about EXCEL while I was there. The part I enjoyed was meeting new people. Oreilly is a very structured place to work. My day consisted of working statements from vendors, researching discrepancies, customer service, balancing invoices."
good,"Was a good place to work, no complaints except that we were understaffed, but direct management was aware of that and working their way through the red tape to fix that. "
good,"I enjoyed the work, the compensations were not enough for my background and experience. The promotions were given unfairly and not based on experience but personalities."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and you work hard, I learned a lot about cars and truck parts.My manager was cool we got along I did what was asked of me an more. Work place culture was get the job done and we can have fun while we work.The hardest part of the job was when team members would not help out when I helped out all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was we all joke around and buy each other sodas food ice cream chips and we still get the job done."
good,I have learned a great deal at oreilly throughout the year. great opportunity for anyone that need to advanced in life. opportunity is there for those that will like to grow up in retail.
good,"The pay is good but could be better, company don't offer much to part time workers. The management could be better. benefit could be better too. They don't offer much for part time. Part time don't get any benefit or paid time off, or no holiday pay."
good,Wasn't a great place to work if you enjoy weekend's and having time for yourself. Worked morning to night while still in highschool couldn't do anything during the week cause of work and school and worked my entire day's on the weekends.
good,"great costumers "
good,The pay is garbage but the job has very low requirements. HUGE disconnect between customer expectations and quality of personnel who will work for such basic wages. Benefits are robust for full time employees. Corporate culture seems to be very focused on profits and growth versus good prices and employee satisfaction.
good,A typical day we would put stock away assist both professional and walk-in customers and keep the store clean and presentable. I learned a lot more about automotive parts than I  previously knew. Management was not very good at the time of my employment. The culture was great.  We all worked as a team to provide the best customer service available and to make sure required tasks were done. The hardest part of the job was either extremely unhappy customers or the lack of time the manager actually spent in the store.  The best part of working there is the great friendships that were created with both customers and coworkers.
good,"I like to describe O'Reilly's to people as this. They give you the perfect amount of work to keep you busy every second of the day, if customers didn't exist. But there are tons of customers and we get very busy most of the time. Also they don't pay you for any experience or knowledge you have. They just expect you to know cars and parts perfectly and don't credit you for anything. I was extremely good at the job, but after the company took advantage of me for a 18 months, I finally realized there were companies that would appreciate me more and left."
good,"Work fast pace. Work friendly and good and bad ppl. Staff friendly. Secured facility.clean environment, drug free. Handicap assesible. HR lady on duty all the time to answer question"
good,"This is a retail business; you have to know how to get this message across to customers and coworkers. It can be fulfilling but very stressful as well. The company itself has a high turnover rate, this is because it hires many first time workers, young people seeking their first job or those with no retail experience. Due to this, may people actually get promoted to managerial position, this is where a lot of people begin to leave the job. Managerial positions are not hard but they are very stressful; high amounts of cash are handled daily and discrepancies are placed solely of the acting managers. Many times they are not resolved, and there have been time when employees have had to put forth out of pocket. This is a rare situation but it has happened. So just keep in mind, this is a retail business that has a goal to beat a competitor, the main concern will always be the bottom line and not retention."
good,"I worked for OReilly Auto Parts until i was involved in a car wreck involving several others. "
good,"Learned a lot in the beginning of working at O'Reilly's, but as time went on and learning less I started to hit a glass ceiling. Great to work part time and great to get store discounts."
good,"If all you want out of life is a steady paycheck, this place meets that requirement. Benefits are on par with other light industrial jobs in the industry."
good,Oriellys was not a place where I felt like I could build a career at. The management was good but co-workers were lazy and were knowledgable like they needed to be for the position.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Laid back atmosphere, but often work shorthanded. Can get very busy, no time to dedicate to customers. Pay is on the low side. Slow/no response from corporate about personal status, pay etc.. GREAT support from Corp on day-to-day questions about operations, issues. Good benefits. Job security is good, advancement is not. Feels dead-end. Hard work doesn't get you anywhere, no wonder why people are lazy. Always reminders about the company making millions, while you eat peanut butter."
good,Overall it is standard retail. It is a great place to learn about car parts and get some good deals to fix one's own vehicle. The benfits are good. There is a lot of turn over in those positions.
good,picking orders quickly and responsibly matching up tickets poor management need more training they need to live up to there culture topics most enjoyable part of the was coming in at 10am and being of around 7pm...
good,High stress because of poor training practices and turnover in Supervisor level.  Hourly employees compensated well. Company is stable with no chance of jobs moving overseas.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is a fast paced working environment. Each day is a challenge with new customers, frequent customers, or commercial customers. In addition, multiple projects are expected to be done each day and after a while it becomes routine."
good,"I would  work here again as a last resort, because of management, it is a easy job but you have to know how to handle upset customers on a daily basis because of other workers mess ups"
good,A bit of both driving and clerical. Good job if you want driving experience. Usually drivers drive before 6pm. If you want a bit of both worlds this is the job.
good,"Great company, great team, working closely with regional managers, somewhat competitive pay as an assistant. Love the fast paced work on a daily basis"
good,"The work place was fast-paced, fun at times, a learning experience for me, & it was also competitive.You can compete with co-workers to obtain a bonus"
good,Awesome manager at the time. Learned alot about automotive parts under this manager. Very family oriented at that time. Easiest part of the day was going to work. Not stressful work at all.
good,"If you are in desperate need of a job and have basic knowledge of how a vehicle works and basic parts, you won't have a problem working here. Great benefits, but hours are never the same."
good,Great opportunity for people to start a career or to build experience. This company believes in promoting from within. The culture is what defines this company.
good,Good place to work. Daily stock replenishment vs weekly. More access to the parts we needed. Upper management was a little more in touch with their store level employees.
good,"It was fast paced every now and then, it was overall a good place to work, but management wouldn't allow advancement for hardly anyone. It would've been nice to move up to full-time, as i had been asking for months on end, and still would get no answer from the manager or the DM (District Manager). It was frustrating when after awhile new management started to cut my hours, but was always there on time, and even went in when they needed help. I did my best, but it always failed to be noticed. If management hadn't changed hands from when i had first started, i would honestly still be working there, and hope to have grown a bit within the company."
good,"It was a decent place to work, but I wouldn't have been able to move up any positions until I turned 21 and that's what I really didn't like. Pay isn't good, but it's not the worst either, they give you opportunities to earn extra, but that's if you can convince people to buy certain things. My coworkers there were good people, yeah sometimes there was someone talking about someone else but that didn't happen often. I just didn't like the idea of being there for 3 years without a chance of moving up and then maybe getting a tiny raise of $1 more an hour by the time I can even move up. It's a good company to work for if you're older, retired, and just want something to do. Definitely don't recommend working here if you're young and want to make good money."
good,"Company has great benefits, a good place for entry level employees, for a new to the work force person there are chances for good management experience and  learning to deal with customers face to face."
good,Over all its a good place to work. Problem was it was a new store with younger employees that would call off work with no warning. Gave no time to have someone cover for them .
good,Working here has been fun and yet stressful. I have just found that it is time to move on to another chapter in my life. The open hours have begun to conflict with my home life.
good,This is a very good place to work if you care about teamwork and love to be surrounded by Culture. Great people to work with. Management on the other hand could improve. The rewards of hard work here can only be matched by the satisfaction of the customers. It's a great company but lacks the ability to recognize the hard work of it's employees.
good,"Overall it is a good place to work. Every store tends to function different though, based on the performance of the head manager. Very flexiavle with hours."
good,"People are nice but this isn't a job that allows you to move up as they tell you once you are hired. You will be promised the world if you do as they ask, but in the end you want see it due to family in corporate."
good,"I liked the value of the company, but I think that the pay wasn't sufficient for the type of skills needed to know parts and cars. For those that have great knowledge the pay is to low. But if you weren't full time you had a lot of part timers, with them there is employee turnover"
good,Being an assistant manager is very hard.  It depends on the people that work under you and also the management team that is above you.  Some people aren't meant to be managers.
good,"Working for O'reillys for the past three years has had its ups and downs. It is a rewarding job when you help your customers find what they need and develop relationships with regular walk-ins. The major downside to this job is when you take on more responsibilities than you can handle and all of your team members start to think that those responsibilities are yours only. This company supposedly has a ""team based"" work environment but after three years, it became very clear that it wasn't. If you can't lift car batteries on a daily basis, and climb ladders to retrieve sometimes heavy parts, it's not the job for you. If you can't handle multi-tasking with customers and other necessary jobs, it's not for you. Most of the time, I was in charge of creating/changing all of the displays, price labels, along with maintaining inventory. All of which were supposed to be every team members job."
good,this way an easy job with minimum supervision work flow was at an steady pace but the pay wasn't that good. had to have great customer service skills and interact with many clients
good,"I worked early morning shift. Start up with a daily meeting, and morning exercise and stretches, then start at work. We would load and scan multiple product to be distributed at our store locations. I learned how to use the scanner and computer use for product intake, and to receive and stock product. Safety is a high concern, and I am part of the safety committee. I have a great team to work with, and we communicate very well. The hardest part of the job was the heavy product that would come in that we had to stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork. Some of the employees became more like family to me. Management was a little difficult to work with at times."
good,is a good company with grow up oportunities but very low pay rate in any position inside great discount on parts the best in the market
good,"great starting job for anyone willing to get started in the work force. some managers can be over the top at times but majority of people who work there are customer friendly, and also are good co-workers for the most part."
good,"The environment for the day to day goings on are basic in a sales situation. I feel like too much stock is ordered, the truck delivery is always a hassle with finding places to stash what wasn't ordered but still arrived. The hourly sales team has high turn over as mostly high school teenagers are hired. Finding knowledgeable staff who want to work for 8-10$/hr is hard to keep. Some locations needs staff with intelligence of farm equipment, hydrolic hoses, and even boat equipment. The cleanliness of a store seems to only become apparent when corporate makes it's rounds. The commissions earned do not have a breakdown on how or what was gained. I feel like the company has many shortcomings. Certificates should be earned after qualifying for a department, either through a cooperative with a trade school, online classes, ASE courses or trade school that can test the through knowledge. Most of the sales team knows minor information on trucks, 4 cylinder engine vehicles and care products. Electrical testing needs to be more in-depth training; its a serious injury waiting to happen without it."
good,O'reilly's has been a good place to work because of the knowledge i gained through their training program and the extensive discount given to employees. It is not however a company I would want to work for long term.
good,Nice place to work while considering what you want to do as a career. Pay is decent. Everyone's opinion is different. Working here is okay
good,"Work and Customer Safety needs to be more of a Priority."
good,I started as the last of the full-time drivers for this company. My biggest complaint is that as my duties changed my pay scale has not been changed. It seems the beginning rate will be your base with and average of 1% to 2% increase each year. Currently I am acting as the Night Shift Supervisor with a pay just over $9.00 an hour. My workbook for the R.S.S. position has been done for about a year with no action or follow up to gain the status of R.S.S.
good,great place to work as a kid. learned a lot about automobile parts. hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers and the best part of the job was being able to meet new people
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts was a great ""first real job"" for me after I graduated high school. Full-time and benefits was a plus. However, the pay is rather low, even now as an Assistant Manager with 3+ years of experience. An average day for me involves arriving to work at 7:00 am and starting my routine of paperwork, warehouse returns, and a daily to-do list generated by our corporate office. The majority of my job is based around customer service and inventory control. I handle more than 200 customers daily, both retail and commercial. I also handle the bank deposits and making sales calls regularly."
good,"Great team in place in the location I was in.  Management was thoughtful, responsible, and accountable for the happenings in the location."
good,"as a counter pro a typical day is checking in new inventory, answering the phone, and helping customers at the counter sometimes all at the same time. As store manager all of the same as the counter pro plus adding daily paperwork, inventory maintenance, store level Human Resources, problem solving with teammates and customers."
good,"My day would start by me getting a delivery truck per paired for the day checking tire pressure, lights, and mirrors on the truck before I had to go on a delivery.When a first call delivery would come in I would grab the parts the other company need and the ticket jump in the company truck and go off to there destination. As I arrive at my destination I will take the parts in and go the the management for a signature and payment if necessary. Then I head back to the store If I am not on more delivery's I will go to the front of the store and help with customers and that is very wide chose of job duties if it is helping a customer check or helping a customer with a installation of there batteries,headlights on there vehicles, or changing wiper blade's. I could also be testing battery's, alternators, starters, or even turning brake rotors. this job has me multitasking in a lot different category's. At the end of my shift I count down my drawer for the day make a drop and sign out and go home. One of the more enjoyable parts of my day is I get to interact with a variety of different people. Through i have previous experience with cars this job has given me an opportunity to become better acquainted with different car parts as well as different makes and models of cars. One of the more difficult aspects of the job is when we get a rush of people and I/we are getting swamped with questions and requests from customers and we are unable to answer said request/question in a timely fashion. This is an average day for me at work"
good,"Work Hard"
good,"Working at O'reilly's is challenging because I have to remember many different part numbers, what people ordered in and how to process different accounts. Other challenges are looking up hard to find, rare parts for old classic cars, tractors, semi-trucks, lawn-mowers, bikes, and boats. I've learned about many different cars, their engines, what parts fit multiple cars and how car manufacturers use the same chassis on many different models. I was promoted to the Retail Store Supervisor which means when the manager and assistant manager leave, i'm in charge of the other employees, closing the store and handling the cash deposits. The hardest part of the job is when there isn't enough workers clocked-in to help every customer and the phones are ringing off the hook. The best part of the day is when a classic car, sports car, or modified car comes in to get parts."
good,"Stay busy, get your job done and keep a clean work environment ."
good,The people here are great management is ok overall the company is a great place to get your foot into.
good,"A typical day involves a lot of multi-tasking, answering the phone while attending customers and stocking merchandise all over the store and warehouse."
good,was ok good time with co worker good job and promotion great time good benefits
good,"Although it may be difficult to lose your job it is also difficult to maintain a lifestyle. If you never want to get fired or worry about layoffs its a great place to work, unless you have a mortgage car payments and children. They don't pay very well to start off and raises are unheard of unless you are moving up."
good,"A typical day will include any of the following: drafting estoppels, SNDAs, lease modifications, maintenance defaults, extensions, tracking critical dates, monitoring landlord maintenance issues and insuring remedies are being taken care of in reasonable time frame, issuing maintenance work orders to landlords/tenants, providing certificate of insurance among being the main contact for your region and handling any issues that arise."
good,"I Personally loved this Job and what I learned . it was very competitive environment, a lot of favoritism but definitely a great place too learn customer service skills."
good,"Sales, Time management, excellent co-workers. Excellent employee morale. Unfortunately no room for advancement"
good,"People I worked were good with some notable exceptions.  Computer"
good,"Worked here for a short time, but felt joining the military would be better for my kids. You have to really apply yourself to be successful here at your job otherwise you will fail."
good,"I had a lot of wonderful Employes to work with, some great training by the company's own tutorials."
good,"It was very simple and interesting from the time you walked in until the time you punched out. we were friends and family rather you were buying parts or selling parts. It had it's downs with some costumers un happy from time to time, but that's easily remedied by a knowledgeable sales representative that gives a care. you cant run a business without costumer service and we topped the charts with it!"
good,"Being an employee at Oreillys involves constant interaction with customers and other team members. There are multiple things to be learned a day whether its new parts that are coming into the store or a new way to order and look up parts to ensure that the customer is getting the correct part they need and possibly other suggested parts that will help them complete their tasks. Management at Oreillys is great because they are able to tell you what needs to be done in a manner that makes it fun to work with them instead of for them. My coworkers is a great example of a team that knows how to have a good time in the work place but stay productive at the same time. In my opinion there is not a part of the job that would be considered difficult. However if there was a difficult part of the job, it would be attempting to keep all customers happy. At Oreillys, the policy is to ""Never say no while keeping a low price guarantee"" however sometimes it's easier said than done. The most enjoyable part of the job would be how simple it is and how great of coworkers I have the opportunity to work with."
good,It was a good place to get on my feet but if was not my ideal kind of work
good,"-A typical day of work included diagnostics checks for customers, delivering car parts to mechanics, stocking shelves and cleaning the store."
good,"This job isn't the worst a person could have, but I'm not sure I would highly recommend it.  My co-workers had wonderful personalities, but I felt they lacked in their work ethic and the supervisors did little to correct it. There was also a high turnover rate.  The base wage wasn't terrible and there was opportunity for commission, but I felt under-compensated for my time and effort amongst all of the inequities in the store. (I also didn't receive any raises in two years.)  The hardest part of the job was partly physical (lifting heavy car parts, etc.), but it was mostly emotional as I felt I was not treated with the values the company holds.  The best part of the job was all of the interaction I had with other people and learning more about cars."
good,"I love what I do.  I enjoy helping people and I have learned so much from the people I work with and from my customers.  I have strived to be the very best I can possibly be in my job and my customers will tell you the same.  There was a change in management in June, 2011 and everything changed.  It is now very hostile and there is very little ""teamwork"" left.  The hardest part of this job was when a female co-worker came to me and complained of being sexually harassed by our store manager.  Several of us had witnessed his actions.  I went to my DM and he did nothing.  She transferred to another store.  The most enjoyable part of my job is just doing what I do.  I love it."
good,"typical work day unloading trucks and managing chemicals"
good,"ok place to work, plenty of advancement opportunities, very high stress, very unorganized"
good,The job was nice but upper mgr sucks they dont want to help you want like to move in the company.
good,typical day at work was a good day but lacking motivation
good,"Finding the right job within this company is really the only way to go. If you can find a niche position that balances pay, hours worked, and family life then you will have a pretty good job. I would recommend ISS or TSM jobs for these kind of hours but you need lots of skills to do these jobs and they don't come open all that often."
good,"A normal day at work for me is talking to people about there car problems, and helping them to see what is wrong with there vehicle. Seeing how many of our customers are do it yourself kind of people not all of them know exactly what they have to do, or how to do it the right way. I also do the paper work for the store as far as sending and receiving items from our warehouse. I also make sure all employees are doing there job, and doing it correctly."
good,It was only a few friendly people. Everyone else kept to themselves or had something bad to say about someone else. The newcomers were treated unfair. They did show me how to manage my time better with my daily life and the job made me more responsible. The hardest part about the job was working when it gets hot. The best part about the job is that if you are doing everything right no one is breathing down your neck telling you what to do.
good,O'Reilly in general is a good company to work for. The main problem is there are too many ex-Napa employees working there in leadership. The stores in the Jacksonville area are being run like napa. I have heard from several employees out west that the company runs things alot differently out there. More fair and more realistic chances for advancement. No favortism like in Jacksonville.
good,Deliver auto parts locally. Restock when not making deliveries. The job is easy and not a lot of pressure. The benefits are OK.
good,"Overall, I would say that O'reilly Auto Parts as a whole is a good company to work for. Ultimately, nothing about the company really sets it apart from any other large retailer. Culture and atmosphere is comparable to just about any other retailer."
good,When I worked For them I loved going to work everday at the Store i worked in.
good,Help customers with what they are needing. Check problems that they may have. Test their vehicle to see what a problem would be with it. Run the register and find the product that they are needing. The managers are very helpful when needed at any given time.
good,Unloading and reshelving small returned parts that are either broken or needing repaired and put back out to be reshelved for refurbished.  After the box is full you are to label and complete taping and move it to shipping where it is shipped out.  Most of the time i was in charge of creating new processes to make things smoother and easier.  This department was attached to the returns department and it is a workout and it  harder that it seems.  Great work out
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo . Buenos compañeros , horario cómodo."
good,Was quiet place sometime a lot people management was bad communication in everything easy to learn everything was in the computer  customer was great people around very nice a lot team work great people on garage something parts not good quality very poor endurance
good,This place is easy! Some prior car knowledge would be useful but it is not required of you. I didn’t know anything but learned a lot the first few months
good,"Working with people whom you grow to trust to give their best effort. people who will help you when you need it and often when you don't. People willing to pitch in to get things accomplished So everybody can have a good,productive day. Management willing to work with people if a scheduling conflict arises. Overall positive work environment."
good,"the place is great, sometimes it lacks management skills. Corporate sometimes doesn’t agree with the choices you’d like to make to make their business succeed."
good,working here is not really hard at all it is really easy to me a lot of it is counting inventory and helping my customers out which i love to do i’ve had build so many relationships with my customers a lot of them only want me to help them out the work environment here is really fun all my employees get along the work together as a team
good,"They gave me alot of training right off the bat. Easy job during the winter, Rather slow. Hard job in the summer cant keep up. There pay rate is not the greatest but get plenty of benifits."
good,"I would not recommend O'REILLY to my worst enemy.  If your job is not one that makes the company money, e.g. counter salesman, you are a nobody and are paid accordingly. After all it doesn't take a rocket scientist to do your job!"
good,I was there for a year and a half and there was one coworker i didnt get along with and I lost my job because of him and i got to know alot of the coustmers over the time i worked there
good,"The place was nice to work at and i got along with everyone that i worked with and some of the customers were nice. But when all said and done corporate seemed to be out of touch with the store. They are a numbers game without knowing or even stepping foot into the store, if your sales are down they cut hours, if my commercial accounts didn't buy enough they would cut my drivers hours which ends up hurting the whole store cause you cannot get your sales up without drivers. And when i asked for another driver cause i had to leave my post to make a delivery for my customers they would tell me that my numbers are too low for another driver therefore i would lose sales all the time cause lack of delivery drivers."
good,I believe O'reilly is company that does their best to be attentive to all the employees needs.  They are a very inclusive company who will help you learn all that you would like to know.  The classes that they offer are a little difficult to get in but if you persist they will work to get you to the class.
good,"every day was very fast paced, with little time to rest. The other employees were easy to get along with, the worst part of the job was the pay. the best part was being the delivery driver."
good,"From managing a store, I suffered what could very closely be called a series of psychotic breaks from frequent insubordination, laziness, and apathy from my crew. Of course, the hiring pool in Duluth is such a flaming sack of hairy garbage that even when you set up interviews with KIDS WHO WORK NEXT DOOR, they will not show up. You will be told constantly to keep payroll down, morale high and profits higher, which is all hilariously contradicting. You won't have anyone on staff that you could promote, let alone teach with any expectation of follow-through or information retention. There are exceptions, but just that. "
good,Just pick the well-managed oreilly and you'll have a heck of a time. I really enjoyed my time working at O'Reilly's I learned a lot about servicing vehicles and customer service.
good,Management is not great but the coworkers are fun and hard working. The most difficult part of the job especially on the commercial side are the customers.
good,"Work days would include a 1 hour lunch with little breaks throughout the day, one thing I learned was customer service and building a good reputation for sales and service.  Management is pretty reliable in all aspects.  Overall the workplace was fun and layer back , the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers.  Overall it's an enjoyable experience for both employees and customer due to the fact you get to build a lot of positive relationships and meet a lot of decent people."
good,"Good first job, annually raise, friendly people, good job for people getting their foot in working for the automotive industry. Learn a lot about vehicles and their parts."
good,Your day at work are fairly predictable and enjoyable. The team members are easy to get along with. Management is very flexible and helpful with all team members.
good,I was hired on as a part time manager so I wasn't given the same benefits as full time employees but overall it was an above average work environment.
good,"very relaxed place to work, helping people with their cars, learning about car parts, normal working hours, low pay, do outside sales with the local shops"
good,Was always treated fairly by the many bosses that I had while l worked at O'Reilly. I feel that the bosses often needed more support from the higher ups. I enjoyed working at O'Reilly no matter what I was doing.the work was never a problem.
good,"It was alright, you get to meet lots of like minded people like cars, but you also have to deal with the customer who can get very temperamental if given the wrong part. I would recommend this job more to people with car part knowledge, or at least willing to learn about car parts."
good,"Honestly, when it comes to my actual job, I love it. I love what I do and I love the people I work with at my store. That being said...there are some serious problems in upper management. You can google it and find pages upon pages about this. The store employees are amazing though and the customers for the most part are awesome as well."
good,It's a god company to grow into for experiment. Great co-workers that you can get along with and help you with your job if you fall behind. lack of communication.
good,The people were nice and understanding of first time emploies. They weren't very understanding when you call into work sick and stressed they we're understaffed.
good,Working for O'Reilly was enjoyable experience. very busy pace. Was able to transfer from state to state due to a divorce . Company benefits was excellent
good,"I enjoyed my time at Oreilly Auto Parts. If it wasn't for the low pay, I would have considered going full time. Easy to advance as long as there is  an opening because they hire from within."
good,"Not too bad of a job. Don't get paid a lot hourly but there is commission and if you are in a busy store, it's a couple hundred bucks a month. Still give out Xmas and Easter bonuses too. Not very generous with raises."
good,"Pay is not that great but great environment. People you work with have great character, and the managers help you with much as you need. Would recommend working here if you are not looking for high pay."
good,its an okay place to start off but it gets old quick its repetitive and you pretty much get the kinda of know it all customers that you would expect at any parts place
good,Make sure your direct deposite is perfect otherwise it takes the company on average to get you a check if there are any issues. They dint care if your paid in a timely manor what so ever
good,There is a lot of diversified learning involved with this company. It is a great way to learn to think outside the box. Patients is key in being able to come up with solutions to many different situations that may come about.
good,Good place with fun and friendly people. Hardest part was dealing with hard headed customers or parts from the warehouse didn't get there on time or they were wrong.
good,"ok job depends on what your title is, pay 8-9 dollars an hour is not a livable pay its ok if you live at home with mom and dad does not cover the cost of living"
good,i dont recomnd working here. they promise things and do not follow up with it. under paid and over worked. favortysm all over the place. ive seen peeople get away with things that they shouldnt have
good,Have to be very  accurate  on your work and make sure that you get the trucks out on time.you can’t be late it will give you points and that are very strick .
good,People came in and out and lines got very big to the point we’re you had to rush evrything  also some days it was slow and the pay was not good enough
good,"Would be a good place to work if you are young or in between jobs. Pay is low but it was a fun and easy place to work. Meeting new people every day and was an easy, clean, and enjoyable work environment."
good,Very stressful working nights. Getting home to relax and sleep during the day is hard. It's kind of dangerous delivering freight at night with on lookers watching you.
good,I moved up to assistant manager and enjoyed the entire time i was there. corporate occasionally got involved and that was the nightmare. They think of no one but themselves and leave it to in store management to solve this
good,its a good place to work for but the pay sucks. would advise working another job along side this. discounts are great though!! think thats why people use this as a side job and not main
good,"it was a helpful experience, i enjoyed working with cars. i learned a lot about customer service and i feel it boosted my work ethic, other than the pay it was a real fun job"
good,Great staff. The pay can be better. But overall good job. A typical day consists of customers. Management was good.Taking tests weekly was a bore sometimes.
good,"It can be a stressful fast paced job, or it can be slow and boring. It is all depending on the customer flow. Easy and cool job, but it does not pay very well at all"
good,Great place to start off somewhere when you're younger and just needing a stepping stone to get your foot in the workforce door.  I couldn't see myself working there for a career lifetime job.  But I enjoyed my time there.
good,"I like my job but the pay is not enough to support a large family. Sometimes it's relaxed, most times I can keep busy. It does requiring going to other locations that pays reimbursement for gas but mileage isn't much."
good,Typically work 8hr days. Friendly people to work with but depending on the department it can be really stressful and very fast paced. The pay is decent but overall a good job for a student or first time job for the experience.
good,"culture is good. co workers were good, those that work, anyways. as long as you dont have to deal with their corporate office, you will be fine. but their corporate wont be helpful, if you can even get them to contact you.. and if they do get ahold of you , you might soom be out of work."
good,i was the store manager i tried to have fun with the employees by having cook outs on the weekend to show my appreciation i would have competitions to have hitting goals more enjoyable but as a store manager i worked very long hours
good,"growing company, they have a great culture idea,  lot of turnover with both management and team members,  overall i loved my job and what i did it was what i was good at."
good,"It was enjoyable you will learn new stuff every day, from auto parts to how to fix cars, one day you will be helping customers, next day driving, and the following day receiving parts."
good,Typical day is to meet and greet customers and assist them with anything they need as far as vehicle parts. Be respectful and professional as we are here to help them with vehicle needs.
good,i only worked part time but the pay was great for going to school full-time. needed seniority to get desired hours which wasn't ideal. but as an 18 yr old i could ask for much more than a job that was flexible with school.
good,"I began liking the job, but my feelings are starting to change. Once I got back in school it's seems as if my boss doesn't want to work with my schedule."
good,"My three star applies only to my current store. Issues in management, being passed over for promotions, and refusal to allow a transfer. It has good benefits, decent pay, and can be promising for other employees."
good,"Ive had a rollercoaster  experince with oreillys, i loved the customers and my co workers had bad experience with management changes over three managers in a year"
good,Overseeing operation. Need have better better wages. enjoy the team work. Training on new test equipment and learning how to read car codes
good,In Flagstaff I was a commercial delivery driver not a truck driver like this website is assuming.  I got the chance to meet a lot of people with extensive experience as mechanics and technicians.  I made a lot of connections with the local businesses and whenever i needed something done I knew where to go to get stuff worked on me cars. I had access to really cheap parts and it help keep me vehicles running. Some of the employees only worked part-time there on the side for the benefit of discount parts.
good,"Good company to work for, with advancement opportunities. The company promotes a good culture to customers and team members."
good,"A typical day at work involves signing a vehicle in for the day, then delivering parts as they come up. "
good,"I was looking for something part-time when I was hired on.  Because of turnover, I was placed in management training.  The benefits are ok.  The pay is sub-par for a management position.  my work schedule wasn't all bad."
good,"It was steady work I worked 48 hours a week and managed all cash control and sale calls. My manager put all of his responsibilities on me even when he was told to split them with me. I didn't have much time for a family life, or time to see my doctors a lot of times I had to go to my doctors on my lunch. I was treated unfairly I trained other sales people to do their jobs multiple times. Only to be told I was being blamed by them for their mistakes when they made incorrect judgments on paperwork. This job ultimately cost me hospitalization and when called the manager only cared about getting his keys back. Would not recommend working for this company"
good,"None still work for company, will not give an unfavorable or favorable review while still employed by this company, thank you."
good,"It was a fun Job because you would get to interact with customers , get to figure out the high theft areas of the business ,I would also manage up to 7 employees and get to work with a big company."
good,"Gave prices to customers and sold parts to customers and local businesses, enjoyed meeting different people and talking to them. I got to drive to many different places that I was not aware of."
good,"I started as a delivery driver in the Durango location. The people I worked with actually took their time to teach me about automotive parts. I truly enjoyed the people that I worked with. We had my original manager retire and my district manager changed had changed his job title. When my new manager took over it was harder of a transition then we all thought. But after a few months things were good. It didn't take too long for me to move to counter and become an RSS, only problem was closing late at night (10:30pm) and the pay wasn't worth it.  I miss working there. But only the people that I was working with, not the corporate aspect of the company."
good,"Easy job with pay to match responsibilities. Wash delivery truck, fuel delivery truck, deliver parts and collect payment. Store manager didn't graduate high school and coworkers are retired from real careers and just need something easy to collect a paycheck with. Would've been a better job if I was in high school because this place is far from career material."
good,A typical work day at Oreilly's would consist of delivering auto parts to our customers. When  I was not making deliveries I would make sure the parts were stocked accordingly. As well as being a delivery specialist I performed sales person duties whenever my employees needed help.
good,"Everyone that works at O'reillys has a good attitude and work ethic.  It is a fun place to work, and everyone has an opportunity to learn alot from it."
good,it was great! fun place to meat different people with the same interest in cars and mechanics.
good,"I worked at O'Reilly's for 7 years and the first 4 I loved it.  It got to be a hassle when I became management.  Then I got to see the corporate side of things.  I usually did paperwork in the morning, stocked shelves, answered phones and helped customers throughout the day.  I learned that I did not enjoy dealing with corporate.  Management was ok.  My boss was a good guy who was just too overwhelmed with corporate demands and bad employees.  My co-workers were a revolving door.  They'd come for six months, hate the money and having to deal with customers, and leave.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with corporate and making sure I had everyone's orders correct.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and in turn them asking specifically for you for help.  Very gratifying to know they trusted you with their only means of transportation."
good,The co-workers were not difficult to work with and I enjoy working with people on a day to day basis. The thing I disliked the most was the paperwork on a daily basis that was expected to be completed that day with very little to regard to the daily up keep of the store.
good,"A great work environment around team members, I adore my co workers."
good,"I enjoy the job, but am making $8.50/ hour. I deliver parts and do inventory functions."
good,well you get to know alot of people and experience alot of different car parts and see how to fix problems on a car.
good,it was fun and interesting to get to use a skill set im good at that could help people with auto parts.
good,Managers play favorites.  Seems like not many (if any) women in top senior management.
good,not a bad part time position i am seeking a full time position
good,"The delivery driver part of the store seems to be nonstop, you get your part orders then deliver them, if you have no deliveries your stocking the shelves or helping with the phones."
good,Oreilly's as a company is a good place to work for but I would have to say that some managers could use more train.
good,good pace. mix of stocking and sales. regular customers that got to know the staff.
good,"A normal day includes stocking freight when it arrives, helping customers with their problems and or finding the right part for them. Also making sure the the store is in working condition making sure all the items are stocked in the front sales area and the isle are clean. Also assisting customers with minor repairs (Headlight Bulbs, Battery Replacement, Wiper Blade Installation, etc). I learned many new things most every day, never think you know enough when it comes to automotive repair. Co-workers work great as a team not everyone knows everything about cars, but as a team we get pretty close. The hardest part of the job would have to be the steep learning curve and some customer interaction (most people aren't to happy when their car brakes down and they have to spend money). What I enjoyed most about this job was the ability to help people fix their problems and making sure they got the right parts to fix their car the first time. Also my co-workers where great to work with, a real team!"
good,this was a fun place to wrk for i learned a lot about retail working here i enjoyed it a lot
good,"my typical day was different than some of rmy co workers. I would do paperwork , price chanes, planograms, continue researching for customers from the day prior, answer phones, customer service etc."
good,Good working environment that can have a fast pace at times . Overall compares very well with the industry
good,Running the business in a safe and productive manner. While still keeping attitudes positive
good,O'Reilly's has a great teamwork policy. Almost feels like a family there. Everyone is always so nice and polite.
good,"i love it due to the customers."
good,Pretty descent company to work for solid hours. There are some very good managers and lots of knowledge to be gained if your willing to put in the time.
good,Management is great. you can advance quickly. The culture is extremely followed and customer satisfaction is #1 goal always. High turnover rate. Nights and weekends keep you from family. Lot of responsibility for low pay and high demand.
good,"Very fast paced environment, lots of parts to know and people to work with as a team. Thriving company making more and more each year. Opportunity for advancement if wanted."
good,"I enjoyed my store, management, and helping people with their mechanical needs. It is preferable that you have a mechanical background but not necessary."
good,"My overall experience at O'Reilly Auto Parts has not been the worst experience, in reality it was an experience that allowed me to gain a foothold in the working environment. A typical day at work would be assisting customers to find generic items for their vehicle and stocking product on the sales floor. I learned a decent work ethic and skills in customer service during my time at O'Reilly Auto Parts. Immediate management above me is often staffed with reliable personnel who do their best to be accommodating and understanding. The most difficult part of the job would be the occasional berating from certain customers who are less sympathetic during a busy shift. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the sense of unity or community one would get while working with coworkers."
good,I’m really liked to handle this job with coworkers and I like to helping customers for most they needed answers the questions if the customer asked for help and recommended to them for the parts they wanted
good,"If you're, looking for a job, this is the place if you consistently come to work and do what you're supposed to do its great. The pay is ok it could be better. The benefits are whack and hella expensive. The discount is great for car parts. the culture and and teamwork is really good."
good,"Oreilly auto parts is a pretty decent company, but it really depends on the location. In my location the pay isn't all that, but the team is why I don't have too many problems with it. My manager is an exemplary example of what a manager should be."
good,"I had two managers here at Oriellys. First one, who hired me, was a amazing. She was a genuine human who understood that life happens. Recently went through manager change, as well as labor laws changing, and the new manager didn't seem to care if she lost employees, and tried forcing me to work. Has no sense of care."
good,Its retail. Not a bad place to work but dealing with grumpy customers is draining. Its not as simple as just checking out their purchases. Car knowledge is helpful. Patients is very helpful.
good,"So I technically worked as a parts person, but that was only on paper. Half the time i'd be driving and if I was out on the road not bad but I hated my commercial guy. Think ADD on massive scale, everything HAD to be done this exact way or it wasn't right. Never signed any of the driving papers, liability etc. Manager, region, district they all knew how much an a** my commercial guy was, but cause he did a good job they turned a blind eye. We weren't allowed to drive with our phones at all. Had to put them in a box at the store, and we never signed anything saying the store was liable if they got damaged. We had no breaks and only 30 min lunches, even though we were on the schedule for an hr lunch. I ended up with an extra hr overtime every week if not more. Some stores are good, some are bad"
good,I enjoyed increased knowledge of auto parts and customer service.  I have a knowledge of auto mechanics and working for O'reilly's helped me further understand auto repair.
good,"I'm still currently working st O'Reilly auto parts and the pay I'm getting isnt enough to live on, I'm struggling to get by on my own. I'm looking for a new job."
good,I really enjoyed most of my coworkers and helping out customers but some employees just should not have been there and the manager refused to fire them. It's a good part time job but working there full time it's just not enough money to live off of and the problems are too severe.
good,"Great team work, enjoy meeting new people and assisting them in getting the auto parts needed to get their job done. Management was great, very good in getting you trained and promotes advancement."
good,"Hours constantly fluctuate, no job security and zero benefits. Felt I was treated bad especially since I did my job well. Oh well, go to advance they're better."
good,"Very set in their ways, and unwilling to change the way that processes are done or innovate. Software updates are decades behind with most of their Point Of Sale software."
good,"It was a great place to work, I got fair compensation, benefits, and had a great manager. I did not like having to take my own vehicle to do inventory at other stores. But I did enjoy the group of people that I worked with. They offer great training. They honestly have great company values and try to do anything they can to get the customer what they need."
good,"This is a great place to work if you are looking for career advancement in a fast paced work environment. Anytime your responsibilities are increased, your pay will follow."
good,"It was a great place to be. I worked myself up from a part time driver to an Assistant manager. I'm proud of all of my accomplishments, and my team that stood behind me"
good,Daily vehicle inspection. Fill out driver route trip sheet. Grab receipt from back and pull parts according to order of auto mechanic/auto dealerships. Put up returns and new inventory of parts ordered from DC. Merchandising and experience in loading and unloading gay-lords. Delivery of ordered auto parts  in company vehicle in a timely manner.
good,Working with auto parts. Learning many things about cars. I really enjoyed building and tearing down planograms. Learning about new products we would sell.
good,The job is ok but other companys with the same type of job offer more on pay. The hours are bad for me because I get off so late in the day and work weekends. The people I work with are good to work with.
good,"Oreilly would be good job if they would pay the employees a fair wage. For people who have to pay rent every month and live comfortable, this wouldn't be the best place to work full time."
good,Working here was not a bad. Keep in mind if going to attempt to go to management there will be a lot more required and at times it will seem like too much for even two people to do. This was just not the job for me as I wanted to move into technology to help people.
good,"Manager was great and the team was alright. My only complaint was the pay. I didn't even get that much even though I was considered management. And whether this is just where I am or not, but the customers can be rather misogynistic and condescending if dealing with a woman at the counter."
good,"I was one of few females to work for the company, I was often given management responsibilities but was told I didn't have the authority to delegate tasks as a manager would so I was often stuck doing many tasks on my own. A few of the guys would come out to help me with the tasks when they observed I was having a hard time completing my given list of things to do. Most just sat behind the counter while I did everything by myself.  I was then discharged due to being late because I had an upper respiratory infection and was still coming in to work but had slept through my alarm."
good,"It's a decent job if you willing to work part time as a side job while you have something else to do like go to school. but it does give you the advantage of learning more about car parts and benefits in stock,etc."
good,"Use computer to look up prices for different parts, price quotes change the sign outside for different sales. Restock the shelves, put away new stock in the back."
good,"Type work day, came in at 6:30 am and picked orders in different zone , and would go help a zone that was behind just to get the job done. And would stay if needed too."
good,I love the job I love the costumers and everyone I work with i need to leave because I don't make enough money here the hourly wage is low and full time in this company is only 32 hours i have a baby coming in September 2017 and 32 hrs a week just won't cut it
good,This is a good job. Just looking for a career. I have a criminal justice degree.  I am looking for something I enjoy more along the lines of security but figured something  to get me in the door would be a good start. I have not been with this company long enough to move up. It was just my first job in 10 years. Needed something to get me started on my attendance and job ethic.
good,It was a great place to work just alot of work for what your paid.. the boss is good person and the work people were great.. just left bc of more money..
good,This is a great place to learn teamwork and leadership skills. This company can really take you high places if you show punctuality and great work ethic. The benefits within this job will do nothing but improve your life and your family.
good,I only didn't like  it because I've work there for three years and have not receive no raise. I didn't have enough hours and the pay was horrible. I kept working there until I can find myself a better job.
good,"The normal day consists of customer service,installing batteries and wiper blades. You learn a lot about car mechanics and car parts. Management is accommodating and very flexible with schedules. Hardest part about the job is stocking and dealing with irrational customers at times.Also, for a billion dollar company, O'reillys should invest in better software and hardware in order for employees to better serve customers. It is very frustrating when you are helping a customer and the computer either freezes or crashes. New hardware will be  What I most enjoyed about this job is the work environment and merchandise discounts employers received."
good,"flexable work hours."
good,management plays apart on an employee excelling at this location. Every employ works hard only to be given non-work related criticism
good,"It's pure customer service, guaranteed to stay busy when you start your day. Systematically, it is complexed in operation. This is a company with high expectations from it associates."
good,Learned a lot working here and established and lot of life time friends even meet my husband here. Working here taught me good work ethic and I how to manage money
good,"Had a good time working with this company, Clients were very friendly, co-workers were very helpful although it was very unorganized parts were out of place, and delivery drivers took very long time to deliver parts."
good,"A typical day at O'Reilly's is pretty basic. I clock on, figure out what invoices need to be pulled , correctly pull the parts, decide which one of my co workers and i will be going to and deliver the parts in a timely fashion."
good,"Working for O'Reilly is a really great job. You must be diligent but the work isn't that hard. Decent pay, not on the higher  end of warehouse job pay but not the worst. The benefits seem to be nice at first, but some co-workers are paying $300 a PAYCHECK for health insurance  for a family of 3-4. There could be room for improvement like incentive pay for exceeding productivity. Management has an ""open door"" policy but they don't listen to anything you say anyway. Favoritism is fairly rampant in some departments, and the DC manager treats the supervisors terribly, which sometimes translates into the team members.But the coworkers make the job enjoyable As long as you fly under the radar, it's really a great job"
good,"Considerable time and effort wasted on managers not understanding how the modern web and web-savvy technologies work. Poor planning, limited views, and outdated technologies that make a developer's job that much harder."
good,Overall Just under staffed with people being overwork to the point where people feel as if they no longer have a life. th money is perfect . but you have no time to spend it 6 days of work with 20-40 hour overtime
good,"At O'Reilly Auto Parts, everybody gets along. It's like a family there. Everyday you get treated like you belong and your coworkers make sure you're doing your job right and that you are taking care of."
good,lots of extra training. books and software to help find parts . expanded outside purchase. family friendly . decent schedules .
good,"This is a great company, I was just looking for something with better compensation and looking to be appreciated a little more."
good,As a store manager for this company you will be tested on a daily basis. Setting a daily routine and being able to delegate are key to success . Dedication and a strong work ethic will pay off in the end.
good,you get to meet a lot of great people during a shift. you get to see all different types of vehicles and hear peoples amazing stories about building are restoring a classic to its former glory. you car share you experiences and learn out new and different ways to fix things. you learn so many new things here.
good,Easy work but managers don't know what they're doing at all. you get yelled at for basic stuff. don't expect positive recognition's of hard work. if you work at night you're basically the clean up crew
good,"It's a good corporation with a good culture, but this location has problems with mediocre management.  It always seemed like Inbound and Outbound were competing, instead of working together as a whole team.  The general manager is very nice, but doesn't know how to properly manage his team of supervisors."
good,A typical day starts with getting the paper work and deposit done first thing in the morning. My team member starts at 7am. When she comes in we work on getting the stock order put up and returns are done. I delegate the take for the day that need to get done to all team members . Everyone is happy and working together well.  My favorite part of the day is when we talked as we work and joke around. It is like a family.
good,"Easy to learn systems. They seemed to have a little bit of problems running the stores and keeping up with their quotas, but always made sure we made the best out of every day."
good,Good place to work long as your not looking to make very much money. Good part time job.
good,Even the long days are pleasant with a strong supportive team at O' Reilly's. Even management gets down and dirty with crew members from time to time.
good,"Working for oreilley has proven to be up and down, some days you would have all members contributing. On the other days you would have to work the work of 3 employees."
good,It was a fun experience working at Oreilly’s had met a lot of new people made friends with customers but also was able to connect with coworkers. Friendly and also motivating environment but they strictly enforce the rules so 1 bad will look bad but awesome job to have.
good,"Orielly's was a great company to work for, the team culture they preach is a great way to keep team members happy and the customers as well.  They have a good support system if you take advantage it. The hours sometimes can be overwhelming for store managers, but if you put a good team together that can take care of itself.  It was a very good experience to work for them."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and challenging the coworkers are nice and the management is satisfactory I love the job just underpaid the benefits should be better
good,"Great customer service skills learned and practiced here. Coworkers are fun, easy going and overall great people. Learning the rhythm of the work place is easy and expectations of job duties are mostly realistic and highly expected once you get the hang. Managment is good. Only complaint is the wages and how hard it is to get paid for the amount of responsibilities given."
good,"I worked for the company for over 6 years and during that time I was amazed by the caliber of people that work there. The team environment is wonderful. However, upper management is secretive and don't always do what they say/say what they do. The work I did was highly stressful and desk-bound. This caused me health issues and negatively affected my work/life balance. I was promoted several times during my time there, but only received 1 promotion with a pay increase. If you are salaried, expect to have your time tracked as if you were hourly. Benefits are very good and the job culture is good. You bleed green when you work for O'Reilly."
good,"I've learned allot while working with the company. I like working with the company. Just in search of a better paying job and that will benefit me in the long run, but i will allso like to stay with the company as a part time or suplemental."
good,I thought it was a great job. It depends on what store u are located some managers are wonderful n some just do what they want to do n when u go to corporate they do listen they take the manager side instead of investigating the situation other than that it was fun.
good,"Your experience on the job depends entirely on your local manager. It is retail. You would not travel or attend conferences until you reach management level. Once there, all expenses are paid in full by company."
good,"A typical day of work includes setting out tasks in the morning for jobs that need to be completed that day.  Ensure employees are staying on task and completing their assigned duties. Make sure employees are embracing the O'Reilly culture of great customer service attitude and ""Never Say No"" policy. No two days of work are the same here as each day brings new sales opportunities and new customers to procure for future visits to the store."
good,"A typical day working for Oreilly's is taking care of customers, sometimes busy and sometimes laid back. Depending on how staffed you are, it can get hectic. I've learned a lot by working there. Management is okay, but can be better."
good,i have worked for this company for all together 5 years and they have never walked over my personal life if i had a problem in my family they understood but the pay was not acceptable as a assistant manager i was payed really low and even store managers were paid low
good,They took the time to train me and make sure I was comfortable with my job. Lots of online training as well. Good benefits and commission off you monthly sales.
good,"This is a good job for someone in high school that doesn't have enough hours of the day to study and work. But shouldn't be for adults with more responsibility than a highschooler because they're the ones always arguing about pay whenever its not a career, JUST A JOB!!"
good,"opportunities for advancement were there . Pay for your schooling in field related studies . great discounts for you ! Benefits 401k, insurance, paid time off ."
good,"I was at this job for eight years, I started as a cashier and within one year moved to assistant manager. I was in charge of all paper work, money, and making sure all employee were successful at their job. I loved working with the customers and helping them get what they needed. Its a fast paced environment, we would have customers non stop all day so your are on your feet a lot."
good,"So, O'Reilly Auto Parts is not that bad of a place to work for the discount they give on items in the store are handy. Depending on the time and day of the week, the store can gain some decent traffic and at times can become quick-paced but it breaks the cycle of waiting around and front-facing the store and training. What I learned from this job is that you can gain some very handy skills like working with the P.O.S system, learning more about the brands you surround yourself in everyday and learning to deal with customers on a daily basis. Some words of advice is try to learn as much as you can about the brands you sells and the different vehicles parts you sell because this will be very handy when a customer needs information on certain brands or questions about their vehicle. The work is straight forward enough where it's not that bad, the exception to that is some vehicles need further questioning for parts."
good,The work Environment was awesome but the. the management was horrible the Store Manager was a stressed out ex junkie and was always emotional. Assistant manager was a stuck up who he thought can discriminate everyone by their ethnicity and religion.
good,"Too much time making deliveries/ can't have support delivering. Can't make sales goals if you are gone on delivery. Too much time at front counter, not enough staff."
good,"I was responsible for assisting mechanic shops in ordering and delivering parts and processing returns from the shops. I also maintained delivery trucks and dispatched drivers. I helped management process inbound / outbound freight, and stocked shelves. I was safety and training manager."
good,Sales are one of the most important things in this job that they care about. they continuously push you to do better and compete against other sales people and stores around the district. The management does well in making it feel as a family with holiday bonuses and picnics etc to interact with each other and customers.
good,This job is more for someone that is knowledgeable about car parts and who strives to work hard and be dedicated to helping customers out by supplying the correct car parts to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,Management and support staff always willing to assist in training. Organized training videos scheduled on a weekly basis. Opportunities for advancement only if willing to transfer.
good,"Job was fine. Business was good. Store itself has high turnover"
good,"I worked as a full time employee, i helped with whatever they needed help with, counter, stocking and part delivering. Most of the time I would be on the counter checking out customers"
good,"Fun place to work. the work was kind of demanding on the body with constant lifting parts, however the environment was nice. Job security was there and place of advancement was there as well. pay was some what competitive, however it was okay. offered sick hours, time off and insurance and benefits. company also had stocks and 401k"
good,"Was responsible for getting my truck loaded for accounts out of town.Generally drove 250 to 300 miles a day."
good,"Great company to work for, unfortunately the advancement in position and pay are few and far between. The people are great and the mission of the company is great."
good,"I mean you stay busy thats for sure. You go in at 4:30 a.m. and work until work is finished. No a/c, no water fountains inside of work environment and the dont pay enough."
good,"Loved dealing with customers. I checked in stock, stocked the shelves. Helped people with there car troubles, answered phones. I was mostly an opener but when they needed someone to close I would step in to help out."
good,"Typical day at work is rushing around. Always hustling to get parts for our customers as soon as we can and set them on their way.  Working for this company, i have learned a great deal in regards to work ethic; doing my duties that are outlined by the manager and completing them by the end of shift. Helping customers to my fullest extent and getting them everything they need before walking out the door."
good,"Start of the day I'll sign in to my RF scanner, then scan parts to their stores where there would be going to. After scanning all the parts in, then I would wrap the skids and load them in a trailer."
good,Greeting walk in customers. Answer phones for inquiries on availability for quality auto parts. Stocking freight. Print reports and do cycle counts. Deliver parts to commercial accounts.
good,Great place to work the only problem is that all the knowledge about automobile related things is not rewarded at all. advancement is very very difficult and the compensation is not good.
good,"Everyday started with a pass down meeting with my peers from the previous shift. After that we met with our team members to plan our day and to outline our expectations. The hardest part or should I say our biggest challeges came whem we would have equipment failures such as the conveyor system or some other piece of machinary would go down. But it gave us the opportunity to improvise and adapt. The most joy I get from work is coming up with new and excitng ways to motivate my team. Like presenting the person with the highest productivity with a ""Fake Championship wrestling belt"". They really enjoyed being the Champ for the week."
good,Sell parst to customers.  Build customer satisfaction.  Management was always on track.  Co-workers was easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry cusotmers.
good,"very busy every day,how to work under pressure,some management are more for others, with co-works you'll relalize who your friends are,they hardest parts is trying to take time off from when needed,the most enjoyable part is when you work with some who is a team player and completes our task."
good,Every night I had to inventory all products. Ihad to count all the day money. And I had to close and lock up the store.
good,I just wanna work overtime and get a better pay raise. It's been a good minute I been with the company now it's time to advance. The employees are great. Management cool to. I just wanna be in a good job position.
good,"O’Reillys is a good place to work. Just looking to better my future and move forward. Had to wait on customers, Stock, and clean the store. Was very pleased with management."
good,"Loved working here. However advancement is very difficult with this company. Sadly they re a corporation and they act like a corporation...."
good,"Cashier,customer service,putting freight away & planogram's. I learned something new everyday. Some management is great & some are horrible. The hardest part is corporate don't care about their team members. The most enjoyable part is planograms, cycle counts & inventory."
good,"A typical day would start slow then progressively change after a few hours past. When I got hired I had minimal experience in customer service verbal interaction. I knew what to expect from a job because I was told by employers who work or used to work there, so I learn fairly quickly. I learned to have more interpersonal skills, customer relations. Management was very lacking in their job. The workplace culture and team members were very easy, going very respectful. The hardest part of my job was satisfying the management to advance in the work area. The most enjoyable part is the customers who made the work fun and easy."
good,"I liked working for O'Reilly's, I just moved on to another job. It was a good fit for me, although the warehouse wasn't air conditioned so the summer season was a little tough to endure."
good,"Job wasnt bad, feel like they should hire more people involved in the automotive activities and pay better to provide better customer service instead of trying to pay less knowledgeable people less money to do jobs and give bad service."
good,Good place to work. Culture is great just not enough pay. The management is awesome as well as corporate management. Nothing bad to say at all about the comoany except for the pay.
good,"You really don't know what youre gonna get with the night shift, you might have no customers for the last 2 hours the store is open or it might be too busy for comfort. Decent busywork in place so that you don't end up doing nothing for 2 hours, but it can get boring. The sales incentive program is overcomplicated, and I feel like they designed it to feel like more money than it is. It does motivate you to provide better customer service, though."
good,Have great coworkers. Good store discount. You will learn alot about parts. It's a very fast paced environment. Be prepared to be on your feet all day.
good,"The good customers make this job what it is. The people you meet and connect with turn the spot light away from the fact that it is a job. It is not hard work but it is stressful at times and isn't the funnest place as well. Any job has downfalls, all in all O'reilly Auto Parts isn't a bad place to be in the short haul."
good,"It was a great job, very slow paced but also competitive. The biggest problem was the expectations were too high for how low paying the job was. Although the benefits and discount were great that didnt make up for the amount of pressure that was laid on by corporate."
good,"A good place to work just stuck with the schedule you have they just dont care about what’s going on in your personal life , so if your catcing the bus or need time for family or anything won’t work with you"
good,"It's a good place to work, just be ready for long long hours. They will relocate you like crazy too! The one good thing is that depending on you're experience the pay is good and the benefits are awesome."
good,"Most days we put away freight, do planograms, help customers find parts, etc. The hardest part of my job is trying to make time for everything that needs to get done without it being late."
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is a decent place to work. The management is well structured as well as the O'Reilly Culture Grid. They will teach you everything you need to know about customer service. The only issue I have found is the pay. It is too low for Boulder, CO."
good,"Opened store Opened safe checked everyones till from the night before , made deposits to bank, did returns , warranties , cores ,paperwork check making sure done properly ,shift scheduling, staff training and supervision  learned all of the above ,co workers were dependable, hardest part i would have to say rude people, most enjoyable  happy customers"
good,"I love working for the company especially the management team, Fun environment and the employees got along well with the team and the customers."
good,great job to get experience in electrical testing and fast paced environment with multiple tasks to complete.
good,They give raises but they are smaller each time. All your money is made in incentive. If you don't handle money or certain parts. You don't heighten your incentive.
good,"The company does not pay competitively for a corporate office. Management was good, culture is excellent, compensation is not great. Awesome discounts for immediate family."
good,I loved my job at O'Reillys. I did not like the management however. I was role model employee and was treated otherwise because I am a girl. Other than the sexist nature of management it was an iverall good job.
good,"My job at O""Reilly auto parts is good as I get to drive and talk to customers. The people I work with are good co-workers and we all get along. I learned to have the ability to drive in heavy traffic.  My most enjoyable part of the job is driving"
good,Everyday it’s something new. Everyday I learned something new. Everyone was always great and treated everyone with care. It was a wonderful experience for me!
good,Good place to work would recommend to someone looking for flexible hours . Good vacation time off sick time . Management willing to work to accolade your needs . It's a must check it out for it work experience .
good,My only issue was being open every weekend and on every holiday except Christmas other than that pretty good company to work for. They have a great outlook and the company is rapidly building.
good,Performed quarterly inventory; scanned and validated shipping documents; accountable for stock rotation; interpreted Material Safety Data Sheets; disposed of hazardous chemical waste; received and unloaded shipping totes; handled heavy equipment.
good,The environment the first few days was very gentle and helpful with the rest of the team. All helping each other try and make every day run as smoothly as possible. Never leaving any one job solely to one person everyone helped.
good,It's a great company to work for they do promote from within. Fair job excellent benefits would recommend people to give the company a try. Good atmosphere feels like family
good,My old manager was strict but amazing. My new manager is cool to work with sometimes but I always have scheduling issues. Pay rate sucks. No lunch breaks and always short handed.
good,Good place to work room for advancement rude coworkers poor management. Work there 3 years became a designated trainer put up with rude employees went to management and corporate several times had to quit because it was a terrible environment.
good,"Great local, year round work. Great hours, better than average equipment. Above average pay. Work day is any where from 9 tp 13 hours long. Use a e-jack loading and unload auto parts."
good,"This company teaches you well. You have to be willing to learn, work at a steady but fast pace, treat each customer with respect. Management system is ok but can get frustrating at times"
good,"nice place to work and enjoy working with customers, great discounts for employees and great prices for customer. parts availability is above average com pared to other parts houses."
good,Like working there and the co-workers were great and  love to drive all over town and out of town. It was a great experiences working there. Manager was great boss  and the hardest was only putting up heavy merchandise away.
good,Typical day I would come in the morning and check in stock and put them on the selves. Clean up areas that is needed. Help customer look up products. Check customer out at register
good,I enjoyed my time their. Pay wasnt great but the overall culture was wonderful. I was able to serve the people their needs and still be able to help myself
good,"Shift management was lax. Sometimes they didn't show up.  They are very knowledgeable and some, not all, are willing to help.  The hardest part of the job was stocking heavy parts, the most enjoyable part of the job was employee morale in Virginia, not Louisiana."
good,"Great job, just looking for something more in my interest to further my career. Very flexible with work schedules, offer full benefits, pay is just not what I expect for the amount of work I do."
good,I worked there for a while.. I enjoyed working there the employees were really respectful. The pay was really good..  I would recommend someone to put in an application.
good,Working for OReilly's is nice if you don't have a life. It's long work days that take up every minute of your day and don't allow for any form of life outside of work unless you get a day off. No form of advancement unless the manager decides he likes you enough and they'll work you full time hours without full time benefits. The customers and mechanics you deliver to are nice though
good,"The pay here is very low. The manager has what the workers call ""Ostridge Syndrome."" Meaning he avoids problems instead of dealing with them."
good,"The management at my store was terrible, otherwise it was a fine place to work, especially as a second job for extra money or something. Other stores may be different."
good,The company is great but upper management gets in the way of improvement. There is not much room for advancement. The pay rate is very poor and the benifits are ok.
good,"Always learning new tips and tricks to keep motors in top shape.  From racing, muscle cars to every day drivers, each customer has a new experience that you can learn from."
good,"Find something else if you have a family, not a good environment every one is unhappy and it starts at management. other then that would be a great job."
good,it was a on off job some days were ok and others were awful. easy work but management was not up to par and made work life hard to bare. customers were nice and staying busy was easy. performance reviews meant nothing and the manager always made them look bad.
good,I was making eight dollars an hour and I didn't see that worth in working my butt off for that little amount of pay. If the wrong costumer complains you could get fired.
good,"When I started working for O'Reilly, I though I had found a positive worm environment. All of my co-workers were incredibly nice people, however, management will stab you in the back whenever they get the chance. My manager was incredibly two-faced, and lied to get me fired so a family friend could have my job."
good,it was a good job. i feel i got let go for the wrong reasons but rules are rules even though it may affect your performance. but i liked it i got along with all my co workers.
good,The only challenging thing about this place is being a female and telling male customers how to fix their cars. Everything else was easy.
good,"checked in stock, put up stock, pulled returns, waited on customers, answered phones, stocked shelves, checked batteries, alternators, looked up various car components on computer and in books."
good,"It's fun to meet and greet the customers that come thru,and needs help I be glade to be hands on on and help anther neighbor u never know what's that persin day like sometimes till they come to your work place,you will be amazed how u change a person REAL fast.i mean ur service ur time,and patience with THEM,thays all it takes for great sales and bringing MORE people to come to the BUSSINESS and LOVE the services so they go spend for great quality. Thanks"
good,"Low morale, leadership does not develop the team for benefit of increased sales, or customer experience."
good,High management turn around. IF you ever hear anything like a compliment be prepared to hear something negative. Its part of the culture. I thjink I heard the management style is production through negative feedback. ( not really sure about that)
good,Work place was alright. Fast paced. Very tiring but it all worked out. There very linyents for people who smoke tobacco product. But they didn't like giving over time
good,"I loved my job at oreillys. the job its self was fantastic. Great training, amazing team work, and a great work environment."
good,It's a fun place to work in sort periods. Long hours become stressful and counter productive. The work quality varies from store to store.
good,"a typical day at work would be helping customers find the right parts they were asking for or needed, answering phone call, cleaning and/or organizing everything that needed to be. Everybody did there own thing and asked questions to other co workers if it was needed."
good,The company could afford to treat employees better. But the experience in helping people is wonderful. Compensation and benefits a sorely lacking.
good,"The manager I had was a bully. The job was not a hard one. I dealt with customers, and sold and delivered parts."
good,"Parts availability good"
good,"Busy days, always the best to pass an 8 hour shift. I learned not to let the small things get to you. Management will work with you if YOU are the one to come to them about your issues with the company only. Don't bring drama to your management team, that is your problem not theirs. Drama is not in their job description, customer service and managing team members is. Co-workers were fun to be around, always a lively group. The hardest part of the job is when it is slow and taking intitiave to find things to do around the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is being apart of a team and having people be there for you when you need help. There was never a time that I asked for help and didn't receive it."
good,When I first started my employment there it was a very good place to work but as I progress the opportunity for wage increase was terrible.
good,If you were wanting a job to work part time through college this would a great place to work to put a few dollars in your pocket. Overall there really isn't any room for advancement in job titles or money.
good,Overall company is fantastic loved working here down side would be the occasional unbearable customers but really thats every retail store. Reason for leaving is pay and management. Manager was unbearable and unfair did not want to give raise while wanting to change position with more responsibility.
good,"Good company to work for. Dang hard to get promoted, even if you consistently hit sales goals. Upper management does not engage with the hourly employees, there is little coaching to get the skills needed to advance. I have a bachelors degree in business and broke my back and only earned 12.50 an hour. Getting time off was like pulling teeth- It IS a retail job- so don’t set your expectations too high"
good,The job doesn't pay you nearly enough support your self and you have good day and some day are bad just depending on the weather and what kind day it is
good,It was a good 1st job. I had to close alot which kept me from having a social life. I was promised a move to full time but gave up because it never happened.
good,"Typical day at work included ordering parts, installing headlights, and the occasional battery. I took out the garbage daily, front and faced oil and batteries, spray paint, headlights, and other products that we sell."
good,O Reilly's is a good company to work for they just do not train their staff properly  In all the stores in Wilmington only one of the stores has a manager that believes in training his associates
good,"i learned many things in a short period of time.  The best part was taking pride in the completed work.  i also enjoyed the customers, many knew me by name and that personable relationship with your customers is the relationship i like building."
good,"O'Reilly was a good place to work at. The demands for parts delivery was extremely unreal, but other than that, it was a good place to work. The employee discounts are awesome!"
good,"Locally you have your picks in the store, advancement is unlikely if you are not in the click. The previous supervisor was  totally hard person to work for.  He would barely knowledge you were even there."
good,"Cashier, Stock, Answer phones, cleaned floor plan, look up items out of stock for customers. Helped customers find item through computer search software."
good,not a bad place to work if your not struggling for  money the discounts are good for employees. there are good options to meet new people and to travel to different store to help out
good,Wonderful company with the right people in place! Weak managers make a weak crew! Management is key in this application! Promoting from with doesn’t happen there is no training curriculum or advisor. You have to learn on your own or no someone who works there!
good,I had A good experience at oreillys until i Came into The Management and started seeing How unfair The managers could be towards employees who they no longer want. They will find any little Reason to terminate You.
good,"Bad store manager, great assistant store manager. Easy job, some days went slow and some went fast. Great job to start at if you don't have a family. Hours aren't bad, but the retail sales specialist and a one part timer close the store and are in there 12 pm to 9pm so your whole day is basically stuck there doing nothing."
good,"I worked there for about 6 months. In that time our manager had to move to another store. We were left without a manager for 1-2 months. The higher up management was apathetic at best about it. We had multiple time when employees would steal money, and nothing was done about it, since we had no manager, and LP was busy with other stuff. Overall it was OK for being a retail job."
good,its easy if you know about cars but if you don't you will learn customers are rude and mechanics. pay is great management is not. one thing i did like are the people that work there
good,The best part of the job was interacting with the customers and getting them the right part for the job. The part about the job I disliked was management let the employees run the store how they wanted.
good,"I enjoyed working at Oreillys most of the time. The manager tried to accuse me of stealing once. I did not really appreciate that. Management reaps all the salary pay, but was hardly ever at work. I enjoyed my coworkers and customers I met. The work was easy."
good,It's a great company to start at but their really is no advancement and no raises. I've been their almost 3 years and have not gotten any kind of raise. It's a really easy job but just no future in it.
good,"I enjoyed learning about cars, helping the customers, and the training that was available. I did not feel higher management was at all appreciative of the work I did which was the hardest part of the job. My reviews were all perfect but I needed honest criticism too."
good,It wasnt the best place to work. Management was not really taking care of the workers. I learn how to deal with customer  and brake down there problems.
good,"A typical day at work was fairly slow and easy but upon coming in, nothing was done by the day crew (I worked nights), and nothing was ever put back where it was supposed to be. I was left to do other employee's jobs because they were lazy. In-store management was fairly decent. The store manager tried her best to do the best she could for all employees but was also very unprofessional at times. The district management was wholly unprofessional and, I believe, sexist. My co-workers had great personalities, were fun people, but were very very lazy. The hardest part of that job was dealing with the messes other employees left for me to fix while still doing 2 other people's jobs, while the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and saving people's days."
good,I closed the store every day that worked . I learned a great deal about people and customer service.
good,I really enjoy dealing with my regular customers.
good,"This is mainly a job for anyone whom is available. Fairly easy to someone whom is familiar with computers, auto parts and automobiles. Good for part time job"
good,The manager I was working for did not have any compassion for the employees and there needs. The company is a great company if you have the right management team.
good,Working for the company was very easy going and sometimes fun. No real complaints. Hardest part of the job was working with irate customers that were hard to reason with when it came to parts for their vehicles. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and getting to know their vehicle's needs.
good,"You would think this would be a great company to work for... No, need new inspiring management for the 21st century. They all live in the past and it is not the same era anymore."
good,Easy job to get. Not enough pay for the work required. No vacation or sick time for first year there. Unorganized management. If your looking to advance you can at their convenience.
good,"quick-paced, allot of retail work, customer service one on one. learn about part and functions on vehicle maintenance. Good co-workers here. fun and active workplace."
good,"Laid back, relaxed and friendly environment. Overall good but not enough pay. Management not supportive of personal or professional growth. Long time to grow professionally and financially."
good,I loved working there. At the end they changed managers and it was the worst mistake they could have done. Had to relocate but I quit before I even had to because the new manager and the original district manager were horrible.
good,"This company doesn't really pay enough to be considered a living wage without having a second source of income.- Unless you live in a highly populated area to make a large commission which is extra on top of hourly pay."
good,"After working for O'Reilly Autoparts for nearly 3 years, after going up in status I still did not receive a raise until I myself mentioned it. They were not compassionate at all and do not know the meaning of family/work ratio."
good,Most people think auto Parts is easy until you really get into the job itself; but I also learned that everyday it self was a very good learning experience & there was never not one day that would go by that I didn’t learn anything new
good,"Steady work flow, relaxed, fast paced environment. Multiple departments to work in, opportunities to grow with the company without a degree. Management was shady and two faced."
good,The most difficult part of the job is dealing with certain members who talk down to other members and feeling as thought nothing will be done because of their higher position.
good,"I am a bit Jaded as I was Target hired from their biggest competitor in the market. I opened trained and hired in 6 locations immediately following arriving in market. I took my own location from Grand opening to twenty five thousand a week in DIY and 10,000 a week in commercial in a industrial placed location. this was still part of a grander plan as myself and 4 other senior managers were systematically removed over a period of a year and replaced with GMs working for 10-13.00 per hour. we were used as foundational staff to get their market moving and as an aside to weaken their biggest competitor."
good,"Its a better place if you have friends there. To cover your shift, or to just show up for there own shift so you can leave on time. Hours aren't steady, everyones always complaining, managements never around."
good,"Was A Very good Company to Work For, Very Easy And Helpful employees. Parts Are Very Esy To Find. The computer system was very easy to understand.And also learned a lot about cars."
good,"Its a good place as an entry level environment to learn automotive retail. i learned may things as customer service, and the work palace its fair nothing out of the ordinary just plain computer look etc.i typical day at oreillys will be open up and check up on daily routine on company trucks."
good,"As long as you can overlook the constant breakdown or equipment, then you would be ok to work there. Basically just an easy job scanning parts into a container."
good,"I have learned many things, I am heading upward towards management. Co workers are great. Pay is horrible. Its a fast paced job. Commision is great to"
good,Good place to be it's just that you have to be really good friends with management in order for them to give you a raise. They work with your outside schedule so that's good
good,the people you work with are great. but as a company in whole its a horrable company to work for they constantly give you a run arround and dont care about the people that work for them
good,Oreillys is a team work place. Good place to work and gives you a lot of on hands training.  Knowledge of vehicles  is very helpful in this job.  However if your not knowledgeable the training here will help you a great deal.  Fast pace at times.
good,I learned more about cars and I have appreciated that aspect. I was the only girl and got treated like the little sister. the hardest part of the job is trying to help a grumpy customer find a part to a system you dont understand. they don't train you on the systems.
good,"Management was ok. Other than that, It was a great experience. I did learn how to put wipers on a vehicle. I would not work there again even if they asked me to."
good,has good and bad just like anywhere management is expected to work a lot of hours much more than what they tell you you are compensated well
good,"The general manager had a God complex, but my direct supervisor was a good guy. Its a typical auto parts sales job. Most customers are upset because their car is broken down, but it always feels good when you can help someone out and sell them the fix they need. Most of the people I worked with were fun and knowledgeable."
good,"Personally my store manager was awesome. He went to bat for me on multiple occasions. But he couldn't beat the District Manager or Regional Manager, so I had to leave to find something better for me and my children."
good,Nice company to work for. Many locations and great opportunities. Flexible with hours. Great management. Open to learning more.
good,"good place to work, good management, works well with my schedule. good coworkers, the pay could be a little better and the benefits could as well."
good,Work environment is friendly. Overall a good place to work. A typical day is based around customer service and sales. Working at here really helped me fine tune management and leadership skills.
good,Manager was awsome. My coworkers rocked.  Almost everybody was willing to be part of a team to assist customers. Perfect place to work if you are looking for a challenge every day
good,"With a quick pace and always something to do, the days go by quickly. The freedom to move around and help customers makes for a good work environment."
good,"The company is an okay company who's focus is supposed to be the customer but in reality its all about sales and making numbers. Over my time here I have learned a lot about cars and the many parts it takes to keep our daily drivers going. Most of the time there is poor communication from Management and Upper Management. All day we get customers who are already upset that their car isn't working, when they come in were supposed to sell them what they need to do the whole job and up sell them while your at it. Often people leave feeling used. Days when everything goes smoothly makes the job worth it, especially when your customer leaves with a smile and you really feel like you've helped them."
good,Fun job but need full time work.Great discount on auto parts and really enjoy dealing with our commercial customers in the field.
good,I learned more about automotive parts and other products sold at the store. Store management was easy to get along with. The job entailed repetition on a daily basis but also some days presented new challenges. The hardest part of the job was finding the correct parts at times when customers were not sure on vehicle information or the exact thing they were looking for because it was a custom fix.
good,"I check in the merchandise that comes on the daily truck, then put it away. I assist customers in finding the right parts for their vehicles."
good,"a typical day"
good,O'Reillys boasts a impressive amount of part numbers to the public and the garages it services however the truth behind the myth is that we spent more time buying parts from our competition than anything else
good,This company was a great company to work for the customers were great.
good,"it was a fun job and i was made manager ,but the store managers they hire dont talk to there employees as much as they should and make sure they can be on the same page ."
good,"you are expected to be an parts expert with no training, then when the customer asks to you to fix their car because their incompetent on how to you the employee has to go out in the parking lot to try to aid in anyway possible to make the customer happy. Doing what ever it take to make them happy and after installing batteries, lights, refrigerant, water pumps alternators pulleys serpentine belts fuel pumps and running diagnostics your pay does not compensate for the labor out in the parking lot being a mechanic. Also not having the proper work environment plays a huge part in it. No lifts, no proper tools, and no place to safely work on the vehicles. ie laying under a vehicle changing a starter while another customer comes flying in the spot u have your feet hanging out in. Then your pay is on competitive salary making taking money out of your pocket while you fix their cars taking business away from the local shops that depends on you for just parts. The hardest part of the job wasn't looking up the parts it was the installation of the parts that wasn't in the job description. also being a paint mixer answering phone calls both walk in customers and the professional customers line while helping the customers both in the store and outside of the store. Too add to the frustration most of the customers didn't know what make model or motor size their car was compounding the problem of trying to assist in helping them with their car troubles. At the job i learned that working at an auto PART store is just parts you are required to be a mechanic and machinist and paint mixer as"
good,Doesn't pay well and dont give raises when they should.They always do your evaluation late and your raise is never on time and it's never the amount they say they were supposed to give you
good,The crew in Montana was amazing but some of the crew in Idaho were not so great  I liked the job in Montana. I would probably still be there if not for low income
good,"It's a good starting job , but if you go any higher than counter person.   Management abuses you left right and center.   After being there for 3 years and having an excellent track record, I was accused of stealing $8 worth of merchandise, without proof and my job was threatened.  I was also told Sundays off would not be a problem but that lasted no more than a month."
good,I still enjoy the working with Oreilly's crew working with and getting solutions is what is interesting to me.. I am very self motivated and working with a changing industry is always fun.
good,a person has to be able to think outside the box as well. Customer service a priority. proper training and safety standards are made available. my most enjoyable part of the job was good rapport with the customers and making sure they got the right parts to them as fast as possible and in good condition.
good,If you like cars or you're building something. It is definitely worth working here. The discount alone saves you a ton in parts money. It can be slow. I usually would put together orders for commercial clients while closing. But as a career... Don't do it
good,"Would be a great company to work for if it had better management!  Don’t pay the employees what they’re worth, in my honest opinion. Offers benefits to purchase, which is great, but with the pay a person makes, can’t take advantage of it!"
good,An ok company to work for if and when there is good management in the store that is equal to all employees. I personally don't recommend a woman to work in that kind of place.
good,"You will get called in, at inconvenient times. Be sure to set up your personal schedule beforehand. Hot during the summer, Cold during the winter. The position is easy."
good,"Stocking incoming shipments, must answer phone within 3 rings weather you’re speaking to a customer at that moment and was not allowed to put phone call on hold. Always insulted by customers, which they claimed was part of the job. Looking up models of vehicles for parts, unfortunately customers didn’t know what parts they needed so it did include inspection of their vehicle. Hardest part of the job was to takes vulgar insults all day. Most of the time, no motivation from employees or managers."
good,"If you like helping people you will love working here, and working on cars. Have a hobbies and help people all at the same time. Fast paced fun people."
good,"A normal day at work would be spent at the front counter assisting customers finding parts. New sales signs would be put up each month, pallets of new product would come in each day before we opened and most of the day would be spent, eventually coming back to the pallet to continue the constant flow of parts. End of the day, I would count the safe that should stay at $900 for change in the registers, setting the store alarm and locking the door behind me."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working at O'Reilly's. I loved getting to help people find the right parts to get their car working again and sending them out the door with a smile on their faces. I learned a lot about cars and car parts while working there.
good,First and foremost I love O'Reilly Auto parts and continue to shop there I started working as a store manager in Greenville South Carolina the district manager is a great guy and most of the store managers are awesome the store I took over had been neglected for well over a year and had some very disgruntled employees I tried my best to train them and to turn the store around in the end I found the job was just too stressful and then step down my advice to O'Reilly Auto parts higher pay and train the best and fire the rest don't let warm Bodies take over the stores
good,"O'Reillys is a great company to work for, good benefits, very easy to learn.For parts specialists and lower management the hours are very flexible , the staffing is a bit touchy seeming as there is always a shortage of team members putting more stress on upper level management."
good,"It was an alright work place, pretty slow paced and boring but not terrible. The manager is the main reason I left. So not a terrible place to work but I wouldn't make a career out of it."
good,"Deliver parts to shops that are not able to stop working and pick up their parts from the store, they are able to continue working until parts arrive. The order is billed out on the computer and paid for through direct billing."
good,"First of all, the work is easy and easy to do. No one comes in and does one sole responsibility. However, as I advanced my role at the company I noticed I had reached my paramount position and would go no further. The manager is willing to work with you on hours and your schedule, but it makes no sense if the following weeks your hours are cut. I found on some occasions favoritism and special privileges doled out to employees. The work gets done by people who are really cleaning someone else's mess. I would love to know what job culture exists because for the past three years of employment I have sadly never seen it."
good,Good culture and place to work but for the knowledge and work you have to have and do the pay is not worth it. They also give 24hr of paid vacation after 6 months full time witch is awesome and also have good discounts for employees and good benefits.
good,I work very hard for this company and I enjoy it but the upper management people are one sided they don't fix the problems they brush them away. The team members are great it's only management that work against you instead of with you.
good,"Oreilly is a decent place to work but very little to no communication"
good,Regular customer service job. Typical retail and dealing with numerous types of people. The work place was mainly relaxed with occasional busy and stressful days. Good management and leadership. I was only part time so I did not have full time employee benefits. Great employee discounts.
good,The distribution center is very high-paced and very stressful due to a high population increase in the area. Co-workers were friendly and I was taught my task very well.
good,"Was told ""Skys the limit"".  Wrong.  Very rare they promote within.  Hiring friends and turning it to a chill spot.   Down hill over past couple years."
good,O'Reilly's is a good place to work as long as you have the right management team. Benefits are good. Pay is alright as long as you don't live in a poor district or region. Offers good paid time off.
good,pretty busy but their isnt great pay compensation for the position you are in. you are expected to do multiple positions because they are severely understaffed.
good,If the manager would take control of his store. Instead of letting some do nothing at all and the others had to out perform. Some could be on their phones alday and others would be wrote up.
good,If you need a driving job this is right up your alley.  The job is really determined by who your working with.  Anyone can do it as long as you show up and drive safely.
good,"Honestly this company isn't that bad. One of the best things is you get a good discount on your car parts if you ever need to buy them. But, there are a lot of things that need to be straighten out or at least at the stores that i worked out they needed to and they weren't getting taken care of."
good,Not bad but not great. It could be better but isn't.  People expect you to be a Mechanic.  Good to have knowledge of cars.  I'm just trying to fill in enough characters to finish.
good,"O'reilly is fun to work but to much favoritism from supervisors and they expect to much out of there employees, O'reilly don't follow there own policies and if you end up working for them don't expect honesty nor respect, one day they would say one thing and another day another, giving your opinion can get you fire or they will retaliate against you, is O'reilly's way or the high way."
good,"There really is no room to advance, such a dead end job I have been there for just about two years and will not ever be considered for full time. Upper management always has a new reason/excuse but they will hire transfers from other stores (mostly men) full time. Other than upper management its a great place to work."
good,"My opinion it's a good company.  A tyical day doing replenishments and stocking batches within the alloted word period. I believe the management could be a little more strict and make sure everyone carries their own weight and not put the pressure a few of its team members. I get the feeling its every man for themselves,  they are more worried about producing numbers than making sure their team members are taking care of.  I don't like how certain team members are catered too and I believe that the supervisors need to be brought through the supervisor training on favoritism. My most enjoyable part is knowing that I get my job done within the 8hr shift.  Hardest part is picking up the slack for others."
good,Overall the job is a good one. I enjoy the people i work with but i would just like it to be more than what i have there. I'm thankful for the job i have there.
good,"A good work environment, with flexible hours while in schools.This job allows me to grow and develop my management skills."
good,"One of the most exiting places to worked loved helping customers and see them came back for you, because you gave them great service and make them smile."
good,I was a fun job but it had its drawbacks like all retail sales jobs tend to have. I do not trust any management above store management however and feel that they are the biggest hindrance to the company.
good,"I was in management so I must say it wasn't that difficult everyone did what they had to do ,so it made work much easier."
good,"This job keeps you busy doing many different aspects such as answering phones, cashiering, part look up, checking cars and scanning them and of course inventory. I do learn different things about cars and how they work from our professional customers who are mechanics. It's always a laid back feeling when i am working which makes the work that much easier."
good,It was a nice company to work for but there were no real opportunities for advancement and the pay could have been better.
good,"Retail, liked helping people with auto issues. learned planograms and store set ups. Overall good company to work for."
good,Very busy motivating work place. We all work well as team. Most enjoyable part of my job is able to answer questions helping customer fix their vehicles.
good,This work environment was inspiring and full. I learned how to manage a staff of ten and how to develop a marketing strategies. My initial introduction to management was clearly one of admiration inspiration. Some and unfortunately not all co-workers were very fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was building a new auto parts brand in a already saturated market. The most enjoyable part was everything else.
good,When I started with O'Rielly's it was a great group of people. After they bought csk it seemed to change. They went from what was a company that seemed to let you actually manage your location to a micromanaging company. I am honestly not happy with the changes they have made concerning comercial customers. We went out and promised accounts we would not be taking business from them by pulling codes ext. and today we are doing just that. I went to work for O'Rielly because of this.
good,aside from the pay and the advancement potential the company is a great place to work. You multitask and wear many different hats in a day. It is a very technical company by the nature of what you are doing and provides challenges for people who like to solve problems and solve puzzle type options.
good,"You have to be willing and anxious to work here.you have to know differences in auto parts you also have to make your sales dor the month, it benefits if you are an automobile mechanic."
good,not a lot of paper work but you do not recieve good pay they keep pushing the commision pay on you to sale more and you will make more waiting for a better paying job to open
good,Always seemed like we needed at least one or two more employees than we had. Never time to get everything done in the store and help costumers at the same time.
good,"The job itself isn't bad, the pay isn't the best though. Experience can vary a lot depending on manager and district manager in the particular store and area. Least favorite part of the job would be the pay. Even though I knew a decent amount about cars before starting, I have learned a tremendous amount while working there."
good,"Depending on which location you work at, depends on how much money you make. The commission is good, the company is a good place to work. Overall the company is about making sure their employees are taken care care."
good,My experience there was like any other auto parts store. I just did not like how new management decide to play favorites and run his store. I was under payed for what tasks I had to do.
good,The job is okay. You deal with a lot of unhappy people and the management is poor. Pay is awful but benefits are okay. Best part about the job is the discount on parts.
good,"Knowledge of the area a must. Management change recently. Be ready to drop whatever you're doing and get parts delivered ASAP. Sometimes extremely busy, so work out how to manage your time the best way possible."
good,"Sales of parts to commercial customers for normal, special orders, and bulk orders. Take orders for parts not normally available to the public. find parts for vintage vehicles"
good,"A company based on great culture ideas rarely implemented by upper management.  Upper management will move team members from your store, sometimes to the point where it causes your customer service levels to suffer. Of course the UNSPOKEN expectation is for the store manager to take up that slack. Upwards of 65 hours a week is not unheard of."
good,"Oreilly is a fast paced environment where the team around you makes all the difference. A team members experience will vary depending on the location. Oreilly does pay over time to hourly associates but with the amount of tasks and goals set, the salaried managers have to work long hours."
good,My most enjoyment while being employed with Oreilly's was working in the hub. I had a great supervisor.  But when transferring to front counter the atmosphere had changed.
good,It's a fun job and depending on the manager it can make a difference whether they are flexible or not other than that it's not bad. It can be a relaxed environment.
good,"an average day is answering calls, servicing customers and stocking and locating parts. on busy days it is none stop and you could get behind if you do not stay on top of stock."
good,"A typical day Insists of:"
good,Just like any job there are ups and downs. Most stores have decent people working there. They have really good products. there is a loaner tool program that is very useful
good,It is a good working environment to work in but fast-paced and stressful at times when dealing with some of the customers you deal with on a day to basis.
good,I cannot review them super in depth with my experience due to the highly personal interactions that were of the negative nature between other employees.
good,yea because yea and yea it was for my College days so yea it worked out pay was pad so yea i left and yea it sucked but yea after i got another job i did not miss it so yea
good,"I like the laid back environment, however it can get hectic at times. They pay is alright but if you’re looking for benefits, full-time is the best way to go."
good,A typical hub store job. Time sensitive delivery schedule with little room for delivery problems or added pick ups during route.always have added deliveries to pick up at route stores to take to other stores.
good,"Clear expectations and easy to accomplish work, days sometimes dragged on during slow periods. Company has constant growth and advancement is usually within reach if you are willing to give up control of a schedule. Not much for extra benefits other than the access to automotive information, diagrams, etc."
good,"The 'Management Team' was more about sales then customer services or employee job satisfaction. Played favorites with school classmates. Had different clicks, that shut out certain people from joining."
good,Generally a good atmosphere. Pay scale wise this would be better suited for someone who is just starting out not someone with a family and larger bills.
good,Awesome repeat customers but terrible recognition from upper management on job performance. There was not much of a home life as i spent up to 6 days a week working.
good,Good job but if u have to go out on leave because of health issues they turn their back on you. Multitasking all day everyday. Enjoyed working with the public.
good,you day will mostly consist of stacking items while you're not busy helping customers. Other times you'll be busy cleaning or running errands to other businesses. Its nothing to stressful but its tedious and gets old pretty fast.
good,i liked the people I worked with.  I did have a good 401K.  The salary increases are small but they do give increases. The store is on the main Route in Belvidere so easy travel.
good,"Working at O'reilly gave me the opportunity to learn so much about the auto industry and how everything is connected from the auto parts to mechanic shops to dealers."
good,It can't be fun some days and stressful the next. No breaks only 30min lunch. Minimum training to new members of the O'Reilly team. Not allowed to had a set schedule or days off.
good,"It’s a good place to start out in the auto field, not a place to stay and make a career out of, I learned a lot in the time I was there from the company and customers"
good,"always moving around"
good,A good company but poor local management and low compensation for work provided.   Decent benefits and discounts. Big disconnect between corporate and regional policies and how they are instituted.
good,It's a good place to work but there are some cases where management could be better and some policy don't get followed even though they are put there for a reason
good,"At the time i worked there the General Manager was horrible at training or helping others out. He wouldn't lift a finger to help anyone willingly and understanding it was a team effort. Although, every chance he got he wanted to make sure who the people were to be the back breakers and who was suppose to bring in the big money for his commission check."
good,"I loved working for O'reillys. It was fast paced yet relaxed, as long as you do your job. My manager was awful, but that was just him. I loved the people I worked with. Just bad timing for me to get injured."
good,I loved working in the fast pace environment. They could have done a little better with management. they had way to many managers in one area at one point.
good,"Mostly inventory, stocking and customer service. Gained parts experience. Management wasn't the greatest at the store I worked at. There weren't really many hard parts to the job. The best part for me was helping people."
good,"This job required standing on your feet and walking all day. It is a very fast paced job, depending on the day, but you always had something to do. "
good,Not a bad business to work for if you are interested in the Automotive industry. Working in retail is also something everyone should do at least once for a few months.
good,The manager chelo is very rude and underhanded. The employees are not given enough hours or advance. customer service is good and the people who work there are friendly.
good,"Have to deal with a lot of customers and calls, need to be able to type and search through the stock and database quickly. general knowledge of cars will make this job a lot easier"
good,I loved my job. My co-workers were all amazing people. The only reason I left was due to the manergers irrational behavior towards my availability. When I left I missed it greatly and want to go back but with a different manager.
good,I put myself as all 3 positions because we don't have consistency. Im supposed to be a driver but i do the merchandising by myself and also end up at the counter helping customers. I always get the job done. Its just stressful at the end of the day. Oriellys is a good place but just not at the Moment.
good,There are so many things that are good with this company and there are so many that are bad. I had a good experience but I knew that it was time for me to look for something better.
good,"Typical work day, go in deliver parts to shops they are not close together so you do have a lot of time on the road. I have learned that no matter how hard you try you cant please them."
good,"It depends on what department you work with, other department are easy and others are hard and has the heavier part of the job."
good,"I learned quite a bit working for this company. Both from employees and customers. On the other hand work load was a bit too much for the pay. The knowledge to work here about knowing automotive is not compensated, it is as if you were working at a McDonalds."
good,"over all this job is fun, really enjoy helping people out, to make sure they get the job done right."
good,"I get parts ready for delivery check in stock from DC warehouse, answer phones, locate missing parts, make sure driver's are on time and taking accurate parts, give keys and gas cards to out of town drivers, can be fast paced at times I am sometimes left alone with all duties"
good,I love working in this field. I like working for the company. The down side of this job is you don't get paid enough for the work that I do here. To find employees is hard because the pay is so low.
good,"It was a good place to work, Not paid very much, but there is a lot of overtime, high turnover, good guys to work with, Manager was great, good employee discount."
good,"I enjoyed working with all the personnel.The job itself was fun and challenging."
good,"I worked by myself a lot, but that is how I enjoyed working. Hardest part is the driving long distances. The hours are great but the pay is not the best. Management tries to work with you but isn't always the best."
good,Fun place to work at. But the district managers fire people for little to no reason. They overwork their employees and underpay them. Understaffed at many locations
good,"Very good, fun and easy jobs. Dealing parts was great. The hours were also good and convenient, not to long but not too short. Pay was alos okay for a easy job."
good,It was a great place to work. I loved it!! up until they got a ne manager. the new manager wouldn't work with me on court dates and legal meetings that I HAD to go to. I had to find other work a place that would work with me on these things so I left.
good,Fun environment. I stocked shelves overnight and helped a few late night customers. Management worked with you to accommodate personal life schedules.
good,You get out what you put in. Growing company with High paying positions being created daily.  Acheivments are usually recognized with promotions as long as the ability to handle more is there.
good,I love my job. I've worked for O'Reilly's almost  4 years.  The job can be very entertaining at times. You do have to deal with customers and at times they aren't in the best of moods.  I was in a bind and homeless and the company helped when they could.They also were very flexible with my situation.  O'Reilly Auto parts is more than a job in many ways they've became family.
good,This job gives you the opportunity to assist customers with basic mechanical assistance.  You help customers find the parts they need for repairs or upgrades.
good,Very little advancement opportunity and constant pushing to get people to buy products they don't need. Got knocked down to 6 hours a week over complaints that I had no control over. Management shuffles positions around constantly
good,"Helping customers get the parts they need. If not in hand order the parts for them. Overstocking merchandise, cleaning and sweeping . Assisting customers with replacing headlights, brakelights, adn batteries. Testing batteries, alternators and starters."
good,"good company overall, but the inbound management team is terrible. poor leadership and favortisim is rampant, along with compulsive lying. you cant respect leadership like that."
good,"It was a good job,I just wished it paid better.  I enjoy helping people and I am a car guy.  If I ever do retire I'll do it again on a part time status."
good,"Good part-time job for anyone having automotive parts experience. Delivery is good for any retiree needing to supplement income a little. Do not expect to start out more than $9.00 per hour regardless of past experiences unless you already have your degree or are currently seeking it. Full time job is best if you need benefits and good job security. Be prepared as the highest comprehensive tier of medical coverage will cost about half of your gross income, although it is fairly good coverage. A typical day at the counter positions in the busiest stores require lots of multi-tasking and sitting is not allowed."
good,Great place to work and learn about autoparts and different ways you can meet new people and help other team members to advance on their knowledge  of automobiles
good,"On a daily basis we would get many rude customers coming in asking many questions with reasonable answers, but for some reason even though you are the one that gets paid to know automotive vehicles your answers will always be considered wrong. I don't blame the customers to much their demographic is always on edge with financial instability. When it comes to the workers most of us are always hard at work while you might have those bad apples that just like to sit around and not move a muscle. Like I always say if you have time to lean you have time to clean."
good,"I worked at the oreillys in Muskogee straight out of high school. I was the typical parts kid that I hate to talk to now that I'm older. "
good,"i learned that almost all vehicle owners really have no idea what they are doing. I have heard stuff that cost people buckets of cash simply due to pure stupidity, and everyone has a story about a customer that ruined his engine by not knowing anything whatsoever about a vehicle they have driven for years. The job was tedious and unfulfilling while being mocked for not really caring about all the little details between the makes and models outside of the minimum required to sell parts accurately."
good,Drove to various shops from Ogden to Provo Utah.  Learned new routes within the state.  Hardest part of the job dealing with traffic and finding new places.  Easiest part of the job was loading/unloading parts.
good,Decent company to work for. Job growth makes this a job to think about. Good benefits and great employee discount. Family owned company.
good,"The workers were nice and very helpful. They helped me with anything I didn't know what to do. "
good,"Good work environment among retail workers. Workers are happy to help new hires learn how to do their job effeciently. Lack of compensation hurts the turnover rate. Store is unable to keep Assistant Manager, Retail Service Specialist, or Counter workers for any extended period of time. Lack of employees often hurts scheduling for night and weekends which causes closing and weekend workers to not be able to properly help customers. Employees are often not given raises when promoted. The store has one of the worst raise rates in the area."
good,"Count drawer in money make sure you start out with $100"
good,"Excellent company to work for, especially if the store you work in has a good management staff to work under."
good,Working for O'reilly's was a learning experience in itself but I had a wonderful manager whom taught me so many things. He set me up for success and I admire him for that.
good,"Working outside in all weather was great, I like to drive. I got along with everyone and there was enough work to keep busy. The hardest part was there was no benefits and only part-time hours."
good,"Parts courier, deliver and pick up auto parts to local shops, customer, inventory, in store cashier. Awesome co workers"
good,"My typical day at work includes my running around in the truck driving from our warehouse to our surrounding stores to drop off ordered parts, and also putting up the back stock that we have. My co-workers are awesome, the management is OK at times. The hardest part of my job is that as part time I don't get benefits or more hours other than 29 hours. The most enjoyable part is the people, and the facts I get to wear my blue jeans."
good,"As much as the lower management tries to compensate, they cannot  make up for the corporate offices decisions that often disregard the safety and needs of its employees. Employees at the store level show varying degrees of training, but each store is given the individual tools to succeed."
good,Selling car parts in a difficult area of town.  I learned that there are no secure full time jobs in retail sales.
good,Helped open and close store and did anything the manager asked of me.
good,"a typical day at work dealt with assisting customer with sales of merchandise needed to get their car back into order, lots of talking and laughter, making them comfortable and wanted to come back to the store, dealing with coworkers was ideal, keep the atmosphere full of work and enjoyment and it was done quickly so other areas of the store were dealt with, the hardest part of my job I didn't have one I enjoyed the people I came in contact with they were like family,"
good,"I enjoy the people I work with and have fun at my job.  Putting up stock daily, daily returns.  I am a hard worker and go above and beyond when I do my work daily."
good,"I kept myself busy. Id walk the isles and see what needed to be stocked. Do inventory cycle counts. Get things ready for up coming monthly sales, price changes. They needed more management training. I learned a lot about  customer service. I got along with everyone."
good,"Oreilly Auto Parts is a company with good values but it falls short in its treatment of its people. I was hired on as a Manager from the beginning but was never given any formal training or instructed on the most basic of my expected job functions. As a result I have been consistently blind sided by procedures that effect my morale and commission. I find it disheartening that a company with the values it claims to have would treat any team member in such a manner. I work with some of the best ""Parts People"" in the business. It would be a pleasure to do business with Oreilly in the future. Unfortunately as a career choice they have failed to gain my loyalty. "
good,job is well working with a bunch of kids who dont know how to listen or have any work ethic 
good,"My store was understaffed the majority of the time I worked there.  I was one of two knowledgeable people on staff and our sales numbers reflected that, but never was properly compensated for it.  At the sales level, this is a tough company to work for."
good,Enjoy one on one with customers. Like to be able to help them with their automotive problems.
good,"provide care for patients inside their own homes, rather it was self conflicted or born with disablilty, age was not an issue. We fead, bath, dressed, cleaned, and their were some that could go to further extents of giving meds and providing 24/7 care"
good,When I was working there I learned multiple new things each and every day. There was some bad days but most of them were good. You know most everyone that came through the dot and was always able to talk to them about anything
good,"Very helpful work staff, everyone wants to help each other succeed. I enjoyed being able to ask for help and not being talked down to because i didn't know how to do something."
good,Within the first day you understand your responsibility and everyone is willing to help you understand your job task. A easy place to work with little to no problems.
good,Working at O’Reilly Auto Parts is very alright. Must be good with customer service and know some about cars also helps as well as it is an automotive business
good,A low paying entry level job that is a great way to begin a career in the automotive field with reasonable expectations for workers and a focus on providing excellent customer service.
good,I love going to work every day . I'm always learning there all the time. Management is always fair to you. I love dealing with the public. And I also loved putting up inventory. But you are on your feet so much it definitely wears you out.
good,In this company there are many different aspects of the company to learn and grow learning about auto parts and how I can take this knowledge with me outside of work.
good,"The company was great to work for. I would recommend it for people who love cars, and want to engage with other who do. But management were a little difficult to work with, there at time a lot of favourites"
good,Loved driving everyday. Loved dealing with the people and the shops. Had a fast pace environment which I loved. Love working with my coworkers. Left because found better opportunities
good,There good open job to learn about cars and be able to grow in the company you have the drive you can do places all the way to the top. There great to work during your school
good,Oreilly was fun energetic but definately designed for men not women..they are a bunch of good old boys and women are better off as secretaries not as their equals.but if you can get past that it was fun.
good,I was able to learn different tips about cars and how to maintain my own car. There’s so many parts that are required to keep a car running and it was important to learn and be knowledgeable about automobiles. Customer service is very important there because there are other stores and it can be competitive but also we all helped each other out.
good,"A good place to work, dealing with customers and working to find the right parts for them. Management is caring and works well with employees to help with their needs."
good,Working at O'Riley's is fun and fast place to work can be slow at times never run out of stuff to do good team work and good incentive program to make more money
good,They can be very fast paced at times. other times slow as can be. Great people to work with and for but pay for the amount of stuff i did and hours i worked wasn't the best
good,Great part time job for students. Typically very flexible with school classes. Pay is not the best but employees are diverse. Friendly and great employees.
good,I have worked at oreilly for a little over a year. Over the time here I have met some great people as well as gained knowledge in the automotive industry.
good,I began working for O’reillys to further my knowledge of vehicles and the automotive industry. Not only was that goal accomplished I as well grew professionally in other areas.
good,"It was actually a great work environment looking back. Management was very spot on and it was run like a proper cooperation. If theres an issue, fix it. Theres actually several benefits of being an employee. The sales commission is small but it does exist. Discount on items was also quite great. Very flexible with hours and schedules."
good,Easy going and learn something new everyday. Lot of lifting. Communication is very important. Hours are good and flexible. Pay is not the best though.
good,The management is fair scheduling is easy to work around. Management has a hard time keeping staff in smaller stores quick turnover and not great pay for the quality of work expected
good,This was by far my most favorite job.  No matter what if you need help with work or something personal someone would make sure you got the help you asked for.
good,"It was a great oportunity to learn and use my abilities as a lider great people and work enviroment, every day was a challenge to learn something new and to help costumers."
good,"Pretty much all you do everyday is come in, in find parts for people either at the counter or over the phone. If not that you Patrol the store making sure nothing needs to be filled on the Shelf or doing planograms. Not very hard physically but can be mentally tasking at times. If you do not like to hear phones ring 24/7. This is not the job for you."
good,"Good learning experience  , great training program.  Very user friendly operating systems. Not the best life/work balance.  Team members at store level should be treated and paid far better."
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a very fast-paced environment to work in I really enjoyed the time I got to spend there I work with a lot of great people and a lot of great opportunities
good,"I believe at the time i was at O'rielly auto parts, i have gained a lot of experience within the shipping lane as well as learning how to maneuver with a rider jack."
good,"I really do enjoy working here, however the pay for the work is over rationed. Environment is fast and friendly, you gotta know your stuff very quick! You will always learn along the way, but the more you know when you walk in the better. Customers are pretty good, but there's always those few outliers."
good,"Restocking, Helping customers solving customer issues, and doing small technical advisement. I learned different parts of a vehicle parts that would go bad parts that are good. Hardest part of the job would be selling something I don't believe in."
good,Overall my job is not that bad but it does not pay well enough to make it a long term position unless you make it into upper management. If the wages were competitive I would be more inclined to stay.
good,"Overall it was a good job. I wouldn't recommend this as a entry level job just because of how difficult the computer system can be. If you are looking for a second job or a day job, this is it."
good,is a decent place to work. relaxed environment. helped customers with there vehicles. learned more about the vehicles then I ever thought I would. management was decent.
good,Manager was awesome very helpful and understanding. Coworkers were fun people to work with. Discount was nice especially since I work on cars regularly.
good,"The stores are very busy from open to close, from customers to upkeep in the store. As manger of the store learned very quick on how to solver issues in a timely manner"
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a fun challenging place to work. We are driven to be the dominant automotive parts supplier in all our markets. We are hardworking team members that are driven by our mission to be dominant through teamwork and win-win attitudes.
good,My job at oreillys is very easy going and my coworkers are very easy to get along with. I have a very good time while I am working my time always goes by pretty fast. I am always doing something weather it’s helping customers or going on deliveries.
good,I really loved working at O' Reilly!  the customers were friendly and outgoing and understood my little experience with auto parts.  My manager at that time was whom i was not very happy with.  he wasn't following rules as they had to be followed.  he didn't treat employees equally.  I enjoy working in a teamwork environment!  I am  always committed to my work.
good,Company in great but just not good employees. The managment is not that great never would follow thro with taken care of bad behaver. I loved the company left because of the employees
good,This job was an enjoyable place to work but they wanted you to be dedicated to them.  Your pay as a manager was based off your success in you position.
good,Learned a lot about cars and car parts. Decent place to work if you have a decent crew of employees. Hardest part of the job was dealing with batteries.
good,"The manager was okay, but I wish she was more understanding of me needing time off. I also wish I was paid more, installing batteries in cars and replacing people's wiper blades is mechanic's work."
good,"great place to work, to start off a career in the auto parts industry"
good,I enjoy being in automotive sales. Its priceless to see the satisfactory from customers who at one point almost wanted to give up due to not knowing what to do with their vehicle or how to fix it
good,I do not currently work at O'Reilly Auto Parts. The workplace culture was rich but stressful. The hardest part of the job was staffing. Finding qualified applicants was always a challenge.
good,I really enjoyed my job at O'Reillys for the most part. I would go back to work for them if I was given better pay and more opportunity for advancement.
good,Nice place to work great discounts. But very little room for advancement. Very little did they give you raises. Decent breaks. Need to buy your work shirts.
good,I have a passion for working on cars. This job afforded me the opportunity to display my understanding of how vehicles operate and the pars needed to keep them operable.
good,fun workplace and great people. always something new to findout and always something new about a automobile. wither its a hard to find part thats only in a few models to a basic thing as changing a ligh bulb
good,"I loved working for the company itself, I loved working with most of the employees and the customer base was fantastic. The management, however, was not the best."
good,"I started back in May of 2018, and I was shocked when i found out how easy the job was and how quick it is to finish training. Management was okay at first, But then he started acting shady and bent company rules often. I.e.: allowing some employees to drive company trucks underage"
good,"After working at O'Reillys for two years, I can tell you that it's a fantastic environment and a fun, fast-paced job. However, both store and general manager were highly incompetent, store manager in specific. He is rarely present, and lacks both customer service as well as general management stills. The scheduling is highly inconsistent, and will change constantly, with no notice given to employees."
good,Fun place to work at. They care about your after work life and will work with you to make sure you achieve all goals you need to. I love working here.
good,"Title says it all. Best job in the world if money is not important to you. Hours are flexible. Typical 5 day,8 hour shifts with a break. Able to make your own decisions. Decent benefits. Hardest part of the job is when customers come in with a broken part."
good,Looking to start something new oreillys was a great learning experience but now I feel like there’s more to learn for me as a manager i feel like I can continue to help revenue and lift the company and hold it to a higher standard
good,The job is easy but the people around you can make it hard. All around it is not a bad job but you need to watch out because people will crate a bad environment and managment will turn a blind eye.
good,I enjoyed my time with my store. I was disappointed when I was denied leave of absence or transfer. It is fast paced and fun to serve for the company.
good,"The job is actually not to hard, as long add you know your parts. The hours are flexible, to an extent. The pay is not very good, and they claim that commissionis part of your hourly wages, so it's hard to get raises."
good,"The job is great, if you want to work helping people. The company is great to work for because of their culture values...and beniefts. Plus, when you find good management, its a smooth business."
good,"It's a cool place for a first job. Most of the day would consist of searching parts and selling parts. You will have, from time to time, to install wiper blades or more rare a battery."
good,"I really love this job, great company, I love the parts business but unfortunately the pay isn't very good and they keep cutting my hours, not a reliable source of income."
good,fun place to work plenty to keep you busy. plan on awnsering the phones a lot. need great customer service overtime is avalable if you want it at other stores...
good,"I would only say that the company has been around and is trying to keep up with the times.  However, like most box stores there is room for improvement from corporate to the stores.  There is a disconnect."
good,this is a fun fast paced job for anyone who likes people or vehicles but hopefully both you will deal with both here. there is more opportunity here if you are motivated to move up
good,Good people who are genuine and happy to help customers and coworkers alike. Limited advancement opportunities so would recommend the company for retirees or younger people entering the workforce.
good,You are always on your feet and there is always stuff to do. Never an easy day. Have to work hard like most jobs to get stuff done. People there are really nice and always open to help you.
good,Management works well with all employees. Workplace culture is good. Most enjoyable part of the job is reviewing the end result of your job. I've learned something new everyday.
good,"It is a fun place to work if you know about car parts. The management has no care for family emergencies. Nor do they care about illness. They require you to work every shift that is given regardless of whether or not you have a doctors note. Also, they have no regard for any type of advances made by customers on female employees."
good,"sell parts and reach customers needs"
good,work day changing diffident how to work computer an pull work order management good workplace good the hardest part of the is delivers.finish up myday
good,"a typical day is you come in, get your invoices to pull your parts to load on your truck, very simple and easy. ive learned a lot about car parts. the workers are nice"
good,Depends on which store you work at but some stores are super laid back and calm but other stores can be chaotic with no parts being put away in the right areas
good,orielly's auto part was actually one of the best jobs a had the pleasure of working we went out of town every week to build new store in different districts
good,The work group is very much like a second family we all support each other and want to help each other grow. Everyone supports one another in thei r decisions and will provi de guidance if needed
good,"Typical day at work was checking in stock and getting it out. You have modules you can learn from. Can be fun, Hardest part of job unknowlegeable customers."
good,It was a good company to work for the two years that I worked for with O'Reilly's. The staff treated me well. I was wanted to move up and found a better opportunity. My boss was amazing.
good,"O'reillys has a good corporate system, however poor store/district managers can make or break your experience. Also they tend to contradict themselves saying ""always do what the customer wants"", bu then ""you're price matching too low, need higher profits"""
good,"your shift will change on a daily bases, the company wants you to be able to tell cx how to fix the car as well as sell the parts, even with commission you will not make cost of living"
good,"My day would entail helping customers find correct parts and components to help customers complete and diagnose the repairs of their automobiles. In addition, I would replenish store stocks and complete duties as a cashier."
good,Team players
good,Lots of customer face to face experience. Dealing with confrontation on a daily basis prepairs you for a lot in this job. Management training could be more extensive.
good,Using Customer Service out of the store. traveling to designated route to businesses to deliver automotive parts. This is done multiple times a day during your shift. and you may be making deliveries to the same location more than once in a single shift.
good,Monthly/ quarterly incentives provided motivation for sales. Easy work and parts locating system. Variety of customers. Recommend knowing some basic automobile knowledge.
good,easy high school or retired persons job. nights are relaxed and pay is low. meet some good people working with customers and helping get the right parts
good,i learned how to greet custmers and to provide great service and also work as a team i also learned more about cars and i also got out of my cunfert zone to talk to people
good,I personally enjoy working there. It was an environment where I was able to learn more about working as team in order to make the most productive outcome.
good,"had fun talking to people asking them if they need help and help them figure out what problems they had with there vehicles"
good,"With the oil field O'Reilly's is always busy, there is always stuff to do. It can get pretty hectic but that helps keep it interesting.  There are always new problems to help solve which can make the job very satisfying."
good,"Overall , it is a excellent place to work. The environment is relaxing but a steady work pace. As a driver specialist, I became better at managing and counting money."
good,"Pretty relaxed environment with competitive incentives. Included in work is cleaning the store. You learn about customer service, vehicles, and money transactions."
good,"No benefits for part time, good place to work. Full schedule if needed. I enjoyed the time I was employed there, and met a lot of great people. The job was easy enough though."
good,"a typical work day dealing with phone calls, customers, and customers cars, it was a never say no workplace so, do anything to get the job done. hardest part of the job was saying no if you couldn't find the parts the customer was looking for. I cant say for all managers but my staff was the best."
good,"It would be nice if the management team would be a little better at managing employees, I was transferred to another store and never apprised of it, until the week I was to be transferred.   I would never have moved if asked."
good,Good atmosphere. Great team member. Good all around knowledge. quick. relaxed. Fun place to work at. Okay pay for a part time student. Good experience with customer service and the general public
good,This is a face paced environment. There is opportunity to grow and learn. One downfall is the long hours that have to be worked and open on major holidays.
good,"I really liked working for Oreillys doing parts delivery, stocking parts and accounts payable. Some of the customers wasnt always easy but enjoyed my job."
good,"Easy job with a little room to improve, not as much as needed for some individuals. There was also not very much room to move up in wages also, my self I like working up and going farther forward."
good,It is what it is because it depends on the store you are at and the staff. If you click with the team that's a plus . very fast environment and busy. Always fun
good,I've gained a lot of friends working here but the management needs definite help. Depending on who your manager is depends on how your working experience will be working with them.
good,"My job consisted of making shelf location space available for incoming parts in an automotive warehouse.I learned how to stock unload receiving trucks, i also worked in the order picking department to fulfill orders processing."
good,Good Job with plenty of opportunities for advancement if you work hard and put in the time. Its a good job for all ability and skill levels. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement if u have the drive.
good,"I did enjoy this job to begin with, and have just recently transfered to a new store as of two months ago. Since moving to my new store, however, I have found the Store Manager to be quite difficult to get along with in terms of balancing home and work, yet she has holidays galore and seems to be on a vacation every few months or so. I would appreciate if myself and fellow coworkers got the same benefits we are entitled to by working for the company, but it seems rather difficult to use any sort of paid time off or sick days or anything of that nature."
good,"The good:"
good,"Pay is o.k., benefits and discounts are the best part of job.  Advancement in company is often flawed cause upper management does not always promote by actual work ethics, experience and flawed by discrimination."
good,Good work environment and location. The system wasn't very hard to learn after a brief adjustment period. Good teamwork because of a small staff. Too many billy bo ray bobs (rednecks) to deliver too that don't know cars and yet have mechanic shops in Columbus.
good,It's ok job. Just looking to better my family and looking for something closer to my home.  I have been with this company for close to 15 years and need a change is all.
good,It was a fast paced environment but I enjoyed that. Im very detail oriented and set in place better systems that made our commercial department flourish.
good,a typical day consists of helping customers finding parts for their vehicles and also being able to learn from management and other team members about all the parts we have to offer or sell
good,The job was fine if you could get the hours per week. They considered full time 30 hours a week so the company did not have to provide benefits such as health insurance or life insurance
good,Good place to work. Excellent for semi retired people. Must be physically fit some fairly heavy lifting at times. Must deliver to customer quickly and correct and be professional.
good,Good company if you are liking for something relaxed and sometimes slow paced. Great job for a college student or someone who wants to advance in to the company.
good,I enjoyed working here due to the fact that I learned a lot of what I use in my every day work life along with building great relationships with my fellow co workers and customers
good,you get to meet new people by selling parts. fellow workers are friendly and helpful. you can learn many things about cars from training and fellow workers as well as customers.
good,"This was a part time job only, nice to place to work but does not pay very well. They were very flexible in scheduling around my full time job. The store staff was knowledgeable and a good group to work with. I would go back there for part time employment again."
good,"Delivered parts to local shops. Managed delivery drivers for other locations. Stocked and pulled parts from 80,000+ warehouse. Overall a good place to work. Low pay. I worked weekends during school."
good,They would never hire for full time. This caused issues with being able to pay bills because there would be some weeks that you may only get 8 hours or less.
good,"its a slow pace job there is not also to it job wise, but you do have to know something about cars, its an easy job . as long as you do your job you will be fine. also have to be comfortable with answering phone and dealing with accounts."
good,It is a good place to work. They could improve on the pay scale especially with all the training they want you to go through and marketing they want you to push.
good,"Great place to work as for me. Love to help customers with there cars, it's a plesure to see a smile on the face of a person you just helped , the pay is not the best but the reward is fine."
good,Liked working in this environment. Would love to manage there again if the opportunity was given to me. Started out as a driver the moved quickly into management.
good,Good place to start your career off. They give you the tools necessary to learn as you work. Career advancement is possible with enough hard work and effort.
good,A typical day at work is answering customers phone calls. Front facing the items. Greeting the customers as they walk into the store. Changing the wipers in peoples vehicles. Put up stock when it arrives in the morning. Overall the company is a good environment to work for.
good,I would recommend working here because it's also a place I wouldn't mind working back for because I was once a driver and it let you clear your mind from stress and you don't have a supervisor down your back while your on the road.
good,Fun place to work. The customers are typically easy and fun to take care of. The atmosphere is comfortable to work in. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the automotive parts career.
good,"A typical day at work at oreilly distribution center, is fast work environment. Three different shifts, ework start as early as 5am, 8am, 11:30 am on up."
good,"I really enjoyed working at O'Reilly Auto Parts. Being a Store Manager was a learning curve, but fun. I had a couple team members that didn't make my job enjoyable but we managed. The job was very fast paced and time went by quick which was nice."
good,"I worked here as a student, and they worked well around my school hours. But they finish delivering at 6pm. So that would only give me about 5 hours a day after school. So I found somewhere else to work. "
good,"I began working with O'Reilly's as a merchandiser. I would check in parts and categorized the parts numerically throughout the store. After six months, an position for a parts runner to commercial businesses became available. I have my drivers licence and applied. While I was a driver, I was still a merchandiser. The positions where fun and the atmosphere was great until employees created conflict. The managers began favoritism to certain employees."
good,Worked during college to support myself and enjoyed my time there until I transferred to Shreveport region. Obtained alot of experience with managing staff.
good,Really learned a lot with this company. Learned many things outside of my typical box.Enjoyed working in all areas of this company. The training provided for the positions and duties were more than what I expected.
good,a good place to work very little to do just drive all day and put up a little stock just a laid back job if that what you like to do great manger cool people to work with
good,"Good place to work. Friendly coworkers and nice management."
good,Good work enviroment and friendly people and coworkers. Flexible hours with chance of extra hours as a fill in for other employees at other facilities.
good,"A typical day for me being a driver is always on the run. On slow days as a driver there is always high customer service and shocking needed to keep busy. Management is always busy. The culture is very focus on the customer service and the attitude of the employees. There really is no hard part of the job and he most enjoyable part of the job is customer service and driving,"
good,"I love helping customers with their automotive needs."
good,"Learning how to supply individuals with the proper vehicle parts need to fix their cars, trucks, vans etc. Ability to learn different parts of vehicles and how they work."
good,This is a good place to work with great advancement opportunities. They also have great insurance for you and your family. They are easy to work for as long as you know a little about cars.
good,Go into work count safe. Make sure all returns are done for the day. Talk to the store manager to see if anything special that needs to be done for the day.Workplace could use some work a lot of resentment to me because they are older than me and i was the manager above them. Best part of the day was talking to the customers about there projects.
good,Good place to learn about auto parts and how mechanic shops work with parts supplier. While delivering parts you get a chance to communicate with several types of people
good,We would come in and start getting all of the work out of the way. We had probably 3 or more breaks a day not include your 30 minute lunch.
good,"Maintaining good Customer Service, Money Management, Managing employees, stocking shelves, inventory adjustments, nightly deposits, running day end reports, and closing the store."
good,"A retail sales associate for oreilly auto parts is a typical retail job, there is room for advancement if you desire and the opportunityis available.."
good,This was the first company that I have worked with that I have seen take very good care of their employees. They are very generous and really go out if their way to make you feel welcomed.
good,At o'reily's I spent most of the time stocking and receiving shipments. O'reily's was a really fun and productive workplace.
good,Great customer service and also the customers were always satisfied but the co workers are very rude and talkative an sometimes i would think they had something against me because i was the youngest
good,"A typical day at O'reillys is very busy and fast day, but I love that about it because it makes the day go by faster. The employees are friendly and we all get along pretty well."
good,Very good company to work with. Not much regard for personal life. Expectations very high with limited resources. They do have opportunities for growth with limitations.
good,"th company has like many others turned away from full time employees to part timers and has lost a lot of valued knowledge, a turn back to this will reestablish this company as the leading cmpany in car parts"
good,"Working environment is comfortable, and overall steady with a variable volume of customers coming in throughout the week.  Coworkers are cool to work with, and they can definitely make the day interesting. Management here is consistent and understandable."
good,"Everyone was one big happy family, we all worked together to get things done and did everything to make sure the customers left with what they needed."
good,"Good place to work, but like any retail store it all depends on who you work with on both sides of the counter.  "
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a good job to get you through college. I really enjoyed my co-workers and learned a lot working for the company.
good,Working at oriellys was good . just need better pay and something with more hours. I used to handle the medchandise that came in . i would make sure.our shrink wasnt high .
good,"Great company but overall happiness at work will heavily depend on location and management. Highly experienced individuals will find it hard to earn a decent salary working the parts counter, and this is where knowledgeable individuals are most needed."
good,"•	Responsible for operating equipment used in preparation, mixing, and finishing product; equipment includes mixers, conveyors etc."
good,"A great place to work. Co-workers are easy to get along with as well as the management. It has been the perfect opportunity to acquire knowledge on vehicles and their components, as well as improving on customer service skills."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was making a sale and knowing that your truly helping a customer. Also the hardest part of the job is management.
good,"i learn how to deal with the public ,ordering parts and catalog them in the right area. i like the way that everyone got along with each other. the bad thing we always short of staff"
good,"One thing I enjoyed working here was the culture the company emphasize. Hated dealing with very stubborn customers. The wage was very low here even for a person who holds the key for the store, which is kind of sad"
good,Great Company. They really know how to take care of their employees. They are good about keeping you up on training and good at working around schedules. Good hours too.
good,Working in the auto part world was a whole different playing field for me.. Most will see it as a mans world and there were a few customers that would only go to the man. I learned a lot for the 9 months I was there. Very disappointed in the management team though but i made the best of it and was always a team player.
good,"Sold car parts, changed some batteries, and cleaned up at night. Most enjoyable part of the job was when you made it easy to find something for someone and they are happy with your work."
good,FedEx Smartpost was one of my first jobs as a 18 year old and it honestly was a pretty good experience for me while I attended school
good,"The typical work day is pretty easy. All i really have to do is help customers and pick up inventory stock. I've already known a good amount of mechanics via owning and building a track car myself.  The job has taught me new things such as checking batteries, alternators, and starters correctly. I am not a fan of the new management because of how they work.  The manager will put majority of the work on someone like myself while he/she sits in the back and goofs off on his cellular device.  The hardest part of the job is having to deal with certain customers.  Whenever you deal with people who are stubborn or really ignorant, you need to have a lot of patience.  Patience is something i have when it comes to people.  I may look frustrated, but i'll help you figure out what is needed.  The most enjoyable part of the job would possibly be helping the people who need it.  It's always nice to see someone's face after you help them figure out a problem with their vehicle."
good,"A Typically day at O'Reilly's is pretty decent. I learned enough for the little things about cars that you pretty much need to know such as changing wiper blades, checking your battery, alternator and starter to make sure its still in good use, My co-workers are good workers well some of them are others don't want to work their hours. The hardest part of my job is I can say having to sometimes work your hours then somebody else's when they call out especially when you have been at work all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have pretty much a set time getting off and working with positive people."
good,I liked it. It was a very cool and laid back job. They were very understanding if you had to maybe take off to handle personal business.
good,it was a good place to work but i just felt i did a ton of more work then what i was getting paid for and didnt get the credit i deserved it just got to me dull and i got sick of it
good,"My opinion about a typical day at Oreilly's is a bit challenging one due to the young workers being introduced to the automotive field of parts with out any experience. I learned how everyone learns differently at their own style. I enjoyed everything about the job. The sales, the daily chores as to P&L, loss prevention, inventory management, and to delegate daily chores."
good,Was a great learning experience but not a lot of room for a career. a lot of stress from the the district manager always changing ways of doing things.
good,Upper management are not allways very helpful and sometimes very degrading to you and you work. Our access to parts is some what nice at time but having to pay for shipping special order parts customer sometimes do not like that.
good,The summer internships there allow for a diverse exposure to the different aspects of the company. Very welcoming and many opportunities to move within the company.
good,"I really enjoyed this job, my coworkers were awesome people, the music was easily liked, and I got to assist customers from outside the country!"
good,It's a decent place to earn a living as long as you don't mind going from paycheck to paycheck. it's not easy to get promoted within the company even after being there for a while. Raises are hard to come by and they let go of too many people way too quickly.
good,love alot of things about working here just didnt agree to much with management moves but other than that fun great place to work!
good,"The job was easy times, but strenuous a lot.  Overall, looking over the pros and cons,  it was a good company to work for with good pay."
good,"Not much room to move up the chain of command."
good,"A typical day at work was nonstop customer service and/or stocking merchandise. I learned a lot about handling cash, talking with customers, and working with cars."
good,"A typically day at work involves me opening or closing the store, approving payroll, releasing reports, checking stock, processing returns, providing great customer service to my walk-in and commerical customers. Being in management has its challenges but I have learned how to effectively handle irate customers. I have great team members who all strive for one common goal, to increase sells. The hardest part is not spending enough time with my family. The most enjoyable part is knowing i work my job to best of abilities."
good,Even before working here I did know about car parts but during and after working here I have way more of an open knowledge about car parts. Thats why I took the job working on cars and absolutely love my career.
good,"Enjoyed working with the company, change in management caused some confusion. Providing excellent customer service and gathering parts were a usual day."
good,"I learned more about the parts of vehicles than I knew before.  A typical workday involved me delivering parts on multiple stop and collecting money for C.O.D.s. I may have to pick up something for one business and deliver it to another one of their locations. My coworkers were alright, but I really did not have much time to talk with them. Hardest part of the job was understanding what part a customer was looking for if they did not know what it was. Most enjoyable part of my job was being out and doing something making the day go by."
good,Great customer service well organized. Working in an automotive environment is an enjoyable job. I learned something new everyday.
good,"Start of with safety talk of the day, mostly repetitive."
good,"Selling parts to your everyday consumer and commercial consumer."
good,"The amount of work you go through doesn't justify the near minimum wage. Average staff of 10, and the amount of revenue we generate, I wonder why the pay is so low. Those currently employed has a large age gap of youth and old. Having these two elements results in a ""lazy ant affect"" where one employee has to carry the workload while the rest are idling (this excludes the store manager)."
good,Working for O'Reilly's Auto Parts was a great part time job while I was furthering my college education in automated systems and robotics.
good,was to help customers find the tools they needed and ordered the correct parts if not found. and helped them install small car parts.
good,"Good Company to learn basic automotive skills from checking a starter, alternator, OBDII. Installing batteries, light bulbs, wiper blades. Great Computer program to locating a part."
good,It's a great job. It's always good when you get to work with customers hands on. And when your able to help them when their in desperate need and get the job done it always make you feel good.
good,I enjoyed working for O'Reilly Auto. I worked hard and enjoyed helping whenever I could. The hardest part of the job was getting to know where everything was located in store.
good,"The places and people one would see while working there is great. Great environment to work in, and the people working there are also great."
good,"The responsibilities that every driver has to deal with each customers and the awareness of each delivery and remain calm on the road to adjust to different situations that arises on each day. It looks easy on the outside, but it makes a whole lot of difference to our customers. The product to be delivered in a timely and safely manner."
good,"It was fun, needed more help so one could take care of current customer."
good,parts counter is not that fun. people suck and the public is over all rude. the pay was way less than deserved based on experience. the quality of co-workers was subpar
good,"My store manager is a very nice and hard working  supervisor. My coworkers are very fun and we work well together.  At times we can have very difficult customers, but we are there to support each other and we generally leave our customers satisfied."
good,"As a part-time employee who retired from the military, I often found it difficult to work with employees where dishonest. The survivor mentalty should not be the work model for a sucessful business. Poor or missmangment of employee's, scheduling issues, lack of accountability for inventory, poor physical and information security practices. Lack of training that is not computer based with equipment used in the store. Mannagers who were unaware of company and corporate policies."
good,i started as a cashier and was given he opportunity to go higher in the company. i was able to reach the assistant manger position and currently going higher. overall great company to begin in the automotive industries.
good,"I had to travel all around the city delivery auto parts. Some rides took more then one hour. Customer service was big,we had to talk to customer and some time help customer with problems."
good,"over it a great job. the the company itself doesn't care about their employees. policy is not great. such sick, accident on job"
good,"Pretty good job, but there was not a lot of room to advance career! The management at the auto parts store I worked at seemed to have a lot of trouble getting the staff organized. I was not a manager there, but I felt I was more organized than the current managers I worked for. I handled the delivery of parts to repair shops, as well as taking care of costumers in the store and stocking of products. I did learn very good costumer service skills while under this company."
good,I would scan in new merchandise and put them on the shelves and then provide excellent customer service to callers or visitors that would come in store. I gained a lot of knowledge about cars and also it was a great job to teach me customer service skills and put them to use day to day. My managers were great easy going and really understanding when it came to scheduling. The hardest part of the day was when the store got slow only because the time dragged and there was nothing to do because all task are usually finished in the beginning of your shift.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help a customer out with a problem and finding the exact part they need to get their daily driver, or project cars running. When driving seeing all the broken stuff at shops is really awesome. "
good,"A normal day would consist of a handful of battery, bulb, or other simple automotive installations. Answering phones regularly and helping a customer find the part they need. At this job I have learned people skills and how to interact with the public. The management is overall positive with a few cons such as delegating work to certain individuals to maintain a smooth working environment. The co-workers are friendly and cooperate well together. The most difficult part of this job is keeping a positive attitude when the customer is unsatisfied and aggravated.  The best part of the job is getting to assist in making the customer's life easier by giving them assurance on getting what they need the first time."
good,Evening crew is not the brightest.  Some holidays worked seem like it costs more to keep the store open than what profit is made.  Not the worst place to work but by far not the best.  I served a purpose.
good,"My review over Oreilly Auto Parts is a simple one. It is a fast paced environment, and I had to learn a lot within a short time period. It is always about the customers and how we can bring them the best customer service that we can for that day."
good,Going to work with positive coworkers and even great customers makes my job fun and enjoyable. When I go into work I am greeted by coworkers and i know my day has started!
good,My job was very fast paced I had to do a lot of multitask things at my job. I learned a lot of new things on my job. I learned how to deal with different customers attitude and also with my coworkers too.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts worked with my college schedule and helped me develop my customer service skills. I quit because my family needed my help. After I got out of the Army I have made sure I'm there for my family when they really need me.
good,"A typical work day would include showing up at 1:30 a.m. I would then start up the conveyor/machines to start the daily operations for the Distribution Center. Managed approximately 4-9 employees daily. My co-workers would say I am a very detail orientated person that can make things happen and get things done when the situation gets tough. The hardest part of the job would have to be to learn to adapt to each individuals different personalities all while teaching them to use their strengths to their advantage. The most enjoyable part of each day would be knowing that when my shift was over, all parts were correctly distributed to the stores who ordered them in a timely manner. On top of this, ensuring that the shift coming in was not behind when they showed up for work each day."
good,A good learning place for someone who doesn't know anything about cars. Customer friendly orientated and high fast paced store. Also good place to work on being bi-lingual.
good,"check in truck in the morning then stock it on the shelves, help customers with finding parts they need for there cars and delivering parts to whole sale accounts, hardest part on the job was letting the customer go without being able to get them the part they needed. the best part about the job was being able to drive and deliver parts."
good,"As a sales clerk and delivery driver, I got to know several citizens in the community. This has immensely helped with the business that I am currently in. Customer service skills are always needed and they are something that I gained through the process of this job."
good,O'Reilly's is a great company. The staff is very helpful to new associates. The customers will become like family and will rely on you to provide them with the best possible service.
good,A typical day involves dispatching drivers out to deliver auto parts in a timely manner. Developing relationships with shop owners.
good,"This job was a very slow and leaser job, all i did was take phone orders and deliver food, and seldom assist customers with items out the door."
good,"I was front desk at O'riellys, my typical day was helping customers with whatever services they were needing. As well as stocking shelves every night and keeping the store presentable."
good,Its an alright place to start your automotive parts career. The best job to be in is management for this company. As just a part specialist the pay isn't the greatest. But the plus side is as any position for the company everybody get a commission bonus every month.
good,"If you love driving for extended periods of time, this job is a good fit. Plus, the coworkers make the job so much more fun."
good,great company with great benefits with plenty of opportunity to advance.  I would reccommend this job to any seeking career opportunities
good,"I would drive around to professional businesses and deliver parts.  The co-workers here are something to be scoffed at, at least morning shift. I have never seen a group of friends that will cover each other like these people.  They have gotten a little better since changing store managers now though."
good,Great job for a first. Not really a great place to stay in and advance in. All the workers are friendly so you can easily make friends with anyone and managers are easy to talk to.
good,"I have learned alot about cars ,managers are great. Team memebers are easy to get along with. Troubles shooting certain cars. Working with customers."
good,"My hours were flexible with most of my time working there in the evenings and some weekends.  The tools and computers at O Reilly made the job easier and more efficient.  I enjoyed everyone I worked with there and the Manager was willing to work with me on scheduling.  I really enjoyed meeting new customers and the opportunity to make new friends as well.   O Reilly's is an exciting place to work and the tools available make the job fun, yet challenging."
good,"I like the fact that I get to learn about cars, I sort of wished it paid a little more. The manager is really cool and fair. I get along with all of my co workers, I've never had any issues with any of them whatsoever. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand what part a particular customer is looking for (at times). The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to leave the store frequently to deliver parts. The other fun part is learning about vehicles and how they react in certain weather conditions. It gives me insight on how to maintain my own vehicle."
good,"I delivered parts and/ or products to the professional customers, collected money, picked up customer returns, performed routine vehicle maintenance and gave outstanding customer service and communication skills."
good,grab orders make a route and deliver get back to store asap. management is very nice. hardest part is trying to find a location you dont know where it is
good,Can move up quickly if you work hard. Pay isn't the best. Store managers are over worked and under paid.
good,"typical day involved your average customers, learned more about car parts, management was ok, loved my co-workers, learning the computer was the hardest part of the job, and overall, the job was great"
good,"Assisted customers in purchasing auto parts and related items. I answered the phones, and put away daily stock. "
good,Managed a few stores for them and left the company for better position at a different company.
good,delivered parts to customers cleaned and put up car parts... Got to interact with customers. drive my own personal truck to the job sites
good,"slow paced environment with nothing to do at times,"
good,"Go in at 5:00am and do my inventory computer work for the day. Audit totes until 7:00am, and then go to my startup with my supervisor. After my startup I will profile throughout the warehouse the rest of the day. Enjoyed working with all my employees. My supervisor was amazing."
good,Responsibilities at O’Reilly on a day to day basis currently include quickly and accurately picking automotive parts and then sorting each part into the correct store containers to send to customers and stores for inventory. While working here I have learned that some obstacles may get in the way of your task at hand but you need to be flexible and find a way around it in order to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you are surrounded with that offer you guidance when you need help or even friendship. I think that the hardest part of the job would just be the constant physical labor.
good,"Employees are smart and know the job well"
good,"Managing outside sales, sales calls from day to day, management was somewhat lacking in some departments, they hire alot of folks very ""green"" to management, regional director was good"
good,There was an emphasis on educating the employee.  I took classes and test during my training that educated me in the ways the O’Reilly employee was expected to communicate customer service.  I enjoyed assisting others and felt accomplished at the end of every day.
good,"I have been at O'Reilly Auto Parts for just over a year and a half now. I am labeled a retails parts sales person. While there, my duties include: taking care of the customers first and foremost by making sure the phone is answered by the third ring, greeting them when they walk through the door, getting them the right parts in a timely manner, and encouraging them to come back and see us. On days we receive inventory it is our responsibility to make sure the stock is put up. I get along with all my team members. There is a great respect and family atmosphere in the store. The hardest part of the job is to remain calm and keep moving when the phones are ringing and you have 4-5 customers in line to check out. A lot of patients is learned in this position. The one main component I have learned is time management. That is the key to make it through the day."
good,"management is good, benefits are great.  Loved my customers and co-workers."
good,A great place to start your automotive parts career. Great environment to learn as well as educate others.
good,preparing the store for the customer.helping the customers for what project they are working on. helping coworker help the customers. clean the store prepare to close the stores.
good,"As a part specialist, I helped customers with any questions they had to the best of my ability. I also worked as a cashier and Driver. I delivered auto parts to car shops and various stores. In Oreilly,s team work was a must, working together helped get everything done properly."
good,"We're a new store, so deliveries are sporadic. So I have the opportunity to multi-task. Receive and put away stock, do merchandising duties, and spend time training to better understand the automotive industry and various company job and cultural values."
good,"Can not say anything bad about it, it was pretty basic and effective."
good,The company is a great company to work for but has no room for career progression.
good,Having mostly experienced fast paced production jobs it was a nice change to work here and it was a very fun relaxing easy place to work
good,"punch in get my till count my money setup my area then begin to help customers answer phones and when drivers weren't available I my self would deliver parts to Shops or to commercial customers help customers locate the appropriate items they were looking for replace batteries test batteries,alternator,starters on the vehicle and test batteries starters and alternators in store restock the shelves when needed face the store which means to have the merchandise display properly and clean the isles make the store more presentable what i learned was a great deal about auto motive parts had very good teachers that became friends and they were very professional. the hardest part of the job was Inventory day the most enjoyable part well was just working with very down to earth cool people"
good,the typical day was hectic scrambling for parts since it was a new store. but the management  has taken a good step in the right direction.
good,Learned lots of sales tactics and customer service. Fun to manage commercial accounts and handle retail customers.
good,"My day began at 7:00 am. I would check in the stock from the truck that came in during the night. All stock would then be put up. I would continue this between delivering to business customers as the orders were called in. My main job was delivering parts, with an occsional pick up of returns or exchanges."
good,Everyday is anew learning experience from taking care of customer to finding out more about auto parts.
good,Start by doing safety pre-checks on your equipment then moving on to checking out store labels and filling orders while driving the forklift using safety procedures once all the orders were filled in non conveyable portion of the store then we would fill oil and battery orders until the day was over and all the orders had been filled and sent out to the stores
good,Learned use of cash register. Management was very friendly and down to earth. Good co-workers that made the job enjoyable while still getting the work done. Hardest part of the job was learning to multi-task. Most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with customers from all different walks of life.
good,I enjoy working with our customers and helping them with their automotive needs.Co-workers are nice and helpful during store hours. Our Manager is also very helpful and informative.
good,Great place to work and excellent discounts. Terrible hourly wages.
good,"O""Reilly is a very good place to work at,but i cant say the same for the Management. Its like the Area Manager only show more attention  to certain people that are not friends of his. They hire a lot of people that are friend with them on the outside of work."
good,I delivered parts to local mechanic shops. I learned alot about cars and different car parts. Everone that I worked with were team players and we all got along great.
good,This is a great place to meet new and exciting people. It's fast paced and always keeps you doing something. The employees make the days fun and interesting and a joy to come into work.
good,"Deliver parts to accounts"
good,Had great co-workers in the tax department.  On-the-job learning.  Managers easy to work with.
good,"The company itself was amazing to the employees,however the actual store management team was inconsistent and varied from store to store."
good,Managed the front office daily operations as well as team relations.
good,"good place to work, gets busy on weekends, good opportunity for advancement"
good,"Great personnel"
good,delivered commercial auto repair parts to customers. also worked as parts stocker.
good,"Customer service, inventory, review reports, schedule employees."
good,mostly loved it here just needed serious help in the pay dept hopefully they can bring it up one day
good,"Overall a good customer service retail business, friendly atmosphere, and great training to advance quickly in company."
good,Everyone there is nice and friendly and very helpful. it can be fast paced at times as well be slow. you do learn a lot about your own car and other things about different types of cars.
good,Fast paced work environment that often presents with stimulating challenges.
good,"O'Reilly's taught me so much! Enhanced my computer skills.Busy all day long, weather it was customer service, delivering parts,freight,cleaning the store. Life long friends"
good,"Delivered parts to local mechanic shops. Helped customers find parts they needed, checked in stock, put stock away"
good,A big plus to be working at o'reilly auto parts is the great discount they give to you usually you get store price...
good,Normal retail type of work. Schedule changes from week to week. Everyone works a weekend and nights.
good,I had a great time working. I want a better future for myself.
good,"each day I was responsible for making parts deliveries, stocking shelves with incoming merchandise, assisting customers with purchases utilizing computers, catalogs, and phones. Also, maintaining clean and safe store appearance. I was also asked to make change orders and take deposits to the bank. Installing windshield wipers, checking batteries and ignition modules using diagnostic equipment was also a regular duty. I completed over 380 hours of online training, as well."
good,I have been having trouble searching for a job as a auto body tech and now i found so many i hope i geet the job i dream of
good,"As my first time working in a warehouse,it has been an experience for me.O'Reilly's is a company that can help you move up and succeed in your goals.I have learned what it takes to move up and the work that it takes to accomplish those goals.Their management plays a good role to their team members,such as communication and motivating people.Co-workers are a big role in any company,it takes teamwork to make a company succeed.In my opinion no job is hard unless you don't want to learn, and the job I'm in, I like to learn,try new things and set goals,and with that ""I love my job"".The most enjoyable part of my job is going in everyday with a positive attitude and ready to learn because I know one day I will reach my goal!"
good,Not a bad place to work MANY potential openings in several different departments. There is plenty of opportunity to move up within the company.
good,O'Reilly's is one of the better places to work. Since working there I have learned many new things about vehicles and their parts. The management is friendly and very fair. The entire team is like one big family and it makes working together easier the fact that we're all great friends. The easiest part about this job is the fact that it's just plain fun to work here!
good,A typical day at work I prioritize projects of importance. I respond to all emails and meet with my team to go over any instructions. I read over my factual research and data to complete reports for upper management and product managers. I supply support with our information systems data to ensure up to date and accurate reporting in my department.
good,"Get to work and prepare myself for my job duties, learned to be nice and polite at all times and do what was asked by the manager, my co-workers not always will pay attention to details of there job, hardest part of the day was doing other workers job when they would not do them and the best part of the job is when it was time to go home and relax."
good,"Great environment with wonderful people, relaxing place to work and have fun. Easy job."
good,"I would run parts from one store to another I had a dedicated route that I drove five days a week. I love to drive so this was a good job for me. I would also help customers at the counter and over the phone looking up parts on computer or in books, then pulling the parts for the customer to buy. Put parts away loved the people I worked with and the customers. The hardest part of this job was we did not get breaks or lunch and was not allowed to drink or smoke in the trucks. Which I understand the logic behind but when was not given breaks or lunch made it more difficult."
good,There was a lot of drama at the specific location I worked at.
good,Here I developed the ability to work in a fast paced environment while maintaining quality and productivity standards.
good,I have worked with O'reilly auto parts for over 3 years and on the whole do not regret working for them. I do however not like the fact that where I currently work is a very over saturated market and no room for advancement.
good,"Working at O’Reilly auto parts is something real cool, the people you work with become family, and are there for you more than anyone else would be. Customer service is a big priority, along with treating everyone equal. Don’t expect anything to come quickly unless you’re willing to work for it with this job."
good,great place to work getting paid hourly as well as making commission on sales is a plus. great place to work with great customers. employee discount is a plus to help on any parts for personal vehicle
good,"I loved most of my coworkers but they could never keep the merchandising team staffed. At one point it was me alone with my supervisor on vacation. It's tough and dirty work, as most of the parts come in covered in dirt. I liked that I was usually done by 230 pm but there were some days where I stayed until 6pm to get stock put away."
good,"Working at O’Reilly Auto Parts is great! Team members are awesome and the customers are as well. However working every night and weekend gets old, and there little room for advancement."
good,"Some previous experience with cars and replacing parts recommended."
good,"The manager wasnt as professional as my other jobs he wasnt really at the store he was always out and about, and when i would ask him  any questions about parts  , I couldn't get a straight answer."
good,I've learned a great deal of info and meet people who are appreciative of help and knowledge. Constant training of product and customer service improvement skills on a daily basis.
good,"team very accepting and helpful, eager to give help when asked"
good,"This is a place where company culture is secondary only to dedication of craft.  Whether someone new to the company enjoys their particular niche within the company largely depends on how well department structures are geared toward cross communications.  The desire to work hard, though, must come strictly from within.  Only with hard work will you gain the support that must often be sought."
good,"A day is fairly typical for retail."
good,"Great company to work for. I will say they need to pay there team members more than they do starting out. Good training available for everyone in every position. I will say that personally I am not a fan of a couple of the services that O'rielly Auto Parts provides such as free code checking and turning brake rotors and brake drums. Other than that, I would recommend O'reilly Auto Parts as a fantastic company."
good,"As long as ur not in management, the place is great. Being in management is a joke due to the lack of pay and support. They expect a lot and do not offer very much help or due they  compensate in pay"
good,there was some issues of some staff in management and that was a lot of the res one why i left i felt like i was not moving in the company any more i started from a stockier and moved up to first assistant within a year and that is where i stayed i had to relocate after a year and transfer to another store and was demoted from first assistant to third assistant then a few moths later was was put into there lead program and went no wear from there i was not going to sit around and keep being told your our next choice for store manager and then be replaced with a auto zone manager that had no experience for the system and being demoted again to second assistant and be told to train the entire store to be ready in a week to open and then when another store became open for a store manager being told that an assistant that was not in the lead program was made that stores manager i was tired and left after three years of service and i worked at a hub store for the first year of the company.
good,"Was a pretty easy job, not very competitive and didn't require much skill. As long as your a people person then you can pretty much complete the job ."
good,My career has been rewarding at O'reillys.Facing the ever changing challenges to make us be the dominant parts supplier in our areas.I love seeing success as the whole team works together to build something.
good,It’s a good company just need to work with some of there managers and train them a little bit better. Could use a newer system to look up parts and to work more with the customers to meet their needs more sufficiently.
good,"Should've been promoted to assistant manager, but instead a new assistant manager was hired in, even though the company is all about promoting from within."
good,"O'Reillys was a great place to work, and wonderful people to work for. You do have to have some computer knowledge and it does help if you have some auto parts knowledge as well. Good customer service skills are a must!"
good,"Overall the company was a good place to work, but management was a bit unreasonable at times, which made me feel that I really never had a chance to move up within the company."
good,"If you like vehicles and working on stuff then you'll enjoy working here. Yes, customers can be obnoxious, but they're usually coming to you at a bad time. If you take pride in helping people with automotive stuff then its a fine job. Plus the discount is pretty decent."
good,"Great selection of products, good customer service, helpful staff, and good management. Very good place to go and earn money and to get all your automotive needs"
good,I enjoy the work and people. It's hard to get a full 40 hours in a week.  They don't have enough to keep you busy for a full day and end up sending people home.
good,I like everything but the $$$$. No matter if you work for 1 year or 5 years the raises SUCK!!!! When you give a company that much of your life/time you should be compensated!!!
good,It just a regular job . You can learn a lot from them and from your customers. When it’s slow you gotta find something to most of the time. Management is good .
good,"As any retailers in US. Standing, liffting, climbing all your time, help customers outside for checking batteries and install, engine diagnosis, install wiper blades in all kind of weather. Lower pay rate. Flex schedule. Monthly incentive"
good,"I enjoyed the co-workers, it was very slow with customers at our store, but got to learn a lot about auto parts and auto body. Hardest part was standing when not busy."
good,"I liked O'Reilly. Got to hang out and meet with other fellow car lovers. They have some of the most knowledgeable customers which makes the job a lot easier. Management was the reason for me leaving O’Reilly. I asked to be moved to a full time worker, never happened. I asked for a raise, didn’t happen. I then asked for a transfer due to my only vehicle breaking down and leaving 30 minutes away, didn’t happen.  Decided to talk to district manager and he told me to talk to my store manager. So yeah, got frustrated and left."
good,It’s a bit heavy but with a really good productivity and accuracy goals. Different departments with certain goals which helps you become a better employer.
good,"O'Reilly is great for part-time work. If you're a delivery driver or clerk, it's by no means a challenging job. Just like anywhere, it has its slow and fast-paced moments but all in all, it's fairly relaxed. Don't expect too much though, with the low pay not a ton of room for advancement. I wouldn't personally make it a career."
good,Work days were busy and fast paced no matter the weather. You were required to handle in person customers along with phone calls. You were also required to keep the storefront stocked and neat looking.
good,Good opportunity good people to work with good. Management team great training opportunities fabulous place to work if you like people a d cars. Customers made the job rewarding
good,Extremely good promote from within attitude. If you're willing to work they're willing to let you show your abilities and let you accel in your preferred areas.
good,"I would work here again just different location, it's a get you by job while you look for something better. Discounts are good to an extent, it's not worth it sometimes"
good,"While I loved working here, the thing that got me was that as a driver I had to do things that I was told I didn't have to do because of short staffed. The management was great at times and was understanding for the most part."
good,"slower than other auto places to work, dicount is very good, auto parts are greater than some places, little expensive but overall good parts and brands"
good,Overall I really enjoyed working with O’Reilly however the management team was not consistent in their practices and there was an off a lot of micromanaging from district and corporate
good,"It was a decent part-time job. I stocked shelves, unloaded trucks and delivered parts. The job was fairly easy, and the pay fair for the work done. Perfect for a first job, or second income for a family."
good,This was a good place to learn some retail and management skills.They do have a good training program The pay incentive program is good. You actually create your own customer base. Individual contact with all customers.
good,"it all depends on your store employees. some stores have better employees then others,  we had a good crew who would come together and help out when we were needed. the hours suck being stuck at work till 10 pm was always the worst part and working every weekend didn't help either. some customers where great to deal with while other would make you run and hide."
good,"As long as you’re working under the right manager it’s a good job. There are too many managers at this company who try to be more than a friend than a boss, which gets in the way."
good,"Every day you do the same thing but every day is different. Its different because you get all sorts of customers. You get customers who think they know it all and then you get those customers who have no clue what car their driving. But regardless we are glad to help out. Every day I learn something new and that's what makes this job amazing, specially if you love cars like I do. Management, like my store manager and district manager are amazing. Hardest part of the job is the customers, but always a pleasure helping them. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people fix their problem with their car and also the people i work with."
good,Overall it was a ok place to work you got discounts on parts plus you hadthe opportunity to invest in stocks..........................................
good,This is not a bad company to work for definitely helped get me ready for the real world. the corporate life just wasn't for me and the pay wasn't enough to support a family either
good,"Great co-workers along with solid management working together to go the extra mile in solving problems to meet individual customers needs. It creates a low-stress, friendly atmosphere in what can be a fast paced and physically demanding job. "
good,The culture values are very well supported and promoted by management. I learned a great deal about the day to day way to run a corporate business. It was very beneficial to my growth.
good,"Great place to learn and work, good commissions, good hours, good management, bad corporate management, good coworkers and good team place, nice customer base"
good,"Got into this position after leaving the monotony of restaurant operations. Overall the job is a solid hourly job if cars interest you any or if counter sales is your shtick. Most days for full time are roughly 8 to 10 hours long depending on how you're scheduled. I've learned a lot about handling customer problems, dealing with customer service issues, and building long term working relationships with the customers. Much could be said also about personnel operations, working closely with those to ensure effective day-to-day operations. Most of the workplace gets along well, but people who prefer to be centers of drama or create drama can certainly lower store morale, but strong employees typically can work through or ignore those who only wish to drag others down, and usually also outlast those persons during their term at the store."
good,"Very good company to work for, no compaints. !8-23 sa;es calls per day, selling techniques, good culture, balancing the long days due to meetings or clinics on consecutive days"
good,"The greatest thing about this place is the culture. Yet, the problem is that half of what they express is fake. My store was very much like a family and because there are so many people moving from store to store daily, communication and connection is great. "
good,I liked working for O'Reilly's but i am by trade a mechanic. I like physical work more than the retail side. But i feel my time with this company was very educational
good,"I enjoyed my time at O'reillys, it was an overall good working experience. I was able to learn a lot about cars while working there, and was able to learn about how to run a store and be in charge. In a typical work day I would help customers find parts for their car, and sometimes diagnose problems in cars and replace parts. The hardest part of the job was probably the wide variety of vehicles out there and learning how to fix a wide variety of cars."
good,I enjoyed my time at oreillys however the pay compared to the work duties do not match up. Preforming assistant manager duties while making less than 12 an hour is hard to live off of.
good,Theirs alot of knowledge that anyone can get at oreilys specially if your a car person theirs many things that you will learn by working their day by day.
good,O'Reilly's was a great place to work and had a lot of room for advancement I would 100% work for the company again! Only issue is the manger I had as she didn't care about her employees and treated all of us like garbage if she didn't get her way.
good,"When I was looking for better opportunity I went for it. This job kept me at home so no traveling.  The exciting opportunity to my commission every month,  never got that from Advance Auto Parts."
good,I loved it at oreily auto parts. I wish I could go back there to work. I would go back in that very second. I learned alot from the managers and employees
good,I agreed with how they dealt with scheduling and taking care of teammates.  Along with this it was very easy to express concerns and I had no problems.
good,the job was great for me had a chance to better my retail skills and i also had the chance to grow with my mechanic skills. I had the chance to meet some new people that were able to help me with life skills
good,Working at Oreilly's was a fun and relaxed environment. You were able to meet different type of people. And interact with them. Overall. It's a good first job.
good,O'Reilly is a decent place to work if you are a student in school or just looking for part time work. Pay is average for retail positions and management is what you would expect out of a huge Corporation.
good,Have been a store manager in this company for 5 years company is solid and better than a lot of retail corporate I've been involved with over the years but local regional manager and I are not on the same page cannot seem to get there
good,"NIce place to work with good people.  Driving routes are long.   Inventory is generally easy to find.  not all the staff in stores are as friendly and helpful as those you work with in the hub,  Most vans are newer and well maintained,"
good,"I started working at O'Reilly as a Parts Specialist, then was promoted to a Retail Sales Specialist. The pay isn't great, commission isn't what you think it's going to be, and the hours aren't fantastic. However, it's a fairly easy going job with the most stress being when you're busy and there are only two people working including yourself."
good,"It is a fun job overall, learned a lot about customer service and how o handle situations. Management is laid back and fun. The hardest part of the job is you are on your feet all day."
good,I had a great time just the wage was to low and the overtime was horrible didnt fully get paid for it. But good place to learn some quick knowledge on cars.
good,"Long days when your in management will, if someone calls off you are pulling a open to close with no break time, don't plan ahead if something happens your working"
good,I needed overnight hours and they were not able to give me the overnight hours I needed. My day consisted of picking up the parts and delivering them.
good,"Overall pretty good work place, management can be frustrating. Lots of deliveries detail oriented. Customers can be a hassle and the manager wasn't the greatest with schedule."
good,I was a delivery specialist the commercial customers could be very rude but the environment in store was overall well. Pay was very low and mostly part time positions great for college students
good,Very knowledgeable management that will coach you along the way to ensure that you are confident in knowing what you work with. Laid back environment while giving you tools to succeed
good,"Busy place to work, fast paced. You can keep busy if you want, some don't. Provide training on various items that they sell.  Good discount program on things you purchase through them, including engines, transmissions etc..."
good,"I normally worked mornings with the manager, inventory clerk and one driver. Mornings were always busy with literal running to grab parts and assisting customers. Business slowed down but stayed steady around lunch time. There is always something to learn and grow on. Anyone can help improve your skills and knowledge including customers. All in all it was a good experience and I would recommend working there to others. I was not happy with new management so I gave my two-weeks and left with good relations on all stages."
good,"It was an ok job. Wasn't perfect but was fun. Big thing is you do learn a lot about vehicles. Lunches are unpaid and you don't get the best benefits. Pays can be a bit low for some of the work, but the people that work for O'Reilly's are usually good people."
good,"Looking up parts on the computers or in the old books was a typical day of work, I always learned new stuff everyday, management was like family because we all got along. There was nothing hard about the job and I enjoyed everything about OReillys"
good,"So long as you're willing to deal with not getting what's on your application for hours, you'll do fine. As hard as the job may seen the employees are always trying to find new ways to work smarter not harder"
good,"greet customers and ask if they need help"
good,"Working at an auto parts store was fun. Helping people diagnose problems, or potential problems, with their daily driven vehicles was fun. Sometimes the vehicles where too rough for wear and would require major repair. And sometimes their vehicles I could repair with simplicity. Sometimes without needing any parts at all. I did have fun there. And may consider it a job for retirement."
good,"During my time at O'Reillys, I learned alot about sales. I have never worked in retail before, but they helped me get comfortable with it. I also learned a lot from older employees."
good,Overall I have enjoyed my experience at O'Reilly auto parts but that is largely in part due to having a good store manager as well as a good district manager. The company unfortunately does not understand how that experience and additional responsibilities should be reflected in your paycheck.
good,"Orielly auto part is a great place to work at if your a Gearhaed. Some location are very good an thriving very well, But there is some lack at some of the stores. Otherwise its a Job with very Good Benefits."
good,"A typical day at O'rielys was quick paced and interesting I stayed very busy the whole day. I really can't say anything bad about the company, it was a good place to work but it wasn't what I wanted to do with my life."
good,I had to teach myself everything I know as far as management goes. I am a quick learner and I really enjoy learning new things. I'm wanting to change.
good,working at oriellys I learned that the store was a tight knit group that had fun together and always made sure that everything that needed to get done was done even if it meant jumping in and helping someone finish their project.
good,Overall it was a nice place to work if im allowed to come back i would for various reasons 1 being im in a different state and not under my previous DM
good,"As an RSS team member, I held the ideal position for a sharing the knowledge and passion for automotive parts with retail and professional customers. Working together with support of management and leading my store counter team members in accomplishing of assigned tasks, including maintaining inventory control, store appearance, and obtaining daily sales goals, operate as a profit center, and follow policies and procedures aimed at ensuring the company operates as economically and efficiently as possible."
good,Depending on what can in would depend on the work load for that particular day. I would come in prepare my day and assigned batches to the associates. I would then follow up to make sure that the batches were done correctly and efficiently.
good,Great place to advance your knowledge of vehicles. Not a lot of down time so it can make the days go quicker. Great coworkers and management. Fast paced and productive.
good,It’s a great work  environment to work at but don’t pay good and don’t get a lot of hours. Looking for a job that will pay good and give me good hours and work around my schedule
good,Relocate parts to customers within a 20 mile radius of Jerome. Help customers with their parts needs. Answer and assist customers with quotes and availability. Handle cash transactions. Restock shelves. Daily cleaning of store.
good,"But management does not lead by example low pay raises for long hours worked. Worked for the company for 17 years. First was a fun environment. "
good,"If you're a female you have to prove yourself to be a harder worker and you know what you're talking about, otherwise you will be degraded or treated poorly especially by male customers, but don't expect to be paid the same as males, even if you do know as much or more than the males you work with."
good,Tons of turnover leave plenty of room for advancement however hand and hand with that turnover comes people that are in positions they either A.) Cannot handle or B.) were forced to handle and are now failing. Not a bad company overall. However not a place I plan on making a lifelong career of.
good,"If you lie automotive work, then you will learn quite a bit working at Oreillys, can be stressful but it's also fun to, you can work at your own speed as long as it's not to slow."
good,"I enjoyed working there at times. It could be stressful at times, but we knew how to handle it. I did not like the Store Hours there. Sometimes the team work could have been better. Hard to get pay raises in that company."
good,O'reilly was a great company to work for. Of course there were some thing i didn't care for but as a whole their value were respectful. Day to day would always change. You had to be quick on your feet.
good,Decent place to work. Not very good pay. Higher ups only care about numbers and money and not very much about the employees. Say they promote within which they do but they also hire a lot of outsiders for management etc....
good,Best part of my job was helping people. The management was not very good but the job itself was fun. The pay was not that great but the benefits made up for it.
good,"Great job loved the customers, really liked my immediate supervisor, and store Manager. The only bad thing was schedule never stayed consistent and they would post it every Saturday for the following week, low pay."
good,"The coworkers are all friendly.  You work independently.  As long as you are a good driver and have a good sense of direction, the driving is easy.  The vehicles are well maintained but I have heard that some of the stores are not as diligent about that as we are.  The schedule can be random and erratic at times.  Been trying to move up into full-time but I don't see that happening.  Great job for retirees.  Lots of older (50+) coworkers."
good,I have never worked for O'Reilly but so have 5+ yr. Ezo as an automotive technician I know my parts hard worker love vehicles I also worked in shipping receiving inventory so I know organization I have customer service experience and also was driver for heating cooling company.
good,My duties at schucks oreillys was to perform many duties. I was an early morning stock employee and sales representative. I would also deliver parts trip a few local shops.
good,"There is substantial growth in the Florida market, specifically in the South Florida area, and opportunities are plentiful. Because of the expansion in South Florida, there is a tendancy to hire 'warm bodies' to fill retail positions. Management is present to grow the business, but, many times management is mired in problems of opening so many new stores and the problems involved, such as: City requirements for retail business, permitting, and staffing the new locations. "
good,This is a good company to work for. They pay a decent hourly wage and compensate with a commission bonus to promote great customer service. They are an easy company to work for.
good,Alot of the day is restocking and keeping the store up to date. Great customers and employees. The store i am located at is a training store so we get new managers once every year or so. Sometimes the store can be understaffed and very busy but I got the hang of things with multitasking and can assist a few customers at a time. I love how accepting everyone is.
good,Inner store management was always fine but when it came to district and regional managers they did not know how to get along with lower level employees and belittled them often
good,Opened store at 630 am by following opening procedures and balancing cash draws from prier day worked until 530 pm. I learned how to be really efficient with inventory levels. They are Masters at doing their Inventory checks and check in and out procedures. Management and support was ok but always had staffing issues due to type of business.  Culture at OReillys is a very proud one and everyone takes part in it. I think the hardest part of the job is finding the right people to work (staffing). The most enjoyable part of the job is being part of a hard working team from the top of the company right down to the bottom.
good,"Overall the experience of working at O'Reilly's was a great outlook on what I was getting myself into. Such as working with others and getting engage an helping my fellow coworkers. In a normal day I would start of by checking out an RF gun, set up the gaylords and begin to scan the parts such as rotor, batteries and other automotive parts, separate then into the designated store as the label follow and continue that pattern until all the parts are scanned and separated into its assigned store/gaylord. Then I would check the computer and make sure that I didn't leave any parts not scanned and all the important parts isn't left out. When all of that is done I would begin to top off the the gaylords with tops with a pallet on top of it then start stacking totes on top. The totes cant be no more that 6 high so therefore there are 5 around and 6 high. After that I would wrap and load onto the truck in order by stores that were unloaded first to the one that was unloaded last all used with a electric jack. Toward the end of the night we would clean and I would used the riding jack to move pallets and stack them with a forklift."
good,Learn more about cars and more important things that you never thought you would expect from the job is responsible and respect . Enjoy my years at Oreilly laughter relaxing also flexible
good,"The job is fun if you enjoy automotive, but the position and pay advancements are few and far between. If you're not in need of several promotions or don't have a problem working the same job over and over, you'll love it."
good,"The job was ok for paying bills and for work experience, but was not going to lead to any good advancement opportunities. Hours were ok for the job as well as the pay. My department supervisor was good as a leader and worked with you for any emergencies."
good,I enjoy working at O'Reillys. The management could be a like better but overall it's not bad. The hours aren't bad (5:30am-2pm). The pay is average compared to other warehouse jobs.
good,it was calming as a driver i got to do more then just stock i got to interact with most customers inside and outside the store. most of the emploees got along
good,"I personally worked for this company for 16 years. To me working for Oreilly was awesome i tackled most of the challenges there driver,salesman,night manager,commercial manager,assistant manager and i left as a warehouse supervisor,good company to work for opens you up in Customer relations,and people skills,and most of all makes you a good sales person."
good,ORiellys auto parts store is a good hard working store but as a deliver drive i do not get that many hours and i feel like I get paid less then what ishould.
good,It has flexible work hours. I enjoy staying busy but wish it paid. I have been working here for 2 years. If you are looking for a part time job this would be a perfect fit.
good,"The people were great but due to the lack in pay, it was hard to keep the good people. Turnover ratio was high. Losing more than they could hire. Overall, a good job for someone looking for part time work or something to sustain you for a short while. Lots of promises made, but none were kept."
good,I was able to advance to different departments & learn various skill sets that I will have going forward in production & customer care.Hardest part was getting up its easy once I got in the routine of things.
good,This is fast pace. You are required to pick a certain amount an hour. You can move around and learn other areas. The co-workers are great and helpful.
good,"I work at store in Acres Homes. Coming into the field I always knew that I would be over looked yet I took the job head on. I have had several incident with customers asking to speak to my male counter part which I have learned to just look over because you can't change people. But I excelled in my career. I became the Assistant Manager within a year and a half. I love the people, They tend to be of age but they are always willing to show and teach if you are willing to listen."
good,"I was one of four Parts Sales Managers. I take instructions from the Store Manager, which involves helping to maintain correct inventory counts, and processing customer orders, and returns, and helping to put away truck shipments.  I communicate our Sales Progress Reports and other reports pertaining to store operations with the Customer Service Personnel.  Part of my duties include auditing the cash registers and preparing the deposits for the daily sales, and reports pertaining to them."
good,Fun work environment. you get to meet new people every day. I would definitely recommend it as a part time job only. Definitely not a main source of income.
good,"There wasn't a set schedule, we were expected to work until everybody was complete with their assignments for the day. Some days we worked 12-14 hour shifts while on others we would wok 6-8 hours. The only good thing about working here was the pay rate and the opportunity for raises."
good,when it gets busy it can be stressful hearing the phones ring almost constantly and seeing a ling of customers in front of you. I was the guy that actually opened books to find parts not listed in the computer. most young employees wont do that.
good,"I liked working for the company, but you cant support a family on it. easy going atmosphere, management is down to earth, fun place if you really enjoy vehicle knowledge and working on them."
good,"There are some real nice people at this store, the pay is questionable and raises are very far and few. If you are looking for something to do to kill time apply."
good,"Oreilly 's gave me my first job opportunity "
good,"It is a good job to work, and great environment, teamwork. I love working her it is a great place and good people to work with. I can build a career there and be successful."
good,Working at O'Reilly's was a wonderful learning experience because I got the chance to learn so much about cars. This job definitely gives you all the experience you need to move on further in any area of work
good,"Fast paced employment with the opportunity to advance. Route drivers compensated fairly well. weekends off and home nights. Med and dental benefits could use a little help.They are a family orientated business, but you will work for your money."
good,"I am the type of person who goes above and beyond and give credit when its due. Fast pace to work, awesome discounts, learned a lot, if you prove your self you can move up. I had the option 2 years ago to become a store manager and now I could've had my own district But I am choosing other options. Anything is possible, the sky is the limit!"
good,Very physical job unloading and sorting totes putting them on a correct pallet. Sometimes I would open the totes and scan the auto parts inside
good,It's an okay job to have an okay place to work if you like cars and have basic knowledge about cars and if you like to work on cars or if your a mechanic
good,"show up on time to work, have fun, do your best, and try to go home on time. you'll learn a lot about auto parts and how auto parts business run. see different people and see loyal customers."
good,"Great company to learn the auto parts trade. Training is good and management is attentive to employee needs. Though I do not agree on their ""secret customer"" scoring system(employee calling pretending to be a customer, and deducting points on responces), they write you up on very minor mistakes.(forgetting to say ""Low Price Guarantee"" ) cost 25 points. A fail."
good,a good place to work with friendly people and a great manager.. the best part of the job is working with the customers and learning new things.. i feel like this is a good place to work
good,It's a great place to work if you have automotive interests. I enjoyed the time I worked there and met many great people. I would recommend this as a place to work part time to gain an extra income.
good,great place.......awesome team effor.... fast paced.....always busy ....always learining something new....paint crew ....family orinted ...all around good fun
good,"A typical day would be clocking on and helping people find their automotive needs. I can be helping someone with wiper blades at one moment and helping someone get the tools to rebuild a motor. "
good,My typical day at O'Reilly's would be getting at 6:30am checking in truck.  Once truck was checked in I would start delivering parts to the commercial customers.
good,A day at work is good. The majority of people at the location i worked at helped each other. Communication between associates and management is not as well as it could be.
good,"Was a great place to work and learn new things for some one interested in the automotive parts industry. Loved the jobest and environment, really helped learned about certain aspects of vehicle manufacturing."
good,"It was a ok job that paid my bills, great people there too. The customers loved me made a lot of new friends."
good,"Oreillys has been a great place to work and grow my management career. The company allows the freedom to manage like your tyne owner."
good,"It's a decent job for someone looking for a part-time position while going to school, or a second job to pass the time. Pay is minimum, management is usually poor in most stores due to the fact that the store manager are overworked and under payed."
good,"its a decent place to work, they have ups and downs, upper management is nearly impossible to get ahold of unless it is on their schedule, they place store managers on a higher level and want to reach goals even when there is more pressing matters to deal with...co workers are good, most of the time willing to work and help learn new things"
good,"I am responsible for opening the store, counting the safe, and doing the daily deposit. after all that is finished I stock parts and help customers get what they need."
good,"Overall O Reilly is a good place to work.  They have very effective methods to how they run the store.  Management was very knowledgeable and  helpful when asked for assistance.  Many of the staff from with in the company gets promoted, versus hiring from the outside.  I learned how to more effectively help customers and management with hard to do tasks."
good,"We have a good bit of hard workers in our workplace that are dedicated to the job titles they possess. Management is pretty understanding and courteous to your daily needs as well as time needed off. The customer base can be difficult to deal with at times, but that is where I really get to learn people and their different cultures. The only issues are that advancement can take place, but not when it comes to pay and compensation of commission. Other difficulties are good ideas and changes are tossed around through our management, but upper outside corporate management always seems to undermine our efforts to increase productivity and organization of the store. I want to be somewhere where I can level with upper management instead of all input being negated entirely."
good,"A typical day would consist of helping customers find what they are in need of. If we do not have it in stock get it ordered in for them. Delivering parts to commercial accounts. Cleaning and stocking shelves. changing store layout for new promotions and knowing how to use a Catalog System."
good,"A a Store Manager at Oreilly Auto Parts I have learned and extensive amount:"
good,O' Reilly parts is a physical but rewarding environment. When I come into work I stock auto parts onto the shelves of the distribution center. I pretty much do the same thing everyday. The job for the most part is pretty easy.
good,I had to load the correct boxes on to the correct truck in the correct spot.  The boxes came down the line and it was my job to get them off the line in put them on the truck.
good,"I check in truck and stock the shelves, change product around when needed. I also help on the counter when needed, check customers out or look up parts."
good,It is laid back work place that offered a fast pace work environment. My coworkers were all easy to get along with. Lots of stress if you prefer to work alone and not much time to actually have conversations with coworkers.
good,My personal favorite times is when I could help the the customer solve there problems. I enjoyed working with public and meeting other people .Just like every job it had its ups and downs .
good,"worked with my schedule, ok amount of hours. over all decent employer. delivered parts to local bodies shop. assisted customers with looking up vehicle parts, checked in truck."
good,"Worked at O'Reillys during college, it wasn't anything special but it paid the bills.  I have certainly worked much less pleasant jobs."
good,"I start my day by signing in to our intranet and proceeding to work on the days to do list. help customers through out the day, put up inventory, help manager with paper work."
good,Great culture and a fun work atmosphere. Day to day tasks included assisting customers and inventory replenishment.Managemnt was great and the people were even better
good,"The Typical day at work for m was to come in and help manage the front counter and customers, as well as make sure checklists of duties and the ""To-Do-List"" was done and signed off. There where some days that i would also help build displays and change the floor layout of the store. overall it was a great place to work."
good,It's  pretty fun place to work and learn about automotive parts if you're not too familiar with them. Customers often tell you a couple secrets to doing the work. It's also a great place with great team members.
good,"I would work afternoons and had absolutely no outside life. "
good,"After a year or two of working there you will begin to feel high stress that will leak to your personal life, customers will feel you have the answers so you must."
good,"Opening store, stocking shelves, delivering parts, answering phones, helping customers, closing store, I was a floater between several stores and did everything asked of me. I worked under stress of my manager trying to get rid of me. He fired me one day after i reported theft within the company, I seen a coworker letting friends take items out of store without paying for it. I wont lie, he did me a favor because I made the best friends I have ever had at my next job, but I was done wrong. I still remain friends with some of the coworkers from Orielly's. I would go back to work there if given the chance. The manage in question is no longer with the company. The hardest part of this job is having to tell the customer that you can;t get the part or that it is no longer available. I like to help my customers find and fix their automobiles. I learned that no matter what the rules say you should do and how much they say no repercussions will occur, they can and will at times. However don't let ones wrongs change your values, always do the right thing. If a door closes another will open."
good,"I was at this company for three years and got to see three different managers run this store. The first two were great, very reasonable whenever problems would arise, would be willing to work around our personal schedule, and vacation time :). But that last manager, oh boy he was something else entirely. A real tightwad always cutting our hours whenever he had a ""reasonable"" excuse. Overall this company is great, but only when the store is placed in the hands of someone great as well."
good,"I usually work a mid-day shift so from 9AM-6PM. My day usually consists of me clocking in and asking my manager what he wants me to do. I'll check my aisle to make sure its properly stocked up, I'll help ring up customers who are ready to check out. I'll also help customers figure out what part they need to get on their car and compare prices and warranties. I'll also assist customers who call over the phone. Usually my first half of work is going out on deliveries. Deliveries are one of the things I actually really like about working here. It gives me a ""break"" by allowing me to work unsupervised but detailed tasks. I'm also learning how to navigate through certain parts of Oakland better. After my lunch break I'm almost always working at the cash register and ringing up customers."
good,"good practice of customer service and knowledge on parts "
good,"Working at O'Reilly is a rewarding job to have as far as learning new concepts in auto parts. I have gained knowledge about auto parts and    store operations. I have also gained many customers that enjoy my help, knowledge and assistance."
good,"Work early morning, but get out about 1 or 2 depends if it's busy then there will be over time."
good,Everyday is different yet the same.  It's a constant learning experience and  sometimes it's frustrating. Mainly because you get those people who read things on the internet and believe they're 100% true no matter what.  But overall it's a great place to work.  The smaller stores mean smaller staff numbers so it feels more like a family.  I've learned quite a bit over the last year for sure!
good,"Only good for a part time job. not enough money to take care of family, great manager, great coworkers ,, but alot of standing"
good,"- typical days are helping customers and putting away overstock"
good,"Typical Day at Oreilly's included opneing or closing the store, customer service,"
good,"Its an ok job if you need money or something to do. If you love Car talk, GO For it!! Remember this, No on really comes in to an auto store in a pleasant mood, so if you apply make sure you have a strong sense of customer service and are willing to take some angry customers in stride."
good,Get labels for a certain zone or area and select orders based on whats on the label.
good,Great place to work if you have any desire to learn about the automotive industry. Computer program turns auto novices into superstars!
good,I am a parts specialist and learning how to be a merchandiser too. I unpack stock and put it into the inventory and put away on the shelves. I get all the returns together to go back to the DC.The rest of my time at work i help customers find the products that they need. 
good,In the average day you what one part is and how to intercross that part the original part. The co-workers are very friendly and helpful when needed
good,Oncology Supply was a great place to work for a while. I traveled the U.S. installing inventory systems and trained the staff on the use of the equipment. The company got so big the management didnt care care about the employees anymore. Job sercurity was very stable for a long time but i was laid off in sept. 2012. the pay was very good for our area but corporate wasnt giving as big of a percentage on raises like they were in the past. 
good,They want you to work as many hours a week that you can stay awake. They donot care about your family or your life outside of work. Thank god this company no longer exist.
good,not a bad company to work for if you are willing to truly work and work hard
good,"Morning paper work, daliy deposit , day scheduling , team memeber training, Inventory control daily."
good,A typical day at work would be lots of fun. I had an awesome manager who made work fun but still kept us professional and on the right track. The hardest part of the job was assisting angry customers but I learned alot on how to handle different situations.
good,"real enjoyable job, meeting new people and different task at hand all the times, pay is fair compared to competitors."
good,"A typical day at oreillys distribution center was filled with exciment and hard working co workers who are treated great as a whole as well as individually by the very involved well spoken supervisors.al though all the team work and smiles that are demonstrated by most employs existed there was still cons to this company. I believe the way you move up isnt due to quality of productivity or accuracy yet , who you know on a personal level in management."
good,I love working with the customers and making the sales. My supervisor is very helpful. O'Reilly is very competitive and successful in the part field. They manage inventory very wel
good,"The pay was good, health insurance was good, the job was easy - overall I'm sad I left."
good,A typical day begins by preparing the bank deposit from sales the previous day. I then complete daily paperwork reviewing the previous days sales. I inventory several areas of the store daily and send product to the warehouse to be distributed to other stores. I supervise a team of five employees currently. I maintain relationships with service shops in the area inorder to grow their trust and business.
good,"This job is an excellent training for any of my endeavors for the future. You have to not only multi task on the computer, the phone , the employees/ customers, but also the ultimate finishing of the sale and maintaining a connection with the customer. Imposed by selling what we have to offer."
good,"a typical work day can sometimes be 8 or 9 hours long, sometimes with no break. I have learned to delegate some responsibilities to co-workers and not try and carry the whole workload myself."
good,"OReilly autoparts is a good place to work. Co-workers have strong culture values and are rewarded for hard work. The team aspect is a strong one with marriages, deaths, births, and promotions published in a team magazine."
good,"A typical day at O'Reilly would include stocking shelves, customer service, and storefront stocking. I was able to learn a lot about the automotive industry through the experiences of my coworkers and management. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the know the regular customers."
good,"This is a good place to apply for, if you are interested in the automotive industry. Also, they need drivers most of the time, and is an easy task, must be 21 or older to start driving. The work environment is diverse and there are different types of personalities and cultures, depending the location which you get hired for. This gives someone the opportunity to gain customer service skills and management along the way if they decide to stay with the company."
good,"Job is nice   "
good,Great customers that you interact with everyday. If you work hard you will be able to move up in the company in no time. Inventory team was a great group of people to work with.
good,Your experience with this company has everything to do with which location you’re put in. Each store is diverse and provides a completely different work environment. Overall the company focuses more on customers happiness than employee happiness.
good,My first job as a scheduled worker.  Learned a lot from team.  Hours not steady due to part time fill in.  Gained customer service experience and knowledge about auto parts.
good,"I would do 3 runs aday between 3 stores. It was little over 2 hours round trip,I very much enjoyed getting out and talking to all the store and being on the road all day. Days long if warehouse was late getting to me as I depended on them. My stores were always happy to have me about as everything was on time or early for thier customers and with the right parts they ordered from us.  low pay but it was super lax and easy job to me so no big deal. Company was always great at working with me and I would work from them again."
good,"There are always plenty of opportunities to learn about new things at this job. The pay isn't great for all of the responsibilities, but not a terribly bad job. It has helped me get through college and learn more things than I would have learned on my own. Very flexible on work hours as far as working with your personal life, as well as school life."
good,"Overall great atmosphere, however, the pay could be more competitive. The people are wonderful and the culture is awesome. Highly recommend for those starting out."
good,"It’s a decent place to work. Install batteries, wiper blades, light bulbs, and scan vehicles. You will answer phones and must have some people skills. They could pay more but that was probably due to the income level of the area."
good,"It was a good job for the most part, there was some things that management did that I didnt think was fair but overall it's a good job and it's easy. You only get benefits if you work fulltime though and dont even think of gettin OT because they will cut you once you hit 40 for the week"
good,"Good job with good benefits, hours are flexible and good hands on for young mechanics and good knowledge builder. Friendly environment with friendly people"
good,"The Good:  I had a relaxed management and most of the employees were fun to be around.  The jobs you perform are usually easy and when they aren't there is always someone to help you if you ask."
good,We had a couple excellent managers who were team players and were always there for employees if they had a problem. Pay was a few cents above minimum wage.
good,"Oreilly Auto Parts is a solid company with decent benefits for those looking for stability."
good,"I've said all I need to by answering the questions n in the summary. Overall it's a decent company to work for that can b stressful at times, but for the most part it's easy going. The management is pretty good about most aspects of the job. They just need to get better at getting issues with the vehicles resolved promptly."
good,"They do like to train the people however, the system is hard to navige with multiple sources to get parts. Management varies by store so, if you have someone who works with you then you are priviledged."
good,Good competitive place to work. Have to reach sales goals. You get to work with local businesses. Sometimes non delivery drivers get to take deliveries  or go to other stores.
good,week every weekend and most night pay is low  fellow employees cause you to work late manager cannot fine people to work good parts discount  not enough family time
good,Managed properly Oreilly's is a good place to work. They have good culture values and stick to them for the most part. Emphasis is placed on customer service. They do need to be more competitive with the pay. Especially for the workload placed on management.
good,"That's really all I have to say about it. I enjoyed the work, I enjoyed the people I worked with, and I thought the upper management(dm, etc.) Was great. But I only got one raise and I haven't seen an assistant manager make more than 14 an hour."
good,You have to get into the right store with people you get along with and then you can actually have a good time at work. It is a better place to work if you are really young or older. This is not a job you can really get anywhere financially.  Once you hit a certain level there is no where else to go. But I really do have a great time at work and get to meet lots of different types of people.
good,"Days would range from dead to busy throughout the day like any retail business day. Check in and put stock away in the morning, do paperwork in the morning before store opens, check inventory regularly and fix if needed, assign employees tasks to be completed by a certain time or throughout the day, teach employees how to use testing equipment for batteries, starters, and alternators, I learned about parts and where they go on a vehicle, some of the ""mechanic's"" language and names for parts i.e ""squirrel cage"" or blower motor, help make schedules with manager"
good,Working for oreillys provides a great form of satisfaction for me. I get to help and most of the time solve people's automotive issues. Its very satisfying knowing that I'm the reason you dont have to worry about troubles with your vehicle anymore and to see the appreciation and the gratefulness of my customers is priceless.
good,Enjoyable to work with customers to help problem solve automotive related issues and to assist them with purchasing the proper part and/or accessories.
good,"The best part of the job was my original boss, Kenny.  I wish he never left.   He taught me a lot.  I also really enjoyed working with customers.  O'Reillys had a culture to make sure the customer was happy.  It was always fun when a customer had no clue about what was the issue with their car.  I had one customer come in and say ""My friend said I wars low on blinker fluid"".  LOL  I had to break it to the young lady that there was no such thing as blinker fluid or synthetic blinker fluid as well."
good,Overall it is a great place to work. The cost of health insurance is very high for what you receive. Management is very fair. The only drawback I had was there was not enough of a proper area for a break room. I usually bring my lunch from home to save money.
good,Friendly people they do their job but have fun at the same time management will work with you if a scheduling issue comes up. Co workers willing to help when possible.
good,I really liked working as a driver/merchandiser for oreilly's. Everything was great except for the district and regional manager. He was very rude and disrepctful to employees when he would come in for visits at the store. However all other employees and customers were pleasant. Enjoyed the experience and atmosphere.
good,Your hours fluxes with other people working there. Got bonuses but depends on how many people you sell to and who buys parts and who returns parts. When it’s slow always cleaning
good,"Good supplemental income. Pay starts very low. $8.50 per hour. Not enough to live off of. Easy most of the time, but you do have to lift and deliver heavy parts, oil, anti- freeze too."
good,I loved working here but i needed something with more hours as i had a growing family and needed a bigger income. I really miss the discount and the people i worked with that became as close as friends and family.
good,"Daily returns"
good,"Management is great, full time has some benefits but not great. Pay is low compared to other similar work places. The culture is nice, coworkers are the best part of the job, and the discount! Overall its not a bad job, needs more pay!"
good,"It's a nice job to work  nice people to work with,  the people is the only stressful part of the job some people know what they want and others don't have a clue what they need"
good,I loved working at oreilly! Hours were good and you also received monthly commission. I started having issues wirh the manager that took over and was treated poorly. Even commercial accounts were having complaints.
good,I enjoyed working at oreillys for the time that I was there. I liked the people I worked with. I worked there from my junior year of high school until I started college. When I started college I was told that they do not hire summer help and unfortunately was let go.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a good place to work the environment changes constantly due to the amount of people that come in to the store. you get to meet people all the time and the workplace is always busy.
good,"Great environment, could use better management. The overall atmosphere created by the consumer and customer relationship is great with regulars always coming in. However, as in any customer service industry you will have customer conflicts."
good,Fun job using intuition and experience. Fair management and good culture  in the business. Customer experience and personal communication were learned.
good,"You deal with customers on a daily, great people to work with when your on the right team. Good benefits, room for advancement, awesome discounts. Learn something new about cars on a daily."
good,"Be on time, do your job, you won't have any issues. Leave your phone in your locker, follow safety instructions, and try to stay out of other people's business. Overall decent job"
good,"Most days are come in, help customers, professional and walk-in, and maintain store appearance. It taught me skills to quickly connect with people and how to ask questions to quickly identify the need of the customer. Strict scheduling is not a guarantee at all, no hours are certain beyond two weeks out. Often asked to work significantly longer shifts, and expected to not refuse despite not officially being forced to work outside the schedule by company policy. Refusing to come in off schedule can and will often be held against you."
good,I loved working at O'Reillys but wish the pay was better. Otherwise i would have stayed longer and made a career out of it. I learned a lot and really liked the people i worked for.
good,They had a basketball thing in the break room most of the people was nice people to talk with but they also had mangers that didn't no how to talk to people
good,"a typical day for me oreilly's included deliveries, cleaning, and stocking. my general manager was very helpful and very experienced, the store manager changed so many times it was hard to get trained in the store properly. the hardest part of the job was management was not properly trained right. best part of the job was all the employees at the other stores were always nice and polite to other employees and customers. I loved my job."
good,"I loved working at O'Reillys. Our old manager was awful but as soon as we got a new one, the store has been on a roller coaster that only goes up. There are a few bumps here and there but that is typical. People are given jobs to do on a daily or weekly basis and are usually pretty good about doing them. Every once in awhile we have an employee or two that lack motivation so they need a stern talking to but it gets back ton normal in no time. A normal work day is very simple. Freight gets checked in, every new part gets scanned on a specific computer program then added into stock. Parts get put away by the employees that have free time, customers come first, of course. Then returns have to be processed. Cores and Warranties get scanned and put into totes, no heavier than 60 lbs. New returns, parts that get returned that we do not typically stock, also get scanned and sent back in totes. Once returns are done the totes get loaded onto a palled and wrapped with saran wrap. A manifest is created which explains any dangerous parts such as batteries or spray cans that could be flammable and set on a clipboard for the truck driver to find when they pick up the pallet to drop off our new freight the following day. New parts such as in the spring time we get a bunch of air conditioning stuff, fall time we get plow parts and snow scrapers, all get put on planograms in the front of the store. There is specific paperwork that shows you where it goes in the store, how many shelves or load bars you will need, the locations of the shelves and load bars, the product part numbers, how many"
good,"I started here after I got out of the Marines, I enjoyed doing the sales much more than driving. It was a good work experience and I hope to stay in the sales department."
good,You can make a large cliantail if you know a lot about vehicles and parts. Don't give anyone a discount that not allowed to get it. Do your job keep the store clean and your job is safe.
good,"As a driver, most of your day is behind the wheel. The management at my store was great, and you're never bored unless you dislike driving.The workplace was welcoming and none of my coworkers were rude or unpleasant, which made it easier. The hardest part of this job for me was overcoming the lack of mental stimulation. This is a job that is pretty laid back with not a lot going on, but it's difficult to not get bored if you have a need to engage your brain. But I would say it is nice to be able to drive around and explore the area that I live in. It's nice to see where everything is at and to more or less sight see."
good,"The objective is pretty simple: sell auto parts to retail and commercial customers. It is quite a bit of busy work and multi-tasking (nightly cleaning, light building maint.) Some days are busy, some are dead as a door nail."
good,"Good job, everybody is friendly and cares. You get to meet a lot of people, and learn a lot of new things, it’s a really good if you love working with public."
good,"Started back in 2013 as a PT employee and I really like the job but it was not covering the bills and I would not be put on FT due to store sales and volume of sales.  Stay with the component because they work with my schedule and availability and have always been accommodating with me and my needs. "
good,I have worked for O’reilly Auto Parts for 13 years have loved every single one. It’s fast paced and fun. Dealing with customers is new every day and can be challenging but it’s worth it when they are able to leave satisfied.
good,"It is a an excellent part time job with benefits related to purchasing parts for yourself.  It requires a large amount of automotive knowledge to be successful.  Customers expect more knowledge than what the job pays.  You will learn quite a bit more about parts, general automotive repair, and best practices after working there.  I would not recommend this job as full time due to limited advancement opportunities."
good,It’s a good place to work if you’re automotive  enthusiast  helps to be a fast learner  with people skills   Helped build  me into the outgoing person I am now
good,"I really enjoy working for O'Reilly Auto Parts. Sometimes, though, trying to be the dominant supplier in all of our market areas can make the company almost too competitive. Some stores are kept open later than the demand of the consumer just because the competition is open that late. "
good,"Workload is front loaded each week as it tapers into Friday typically being the easiest day of work. Raises dictated by one's own performance when measured against the productivity standards set by each department. Team oriented tasks from stocking shelves, processing orders, to loading up semi trailers for delivery."
good,"Very structured in how things are to be done, below average pay in the industry on the Distribution side, very good at training its team members with on site training."
good,"I enjoyed the oreilly culture but the pay can only go so high, in the position i was in i felt as if i should have been payed more but because of the style job it is i vouldnt recieve the right compensation"
good,"Individual store managers and employees are usually awesome to work with and be around, generally making work fun and bearable. Upper management rarely if ever seems interested in the welfare or well being of its employees, going so far as to say that employees should be offered words of encouragement and endearment as opposed to pay raises."
good,I loved working for oriellys. I worked there my whole time in automotive school and it was beneficial. We had a manager change which in my opinion took way to long to recover from. Before I reached the year mark I was told I would be a raise which would have been my second one. I never got the second raise. October of 2018 they wanted to promote me and then finally there was that raise but I that point it wasn’t worth it. I did my part during my time there I considered full time but I couldn’t at that pay. they ask a lot from their employees to not want to pay them. That was my biggest issue was I was never gonna be ready to move on with life cause I didn’t make enough money.
good,"good place to learn everyday life skills. learn new things everyday.automotive,customer service orientated,teach great people skills and communication."
good,"Good training which has helped me advance my career, good coworkers and discounts."
good,For the most part it is a fun place to work.  If you are a hard worker you can advance in the company. There is a lot of favoritism that can push your advancement back.
good,It’s a good place just not a lot of room for advancement for women. There are a lot of amazing people in the company. Quite a few good perks!!!!! Not a bad place to work.
good,"Good company just need something different. I would recommend this place as a good job for anyone. They don't discriminate age,gender or race. I'm not leaving them because of anything but just want to work in a Motorcycle Shop. I have enjoyed the people I work with and will still purchase my auto parts there. O'Reilly Auto Parts is a good Company I just want a change."
good,this was my 1st job in the auto field i was so scared but the team helped me understand what every part was they never judged me for asking for help and always asked if i needed help if i looked stuck
good,Not a bad place to work great for high schoolers that know mechanical knowledge. Has opportunity to grow with company. Will learn customer service skills
good,Look these reviews are a pain in the neck. This is a parts delivery job that entails picking parts and delivering them to customers. We also handle returns and stocking shelves.
good,The benefits were decent as a full time employee. The part time employees did not receive those and the company seems to be trending toward part-timers. The work was good and management was acceptable. The atmosphere was typically fun.
good,"Working there was very educational, made a decent amount of friends including some of the locals. Automotive is a great way to especially if you're going in business for yourself."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for O'Reilly Auto Parts. The people were nice and customers as well for the most part. A few would be rude, but other than that, it was fairly easy and comprehensible as to what you were supposed to do."
good,"Growing company, with career opportunities if you like working in the Auto Parts and Automotive industry. You work as a team with the parts specialist driving pickup trucks and delivery auto parts to professional repair shops."
good,"great place to start out not the best place to stay they promise there competitive pay there not they feed you a line that if u sell more u make more you don't, they more you sell they more taxes take, they work on a commission based pay on top of hourly rate"
good,"You learn a lot working here. What parts do what, basic vehicle maintenance, how to deal with stress and unpleasant customers, and how to really help customers in need. Nobody goes to an auto supply store because they want to, but because they have to. The best thing about it is helping people in their times of need."
good,"You learn a lot from customers and also from Auto Mechanics."
good,"In my typical day, I would open and close a store, count safe, perform custodial duties, make and approve schedule, assist customers with the changing out of their headlights, batteries and windshield wipers. Also getting the part the customer needs in a timely fashion."
good,Productive and a good place to work at just doesn't pay enough and the people that you work with are great and helpful in a lot of ways. The management could be a lot better tho honestly and be helpful with the employees when they ask for help or whatever they may need at the time
good,"Some of the company’s management choices need work, psychically an easy job. Pay isn’t great until you reach SM with a good earning store or DM. Store managers sometimes take advantage of their power and status."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Lots of hours during the summer months, not so many during the winter. Lots of friendly people and accessible management."
good,"Good work ethics, As manager was available to cover for anyone out for shift. Was responsible for scheduling, training, wholesale and retail sales, as well as all management responsibilities"
good,my job over the years has been a lot of different things but when I don't see my husband for three days because of work then something needs to change
good,Good group of core drivers. Profit sharing with hub store when they met sales goals and drivers shared in that. Nice benefit. Responsible for pulling and stocking parts.
good,"Have an awesome manager that does everything he can for his employees that deserve it. Fun atmosphere but with the right employees, you can get that anywhere."
good,This was an interim job something to fill in my time till I needed to go back to work full time started as part time worked into full time only left because an annual raise was not given
good,"wasn't to bad could pay more when moving up in the company, but the parts discount you get was nice and convenient. Managers are willing to work with you"
good,I was a parts delivery for O Reilly Auto Parts It was a simple job but the only problem was they did not offer Health Insurance I was responsible for minor maintanance on the delivery vehicle plus Delivery and  Returns of Auto Parts to the in the area Mechanics
good,"O'Reillys is an ok place to work, it is very stressfull at times, to many hours are accepted, about 55 hours a week with no overtime, but do get paid commission"
good,•	Complete and submit required paperwork
good,Job is great when your want to learn about cars. Great out of High School job. I do not recommend as a career or if you have a family. The Employee discount is great
good,"As a hub driver its a simple job and kinda fun. The driving is straightforward, you drive from one store to another and so on, and you get assigned a route. Hardest part is the constant lifting 50+ lbs totes through out the day, but overall just make sure your part numbers match the invoices and you're good to go."
good,"I loved working at oreilly's and would work there again in a heartbeat.. if the pay was increased. When assistant managers get paid the same amount as other sales personnel, there is an issue. After working here almost 2 years and getting a promotion, I was making .25 more than when I started. Meanwhile new employees in lower positions would get hired on at a higher starting salary than I made after 1 year. Sales and effort translate to nothing for advancements and raises. But the customers made the job enjoyable and it felt good to be able to help out fellow car enthusiasts. I would recommend working here to anyone who loves cars, the discount is pretty good. But anything beyond a part time job here will end up not being worth it money-wise, unless you are a student and don't need much to get by."
good,Customer Service and cashier.  Made commission on in store items purchased.  Became a full time driver to deliver parts to other locations.  There were a lot of team members and we worked together very well.  The best part of working for O'Reilly's were working as a Team with other employees and customers on a daily basis.
good,"I greet customers as they walk in through the door and ensure all their product related needs are met if also help them outside the store. "
good,"They have treated me wonderfully through the years. "
good,"Clocked in and almost immediately there would be tickets to pull and deliver. "
good,Good place to work. Everyone always worked hard together.  We always worked together.  It was a fun place to work. I did like going to work everyday. I'm always a go getter.
good,"The job is pretty basic. It's not difficult most days, but there is little chance for advancement, especially in a small market. The managers tend to leave early and leave everything up to the rest of the employees. It isn't nearly enough pay for the work that is required."
good,"On most days there was a lot of busy work in the mornings with cycle counts, reset of planograms, in the afternoons the customer flow would increase and we would collectively handle all concerns, and business needs as a team"
good,"I feel I did not have  a future there anymore so I left. I have a great work ethics,always got the job done.Did what ever it took to get the job done.I had a great customer service record,all my employees had respect for me."
good,Working in the warehouse was nice and then in the afternoon we had to return thing back into the rotation of stock that was not delivered or pick up by the customer.
good,"I started at O'Reilly's with minimum automotive knowledge. I'm glad that the manager decided to give me a chance to prove myself. I started at the bottom as a driver and within 2 years I became an assistant manager, so there is without a doubt room for growth. During winter, especially if you love where it snows, hours will get cut back which can be very frustrating. Unfortunately, the big guys that don't work in the store everyday are pretty tough on the store managers about sales and payroll, which rolls downhill onto the rest of the employees. One of the downfalls I have noticed is that if you don't use your entitlements such as vacation, personal, or sick time before your years anniversary, you will lose it. At the stores I have personally worked at, staffing has been an issue causing me to lose a good portion of the vacation and personal time I had saved up since I was unable to get the days I had asked for off. However, you are always able to earn more money. On top of the hourly rate you make, you have your earned monthly commissions which, depending on how much you sell, could add a couple hundred dollars to the second paycheck of the month. Also, every few months they have premium rewards. There is a list of specific brand items that each have different amounts attached to them, for example; a yellow top optima battery is worth $4 to the employee that sells it. For every item on the the list that you sell, you get the total amount its worth added to your check at the end of the promotion. Its a typical customer service based type of environment, you want to do everything"
good,if you care or enjoy helping people and are interested in cars ; working at oreaillys is a great. Interacting with customers is the best and worst part of the job.
good,"Sat inside a heated environment at a desk, waiting for customers to walk in. Never got too busy, but i wasnt bothered considering I was hourly. Got along with customers pretty well and became social with them and established good rapport."
good,Typical retail work environment. It was a fun place to work. Interactions with various people were always great. The only issue was when corporate came in and started to micromanage everything.
good,"The patron customers are great and were always a hoot to listen to, especially on those rainy days. Most co-workers are knowledgeable and helpful in getting you into the groove of the every-day workings of the store and management is top-notch. I generally enjoyed working here, but it could've been better if I had a four-leaf clover."
good,I would highly recommend any students this company. They are very flexible when it comes to hours and accommodating them. Pay is not very good but that is expected with a job such as this
good,"Working at O'Reilly was a great experience because you learn how to do everything in managing a store. It was more than just being a cashier, you had to do everything for the store, but nothing was overwhelming."
good,"The daily/weekly online courses, though mandatory, allowed me to learn a great deal more than I already knew. The competition for sales were done in a professional manner, it was fun."
good,Great place to work. Helping customers on the sales floor decide on the right car parts or tools. Cleaning and restocking the sales floor are daily activities along with being responsible for cash.
good,Working hours varied heavily per day. Beginning of work week could be anywhere from 8-12 hour days and end of week could be as little  as 6.  There was a lot of tension between many of coworker and myself and people had poor attitudes towards the work.
good,"I worked for O'Reilly for a few years before I had to quit. "
good,Typical work day would show up before the rest of the crew and set up. AM Shipping was short handed had to work 2x maybe 3x harder to stay caught up with the work flow. I've learned I can work fast with a steady pace without having any mistakes. Learned to run the shipping dock if need so. The work place was fun very friendly people. The hardest part on the job was trying to stay caught up on Monday & Tuesday cause it was the busiest/ longest days of the week. You could be working 12 to 14 hours days on Mondays & Tuesdays. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was my crew that I was working with. We pretty much got all trucks out on time with always being short handed. We also worked with everyone on the dock if we saw one person struggling to keep up we move around to help to make it easier on each other.
good,the other employees at oreilly's where a blast to work with. manager doesn't know how to manage people. the work was great and the training was easy and well done
good,the manager is laid back until he gets stressed and then he starts acting up and trying to dis on you. its a very stressful place because the customers are rude.
good,Customer service all day. I learned how to involve critical thinking on a day to day basis. Stocking and inventory management and conflict resolution.
good,Thew people I interacted with were very nice.I was basically crossed trained in all positions.I enjoyed meeting a lot of different people when I delivered their merchandise to them when they placed their orders.
good,"The company hired a new DM and this person ruined my working experience. He cleaned house and in less than one year, fired 90% of the staff. He replaced all positions with people of his choosing."
good,"All in all O'Reillys is a great company. A normal day really depends on the location. Warehouses or busy stores are almost impossible to work. But the discount is great, if you have an old car. But my problem with the company is even though the slowest stores still regularly break $250k it seems like the majority of the wealth is held by the top of the company without much trickle down economics."
good,good management staff and fun enviornmrnt. decent work shifts have good culture attitude. Good place to work if like working with your hands. put in batteris bulbs and some other minor things.
good,"Great job to have. Good place to work at. Fill out an application today."
good,"its a high paced place , will have to deal with customers and attitudes from ones that think there a master mechanic. can be fun work environment . the discount is great"
good,i enjoyed working at oreillys it was a good place to work for i would recommend it to a friend i had to leave for a hsort spell due to medical reasons
good,"I love working here the managers are nice along with the team"
good,I learned how to adapt into the store while being coached and being a productive sales specialist. Overall a team effort is required in order to meet store goals and individual sales.
good,"Excellent company,excellent benefits,excellent incentives programs,company will give you everything to operate your store is up to the Regional manager and district manager how they used it ..excellent workplace culture..."
good,"the work is easy enough, but its fast paced and sometimes hectic. the weight of some of the products can be dangerous if handled quickly and/or improperly"
good,"meet new people every day. some customers not so happy and others very easy to get along with. fellow workers were very helpful and friendly. if you had any questions, they were willing to help out and answer them. i learned a lot about vehicles at this job by selling parts to help fix problems."
good,Fun place to work just think we are under paid and commissions are nothing compared to other employees. I have been around automotive my whole life so meeting all the car people is fun.
good,"This was a great job for me as I went to school. Although sometimes I had to deal with some irritating customers, but thats any customer service job. I learned a lot about cars and management skills and made some friends working there. Poor pay, but fair for the work."
good,This place is great to work if you love vehicles and anything to do with them. The atmosphere is fun and challenging and sometimes stressful but at the end of the day it all comes together.
good,Over all its an ok job it fits well with hours just not enough pay to take care of my family and i feel im not paid enough for my experience and not aloud to take off when needed
good,"Fast paced and slow paced dont slack off"
good,"Fast paced, detailed oriented, place to work. Learned a lot in my many years there. They have a good culture system and try to do things for the team members to show appreciation for their work. You won't get rich but can make a living."
good,Everyday can be different but defiantly faced paced and you always stay busy which is a plus for me.They try to make it fun for their employees with cook outs and other events. Sometimes can be really short staffed and makes things difficult at times but they do what they can.
good,"Only left to help take care of newborn. General manager was not well versed in taking care of his employees, but all other management was great. Would work there again."
good,Loved the work I did as inbound material handler. Pay was good. Benefits were good.  Most of management team was nice and helpful.  I decided to find a new job because it was becoming too physically demanding.
good,"This was a very fun place to work. I had no issues with the team members. We were like a family. the corporation started making changes and took benefits away from the employees. They do offer 401k health, dental and optical insurance, vacation time, holiday pay stock options and incentive bonuses to full-time employees. Took away health benefits to part-time employees. Allowed part-time employees to retain vacation time, holiday pay, incentive bonuses based on personal sales or the store profits. Also gave a high discount for buying your own personal auto parts and a discount on cell phone bill. Required the merchandiser to travel to several different stores for inventory with no drive time compensation only mileage pay  It only payed out once a month.Most of my drives were over an hour one way in my own personal vehicle."
good,"There was only one thing I disliked about working there and it was the heat, but other than that it was a great work place. Everyone was extremely friendly and work was simple."
good,its ok i dont see a furture here they cut of hours if we dont get busy we r under pay. people wise every one there is great but everyone i work with hates be there
good,Oreillys as a company is a good one with great training for employees.Through our my time working there i have learned alot.Its also would make a good part time job for high shool students.
good,"Typical day at work would be showing up counting your drawer, taking care of customer needs and keeping the store maintained, keeping it stocked with products and looking professional at all times. I have learned a lot about cars and business from working at O'reilly's and what it takes to run and up keep a business and how to work with and understand customers needs. The management is stern but easy to obey, if you do your job right and with joy then you have nothing to worry about, if you don't do your job right and with a sour attitude then you get to deal with unsatisfied customers and unpleasant management. The work place culture is very clean and organized, everyone works well together and under stand what needs to be done to get through the day successfully. The hardest part of the job would be that at the end of the day you can't always make everyone happy no matter how hard you try and it's hard to accept that sometimes but it is part of the business. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to make people happy and make their day better by helping them out with parts that they need to keep their own careers and lives going while also getting to work with vehicles and parts all day."
good,"O'reilly is. A really good place to work. The manager there is really nice and laid back. When you work there, you don't work by yourself, you work as a team.if you're in to cars, you get to learn new things and meet some really nice people"
good,"At my current location, management is very knowledgeable and helpful. the job itself is not challenging at all, but it can be if the other team members are not motivated."
good,good place to work just had some management issue when I worked there but they have the right people it goes good. just need to work on the favoritisms.
good,I enjoyed working here. The environment is fast paced but I worked at two locations and all the employees are very friendly and the management was flexible as well
good,"The day was always busy between stocking, phone sales, customer service and cashier.  I learned about stocking facing, customer service, computer searches and ordering.  Management was responsive to needs.  the hardest part of the job was the lifting.  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service."
good,"Hard work, but worthwhile."
good,"Stocking and inventory, delivering parts, collection on accounts,"
good,While working at oriellys auto parts it was fun and very compfrotable enviroment. Everybody pulled their own weight and we all worked together as a family.
good,Typical day consists of delivering parts to commercial accounts and also helping out walk in customers in the store with any parts or questions they need.
good,its a good place to work however they need to get better at getting the proper staffing. overall friendly staff and the people who work there are very helpful
good,"a typical day at work is helping costumers, by either phone or walk-in. I learned patience with costumers, accuracy with part numbers, and related products to do a job right."
good,"You can move up in the company if you have the drive to, you can also learn a lot a this company from customers and employees. It is a great place to start of in retail."
good,"Enjoy the company and the people. Straight forward job room for advancement .  Job is what you make it, there are ups and downs with the job Can be busy all get out them not busy."
good,This was a pretty cool job I enjoy the people of the tub still gangster whether we work together overall. In the manager was so she'll hear. I would definitely go back if I can get more pay.
good,"typical days at work included various busy points as well as slow points, management wasn't always the best, not very approachable."
good,"I enjoyed my job very much always interacting with the general public,learning auto parts was never boring,fast paced at times and slow other times"
good,I like my store and the people I work with in there except 1 person. A lot of really cool regular customers that come in. Sometimes it's just hard to get everything done in timely manner due to customers constantly walking in as management doesn't understand. It gets annoying. Definately should pay better than they do. It's not worth getting yelled at talked down to overall being disrespected by customers for 11 an hour. Let alone have an upper manager title for 85 cents more
good,"Delivery Driver"
good,This place was great until the new district manager came in and want to run all stores the exact same. He doesnt care about your families. Just a number to him we are. I wanted to grow with this family until he came into the picture. If i was in a different district think would be different. They dont train correctly. The company is not on same page together.
good,The job itself can be pretty stressfull at times but the more you put into it the more you will get out of it. Very employee friendly company with above average benefits.
good,Atypical work day consists of checking in truck and assisting customers. Learned that great customer service keeps the customers coming back and happy.
good,I enjoyed working at O'Reilly's. I was not very fond of the commission system that they use. Many times an employee would put in a lot of time and effort helping a customer only to have that costumer come back to purchase parts and the credit go to the employee that happens to be working that day.
good,"Seems like at times it's about who you know to make advancements.  Its a great place to work at and the immediate ""family"" at the store are great people.  Once you get above the store manager though it's seems to go downhill.  "
good,Great place to pass your time while you're finding your next road. If you choose to stay there are plenty of opportunities to move up inside of the company due to their preference of hiring within.
good,Good family orientated company and a great company to work with. Usually promote from each store personnel . Has good rewards for doing an outstanding job.
good,it was a good place to work but at my store we werent properly staffed and the supervisors arent easy people to deal with other than that i liked my job
good,"Good work environment, very knowledgeable people, team oriented.I have the opportunity to meet a wide array of different people, learn more about repairing of vehicles, which is probably the best part of the job for me. My coworkers are nice and respectful and do not try to make you feel unworthy due to questions you may have."
good,"helping customers and maintaining inventory is the easy part, trying to move up in the company is the difficult part. Jumping thru hoops with no signs of actually gaining a higher position or raise. Part time working Full time hours"
good,"I work hard and gave my all, I trained and for this job daily, I learn a lot and gave to the customer  often, teaching other how to look up part and how to locate in the store and behind the counter."
good,"On any given day, I would lead a team to daily,weekly,and monthly sales goals. I delegated tasks that included floor moves, store maintenance, and customer service."
good,"If you're great with vehicles and slightly hateful customers that constantly want prices changed then O'Reilly's is the place for you! Great starting pay rate and commission! Usually flexible hours. The best shift is 8-5, but get used to closing and working weekends if you're not full time. Generally some downtime but lacking enough employees to struggle with customer demand at peak times."
good,"go in, clock in, when co workers get there, we all start joking around but know when to get serious and when work needs to get done."
good,"Fair pay, no benefits, scattered hours.  Enjoyed the work and customers.  Flexible hours.  Great part time job.  Open or close shifts available."
good,Taking care of the customers on a daily bases. putting away stock. and making deliveries. I've  learned a lot about cars. I can run a code on cars and testing batteries alternators and starters. I also learned how to do planograms. My manager is fair to all the employees. We all work as a team. I like doing planograms. and making deliveries gives me a chance to be outdoors. I don't think their is anything hard about my job.
good,place is a good fast paced work enviornment the only bad was management besides that the work place was very good and nice place to work for
good,"All in all, it is a good company to work for.  I am only part time but have been offered promotions."
good,"I enjoyed this job in the sense that it was an inside job, I was able to develop my customer skills further working here. And it also gave me management experience that I can use down the road."
good,Sold automotive parts to individuals and automotive shops. The store was in a very small town and was hard to find able employees.
good,its a really nice pace to work at and learn about vehicles. i learned a lot about auto parts and now able to understand what each part does. the best part about my job was going out and helping a customer with their needs to make sure they understand anything that might possibly be wrong with their car and show them what they need to fix that problem.
good,"After 10 years working for the company, I held almost every position there was. I really enjoyed working with private dealers and dealerships to provide them with all of their parts needs. I didn't like having to balance the front counter sales with the professional sales because it took away from my customers. That mostly happened due to lack of staffing. My management staff was great in the beginning but lacked in leadership and organization towards the end of my employment. I learned exceptional customer service and leadership skills in my time at O'Reilly's."
good,I enjoy my job because I enjoy working with the public.Everyday is different as certain days have different duties to perform. My job was not hard and my co workers were all great to work with.management was good.
good,Everyday was a lot of exciting new information and knowledge that I had not previously known. The employees were all very respectable and knowledgeable in the field. The hardest part of everyday was being faced with questions on things that I had no personally dealt with and trying to assist the customer to the best of my abilities. The most enjoyable part of the job by far was being able to help customers who weren't knowledgeable in the trade and making sure that they felt they were being treated fairly and ultimately satisfied at the end of their visit.
good,The store I worked at has great co-workers. They company itself could use some changes. Maybe more respect for the employees that don't work at corporate.
good,"High paced environment. Worked closely with the development team, Cities and design professionals to acquire permits for construction. Tight schedules to open new stores."
good,My coworkers are fun to work with customer are also good to me as well. hardest part of the job is there can be some bad customers. i am an RSS or a retail sales specailists which is a third key holder or manager. i learn in this posistion to be a leader and to make tough decisions
good,"customer service,knowledge, committment,its a good company and has a descent plan for its employees. it has some ptential to be part of a well established company"
good,"It was fast pace place to work at, it was non stop up to around 9pm. This job taught me a lot in auto, you give more knowledge on it. Hardest about the job was we were understaffed most of the time."
good,made some friends on my delivery route and at the store. had a lot of fun doing it. miss it! some of my coworkers where great to work with.
good,"Working there consisted of stocking and inventory, customer relations and services, parts identification, parts locating and ordering, and basic vehicle diagnostics. I learned so much about parts, part identification, and vehicle maintenance and diagnostics in the 3.5 years I spent with O'Reilly Auto Parts and AutoZone I cannot do it justice in a short review. The people I worked with and above at O'Reilly Auto were generally great people that I got along with on a daily basis. Every person has their bad days and good days, but as a whole we all enjoyed working with one another. Management, on the other hand, was very difficult to work with and along side. With it being a corporation there was very little to no room for discussion on certain things because it is what it is and how it is and the reason for that is just because. I got that answer a lot when I asked questions about procedure or topics such as that. The hardest part of that job was definitely customer service. Dealing with upwards of 120-250 separate people each and every day can sometime overwhelm a person. The most difficult thing was the language barrier in an area like Guymon, where the diversity is very large. African, multiple ethnicities of Asian, and multiple Hispanic ethnicities definitely keep one on their toes. I do speak a fair amount of Spanish but the multiple dialects definitely keep me listening and problem solving. Again I just enjoy cars and truly do enjoy teaching and helping customers as well as learning more about vehicles."
good,"Go work and help those you can while keeping  the store in orderly and fully functional retail establishment. Started with minimum knowledge of the parts world an now having  a well rounded knowledge of the processes and protocols of an auto parts retail store. Management was understanding and accommodating of employees needs and situation. Close net co-workers working together on a common goal made working together easy. The demands of costumers was the most difficult part of the job, but the most enjoyable part of my job is helping costumers who appreciate the knowledge and help of the staff.."
good,"A typical day can start off busy have its slow moments in-between and right before we close it will end up busy again."
good,"always something to do during down time, but stays busy most of the time, no benefits for part time work. You see a lot of different people and meet a lot of fun people as well. Enjoyable people to work with, sometimes it gets stressful."
good,faced paced 9 hour day where I interacted with up to 50 people in a day. sold parts collected payment set up deliveries and returns.
good,Great place to work. Opportunity to be productive and advance. Co-workers are pleasant and well as the customers. Easy going environment and great relationships made with customers.
good,"Long periods of standing around or performing the same redundant task with little to no progress, broken by short bursts of assisting customers with part selection, specific application look-ups, as well as minor repair advice or vehicle diagnostics."
good,"good place to work providing customer service, good benefits,good work schedules, good competitive, fun workplace."
good,nice place to work just couldn't stay have to continue to write before moving on.
good,"My typical day at work consist of me being there at 8 and working until 2 monday through friday. Working there I learned how to ring up customers and learned about car parts, which I didn't know anything about before I walked through the door. My coworkers were really nice to me and helped me when I needed it and the only hard part of my job was, not really having the knowledge or background of cars so I could've provided better customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was, the people. It was a cool place to work."
good,"A typical day at work would be 90% out in the company vehicle delivering parts to mechanics, making exchanges, making return invoices, picking up wrong parts, cores and money."
good,"I got raises, & good people, But the lower management really didn't let the employees know what was going on in order to fix or improve the store."
good,This is a great first job for new job seekers if you have a good knowledge for cars
good,"Managing/supervising, staffing, scheduling of store employees. "
good,Returning customers give you the satisfaction of knowing that you've helped them enough to win their confidence. Staff is also very knowledgeable and easy to get along with.
good,"good workplace "
good,I really liked working for this company overall bet there was a lot of room for improvement when it came to training and direction
good,"Most days were spent always adjusting inventory and making sure cycle/bin counts were up to date, receiving freight, reporting to SM(store manager) periodically, helping customers, and occasionally assisting our commercial manager. I learned a lot about cars specifically, and the function of most parts and special tools required to fix them when needed. My co-workers were always at competition with each other for sales which kind of took their attention away from providing actual ""customer service"" and maintaining overall store appearance and cleanliness. For some reason my manager always felt it was my job to pick up after everyone and train them to take care of themselves which can get kind of exhausting and interrupt with a lot of the duties I had to complete which in turn lead to a lot of overtime because he just didnt want to take the time to train everyone correctly. That lead to a lot of miss-communication and lost customer information by other employees which I had to somehow magically fix almost every day."
good,A typical day at work is very fast pace in and out delivering parts and helping out customers in the store and putting up inventory as well. You learn on a day to day basis whether it's learning something new on the computer or something new on parts. My co-workers are outgoing people full of personality we all get along inside and outside of the work environment. The hardest part of the job is having to tell a customer that we cannot help them with their automotive issues. I love going to work it keeps me going.
good,"putting up parts "
good,A typical day includes driving from Tampa to Ocala delvering auto parts. I enjoy the people I work with and there is nothing hard about the job. I only wish that I could be full time.
good,Great place to be a driver and management was great also but the pay was significantly lower then their competitors.
good,"this was a very good place to work except the pay, if they paid more i would make a career out of this company. easy to move up, helpful people."
good,For the 6 months I've been there the supervisors and co-workers showed a great deal of hard work and dedication to the company which has inspired me to do so as well. Although i wasn't able to continue my career there for school reasons i was still able to learn from my experience there and grow as a person too.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts has a great philosophy on taking care of its employees and customers. Corporation has many programs to assist its employees to help them succeed or in a time of need. Working in Retail stores can vary greatly depending on management.
good,decent job could be better thought. was there four years now im ready to move on.
good,"The management team is easy to get along with, the crew really treats you like you are part of their family. O'Reilly's has a computer training program that teaches you about various systems in  cars, trucks, and even semi's. Written communication is not a strong point in O'Reilly AutoParts. The work day really pays off when a customer really shows their appreciation towards you."
good,"Clock in and begin to ""Do Truck"" as we say. That is unloading our new merhcnadise, scan and sort in diffrent baskets. update inventory then begin to stock merchsndise on shelfs. Then I would go on register assist customers with purchases and questions about their vehicles. hardest part would be to memorize all our inventory and auto parts we carry, but i was able to do it in 2 weeks."
good,"I liked working in automotive, it was something I knew a good bit about. My favorite thing was the customers. It was always a new experience."
good,"Was a great workplace, close coworkers depending on which store you worked at. "
good,"It is a fast-paced environment, which is what I did like about this job. Getting to know all of our regular customers, people I worked with were fun & somewhat helpful. The hardest part of the job was probably lifting some heavy things that came in off the truck, but was not too bad. I learned a lot while working here and how to work together as a team."
good,"Depending on store, experience may very. Company was good to work for, depending on store management wasnt"
good,Flexible hours some benefits. Lots of duties per person but over all fun caring staff.
good,"When I started with Orellys, my manager was very pro-team oriented. I jumped right in not knowing anything but was taught in such a manner I felt appreciated. During the change of management I felt like I was a threat and was treated not accordingly to what I had been prior."
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts has complete left the ideals of it's founder, but is as a whole a good company to work for."
good,I enjoyed working for this company but the advancement is incredibly slow and the standards of the management are low. It was a work environment that semed to have a lot of opinionated and disloyal people. There was generally friction in the work place between employees and to be honest not too much respect between them either. Professionalism was at a decent standard for the most part. This is just my opinion for one store any me experiences. I wouldn't want this to reflect on the company as a whole. I truly believe this is a good company to work for when under good management.
good,A day with this company was always interesting. You would walk into the building wondering what time you were going to be let go and where you were going to be needed. Overall the days moved quickly and the paychecks were worth the time.
good,"Overall, O'Reilly's has taught me a lot about automotive and management skills. Customers are great most of the time and the employees are the same way."
good,Overall good general place to work at for steady income and advancement.
good,the hardest part of the job in the stocking is keeping up the productivity and accuracery in the levels that are required.
good,"Overall a good work experience, the environment and work load changes drastically between stores though. Good management and friendly coworkers made for a phenomenal job at my first store, my second store was in the middle of a remodel and was an absolute nightmare. I would definitely consider working for the company again depending on the location"
good,"Great work environment, friendly management. Advancement is based on a great work ethic, not just knowledge. The con is that its minimum wage and barely liveable but I enjoy working here. Another con is they will put you in whatever position they need filled, not exactly what you were hired for."
good,"The company emphasizes its culture values of hard work and dedication, as well as the mission statement of becoming the dominant auto parts supplier in all its markets."
good,It’s a good place to work if you are going to school or need a nice substantial job. Everyone I work with Has a good spirit about their job and enjoy working there
good,"I am ashamed to say that I did not take full advantage of the opportunity I had at O'Reilly while I was there. It was a good job that pushed precision in accuracy, hard work, and reliability. I did not always reflect those qualities. I am not aware of the culture now, but while I was working there I do not believe I was the only one who was like that. As is true of many manual labor jobs, the turnover rate was high. Whether that is the fault of the employer or the employee, I do not know. The pay was fair and there was a very regular opportunity for pay increased (based on performance) as well as career advancement."
good,"Worked there as a parts specialist for about 1&1/2 years. I knew a good bit about vehicles before applying, but I learned a lot about common failures and different parts of cars and trucks that I know now. Very good benefits and good hours."
good,"its hard to get fired, just do your job and you have nothing to worry about."
good,"good people good atmosphere, could use better training for new hires. and if they would stand by there word. overall an ok place to work if the lies stopped"
good,A decent place to work. The people are friendly enough. Blah blah blah blah. I done mostly hub driving I wasnt at the shop to much so I cant give a good description on how they worked things there.
good,"It is interesting to work for the company for a number of reasons. There is a lot of benefits, the company gives you many incentives to work for them. The hours are VERY dependent of the current local market. By that I mean that the hours you will get are dependent of the sales that specific store is receiving. The company likes to through the word TEAM, around a lot but you have a job and the stores seem very singular. Unfortunately there is not a lot of immediate job advancement. Many workers are young and as soon as they are hired they always want to find better job placements to avoid doing what many would see as ""mundane"" or ""grunt"" work. Which is great but with a consistently changing market makes you learn about a new co-worker every few months. What I can say is look for a store you would like to absolutely work at and get to know the people you work with. Your time there will be more enjoyable with everyday and the job will seem more fulfilling."
good,"Overall I would have to say a great place to work. Spent almost 15 years with the company, and the only reason I left was for way more money at Union Pacfic. Unfortunately if I could do it all over I would have stayed with Oreillys, cause the money wasnt worth not seeing my family. If you have a chance start a career here"
good,I have worked with the company for a few years now and the best part about working there are the people that I am around. There are some great repeat customers but the bad customers are also regulars. The balance is to just give them what they need and treat them like the rest of your customers. Typically the culture in the work place surrounds cars so if you are a car person it'll be for you. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when you start talking to a customer about cars and they light up because you're no just some person behind the counter selling parts.
good,I got hired on the old training system where you had to do training now it’s pretty much you get through on the register some times it can be buzy sometimes you dont get a customer all night
good,The job is easy all you have to do is know some car parts and mostly everything else falls in place. You learn quickly how to deal with customers with difficult questions. the management at the time needed help for now i'm sure they are better. The best part of the job was learning new things from the mechanics who came in.
good,Deliver auto parts to commercial customers. Bring customer returns back to store. Pick parts from stock shelves to deliver. Stock shelves from bulk freight deliveries. Requires daily education online.
good,"This job is like no other. If you work hard and express your interest to advance, you will be rewarded by advancement and opportunities. Pay is nothing special, but benefits are a huge plus. The culture in this company is like no other. District and Regional management leave much to be desired."
good,I learned a lot of knowledge about cars and other kinds of vehicles. There is a lot of resources at your disposal for learning. The connections you can grow in this environment are some of the best pros I can mention.
good,Management was poor. Hours were fairly decent. The work environment was clean and the coworkers were decent. Overall the job was alright. Decent place
good,I advanced very quickly through the ranks to Assistant Manager within 3 months. Great customers come through and told stories and that made me excited to go to work the next day.
good,"My daily routine was open the store, do returns, count safe, paperwork. Do the schedule for the following two weeks. Manager issues, Human Resources issues, Lp issues. Have good customer service"
good,Great store manager. Hard to get hours if your not full time but opportunity to advance is always there as long as your punctual and honest. The training they provide will keep you up to date with customer needs.
good,"Great place if you have thick skin. The Distribution center has a lot of gossip. But many people have been there a long time. Good, steady paycheck. Some benefits good, some expensive. Typical DC environment: dont be late! Ever! If you are a person who is late, don't bother, it is the easiest way to get fired."
good,I worked here for 12 Years. Started out as a parts proffesional and in three months moved to an asst. manager. Then three months after that got promoted to a store manager but then took my own hub store as the manager and that is where I stayed for the rest of my career at O'Reilly Auto Parts. Wanting to move up as a District Manager and take on more duties and hold my own meetings with fellow mangers and they passed right over me.
good,"This was a great job to have if you are just out of high school or just getting experience. There is not a lot of room for advancement but, good benefits, and discounts."
good,"Good job, good people, generally good store managers. They do not offer cost of living raises. 1-3% annually. The employee discount is really good. After 1 year working full time they offer stock purchase plans. I’ve enjoyed my time at Oreilly Auto until I tried to promote. If you’re not a yesman promotions are difficult."
good,"Nice job to work for a single man starting out. Good experiences. My hours were decent,  but I needed better pay for my kids. My coworkers and managers were cool to work with it was just hard to take time for my kids."
good,customers can be a real pain with not even knowing what vehicle they drive and then give an attitude if you cant get them the right part. management is good and the employee discounts are even better. not a hard job just kinda stressful dealing with certain customers.
good,A fun uplifting place to work.  The hardest part of the job was finding the correct parts the customers were coming to pick up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the laid back atmosphere.
good,It’s a good job if you know what your doing. Over then that it’s really easy relaxed. Busy and quick paced place but also. Sometimes very slow and nothing to do.
good,"this store needs to on the same page. we have CSI needs to set example for the rest of the team can follow. Drivers need to feel important. you do get to meet people. pitting up these heavy part, 50gal. barrels . need to uniform the breath"
good,"Flexible hours and decent benefits, they very rarely promote within the store they most always want u to be able to up root and move to become a store manager it took me 13 years to get to $11.50 an hour their raises usually at max are .25 cents a year"
good,Great company upper management at time was not in line company philosophy and goals. That particular manager no longer with company. I would have stayed with company
good,The option for career advancement is there. You do get raises based on your performance. The work is fast paced and you need to be accurate with the parts that you are selling. Sometimes the work can get overwhelming.
good,i just hope they will give me the opportunity to transfer with the company hopeful  and we start the day with paper work and deposit then do returns and the stock and start opening store and selling parts  i do enjoy my job and helping people with problems guess that why i do like to transfer i work in serveral store in TN just would like to move farther closer to my older son
good,"Most days it can be busy, sometimes seem overwhelming, but by pulling together as a team the job can be accomplished. When its slow training can be done to further product knowledge."
good,"I left due to a better job oppourtunity. But i miss it. The company is great to work for. Fast paced on most days. Great people, you get treated like family."
good,"I worked there for a little over 3 years, and it was a somewhat enjoyable experience. The crew I worked with was very nice and they made the exp a lot better."
good,"Oreilly was great, every employee I met was respectful, funny and genuine. Everyone truly cared about customers, the store and employees. They really male it feel like family. Being a merchandiser the work was non stop for the first 6 hours, it was great, and the manager was great. Always be confident in learning because I went from knowing nothing about car parts to pretty big percentage of knowing. The only problem is the underpay, but they do give an opportunity to grow."
good,My experience with O'Reilly's was overall great.They are willing to work with your schedules most of the time. Sometime expected you to come in no matter if your child is sick or its your day off. Some stories had their favorites were expected to do much of anything.  Most managers will try to help you if your have a hard time in any aspect of your life.
good,It is a great job to have and to learn about team work. They are really flexible with work hours if you are a college student. It is a great place to gain work experience.
good,Learned more about each different type of cars and their problems and how to over come and diagnose them. Management is good they definitely are apart of the team to get things done. Everyone that works there is friendly for the most part and enjoys being there. the most enjoyable part is actually helping out the customer with their needs and get the part they needed to get the job done and seeing the smile of their face when they come back and thank you for helping them out. hardest part of the job is locating parts that say they are there but not and then tracking it down for the customer to get or to order in
good,The best part about O'Reillys is the family-like atmosphere.  Customers and coworkers are loyal and are willing to help you at any time. By far one of the best companies I have encountered.
good,"A typical day would be directing my employees assigning tasks helping with customer and phone call situations and troubleshooting."
good,"Depends on the location you work at, some can be phenomenal but others can lack pretty seriously with management and organization. Pay raises could be offered more frequently for full time employees and offer part time employees more opportunities to advance."
good,"Good company, has employee problems like any company,  A few do most of the work, others just gripe about it.  My supervisor had just been in the deptment a few days before I started, so he was learning and trying to train me."
good,"Good company to work for overall, little low on the pay but it is to be expected with an entry level job. Good opportunity for networking as well as the national management meetings."
good,From this job I learned almost everything I know about vehicles. I also met some amazing people there who gave guidance through the more stressful parts of the job.
good,"Positive management, great guy where I was, decent coworkers, the poor ones got weeded out. Not unreasonable expectations, pretty modern equipment and a decently maintained tool cart available for use. Handy discount"
good,It was long hours was not home long for me to spend time with my daughter being a single mom i was paying more for child care then i was making to live
good,Great place to work. Asks a lot from their managers but for the most part easy going. If you do your job and are willing to relocate you can move up to any position you want to achieve.
good,"Sold parts over the counter and by phone including researching and acquiring non standard parts; finding workable solutions to meet customer needs. Prepared invoices, special orders and executed other necessary paperwork in accordance with Company policy. Checked in stock orders, stocked shelves, insured proper stocking levels were maintained. Performed periodic and special inventories."
good,"basic retail job"
good,My review for O'reilly Auto is pretty simple I liked working at this store I liked my Manager and Assistant Manager the ISS It was a good job i would gladly work at that store again if i was in Wyoming if they would take me back.
good,Never been much of a people person but my manager helped me along and pushed me to better myself The best part is the employee discount overall good company
good,I enjoyed working there because I like cars. Work consisted of selling cleaning and organizing. The hardest part of the job was turning Brake rotors. I enjoyed talking to customers the most
good,I enjoyed my time with O'Reilly's and still want to go back. I was an unloader and city counter driver and enjoyed both. I wouldn't mind doing anything they would put me if they hired me back.
good,Average day was very routine. Some exciting moments dealing with customers. Lots of computer learning from parts to obtaining your parts ase certification.
good,I enjoy my time working there.  I was able to get a raise every 6 months until top pay was reached.  My work was appreciated by my supervisors and team.
good,Got the job cause I don't have a car and can walk down the street from my dorm to work and it has been a experience working there so far. I would only recommend to any one who know about cars.
good,I actually had a great time working at O'reilly's just management is the issue and the raise is only 5 to 10 cents max on hard work. The stressful part is dealing with negativity of gossip.
good,"Nice foot in the door for your automotive career, but not the final destination "
good,"days were based on work load to amount of crew ratio if we had a small crew on a heavy day we would work 11+hr some days we would work 4 hours ,during summer it would feel like oven because its not climate controlled easy job,kind of a workout due to all the fast walking squating lifting pulling pushing"
good,Ive only been there a few months but from what my co workers say it's difficult to advance and truly make it a career. But it's an amazing place with awesome people. My manager is great I have stomach problems and he understands completely if I need to go slow or leave early some days.
good,"productive place with good people .  "
good,the people I worked with were great an good people. The customer service was ok at times but I delt with a lot of drama 5yrs of it caused more problems
good,"Did reports for the day before sales. Help customers either as they called or walked in to the store. In between customers I worked on inventory counts, putting stock up, straighten inventory and clean store."
good,"get everything they promise in writing"
good,Enough money to get you by if you work part time. Mostly a fun atmosphere with a few busy rushes from time to time. The discount was great i was a large reason i took the job at O'Reilly's. Treats their employees pretty well. Management requested more hours from me regularly and harped on me if i attempted to schedule days off which wasn't for me as I was a collegiate athlete at the time and I requested a month off in advance and would still get constantly questioned and badgered and bullied for requesting off or getting my request denied. Being a student first being asked to work more hours regularly was the worst part. I only left because I got a summer job away from school and tried to come back when I got back and they had no available positions. Would still probably work for O'Reilly's again if scheduling was better in the future all in all good place to work.
good,"Working for O'Reilly's was fun and exciting. A typical day would be checking in freight and stocking, returning merchandise, taking care of customers was always first priority. I extended my knowledge in automotive parts and systems. I was always eager to learn more everyday. Management was okay. Most managers knew how to properly run a store, and make sales for the company, and were great at teaching employees how to do this and have better customer service skills."
good,Depends on your crew and your boss on how it will be working at a specific location also has a good team work environment not a lot of heavy lifting just have to be a people person
good,quick-paced atmosphere and alot of walking. yet enjoyable. Learned alot about automotive parts that I wasn't quite knowledgeable of and was able to gain a better understanding of how the automotive stores operate along with the distribution center.
good,This was a good company to work for. I only got hired because i was dating the managers sister and he really needed someone to unload the truck every morning. It got me thru the door and turned a blind eye to the misdemeanors i had and gave me a chance to show my worth. After the first 6 months i requested to be moved to the counter. I learned as much spanish as i could in order to keep up with the other employees. After a year I transferred to another store where in the first 2 weeks i was moved into a management position. I enjoyed the job but i feel like I got taken advantage of because i am a woman. I worked a lot harder than a lot of the men in my position and above me and was still looked over time after time.
good,"I mean it's like any retail job, you just have to know about different things. It's a great job for someone starting out and depending on the place, you can get promoted with relatively hard work. Pretty ""run of the mill"" retail job."
good,"It can be a very good place to work, chronically understaffed, low wage offers, except for Store Managers and above, Lots of training is offered.  Never seem to notify when Managerial positions are available, they pick and choose."
good,"I have only been with the company for less than a year so far and my knowledge for vehicle maintenaince and auto parts has increased immensely. This job helps me understand basic and major issues for all kinds of vehicles and small engines. My location is slow paced and relaxed which allows for a less stressful environment than other locations. Management with the company has always been respectful and understanding of any situations you may have while working. Battery installations and engine diagnostics in my opinion have always been the most stressful service, depending on the situation, but overall nothing too bad. The most enjoyed part of my job is learning new things while helping customers on a day to day basis. The very respected employee discount has helped me and my family in many cases take care of our vehicle maintenance. I would highly recommend Oreilly Auto Parts to someone in need of a job."
good,The company was excellent about making sure we knew the customers were taken care of and were always our main focus. They also did a good job of training us to be prepared for many circumstances and everyone helped one another to achieve our goals.
good,"Great place to work with customers, fellow workers are good people. Would work there again, and recommend it too others also.Needs better break room area."
good,it will take years and lots of hard work to get where you want. the pay is horrible and they expect you to work like you get paid 100k a year. the job overall is not that bad and the benefits are decent and growth is there to move up in the company but the pay is not...
good,"I wouldve been a pretty good job, if i had been paid for the work i was doing. My job position never changed, therefore my pay was not allowed to move up like the others."
good,Loved the job that combined auto experience and training with driving. Same customers but new assignments every day! Handled money from parts delivery to commercial clients.
good,The job it fun if you like vehicles and learning stuff about them. The environment is super relaxed and the people are fun to work with. You get lunches and they understand you have a life outside of work
good,Oreilly's would be a great career if it paid accordingly for the expertise it looks for. You can't get an ASE certified tech for $10 per hour that can work at any shop for $30.
good,Day to day duties include sales calls in an effort to grow commercial business.  Great for the outgoing personality that enjoys a challenging work environment.  Management is based a lot of trust and self accountability.
good,"Decent place to work"
good,"Very clean and newer buildings, they give team member incentives, however wages are dismal for the work load you are expected to accomplish, even McDonald's pays more, don't expect to build any form of wealth, but definitely a notch better than Autozone or Advance in terms of a comfortable environment."
good,"Loved the job, but need to know a lot about cars and it doesn't pay well jus a lil over minimum wage.  Give raises once a year but their very low usually 10 cents raises.  Seriously,  I got a 15 cent raise for being a outstanding employee.  I was suppose to get 10 cents but since I had perfect attendance and great work ethics I got 15 cents.  wow! I quit soon after that.  Be nice to your part store helpers.  They don't get payed much."
good,its a great company i just couldnt see myself staying there. the jobs i could advance to i didnt see myself doing for the rest of my life and thats why i moved on. but its a great team and job.
good,"For the first several years this was a good place to work.  Pay wasn't great and raises were rare but the culture and atmosphere made up for it.  Unfortunately the company, at least in my area has become just another job where they make you fully aware you're easily replaceable.  It can still be good or bad depending on the store manager.  The problem is if your store has a bad manager it does no good to complain because of the ""good ol' boy"" attitude of upper management.  They stick together and during my time there I saw plenty of team members get their hours continually cut back until they could no longer afford to stay when they tried to get upper management to address issues.  If you're thinking about working for O'Reilly Auto Parts I would suggest going to the location where you want to work and talk to the employees in the evening after the manager has left to be sure it's one of the good ones."
good,"Great place to work, wish the pay was a little better. great customer base. Great discounts. Flexible work hours. Training was good and educational. Good managers."
good,"Stressful environment but, learning things at a fast pace. It gets you involved at decent rate. The discount was nice. Health benefits and business benefits where also nice. Teamwork was a big part of it."
good,"Extremely easy job to do and it is a very relaxed paced job. If you work on your own vehicles then you will love the discount on parts, I think it is like 40-50% and I definitely took advantage of that!"
good,"Good place to work for a single person.No rotating weekends off and a random schedule week to week. No vacation request during the summer months."
good,"Coworkers can make or break your job. Working in a small town business is slow. Easy work, you learn a lot even if you think you know a lot already. Management plays a good role in how you’ll like your job. Depending on where you work pay can stink."
good,"Really enjoy my job at O'Reilly, but need more days and hours.  Enjoy working with the public and helping customers.  Typical retail position, but knowledge of parts and automobile mechanics is helpful.  Co-workers are terrific."
good,"Fast-paced environment at this location. Customers usually lined up waiting for doors to open. High-volume customer base with heavy customer service needs. Ability for unlimited commissions based on add-ons and up-sales. On-going educational opportunities via weekly on-line training modules. Good arena for honing multi-tasking skills. Store management approachable and skilled at delegating and designating job requirements and responsibilities. Team members worked well together, for the most part, and were willing to assist one another as needed. An updated computer system would be an asset allowing for easier access to customers' prior sales records when dealing with returns and warranties. Interacting with large numbers of customers makes the day enjoyable, but also makes the day seem to pass all too quickly at times."
good,"Quick bursts of customer traffic followed by slow moments stocking shelves. 50/50"
good,The job is fairly laid back and is a good place to work. The pay isn't great but it is fair for the difficulty. A good salesman can make up for the pay with commission.
good,This job could lead you into a better career. you have to learn befor you can move up but the turn at low levels is always stessfull. so it hard to move up with a company so big and so many employees its really hard to shine unless you are a superstar
good,"Learned more about cars and how to work in a fast paced environment. Also, how to deal with questions customer would ask good and bad. my mangers also, helped me with hours."
good,Good job but low pay. Career advancement takes very long even when you exceed the requirements. Store Manager was great. You get to learn a lot and good benefits.
good,"Good atmosphere, and good coworkers. Store feel depends on the town it is in,otherwise if sales are slow the job can be a little boring. However getting paid by the hour never hurts when things are slow."
good,The job consists of greeting walk-in customers as well as the commercial clients. Monthly sales goals were set by management and commission is awarded monthly.
good,typical day at work is up beat and fast paced. I learned new skills and we work a lot with team work and rely on each other. The work place was a great environment we grew as a team and had great culture. the hardest part of the job is that it isn't easy to move up in positions.
good,"But as it got sold after many years, the company culture kept going down.  CSK wasn't too bad as they left Murray's as its own company. But when it went to O'Reily, everything went out the window.  After a bit, they started restructuring the Store Manger pay program and making mostly dependent on store sales with a very small base...while that may work for new store managers, the old timers like me it just wouldn't do & they knew that.  After 4-months most of the old timers were gone, including myself."
good,oriellys is a easy job to understand and jump into. However it is easily to get let go if someone calls in on your driving. learned quite a bit and management is easy to get along with
good,"Pay is low but good entry level job, room for advancement, workable hours and schedule, also good if you're into mechanics.  No prior mechanics experience required."
good,was a great place to work for pay on par with other jobs in this field 
good,It truly feels like a family when you work there. Not a bad job at all it is based on sales and it was fun when we competed but you do need to know about everything.
good,"Reviewed my daily sales sheet , Loaded Vehicle with sales Parts and sales promos , Put together a heavy truck parts selection, also put together a Hydraulic hose and crimping machine section, Management gave me the OK to put in what i felt needed to make sales in the heavy duty truck and trailer market. Workplace was fun and busy, Hardest part was being price competitive in heavy market, The work atmosphere was great"
good,Good Company  to work for .  Typical work days are not to stressful . It is a learn as you go type job . Advancement is pretty good on the low end of.
good,"O'Reilly's is a great place to work if you are looking to work in the automotive . I have learned so much with my time here it's unbelievable, the only hard part of the job is some of the customers aren't the friendliest people."
good,"O'Reilly was a good place to work for me.  I started as a driver then within a year got promoted to a retail service specialist (key-carrier), but you could not really count on the words of the manager.  He will tell you he would work this and that with you, and for a while he will do it, then after some time take away what was supposed to be promised without a word given to you.  Besides that I have been working there for some time then some new people get hired and tell me they are getting paid more than I am even after I was at a higher position!"
good,"I felt like it was a fun place to work. Got along with everyone very well. Built a friendship with management and things clashed between out of work and in work. Other than that, great place to meet new people."
good,"We did all the training for new team members so you get to show them haw everything works and not let them get bad habits. I learned cash handling, time management, and how to talk to different people, such as team members/customers."
good,knowledgeable staff and associates available to help or answer questions. Lots of training to help you excel with you job responsibilities. ongoing support.
good,"Good job culture, not hectic during the weeks except Friday. Never had any issues with customers or the way the store ran except that the manager was still kinda new and would not like to hear any opinions from anyone besides the assistant manager. Would make others including myself feel like we didn't know what we were doing by being talked down too and putting us down."
good,"Despite barely having enough workers, the work atomsphere was fun but could become very stressful at times. Many workers never should up for their shifts becuase the right employees were not hired."
good,"Fun environment with great management and opportunity to advance career in the field. a day at work is fast, fun, and goes by quickly. plenty of company for the social type, always assisting customers with all kinds of problems and troubleshoots."
good,"I worked at an Oreilly Sales store in Alabama. It's not a bad gig but you are underpaid extremely bad for the type of work that you do and the people you have to deal with. It's a great place for someone who doesn't want to go to school or might not be able to because you can really learn about automotive systems and how they work. It's a great starter job for someone coming out of high school, especially if they are into auto technology. I wasn't full time so I had plenty of time off. I have no say in whether or not the work to family ratio was fair because I didn't work full time, and I was there for 5+ years. Although I know in my region they didn't believe in letting people have Holidays. Corporate also expects way too much out of you as far as the selling part goes. You were supposed to sell this much and do this and that. Like you can control how many people walk through your door a day, especially when it's raining."
good,Oreillys is a great place to work in a industry that continues to grow. Oreillys is growing by about 1000 stores a year and incorporates a great culture as well.
good,O'reillys is a great place to work at you learn fast and get great one on one with people everyday the hardest part is the rush hours but it can be fu
good,"I expected to learn much about life working for a corporation, but after only a couple weeks I was given a specific job to do and sent on my way. The mentoring ended that day."
good,They teach you everything you need to know to get the job done. the management teach you a good work ethic and knowledge on everything to move up in the company.
good,This was the best job I ever had everyone work together. I really miss my job here. the only problem I had was the superviser she had so Bi polar issue or something plus on top of that she talk about everyone like she was still in high school or something other than that I had no problem I got along with everyone except her. I even got along with other stores and the district manger. I have no problem doing what she ask. I kept everything organize and she was happy with it. she even said when I gave my 2 week notice I did good work.
good,I loved working at O'Reilly's the team was great and everyone all the way up to the CEO was friendly and eager to share information. The reason I left was because the other job was already recruiting me before I accepted that position and I had no knowledge of the upcoming acquisition.
good,a great company to work for. they give their employees commission based on individual sales or store sales. great management at all levels. no outrageous or ridiculous training programs
good,"Great people, good environment, LOW pay! I started at the warehouse and when I reached 62 I retired (semi) and started driving for a local store, 2 miles from home. The work is fast paced and tiresome at times, but then again I am not a young man any longer. Great mgt and great people to work with. However the pay is pretty pathetic!"
good,This. Company has a culture that is second to none. If you want to be part of a team oriented and people friendly environment then Oreilly Auto Parts is the place to be.
good,Depending on your location and management style the job can be very laid back. This is a perfect place for any student that is looking for a part time or full time job for the school year
good,"Loved the job and enjoyed working with people and the project cars they would be working on. But a store that does over 300,00.00 a month can afford to pay the employees more than 9.75 an hour."
good,the only downsides to working for this company is the very strict policies that are in place and the pay. I really enjoyed my time there and was on my way to making a comfortable living but one of the policies came back to bite me. you live and you learn. they have a very good insurance plan at a very reasonable cost to the employee.
good,"Wonderful store manager, relaxed work environment. As long as tasks are taken care of that are asked of you its a smooth job. "
good,"O'Reilly Auto is a great company to work for. They offer many benefits and opportunities to move up within the company. That is a good thing, but also a bad thing because some times O'Reilly will promote an employee who just isn't quite ready for the position, and that greatly effects everyone working in that same location. "
good,Love the job. Sell good quality parts you can have confidence in and good with warranties. Good employee Discount. Good environment to work and good customers
good,"I enjoyed working there. The only issue I had was the pay, you worked your butt off to get paid very little. My manager was laid back and fun to work with. We did cookouts and had fun."
good,Great place nice people. Don't make much unless and assistant manager or higher. Same pay as people that don't have a background in the automotive industry
good,Every day is different in this job because you always get a different customer each time and they sometimes rely on you to help resolve a problem with their vehicle. It can be really busy at times or slow depending on the time of the day but you always had something to do. My coworkers were the best people I could have worked with here.
good,Loved working here. I basically delivered parts to our mechanic shops. Stocked merchandise and would send merchandise out. Very laid back environment.
good,"not interested in filling out review at this time. looking to find a job."
good,O'reilly auto parts is a great first job for someone who doesn't know about parts. the staff will help anyone in need and go out there way for the customer. but the only down side is the pay and the management .
good,It's not a bad place to work their r friendly people and good management. The one down fall is pay rate they are well under other companies but that is the only downfall
good,I had a fantastic manager and a great team to work with!  Delivering parts allowed me help mechanics in our area give their customers the highest quality repairs possible as quickly as possible.  By taking the parts to the mechanics we saved them valuable time which allowed them to pass the savings down to their customers.
good,"When I first started working for the company everything was sooth, besides me striving for full time and not getting it. When a new manager was transferred in and terminations started the schedule started to become more difficult in working with."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at O'Reilly Auto Parts! As with any job, you have your good and bad days. The management was great and the staff became more like a family to me. I still drop in and visit from time to time."
good,O'reillys is a good place to work. The works very physical but there's a lot of different things you can do not just feel obligated to do 1 thing. Make a lot of work pals.
good,good camaraderie and supervision. good place to work. liked working for the company. manager was very helpful and encouraged teamwork.
good,"Cash handling. Bank deposits. "
good,"It is a good place to work for, the only downfall is that they do not pay based on experience. the hardest part of being asst. mgr is doing your job, plus the store mgr's."
good,"Working for oreillys was a great place to work, plenty of hours and breaks and lunches. I did not want to quit Oreillys but had to have a couple surgeries and would be unable to work for month for recovery"
good,"Start the day clocking in and began to count money at the counter to began making sales, if no customers are in the store clean floors back room, make sure the sales floor is clean and presentable, until closing time, then close down the store, make sure money safe is correct , make sure doors are locked and store is clean, set alarm over night. I learned a lot about cars and learned about how to supervise and be in charge of employees.  The hardest part of the job was being in charge and closing the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was, the people I worked with and being able to help people with their car making sure they are safe to make the drive they need to make."
good,"Do truck inspection, verify load and/or load truck. Make deliveries on time and safely manner. Learned many different routs. Management was respectful, helpful and understanding. Worked with great team players. Hardest part of the job was driving in the snow. Enjoyed meeting new people."
good,"Needs to be more professional setting, a lot of unnecessary drama in the work place between employees. Fun, but could have also been a better experience."
good,The job was a lot of fun. I got to learn all kinds of things about cars and repairing them. The hours could be rough due to call outs and things of the sort. I really enjoyed the people i delt with on a daily bases.
good,"It was a great experience, I enjoyed working there aside from minor issues. Gossip was one big contribution to some of the managers decision making."
good,"Typical day was simple look parts up, stock shelfs and just make sure store is clean and professional looking. Management differs from store to store, Job was simple and straight forward."
good,I have greatly enjoyed working at O'Reilly's. I have enjoyed being a part of such a great team.  I just wish there was more room for advancement.
good,Positioned as Delivery driver making drop offs to several establishments throughout the day. Time management skills were strengthened and knowledge of auto parts.
good,I love working at oreilly it's a great working environment a fun place to work I would recommend it to a person who that is just looking for something now not long term...
good,good place to work . easy company to work with . Manger is good and understanding . really good part time job. they are easy to work with . the weekends I had my kids they would let me off that weekend .
good,I've been at Orielly for 4 years I've changed departments 3 times (by choice) because I love learning different aspects of the warehouse.
good,"great part time job to get some experience. great work environment, good interaction with people in the local area. was able to learn basic car maintenance"
good,"Looking up Part Numbers Drive Delivery Trucks get to know the customers laughs with all employees including managers "
good,"I learned a lot while working there. Loved the people i worked with and the space worked in. I do not however, agree with how some buisness is conducted there."
good,"A typical day would include any restocking of product,inventory counting and store reorganization per corporate planograms. Lighthearted atmosphere. If a Person wants extensive experience in Customer Service this Company will provide Exactly that. The single most Important thing I learned was Face to Face Contact with an extensive variety of Customer Needs.Management is well Trained and Motivated towards Company Goals and Training.Hardest part of the Job was also the Customer Experience with regards to insuring every Customer remains satisfied and will repeat their Business with O'reilly Auto."
good,"I have learned a lot of how a virual pool inventory system works as it relates to retail sales. Management is excellent and reaally works ro train and ensure that I get the knowledge and suuport needed to do the job,"
good,its a job something temporary is fine not a job to have as a career unless your are up in management. not a hard job fairly easy
good,"Family orientated, manager knows what to look for good qualities in a employee and everybody gets along between coworkers"
good,"i enjoyed getting to know all the mechanics and learning all about cars, they were willing to give me knowledge of how  cars run and the simple things to do to keep them running. the  hardest part of this job was having to say good by"
good,it was a pretty hard job but i learned a lot while i could my co-workers helped me out when i was in need. it was fun learning new things about car parts its not just a guys job .
good,"worked 8 hours a day"
good,"if you want to get to know the more intricate parts of the automobile, this is a good intro job. I feel like you really need to like cars and know that you do though."
good,O'Reilly's has an awesome training program. They also offer a few ways to obtain bonuses. Overall an okay company to work for.
good,"I have learned a great deal at O'Reilly! I really did love the job other than management and the way they handled things, and that goes above the store manager! I would really love to work for this company again but in a different area. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact of constantly learning new things and different approaches to problems.  The hardest part was advancing (moving up and getting raises). My co-workers were great people and we all got along like family, there was a constant issue with keeping people employed. In less than a year my store went through almost 15 employees! The company has a great recognition program and so many sales challenges that it keeps the team members motivated to sell as well as keep a competitive vibe. Because O'Reilly is dedicated to the professional it gave the team members a chance to meet people outside of the store and build a relationship with them as well as gain knowledge about car parts and what to look for or the opposite. It really was an awesome place to work!"
good,"would sell parts to customers and inform them if they needed information "
good,stocking replenishments and batches in a timely manner in different locations.  making sure the right part numbers are in the right locations.  order selecting which is picking customer orders and sending out the right parts to the right orders
good,A Typical day of work consisted of checking in freight and stocking the shelves. followed by price changes and planograms.
good,"Everything was amazing at first, I learned a lot is a short amount of time. They eventually had me working at 3 locations to help out, and sent me down to San Juan. The DM threatened me"
good,"The company as whole isnt a bad company to work for! There is room for growth, but experiences will always will vary to each location and position."
good,"I worked on the lines receiving totes, stacking them in there assigned pallets, when full i would wrap them up and set them up for loading. i also helped with the loading. I've unloaded and loaded trucks, i was certified at the company for the forklifts and pallet jacks. I've used them all. i learned to be fast paced and work with precision and be a team player. Management was ok, very bossy but the supervisors helped a lot. i enjoyed working with my co-workers they where very interesting and easy to get a long with.The hardest part of the job was at the end of the day they would send a tone of totes down the line and we would have to consolidate them and stack them where they go at a very fast pace. i enjoyed my job especially working with others."
good,"Workplace was usually hectic, the store was too short-staffed, but it was also very informative for me, it taught me how to handle customers in an efficient manner while multi-tasking."
good,"Good place to work, knowledge of cars is necessary. co-workers were great, got along with every single one. hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers."
good,"Great place to work because O'reilly Auto Patrs focuses on satisfying the customer. The company likes to promote within in turn, as a team member advancement is possible. also, everyone is encouraged to work as a team."
good,Working with company is good downfall is lack of hours given. No benefit given. Company does offer 401k. Management understand work along with your personal life. Vacation is offer.
good,"They primarily are a retail chain, and my thoughts are that they wish to remain so. Wholesale seemed to be a secondary function."
good,"As a GM more paperwork than you can imagine,work one saturday in between,good benefits,they take you on trips every year,DM are young and dont know what they are doing the change people around all the time and stores fall at their peak,they prefer you to have a deposit at 2 pm every day and paperwork in order that to make 135,thousand dollars a month overall Advance auto Parts is Better."
good,"Good Production and awesome leadership would recommend to anyone trying to get a start in the industrial field. Good, fast paced and good learning curve."
good,They are very professional and like to make sure their customers leave with more than what the customer came in with. whether if its the customer get there problem fixed on their car or being quoted prices for a part they make sure everyone is happy. Also they give you pretty good 401 K benefits and stock purchases. it's a fun place to work.
good,"Checked all load-related documentation to ensure that it is complete and accurate, Drove to stores on designated routes and made deliveries nightly with pallet jack"
good,"I come into work counting the safe (to make sure it is correct) check in stock, fill store with stock that either comes in on the delivery truck or from the over stock. I learn about working on cars. I am part of the management. The hardest part of the job is lifting cases of anti-freeze. I love the customers."
good,The job was amazing if it would just pay better I would have never left.  The job is full of opportunity to expand your knowledge of automobiles and their workings.
good,O'Rielly auto parts has been a great job with good benefits and decent pay. They've done right by me and I work with a great group of people daily!!
good,Oreilly was a good place to work and management was great. Pay on the other hand could've been better. But I learned alot about auto parts.
good,Pay is good benefits are OK coworker's are friendly and helpful.the work is easy long hours but it pays off. You come in get your head set and start  pulling parts all day for 8 hours have a 30 min. Lunch that fly's by and bk to pulling very consistent work and boring at times but overall great place to work.
good,This was a fun place to work. The people all around were great. They worked with me on my schedule to make sure my home life duties werenot affected.
good,My co-workers for the most part were wonderful and I loved my job just didnt pay enough.
good,"The automotive parts business can be tough, especially for the un-trained, I came to the company with many years of automotive repair"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with people
good,"My duties at O’Reilly as a sales representative/ cashier consisted of looking up parts for customers vehicles, helping them find what they needed in the store, learned how to look up parts on the computer and in the catalog books. I learned about the parts on vehicles and was able to help customers find what they needed in the store and by me ordering the product."
good,"Although not the most difficult job, my knowledge was routinely challenged with the goal of solving customers' automotive needs.  I learned a lot about vehicles I had never come into contact with, as well as being able to apply previous knowledge to new situations.  When customers were not in the store, I could stay busy by taking initiative to handle shipping and receiving, stock and inventory and maintenance of the store.  The hardest part of this job was the customer interaction, as their knowledge of their problem might not always be accurate enough for myself of other staff to help solve, which would sometimes not result in a successful trip to our business.  On the other hand, the most enjoyable aspect of this job was aiding a customer in the diagnosis and repair of their vehicle and have them leave happy and satisfied."
good,"0900 work call. Make commercial sales and commercial deliveries. Head up front and assist the front counter when needed. Help all customers troubleshoot and find the right parts and the right tools/equipment that suit their jobs or needs. Co-workers were great we had a chance to cut up and get to know one another, but when it was time to fill the store, fix the store or any other task then we were all business. There were know hard parts of the job truly. The most enjoyable part was the friendships I acquired and that have continued years later."
good,"Being a ""Zoner"" was cool. I love helping customers get the right car parts for their projects."
good,At O'reillys I enjoyed interacting with the customers. This job helped me to further my work experience and the co-workers there were pleasant to work with.
good,"Being an autoparts specialist with O'Reilly's means you have to live up to certain standards.  It should be noted that the expectations come from two angles: customers and corporate.  Customers want you to be an expert on all vehicle troubles, and corporate wants you to be an upselling salesman who can meet a quota both in volume and combo deal sales.  If you can handle these things, you're a natural fit.  Pay is not very good and part-time positions are the norm until you eventually get into a full-time spot when one opens (usually an assistant manager role), but there is a lot of room to move around in the company.  After 6 months and good performance indicators, you are eligible to apply for internal positions.  If you have other skills, such as accounting or computer tech aptitudes, there are positions in corporate that might suit you.  But you must prove yourself on the ground floor!  If you can't jump through the hoops of making your sales and learning the company culture, you're not going to be able to advance."
good,A decent place to work the salary is behind what Colorado living conditions are.  Good training and the culture is good.  This is a place you won't be mad to go to everyday
good,"ok job pay not so good expect to work alot and not sit all day, expect to clean and stock and do may things for little pay, and hear angry people all day"
good,"Busy almost everyday"
good,"Great managment"
good,This job is what you make of it. Make friends and try to keep each other smiling. It helps the time go by
good,Good job but ready to try something new. I currently handle all aspects of running a business day in and day out. I like having control over everything but the long hours are sometimes not worth it.
good,Flexible schedule but it is retail so sometimes the hours are not so great. Easy going management and great coworkers.
good,"Phone Help Support"
good,"A typical day of work consists of helping customers make educated guesses on what is the best way to fix their car.  I supervise our team members with store resets and new planograms as well as taking care of the daily paperwork.  The best part of my job is everyday is different, there is always something new to get done or a new customer to gain."
good,I worked there moving out of my moms house and I was there 2years. the pay was good and the hours were there if you wanted them. I lost this job b/c after I got insurance I went and got two teeth pulled. I came with the doctor/dentist note and the human resource lady at the time said that that wasn't enough proof to keep my job
good,Great place to work if you can find a manager to work for that takes you seriously.
good,"this place is really fun to work for , the pay is great ,,but commision, is decent, benefits are great as well, they are so so on working with your schudule, but still is a very good job.. just wish they were more family friendly, when it comes to holidays"
good,I started working here as a parts specialist looking up parts helping people. As I grew the job moved with me I got to deliver parts and become a retail service specialist counting out drawers and the safe dealing with our commercial customers. Then I became an assistant manager where I had to handle disgruntled people and paper work along with the rest of the stuff.
good,"One of the managers that I had was great to work for. The other was a self-proclaimed rule-bender. I had a hard time with the rule-bending, because I started there under another management style that was more focused on doing things the right way."
good,"Work place is enjoyable and easy to fit into, however, the pay and benefits are behind the national averages for similar job titles and responsibilities."
good,"answering customer calls and running the register, and helping customers find what they need. i have learned how to approach customers in a friendly manner. and suggesting certain products that best fit our customers needs. learned how to quickly help customers with everything they need and getting them the right parts. good management, always took care of employees and customer needs. coworkers were friendly and knew their stuff. very knowledgeable staff with diagnosing problems. hardest part of the job was maybe some of the customers didn't always know what they actually needed by leading us to think it was a certain problem with their vehicle when it was a different problem. the most enjoyable part of the job was quick and easy diagnosis of vehicles and a fast turn around with getting their cars back on the road."
good,"Name brand parts at affordable prices. Ability to turn brake rotors and drums for the mechanic doing a complete brake job. "
good,Typical retail environment with the added bonus of the training to further expand your knowledge. I learned a lot from the co-workers and the customers that came in regularly. Management at the time was sketchy and unfair but I've been told that it has been corrected since then. Hardest part was odd requests from various customers but in the end became part of the learning experience. The best part though was the co-workers always got along with each other and assisted when needed.
good,Typical day at work would be 90% Customer service.
good,"I was originally hired to be a driver, and early on, I was trained in various areas, inclu ding cashier, shipping and receiving, stocking, inventory, and merchandising. My days were never typical, they were always an adventure, because I never knew what I was going to be doing. My co workers were awesome, management was so, so. There were never any difficult parts of my job. It was only difficult to listen to my former supervisor talk to customers. My most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and with the account holders."
good,take in truck manage the store did returns . drove the truck to deliver parts i liked to do that
good,O'Reilly auto parts is a great place to work. Answering
good,Inventory
good,I owe a lot of credit to my years with O'Reilly in the choices I made after leaving there. It was the most secured job I ever worked at. After leaving some seventeen years later I was offered a job with a competitor as a consultant which made me a good living. The only regret I have was leaving. I would have been with them 28 years. I still kick around going back to work for them. The hardest part of the job was the time I was away from my young family to make a struggling store successful in 4 years.
good,Managed and maintained commercial department to reach #1 in sales in the district and the top 5% of sales in the state each month. Directed deliveries to obtain an efficient work load daily as well as arrange and make the weekly schedules for the drivers and dispatcher. Communicated with customers daily/ weekly during sales calls to request their current needs. Held bi-weekly meetings with Commercial dept. discussing our strengths and weaknesses.
good,O’Rileys is overall a great place to work with nice employees providing an energetic environment! There’s lots to learn there’s opportunities for everyone if you apply yourself!
good,I loved this company. Was able to gear my inventory to my market. Get next day delivery on most items 5 days a week. Easy history search. Easy part look up. Very capable system
good,Arrive at work and wait on customers.  Most customers need parts for their vehicles but some people need help finding out what is wrong before they get the part.  I would do testing on the vehicle to determine if we could solve the problem.  Management was very supportive in all areas of the job.  The hardest part of the job was satisfying some of the customers when you could not help them.  The people that I worked with were friendly and helpful.
good,"I really think the company is a very good company to work for. Flexible hours, good management. The job is pretty cool. I have been doing this for a long time, and i want a new challenge."
good,It was a very good place to work at. I enjoyed my stayed for awhile. Working with people and helping customers from time to time was really good at most
good,"Management at store 2302 is really good and flexible, allowing me to work and go to school at the same time.  Management is not too strict, allowing us to have breathing room and work out problems on our own, but not too lenient to let the store go down under.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who believe we are mechanics.  The most enjoyable part is selling the job completely to the customer so that they do not have to come back the same day."
good,"Good company with decent benefits, discounts of automotive parts make it worthwhile working there. Coworkers make it fun and stressful at times, but still worth it. Wish they payed more though."
good,O’Reilly auto parts has a great working environment that keeps not only workers but as well as our customers safe and happy. We treat them like family and make sure we helped them with as much as possible
good,"Tilda, the manager was super nice and supportive. As a student she was flexible with my hours. The only problems is the lack of traffic in the store. A lot of working is completing exercises on the computer. Though it's educational it's not fulfilling."
good,Some of the best co-workers I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Both management staff as well as hourly employees were eager to assist and teach when it was necessary. Friendly work environment.
good,I loved my job at oriellys. I met a lot of great people at my job. I enjoyed the people I worked with and enjoyed working with car parts. I liked working with money.
good,"fun place to work, very easy job. Would absolutely recommend this job to anyone thinking of applying. Just be ready to learn where every part is in the inventory as that is the hardest part."
good,"Fast Paced environment with fun work activities. Great culture.    "
good,Good job ....positive experience ...wish I would have never left..... excellent benifits....good opportunity for advancements....low starting pay but with knowledge comes advancements in pay
good,Good place to work. Gotta put in a lot of time though. The company does take care of their people in the long run. The upper management are some of the most down to earth people around
good,"This has been a great company to work for. If you have the drive to advance in the company and show your worth, you will be able to make it as far as you want to."
good,I should’ve stayed. I miss my old job there. The manager would often give rewards to anyone who met a goal that was set. Often time the manager would supply lunch for everyone if they had been working hard the whole week. Great benefits and paid time off. Diplomatic when approaching a situation or disagreement
good,Good company to work for. If you put in the effort you will be rewarded with advancement opportunity. PTO and stock benefits for full time team members.
good,Parts sales was challenging due to need for accuracy.  Related sales was motivating.  Parts delivery was very important to this company and is a big part of overall sales.
good,It's a great place to work. Hours are great. If you have a family emergency they will work with you as best they can. After a couple of weeks of working there they will find a schedule that best fits them and you.
good,"If you are a male employee with automotive related knowledge, you'll do fine with this company. This is an industry that is still primarily dominated by men."
good,It is a great company to work for. Their culture values are some the best in the industry. Lots of room for advancement to higher positions. Lots of good people that work there and have very loyal customers
good,Day to day can have stress but company cares about its employees and the entire management team care about employees future success. Focuses on TEAM efforts and working together.
good,This is a relaxed and friendly work environment. Customer service skills are a plus with this company. Also being a little knowledgeableabout auto parts or cars would really help in the long run.
good,As a TSM I mainly work alone. I am required to call upon 10 to 20 accounts. I have learned to value my customers and understand their needs. I have learned to build a relationship with my customers and balance out the company and customer needs.
good,I liked working for oreilly's all the gripes i have are minimal except the pay. They just are not willing to pay for knowledgeable staff. They are more then happy to hire a person who has no clue about anything automotive for 8$ vs a knowledgeable person asking 12$ an hour.
good,"This job is fine for people or young adults that are going to school. The man problem at the store that I worked at was the Commercial accounts salesman. If you sold anything to a commercial account he would refund it and low the price down and resale it, so his numbers can look good."
good,This job is a great place to start if you are trying to get into the automotive industry. You will most likely learn something new everyday and understand how something works more and more once you start seeing the part over and over again.
good,Hardest thing is no communication between management and employees. Good money and benefits! Some jobs you have to stay until job is complete so no set time to get off work.
good,I was let go because of my record. I really liked the work there. Every body i worked with there or the customers that came in were so nice. I would like to go back
good,management had its issues but overall was a good place to work. they had computer training to improve their employees knowledge of the business. selling bonus.
good,"Because it was a new brand store, it really started very slowly.  Little by little more new customer started coming.  I was supposed to be only the parts delivery driver for the store; taking parts to the different clients.  However; during the first days, the business was very slow.  It helped me to learn how to work in the store, learning more where the parts were located and learning how to be a a good customer helper."
good,"Simple job. easy to learn, quick to understand. Acceptable benefits and enjoyable cooperative staff. Room for advancement and raises. Guaranteed forty hours."
good,Great opp for advancement if you want it. benefits could be better but def better than other auto parts stores. Depending on the store you land in the management is pretty good.
good,Working at Oreilly's has been great for me. I do wish the pay was higher to help with the cost of living around this area. After 6 months theres options for you to move within the company to help expand your knowledge.
good,Relaxed atmosphere. Always something to do. Customer service is a must! Expanded knowledge of automotive parts and mechanical design. Upper management approval.
good,"I still work at O'Reilly's, and my time there has been a mixed bag but a largely positive one. I went into the job knowing next to nothing about cars and was frankly nervous I would fall behind and let everyone down. Thankfully, the training regiment for new employees has plenty of different ways to learn, I found that simply asking my coworkers questions helped me to do my best, while also making friends of them at the same time. Those friends you make will stick by you if the company or a customer ever tries to get the better of you. Management takes the opinions of the workers seriously and often is behind the counter working alongside us which I found to be great. The most difficult part of the job in my opinion at least, would have to be dealing with customers, because O'Reilly's is an auto parts store you'll mostly be dealing with mechanics or DIY kinds of people, they're not all bad, but some make it a point to prove how much smarter they are than you in the field. If you enjoy cars and making friends, however, this is the job for you."
good,"It was a fine place to work as long as you understood what it was. It's nothing fancy, it's just like any other warehouse job. As long as you are there to just do you job to the best of your ability, get paid, and go home it's fine for what it is."
good,"A typical day can vary on weather, some days required more hands on, and creativity. You will learn alot about vehicles, and different challenges/problems to solve for customers. All the employees are absolutely amazing, and unique. I love working with people hands on, and building relationships with retail customers. I loved helping people solve interesting questions that really tested your ability to solve things."
good,"Worked 8-5 with 1hour lunch period. The job is very fast paced at times, slow at other times. Put up new stock during periods of slack time. Full timers have holiday pay, part-timers do not."
good,"Been working for the company for a few years I've seen a lot of people come and go, they arent too picky about who they hire, and employees arent really encouraged to keep busy. We seem to hire a lot of auto zones throw aways"
good,"Being that I work on my car quite often working here makes a lot of it quite a bit easier on the wallet, you meet a lot of unique people in the automotive workplace, usually a pretty relaxed place to work."
good,Easy job & quick way to make money. It's something I definitely enjoyed doing & would do it again if the opportunity came about. You become real close with your coworkers too.
good,I liked working with other employees and the customers that came in. I liked being able to help others when they can not find the parts. I liked the fact they called me when not there and I could tell them where the part was without being there
good,"When I started the position at O'Reilly as a Parts Specialist, I had absolutely no experience, but I was great with people."
good,Just like any job there are ups and downs. Most stores have decent people working there. They have really good products. there is a loaner tool program that is very useful.
good,"Company is great to work for and promote within, pay could be better. Managers get usually work mostly a day shift and are the man cog in driving sales."
good,The company was great. There was great support and room to advance your career. Overall would recommend and a great place to work I enjoyed my time there very much
good,You have to hire right  because the wrong people could hurt the business but they are a good company to work for and with good working skills and determination you can move up.
good,O'reilly's is the best job I've ever thrown away over personal issues at home.  I've regretted doing so since.  A very solid company with concrete training courses on automotive parts and maintenance.  They have an excellent culture mentality towards business and their rapid growth proves that
good,the under acheivers will drag down ur timer and ull get fired not them. cause ur expected to be the better person and help others....if ur boss likes you ur doomed here!
good,"I love being able to interact with my customers & helping them with their needs. A typical day consist of checking in freight, stocking, processing returns, & updating inventory. I enjoy most of all the inventory, making sure we have accuracy of all the products necessary to assist our customers."
good,The manager you had to work under would determine the energy of the store. when your manager was fair and hard working then business would run alot more smoothly
good,"Great place to get some customer service experience, I gave this place 6 years of my life and don't regret it. I learned a lot from Manager employee training to computer training tutorials. One of the company's Vice presidents started out as a delivery driver so they like to hire from within. The pay cannot support someone living on their own and to climb the ranks requires more than just base knowledge they rely on the judgements of high sales earning representitives and store managers to decide if you're the right fit to move up in the company rather than those who worked closely with you in the past to speak on your behalf."
good,Loved the people I worked with. Loved the customers I felt with on a daily basis. It was close to home which was nice if I had to have time off for My children it was worked out
good,"great management, it was a good job to start off a good career, time to move onto bigger and better life experiences, the job was easy and you was able to deal with a lot of customers"
good,"I loved this job as parts delivery, and the management was great. It requires attention to detail for long part numbers that are slightly different, finding a part quickly in an inventory of over 100,000, and problem-solving skills for when things don't go as expected and you have no way of contacting your boss (cell phones aren't allowed). The only reason I left is that my personal life took a turn for the worse, and I had to choose between the two jobs that I had and this one didn't pay very well, or offer full time hours."
good,"I absolutely loved this job! I loved constantly being surrounded by cars and working with people who share my passion for cars. I learned a lot about parts and fixing vehicles along with getting to work with some fantastic customers on their cars. I would still be working there today if it weren't for the change in management. I loved my prior manager but he left and they put in another who is absolutely horrid. Higher management also won't take your side, even if your opinion is shared by most of the store. Again, if it weren't for management, I would still be there."
good,Good company but not much room after your reach store manager and the pay is not the greatest. For the hours you put in you should be getting paid twice what you do get paid.
good,I looked up Auto Parts for people on a computer and sold them to them.  I was on the Night Crew that had to close down the store each night.  I had to ensure all cash drawers were correct and weren't missing money.  We had to ensure the store stayed presentable at all times.
good,We were extremely busy but they let the 2 best managers and parts manager slip through their fingers bc of corporate policies nd it went to zero. Business went down so bad when they left I was confused but shortly after I had toleave and relocate anyway but probably would have searched for something else bc I felt no purpose there without the 2 smartest mechanics and great guys you’d ever know. It was sad that oreilly Corp. didn’t realize what they had. They both went NAPA. Shaking my head.
good,loved working here met my husband here most of my current friends was an easy job but the safety was never taken care of i blew out my knee and sprain my back due to safety issues not being resolved
good,Strong company with many opportunities to grow internally  Fast past store operations and company team building events to support the new store growth.  .
good,"I worked full time and part time at o-rielly. It is a fun working environment. Most of the time, my co-workers and myself made our shifts enjoyable. Most of the time the customers were pleasant. This kind of place has regulars so you get to know them. The system used to look up parts is easy to learn and navigate. Pay is fair considering it requires no education or experience. Plus, you get commission."
good,"A typical day of work can be anywhere between rapidly busy to slow, it is based on the season. i have learned much about business and retail. while others do learn more about car parts as they should. Management is not my upmost favorable part but it all works and i as a role in management will and continue to try to make the job enjoyable and smooth for the rest of the team. the workplace culture is the upmost basis and satisfying the customer. the hardest part of the job as it is retail is tending to all customers as it can get busy and there are boundaries that will come up. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with alike coworkers and seeing customers satisfied and ready to come back any time."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Great management at my store loved the team i worked with but it was stressful from time to time. Wonderful connections with the professional customers and have kept in contact with many of those people afterwards.
good,"O'reilly is always busy, especially the store I work for because we are a HUB. Time goes by pretty quickly when working here because of the people I am surrounded by."
good,It is a great place to work just bad management. The manager at the time was under to much pressure between work and health issues. Not the greatest place to get trained.
good,Enjoyed working here with the intention of learning more about vehicles and providing an excellent insight of top customer service positions. Had a very leisurely and relaxed atmosphere.
good,"O'Reilly offers a good working environment with many options to advance within the company, as well as a great culture.  There is always plenty to do on a day to day basis, and the nature of the work never becomes dull.  It is also a good company to grow your professional skillset in, as there are many learning opportunities, and the culture is such that learning is highly encouraged."
good,Wirking here has taught me about social skills with helping customers and with working with other people as a team. It can be fun to work here but a little stressful due to responsibilities.
good,It was a great time and good management that treats you like family. However the payment starting out is minimum and even after working there a year I wasn’t getting paid much more than minimum.
good,"working conditions were great, corporate rules were unfair and unjust. employees aren't given the respect of accusation without recourse.blah blah blah blah blah blah"
good,This company is a great company to work for. They truly care about who you are as a person and allow you to have a life outside of work. Each person wants you to succeed.
good,Oreilly is like the chik fil a of auto parts. You are the cream of the crop when it comes to customer service and getting people what they need and want.You meet new people and some people become depended on you. Oreilly is a great place to service your community.
good,Work was always a good time because you would be working with a bunch of other guys who all have the same interests as you. We would be driven to get work done and have time to relax and hang out too.
good,"Loved to work with customers and their cars. Good pay once you start to move up. Could get fast paced and stressful at times, little contact with the higher management."
good,The management team here is willing to work with employees training that training assessments motivation was highly expected great company before benefits has a busy schedule easy to get along with great customer service great advancements for management
good,I am store manger and work 50+ hours per week. The ability to hire in Giddings is almost non existent. We cannot find anyone to work or come to work daily. I am working so many hours with no help from upper management.
good,"In my experience, O'Reilly Auto Parts is a great place to work but in the time that I have spent with the company, there have been a lot of personnel changes."
good,I had the best job experiences here. It is an at home type of job that makes you feel comfortable and appreciated. But some employees look at you like you are dirt that you walk on.
good,Good place to work if you get good management and good employees. Environment was so/so. Pay is alright. You learn pretty fast. Customers can be a pain and sometimes hot headed.
good,The company is great.  The culture really makes management appreciate team members.  The company has some great leaders.  Can get hectic at the distribution center during the summer months.
good,"The company would be great to continue a career in but the way the pay their employess and how they treat them so disposable is the worst, each team member is trying to live and enjoy their timbe, but with the way this company pays their employess it's almost impossible."
good,Working in retail is stressful no other job is less stressful than the other. You walk in with stress and leave with stress that is how retail works. The culture anywhere you go you can feel it.
good,Great people to work for. Cares for their people. Really believes in family values. Earned my trust early on. Didn't think I'd ever leave. Pay was nice also.
good,"Plenty of things to learn and the discount is great! However, the customers can get pretty rude( I mean they are experiencing car troubles), it's either dead or everyone shows up at once, management seemed to always be gone, many communication issues between management and staff, and improper training."
good,"Job is challenging but will advance your knowledge. Will be tested by customers who aren't as knowledgeable as they seem, but will learn the correct way to handle customers. Pay is low."
good,"Working for this company is great. It has its ups and downs, but overall it was great. Working there taught me to be patient but it was very stressful and it took a lot of time from my family because I had to give so much."
good,"I am a store manager, i long hours, i do paper work, set sales goals and make sure my team members meet them, i.also do bank deposits and accounting proceeders"
good,I have enjoyed the time I have spent working with O’reilly auto parts. I have moved up from a regular part time parts specialist to a full time assistant manager in that time. My previous manager was an amazing teacher and gave me many life lessons and good work morals
good,"A line at the door waiting,I print a OFM which is over an under stock, stock what was sold until a delivery has to go out i love a satisfied customer."
good,"Good Company, ethics and Company Culture are strongly emphasized. Corporate mandates stress minimum crew for any day, often employee ratio would be 6-7 to 1."
good,a great place to work. paid decent but found a better job. would love to work there again. learnt alot about the parts side of the automotive industry.
good,Wasn't able to advance in my desired career path and didn't make enough money to do it. Learned how to work registers and be a better sales person. Didn't know a lot about car parts going in and that was definitely a problem. Managers were pretty patient about teaching me what I needed to know and didn't rush me. Coworkers were alright. A few that I really liked and a few that I didn't. It was easy to get overwhelmed when it got really busy but just have to keep a level head. But a lot of down time and having to find something to do is common. And you're on your feet literally the entire time you're working. Don't remember what benefits we received other than discounts.
good,Good company to work for. Good PAY. Promotions take time. Good quality auto parts with over all lifetime warranties. Good benefits. Flexible scheduling
good,Oreilly Auto Parts is a place you can create great friendships and work hard at the same time. People in the company are amazing and are willing to help you in every way. Especially District 236 which was my first district with DM Maurino Who is one amazing manager.
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job is helping customers get the right part the first time . helping customers install new accessories, batteries , and blades"
good,"Good people, steady pace could be busy at times. Relaxed atmosphere. Received a good parts discount meet some good people through the work place. When needed training was available."
good,"oreilly auto parts was a great place to work at considering work life balance and good manangement, their was no room for advancement. I was only part time so the hours given to me on a weekly basis were insuficcient to keep me afloat."
good,"I really enjoyed this job, but after I had a baby I couldn't work as many hours as they needed me too. It is a high stress industry but the benefits are very worth it."
good,"All the employees are very cooperative. They have great teams and they even do team building exercises. I highly recommend working there. Its a very relaxed, friendly, working environment."
good,Great diverse place to work.  Always learning with computer seminars.  Responsible for inventory and stock check in and cash handling.  O'Reilly Auto Parts has a great culture to follow. You are busy from the moment you arrive till you leave for the day.  Enjoyed the customers.
good,That was one oft the most exciting jobs that I ever had.  Just being able to help people when it was needed.  The only problem I had was the pay and time off.
good,O'Reilly is a competitive place to work. Like most companies has some down fall. The people are great to work with. Came from a small family company. Culture is lived by all.
good,"Decent Mon-Fri job for $9/Hour. Manager was very competent and all employees were hard working, but able to enjoy their work. Everyone got along 90% of the time, and any issues that came up were discussed and resolved. Only drawback is their very strict driving qualifications. Any at-fault accidents almost completely disqualify you, so make sure to maintain a good driving record."
good,"A typical day at Orielly's was opening the store and waiting on my customers. I learned that people can be very picky on the company who makes there car parts.Management was awesome, Paperwork was not the hardest part of the job but most time consuming, The most enjoyable time here was the customers being able to experience the different cultured people."
good,"Good Job! unfortunately i could speed and make the exact time for return after the last run was made, due to the weather inconvenience or the traffic on highways and rural roads, Love it and feel said for the poor communication between management and employee. Due to third party venous. My experience by my self was of knowledge and discover different characters of personalities. learn different people different characters and use people skills to all."
good,Everything was smooth there. Understanding stood out the most among all the associates. Everyone seem slow to anger. They had great knowledge of the store and its establishment.
good,"Management varies greatly from different locations. You can advance within the company with enough effort, and the higher up you get the better the pay. Hourly workers should be paid better and all around need to be treated better."
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is not a bad company to work for, depending upon the area you work in. They are willing to train you even if you have no auto parts knowledge. The pay isn't great starting out, but every area is different on how much they start you at. Part time you don't really get any benefits except your employee discount on things in the store and once you have been there for a year, you get automatically enrolled into the 401k program. You don't get any other benefits until you get full time. Then you will get the health insurance and paid time off and stuff. Overall a good company though. I have learned a lot with my time with the company."
good,"typical day was doing morning paperwork,bank deposit getting the store ready for the day. "
good,"created good customer relations, pay was not fair but manageable. management in certain areas was great and higher in someplaces only cared what benefited themselves."
good,"Demonstrated my ability to think out side the box, manage change and resolve ambiguous situations. Also demonstrate ability to prioritize and manage multiple projects simultaneously. Have to be a really quick and focused because of the quick paste."
good,Overall it was a great company for me a gave me management skills It gave me more communication skills a gave me management skills My management me at the time was great at my 1st 3 stores then my My manager went to another company and that's when a got real real bad we got this guy he was OK And I made a mistake in left a safe open in he called corporate and corporate Fired me for leaving the safe open It was a mistake cause I was Rushing to go to my other job because my pay what and that good But overall it was a good company
good,"this company was fast paced and work till the job was done."
good,"I love my job, but as I have jobs I do on weekends, I was hired Monday through Friday, management does not make sure we are properly staffed, therefore I am working allot of Sundays on no sleep, in 14 months I have worked my hired on hours 5 weeks."
good,"Oreilly's was a temporary part time employment opportunity for me. The Management staff changed a little too much for my taste but sometimes that is to be expected with a growing company. The hardest part of the job for me was learning the countless automotive parts they offered. The customers were very helpful as long as i was straight up with them in my knowledge of automotive parts. A typical day consists of running a register, locating parts, ordering parts, straightening and stocking the store and doing your best to help less than knowledgeable customers with their concerns. All in all Oreilly's is a decent place to work."
good,"The company is GREAT, the promote from within is even better!!! They just need to learn how to fairly compensate the TEAM and they will be untouchable. Let operations run the company and keep HR out of the operations and you will retain solid talent and stay out of the court room."
good,"A typical day starts at 730am. There are 3 pallet's sitting in the stock room that I'm responsible for opening and taking inventory. This takes about 2 hours. Once that's done, I go to the front register and start helping customers as a cashier. I had a good rapport with my customers."
good,Moved up the corp ladder just to come back down off the horse. Large company able to relocate if positions are available where you are moving Very stable.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a great company to work with they offer multiple benefits stock plans insurance plans 401k team member discounts very fast pace very customer service oriented sales driven and competitive
good,"Usually there is slow mornings, but picks up when the mechanic shops open. Things pick up quickly and there are some days that you'll be delivering part after part to mechanic after mechanic. Its a little difficult memorizing the shops you deliver to but quick to pick up. While there are no deliveries, you will usually re-stock or help  with sales. Must be friendly with customers and know which products work best for vehicles."
good,"Delivery driver is great job most of the time. You do learn alot about parts etc... My co workers I liked. Felt some were somewhat lazy and didn't do their job as best they could. Maybe because they are young. I don't know, but I felt like a father there."
good,"Able to help customers and improve customers lives "
good,If you are interested in sales and knowledgeable about cars then you would enjoy this job. The hours are decent. The pay could be better but opportunity to advance within the company makes up for the entry level pay scales.
good,"Helping customers get the parts they need, getting to meet new people everyday, I have learned that patience is key when working with people in the auto parts world"
good,"We were able  to improve employees working conditions and provided equal rights in education, housing, public accommodation. I also get to travel all over my state and others states fighting for civil rights."

good,The pay not the greatest but it pays bills not a bad place to work people are usually good to get along with the pay is the only thing that is the con to O'Reilly's  but other than that not bad
good,"O'Reilly is a great company to work for. I sincerely enjoy working with my team day in and day out. The company culture is great and management knows how to cater to both team members and customers alike. "
good,"management was great, flexible scheduling was available, pay was low but that was expected as it is an entry level position. work was easy and rewarding."
good,"While spending my time there, there were ups and downs, but of the most part it wasn't a bad place of work... it just wasn't my style of place. I personally am not a car guy at heart like most of them are."
good,Auto sales here was quite good. Friendly workers and pretty good customers majority of the time. Went from not knowing much about cars to knowing the basics on fixing them.
good,"5-6 working days"
good,I enjoyed working at O'reilly's.  It was low stress and quite interesting. I left because I needed a higher paying job. It makes for a great part time job if you're a student! They are very flexible!
good,I enjoy working for this company. They had great benefits and I enjoyed working with other people and meeting new people and customers. They have great variety of products and services to help out the customers.
good,"A  typical day at work consists of applying mechanical knowledge to identify correct auto parts, filling out paperwork for core/warranty information, serving the customer and providing the best service I can for them. I learned that patience comes synonymous with success. Also, I learned that professionalism is key to great customer service. My management at this job is strict and also   policy driven. The workplace culture is great, as we have commission programs, discounted prices on items, and meetings once a month as a team. The hardest part of my job is is dealing with angry customers, but I tend to resolve most problems that I have with them. The most enjoyable part of my job is finding the correct parts the first time. This is a brief overview of my job."
good,Un poco mas de comunicacion y trabajo en equipo adquiere ma ezperienza y conicimieentos de productos para vehiculos
good,Make sure work area is always cleaned and inventory is always up to date. Work uniform at all times. Welcome all customers and be friendly and helpful.  I learned how to be patient. Every customer is there for a different reason. I learned how ro multitask and how do my research on finding parts we didnt have in our store
good,"The distribution center had a suggestion box that our DC boss actually read, and put the things that were in his control into play. Over all the DC made production, even if we had to do a little over time."
good,"the work isn't bad, you get to talk to a lot of people and they start you off at little bit more then minimum wage. you learn about parts and you get to help people fix theirs."
good,This was a great job. The management was dependable and my coworkers were hard working. The cons were dealing with grumpy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining knowledge about the automotive and business worlds at the same time.
good,"Help customer seeking advise with car problems. Great customers and help them find solutions to their car problems. Great management team, helpful co-workers, great way to learn about cars and parts."
good,it was a great place to work but they needed some new managers like ones that didn't use there position as a threat all the time it honestly got to the point where I got tired of it so I honestly quit... Some of their manager repulsive.
good,"I love my job. I don't love how our compensation works or our pay. Certain areas make a lot an hour, others aren't so lucky because of location. Moving up is easy if you're willing to learn, listen, and do your job! It helps having an awesome manager and DM!"
good,"It was a great opportunity. I learned a lot from professionalism to character to actually enjoying work. The co workers were great, work enviorment was never overwhelming. I enjoyed my experience."
good,Every job has it's ups and downs but I genuinely enjoyed this location and learned a lot. One of my favorite work places. Good management. Good benefits
good,its a cool job to keep you afloat. people and co workers are great. there traing is always up to date and they are on top of all orders and other things.
good,"I went in not knowing anything about cars but as I worked, I picked up a couple of things. I now know about pets, fluids, anything having to do with cars."
good,"A typical day at my department is pretty easy going but very intense.What keep me going through the day is  that,I think im working out everytime i do my job. I always keep a positive thought in any work i do to keep my work proficient."
good,"I love working at O'Reilly. There's a good, team oriented atmosphere. There is a lot of public interaction, which might be off putting too some. It's a fairly good SECOND income, but I wouldn't depend fully on this job."
good,it is very easy work and good training it is easy to do very supportive team that will help you out when you need them it is very chill
good,Great place to work as long as your focused and dedicated. Need a lot of dedicated workers.  Come in giving it your best shot and have a willingness to learn and you cant go wrong.
good,Orielly auto parts is an ok place to work for if you know cars and had a Manger that wasn't worried about them self all the time. They only thing I liked about that place was the discounts for parts you got.
good,Daily customer interactions test your social skills. Learning and familiarizing yourself with each similar but different products was the hard learning part. Super nice co-workers always willing to help out when stuck with questions or in doubt.
good,Working at O'Reillys I learned a lot more than I did know about vehicle and motors and the sudden rushes of busyness was exciting an I like working on cars and helping others fix their vehicle's.
good,"During a typical day, we take parts request from walk-in customers, fulfill orders both over the phone and in person. Customer service is key, and I've learned a lot of valuable communication skills as well as a lot of information on parts ID. O'Reilly Auto Parts is an excellent employer. Management is more than accommodating to all employees. Everyone is treated fairly and justly. The hardest part of the job is sometimes filling someone else's shoes when a team member is out sick or has a personal issue at home. Everyone's job is vital to making the store run like it should, so when someone calls in sick it can be challenging to do the job of multiple people. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer has had a hard time finding what they need, and you are the one challenged to get the correct part when they need it. Their appreciation is the most rewarding experience in this job."
good,"My manager was a great manager, a lot of people would enjoy him being your boss. However, they are not competitive in raises or anything like that. They pay minimum wage which is to be expected, however when they promote you to RSS they barely give you a dent in your raise and the work load is overwhelming. You get the store(s) key(s), which means they will make you close. When the manager is not there you are in charge of the store. Had they given me a raise from employee to RSS, I might have considered staying. The district manager is the worst to deal with, according to others (will not say the name). I personally have had no issues with him."
good,Loved working at oreillys have to say is one of the best jobs I ever worked at . Part time job is awesome . You meet a lot of new people . You get to learn a lot of new things about cars .
good,In working for this company I have learned a great deal about auto parts and wish to pursue further education and experience.
good,"O'reilly's auto was an overall decent job with respectable management and co-workers. This job required excellent people skills and would best suit someone who is bilingual. I worked at the cash register and my duties consisted of retrieving auto parts and checking customers out. It helped me greatly in the long run because it taught me people skills and how to communicate with customers who spoke broken english or no english at all. At the end of every work day, I was responsible for cleaning the entire store before close. it was a great experience."
good,A typical day is non stop moving around. I learned a lot more about car parts and how the parts work. The hardest part of the job is when you pick up the slack of others and don't get the credit for what you actualy do.
good,I had a great time working at O'Reillys. It was very apparent after going under new management that I wasn't taken very seriously because I'm a woman which was to be expected. And sometimes customers could be extremely mean. My coworkers were a lot of fun and great people. I left because management clearly didn't want to move me up positions like they said they would even though I had worked there for almost 2 years.
good,Good fun place to work fast paced environment. Great training available for those who want to further themselves. I have always been able to work well with all mangers and employees.
good,I loved my job and the only thing that I can really complain about would be part time hours. I worked with friendly customers in most cases and it was fun working with auto parts.
good,"I really enjoyed the management, tried hard to keep things fun while running smoothly, tried to keep people advancing. Not much in the way of benifites. Would assign a lot of training assignments hard to find time to do them..."
good,"This is a retail and customer service job to the fullest extent. Job duties would include checking in the truck, putting up freight, customer assistance, making deposits, and opening and closing of the store. Fast past workplace with great people to work with. The hardest part of the job trying to get everything done in your shift, and the most enjoyable helping a customer fix his/hers vehicle."
good,I love my job and the people I work with being able to help customers fix their problems or solve and issue is very rewarding it help to be confident and to show that in any job that you do not being afraid to ask another coworker for help or their opinion also a plus
good,when it comes to the seasons production slowed down a lot and people where transferred  to different departments where the work is different in many ways and you need certain experience to work in certains departments that they place you in
good,loved to work there but the pay wasnt inline with the competition. the store mgr was awesome as were most fellow employees
good,If you're single the O'reilly Store Manager position is perfect for you. Tough but achievable goals and expectation. If you like cars and helping people perfect job place
good,Everyday is different because you do not know who you will be delivering too. The hardest part was remembering all the parts numbers and where they are located in the store.
good,You arrive at work get briefed then get on system to pick customer orders and ship them. Very fast paced environment. Pay was good along with the work wasn't hard to catch on.
good,"It was a great experience to work at O'Reilly auto parts, because the colleagues and customers where great to work with. You may learn a lot from working with automotive parts and the benefits where great even if you were just a parts specialist. Great way to gain experience  in sales."
good,Fast Paced and great job! Constant learning experience. Easy to make a positive difference in customer's day. Co-workers helpful and fun to work with. Loved everything about the job except the low pay.
good,"You have lots of learning opportunities. "
good,Being able to Help them with their Problems and Keep them Happy. I get to involve Myself and Be able to see the Problem and Look for Solutions for the Customer.
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is getting off early, even though you start at 5am. and you have longer hours in the beginning of the week but shorter hours at the end of the week."
good,Good retail job with potential for advancement. Not the best pay and not very flexible with scheduling. A decent employer.
good,I enjoyed working at the DC. I was hard work but satisfying and I will continue to shop at O'Reilly's even though I now longer work for them.
good,Overall it was a good experience to work at Oreilly auto parts. I had no issues with the management nor my coworkers. It was easily the most enjoyable job I've held in the last 15 years
good,My day was was clocking at the time I was scheduled help walk in customers and quote prices over the phone and check stock to see how long it would take to get if it's not in stock. I would fill all the stock at the end of the night clean the store and count the drawer and have the manager put how much money I had to check shortages. Best part is helping customer that really need the part right away.
good,"good customer service, good team worker, I'm a person that can work with positive attitude on any management or hard situation"
good,"Sell parts to people and help trouble shoot mechanical problems, the staff is ok but everything is a little clustered and unorganized at times, most of my co-workers are ok but every place is going to have those few who aren't, best part about the job is having regular customers who only work with me."
good,Great company to work for. I would still be working there if they were able to accommodate my schedule. Other than that work was fun.
good,"A typical day includes getting a game plan together. Supervising employees. customer satisfaction. Cleaning, paperwork, deposits. That if I can lead thirty two people and about 900 inmates I can do anything. Helping people is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Spent a lot of time multitasking. Company is very healthy and growing rapidly. Most enjoyable is working with appreciative customers. Most difficult is not having enough payroll to retain good employees and having to do the work of two to three other people as the only salaried employee.
good,"I am a delivery specialist.  My typical day is driving around town delivering parts to local shops.  My manager is great.  I've never had a problem if I need to have time off. My co-workers are great too.  Very helpful!  The hardest part of the job is when they need help on the counter and I need to help customers with automotive parts.  I don't know anything about automotive so I struggle with this.  That being said, my manager and co-workers are understanding and know that I was hired to drive, not know automotive. I help out on the counter to cash people out who are waiting in line.  But sometimes I end up with customers who are looking for a particular part.  That's the hardest for me.  My most enjoyable part of the job is the actual driving to the shops.  I love to drive."
good,"O'Reilly's was a great learning experience for me because I had the opportunity to learn how to lead people of all different personality types. To be responsible for paperwork, payroll, inventory, hiring, scheduling, and customer service."
good,"awesome place, great people, nice benefit. fun work place with supportive management. you get time off when you need it"
good,out of all the places I have worked I can tell you the family feel there was great I liked getting up in the morning to go to work sometimes I would stay late to help out that's what a family does we work togather
good,Great team to work with had a lot of experience there on the counter and doing sales. would recommend to anyone with mechanical skills trying to get there foot in the door in parts world.
good,This work environment is not to bad you meet new people on a daily basis. The only problem is they expect you to basically bend over backwards to make customers happy even if you get harassed by them.
good,"We all work together as a group to complete task that are needed to be completed. Thought i am apart of management we are not better than anyone we all do the same amount of work. Being in management can be pretty difficult at times but with a very motivating staff, i always remain with a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to help the customer by providing them with parts and tools they need to complete the job fully and correctly."
good,over all a good growing company that has it sights set on an ever growing market stragity to be larger and more effective. they are very focused on the customer and making them happy
good,Days consisted of hard work in a team atmosphere. Consistent effort and willingness to achieve goals required on a daily basis.
good,"Over all a good company to work for, has good benitfits, over all good management personal. Good co-worker great people to work with, hardest part was the travel to and from work, most enjoyable part was helping the customer solve their autoamotive problems"
good,"I enjoyed my time with O'Reilly, but living in the Ozarks you can't necessarily expect them to pay the best. The people are great and the company is definitely going places, but don't expect pay over the national average. Or near it."
good,"O'reilly auto parts is a great company with a good culture. In 2013 the publicly partnered with VIP auto parts/tires/service. VIP has had a shady back history and less than perfect performance record. During the acquisition, the company had retained a significant portion of the ""bad"" VIP managers."
good,"Good place to work part time. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of opening the store or closing the store, making sure all paperwork was done for the day, all items were fronted on shelves, floors were cleaned and swept, all registers were closed down properly or opened before the store was opened, money from all drawers are opened and recounted other than what was assigned to drawers, made ready for deposit on Monday, all entrances where closed properly before leaving for the day."

good,"By saying stressful I'm talking about the co-workers. Don't get me wrong, working at O'reilly was one of the best jobs I had. Every single problem I had was with co-workers and not customers."
good,Overall a great place to work in the auto parts industry. Typical days are full of a variety of people and interactions. Management varies store to store but overall it s a company that understands that the retail employees are the front men and women of their business.
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading the stock truck that comes in and using it to restock the shelves. In addition, making deliveries as quick as possible to our partnering professional auto body shops. Each day is a learning experience on parts and new ways to be efficient at my job. The management and my co-workers are helpful in expanding my knowledge on car parts. They also are easy to get along with and make work fun. The hardest part about my job is not enough teamwork at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers."
good,"I have route with 11 stores and each store have orders from the day before. All my parts for my would come all together. My job was to scan all parts, then all stores together and wrap and load the route in my trailer."
good,My job was to update the store inventory and to help with customer service. I learned how to be a team player. The management there was the best that I have ever had the experience to work with. I would be happy to work with him again one day. My co-workers were great people. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers.

good,"The first thing when I arrive at work is clock in, help customers with there vehicle issues. Maybe install a battery or wiper blades. We receive a pallet of stock from our ware house, so i check it in. Each pallet we get, we need to scan every single wiper blade, light bulb, spark plug, lug nuts, etc, Then an hour before we close I do paper work making sure co-workers are doing there job correctly and then clean and close for the night. "
good,Management is fair. Enjoyed time with the company. The only thing with the position was the fast paced work environment and little lunch time.

After I'm finished in my area of responsibility I report to my supervisor before assisting in any area of the D.C that may need help. I've learned in my Six years (OCT 2013) how to operator several pieces of MHE including although not limited to dock stocker, motorized pallet jack, electric pallet jack etc. My immediate supervisor as well as her support team (stocking supervisors) are excellent leaders. I have no issues with them. The only issues I have are with upper management because a lot of their ideas seem reactive instead of proactive which causes mismanagement of time and money."
good,"it was a good job it closed down in the end,i would be helping marking out things and hanging the duct in place"
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is an enjoyable place to work.  My co-workers and I get to have fun, while doing what we like to do.  The managers at our store are really great to work for.

I head to work and begin my daily tasks of approving payroll, strategic scheduling to make sure I keep my production hours at goal and take a deep breath before beginning to assist customers. I have to use quick and critical thinking for problem solving as well as being able to stay on top of accounts to make sure all money balances out. I have a good team that works under me and they take just as much pride in their daily duties as I do. I have learned multiple ways of handling the unexpected things that may occur with being a store manager. I have to make quick scheduling changes when people call out of work, when a customer needs more personal care to solve a problem and being current on all audits with accuracy. Every day brings a new challenge but with that it also brings a new way of learning how to fix it. I enjoy the diversity and ever changing environment of being a manager."
good,"Assist customers, put up stock, keep the store cleaned and well stocked. Could have better management, upper management. It was more enjoyable working there before new upper management came in. Enjoyed working with most co-workers. The most enjoyable was seeing our regular customers."
good,"A day at O'reilly is filled with different people with totally different needs. If you don't have any kind of car experience you will have to learn fast. There is no room for era because the customer is depending on you to get there vehicle running. lots of fun people and the team works well together. I enjoy the fact that most of or customers are return customers, and when people come in there only to see me."

The best part about working here was the day was never dull, there was always plenty to do."
good,"It was a great place to work with respectable employees, advancement in leadership and management roles was available, the first store i worked at was part time and the management was a very good team player, the second store i worked at was full time, and the assistant manager was great very helpful in both my training and teamwork and very respectable my most enjoyable time there was just being around the people who worked there"

good,I love working at oreilys I just feel like it was time to go on to the next thing . I learned a lot of information in my time here that I will take with me into life.
good,"The job itself as all jobs, has its ups and downs. Customers are fine for the most part, but can be challenging. DIY clients call parts by different names. It would help if there were more engine specific trainings and assistance for the employees."
good,Good Company to work for with job security as long as you are willing to work. There is plenty of opportunity to move up in the company  with good benefits
good,Awesome opportunity to be involved in a goal driven company that enables its employees through goals and accountability.  Being part of such a large and diverse industry so you learn everyday and can always advance.

good,great team cohesion. customer service is great customers come back because they know we will be able to help them with all their needs big or small no matter.
good,Oreillys was a great company to work with this year. They have good room for growth in the company as I became a manager at the company within the first few months of starting and I am working on the assistant manager program now.
good,It was a good place to work but pay is not competitive with other autoparts places. It is a layed back place. Needs to be more concerned with appearance of stores and people.
good,Working in this type of job gives you the ability to learn about customer service needed to expand your portfolio or resume. Good experience and fair wages. And you learn a lot about vehicles.
good,Was definitely a good learning                                                                       experience.      I worked there while in college.  Nice people. Learn many helpful things.

good,"Fantastic work environment, great management, pay was good for a part time job along with the discount if benefits and in house training for related position"
good,i loved working at O’Reillys is was a stable job where your managers actually cared about you. i lost the job because of my poor attendance. you always had work and if you didn’t they would let you leave early.
good,"Customer Service and Sales of auto parts. Diagnosing the customers needed issue and what parts they are in need on , always selling up or cross sales, Cash handling safe counts and bank drops."
good,Plenty to learn if you are looking to expand your knowledge of how a warehouse operates. There are career opportunities if you are willing to come in everyday and exceed expectations.

good,Was a good place to work mostly because my manager at the time was an outstanding dude. The corporate aspect of the company wasnt that great. Decent schedules.
good,"Fun place to work and great for college students, good benefits, 401K, insurance not so good. A lot of heavy lifting. Boss is awesome. Great discounts"
good,It can be fast paced if you make it. Or it can be calm if you do everything right. It all depends up to you and what time you want to leave. Good job if you have no experience.
good,Management was kinda an issue. They were always changing things and not telling us. Then yelling whenever we didn't know. The team aspect was always nice. Jobs always got done in a quick manner.
good,Fast Paced Engaging great people good growth. You Pave your own way and grow with your own efforts. Good life balance understanding upper management..
good,Its an ok job..no one gave me proper training that i needed being a new employer..i had to learn everything on my own..my advice to anyone that wants a job there be ready for a roller coaster ride
good,I believe Oreilly is a great job to have it just lacks the originality it needs to be a great job. The people are harsh such as customers and the co workers are great if you find the relationship with them. Very good job in the aspect of professionalism
good,i love working with all of the people that work there and everyone looks out for everyone who is there. everyone comes and helps someone out when they need it and they would like to see everyone grow.
good,"Great team atmosphere and works well with difficult schedules."

good,"Great place to work. Great benefits. Good chance for promotion. The higher you get on the corporate ladder, the more competitive the job gets. Other then that, would recommend to anyone."
good,Ok just not enough hours.  Good benefits but with my hours being cut I'm going to fall below the minimum hours to remain at full time. Idc I do I'll need a part time or another full time job to compensate
good,"Put parts away, deliver parts to customers, log in your deliveries. Learning new hand held. There's a wireless speaker in the building, so there's music. It's a laid back job."
good,I would recommend this job to someone in college or if you are looking for a career and do not have a college degree. Personally this is a job to get me through till I start a job as an engineer.
good,"I have always had a good relationship with my co workers and repeating customers. Commercial and retail sales and learned a lot of different things. Talking with customers about their projects and just friendly chatter. Management moves around sometimes, promotions are possible."
good,Pulling parts and delivering those parts for professional costumers and unloading parts from tots and other devices to put on the stock shelves in their designated locations
good,"As long as you do your job and show up to work on time, you will be able to make some money here. There are benefits from working here like 401k, sick time, vacation time, stock option, and paid time off for holidays."
good,"My overall experience as a driver was good. As able to meet different people and was able to learn more about auto parts, tools and cars. I enjoyed driving"
good,my location has amazing management. the job is fairly simple; learning all the auto parts is the real challenge. my store is really clean and all the staff is friendly.
good,It was like being in a big family. Everyone got along worked together it was amazing except for some lying people but other than that I loved and I miss it
good,"I was happy at Oreillys for the most part. It all depends on who your manager will be, for some reason I always had a difficult time dealing with my managers here."
good,"It's a fast pace, fun place to work in. Sometimes could be overwhelming, but there's always a supervisor near by to answer your questions. O'Reilly also believes in promoting from within..."
good,Great place to work with opportunity for advancement and competitive pay. Good schedule and great management. Lots of room for longterm career opportunities.
good,Working here was fun and helping people was great and working with the team was the best experience ever. Would like to come back if I ever have the chance
good,Relaxed atmosphere never had anything bad to say about the customers or my coworkers but the manager could use some work explaining things to new employees
good,By working here you'll gain great customer and management skills. You'll learn how to work as a team and not do things on your own. There's always something to do and training every day.
good,Overall I don't I have anything really negative to say about the company. They offered room for advancement and hiring from within the company when it was called for.
good,"I liked working at Oriellys, everyone there was friendly and pretty laid back. The manager was really cool and helped if you needed anything or had any questions. The discount was a definite bonus."
good,Working at O'Reilly was fun. Laid back atmosphere as long as you completed your work when it was given to you. Come to work and do your job and it will benefit you.
good,"I have been with Oreilly for a little over a year and started out as part time, with in three months I was given a full time position as an RSS, and less than five months later I was offered the Assistant manager position."
good,I enjoyed working at this store. The daily inventory could be a little tedious if employees weren't willing to work together. But overall it was a very relaxed atmosphere. You might end up with some busy times but they were usually predictable and manageable with two people on the counter. Our store was one of the busiest in the area. Management was awesome and very helpful. They definitely promote those who are good fits for the role and not just those who have seniority. Overall a great place to work and highly recommended for anyone needing some extra money or as a first job even.
good,Working at O'reillys is a fast-paced job because your always doing something either your cleaning making deliveries stocking merchandise.  The hardest part about working here is if you dont know anything about car parts.
good,"everything about working at oreilly is great. competitive wages, promote within the company. as long as your a good worker you move up pretty fast. great and friendly envrioment"
good,Sold car parts for all vehicles. Was considered as a parts specialist for the various parts involved. Good with the public and those who came in to the store.
good,Days vary sometimes you can be really busy and other times its slow not a bad place overall  Can learn about auto parts save money on doing your own repairs is a big plus
good,"A typical day of work could either quick or slow paced, every day differs. I have learned a lot about parts and customer service, and how to handle different types of customers even angry customers. "
good,"The Durango branch has a really good work environment, however this is not a job to have if you live in Durango. It's very expensive in Durango and they only pay minimum wage, which in Durango just isn't enough. It is not the fault of the company but the fault of the city."
good,"O'Reilly is a good working environment, really enjoy dealing with the customers. I also really enjoyed working on cars and being around all the parts."
good,Oreilly's is one of the top names in automotive parts distributors and if you love automotive and cars it's where you want to be. The company provides many benefits to incentive you to learn and work harder to make sure that you have the ability to solve any automotive problem.
good,Just focus and due your job right the first time.  Be as helpful  to others as you would like them to be to you.  Also when having meetings always take notes and also pay very close attention.
good,"Initial management was amazing"
good,this is a excellent place to learn about new things and get familiar with the auto parts industry and be able to improve on your customer service skills and sales. the only bad thing is we were open just about everyday you had to work holidays only day we would close is Christmas and that is it. other competitors would at least close early and reward their employees on holidays with a meal or something not here. schedule is somewhat flexible but weekends is a mandatory at this job so cant expect to see families on weekends and plan on missing out on family events because they are open from 8am-9pm so it takes up the majority of your weekend. having a discount on parts is huuge they actually offer a bigger discount here then the other competitors. overall i enjoyed working here could have been because of the people i worked with at my store but i miss it just sucks they pay so little.
good,"I loved working at O'relly auto parts. It was very laid back, customers made it my job easier by knowing what they needed and the discounts are awesome! Would work there again."
good,Great place to work with flexible hours plenty of room for  advancement if working toward a career. Benefits are great with the company stock options available after 90 days of employment.
good,"I had a great time during my employment at O'Reilly. During which I had the opportunity to learn how logistics works. By the time I resigned I had learned almost every job function in the warehouse. I was also heavily regarded as the go to person for questions from any department. I loved learning more and more from them but the advancement options lack luster, especially how much people sacrifice for the company."
good,O'Reilly was a part time job originally taken to make ends meet.  Over time it became consuming and took over my life.  I am ready to move on and find something that inspires people to be great.
good,"The job is very easy. You can move up quick if you really want it."
good,I enjoyed the interaction with customers and fellow employees. Excellent work ethics and strong customer relations. Good training and career advancement.
good,"great pay, very fast informative about the operation and ways of completeting the job; would defininatley encourage other to work there if they get the opputunity"
good,"The work environment is good and the staff are good people. I advanced quickly to different positions, if you are a good worker you'll be fine. I worked with the company for 2 plus years and never had a write up or disagreement with management; it took one manager that didn't like me personally that let me go. I would probably still be there under different management. Oddly enough, that manager no longer works for the company."
good,great people and environment loved working there. wish i didnt have to move. the people in this company and district are very amazing. and willing to go out of their way for employees.
good,"I was an inventory specialist so most of my day consisted of counting or organizing items. I went through three managers during that time at my home store, the first was OK, the second was the worst boss and person I've ever experienced in my life, we had about 2 months with no true manager, then the third manager was the best I ever had."
good,This company is good  Not for everyone  Must enjoy fast paced where things change at anytime  Customer service with physical labor  They train you for various positions but also make you figure it out on your own  Do not pay people well so you have a constant revolving door of people
good,"Very good place to work, with great opportunity to move up.Truly get what you put into this company. And great benefits.  I would defiantly consider going back one day."
good,This was a good place to work they treated you well good chance for advancement but the travel time and mileage seem to be too much compared to pay scale
good,"My time at O'Reilly was challenging and rewarding. I learned a lot from the leadership team and the Culture at O'Reilly is second to none. The DC Manager was always positive and would be found, along with all of the leadership team, on the floor when the work was the heaviest."
good,"While working here I learned a lot about the automotive industry. It allowed me to get a better career. Workplace culture is amazing, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most educating people."
good,"Good place to learn about automotive and discuss recalls on vehicles, help people out with problems in their vehicles, proper parts needed to fix their cars and proper maintenance"
good,I do not want give a review and it is not negotiable.  I reserve my feelings and comments to myself. And your system will not make me do anything else.
good,"A nice place to work but very stressful as it goes in the parts world. Good management in the store makes for a better work environment."
good,good company to work for lots of training keeping inventory up to par to many people working at one store but over all all good that's all I hve to say
good,oreilly is a good place to work but i feel you should be able to cancel at anytime at any cost we as an employee should be able to adjust our status to
good,"I enjoyed working at Oreillys. Management is great,  my supervisor  was caring and patient. Everyone was kind.  I learned the computer system quickly due to the staff being well educated."
good,"O'reillys is clean fast paced work place, where you organize parts and help customers in store and over the phone. You have to be good with number because it is important to get the correct part number to match the customers part."
good,"I had a perfect mix of people that worked well together.  We were able to have a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.  I understand not all stores were as fun, but it worked well at my store.  We also kept things competitive for top sales numbers.  Upper management in my area had a problem with a weak backbone and something of a falseness towards employee happiness."
good,"Typical day at work for me would be to come in at 8am and clock in, then I would wait for greenvilles hub driver to bring us parts at 10 am/ 1pm and 4 pm then we deliver parts to different oreilly stores. Very simple, great people to work for."
good,"Love interacting with Customers, and delivering to other companies!! Also, I love working with my coworkers, they are all real team players. I have learned how to travel to different areas without GPS!!!"
good,"Employee's work hard to maintain good customer service. I worked as a front desk help with customers finding the parts, and ring the customer out. I also became a merchandizer while being a shift manager."
good,"A typical day at O'Reilly, we clock in, we start pulling parts, management want all parts correct. The work culture is very  good. The hardest part of our job is finding parts that is out of place. The easiest job, and most enjoyable is carrying the part to the customer. Over all O'Reilly is a great place to work."
good,"I worked for orielly for just over 2 years and in that time quickly progressed from part time counter sales to Full time, salary store manager due to outstanding performance."
good,Great place to work!They are willing to work around your schedule. The staff is very understanding and there to help. There is no strict point system.
good,"My most recent Store Manager was great! He worked with me on scheduling and was very considerate of my needs when scheduling me. The staff was very sociable and it almost felt like another family. Although at times it was fast-paced, my co-workers made the best of it and made it a wonderful working environment."
good,it nice there and people are great and customer are ok and  learning new thing and different thing enviroment is good and dropping off parts to big and small business is great
good,"Typical workday: Clock in, look on the delivery shelves and see if there are any pick tickets for parts to be delivered. If the part(s) was/were not already pulled, id go pull the part and take it out for delivery. when it was slow, id stock shelves, organize shelves and clean the store.(You do get dirty!)"
good,"it was a fair job, got to meet a lot of people, job was laid back and not so up tight like most other jobs. had advantage to move forward in the career."
good,"Oreilly auto parts is a great place to work! The company lives by three Oreilly culture values. Which are teamwork, honesty, leadership and safety and respect."
good,This is a great company with awesome opportunities for their employees to participate in. The company promotes within so all employees are presented great opportunities.
good,Always busy. Fun place to work. Great people. My boss was the best. Extesive training.  Willing to work around my school schedule. Time off when needed.
good,Coworkers are typically car enthusiast and hardworking people. However most customers assume you are a mechanic so there maybe some need for patience. hardest thing you'd ever have to do is change a battery which isn't hard at all.
good,Great place to work for a starting job or for minimal advancement. Unfortunately the way Oreillys corporation is structured it can be hard to advance in position just because the corporation is nationwide. Pay rate is decent. Staffing is also an issue at times. One of the reasons being is incentive pay which is based of individual sales. The store as more then one responsibility then to sell auto parts all the time which I feel promotes laziness for people to make a bonus instead of doing other store functions like dealing with back stock or cleaning.
good,Great place to work if you want to learn about cars. Easiest job i ever had in the automotive world.  Pay isnt amazing by any means but its a good starting place.
good,"Its a good job. Hardly no complaints when working there, my co-workers was ok to work with, managers were pretty descent only if you are working hard."
good,"Nice place to work with a great employee discount, they usually like to promote within the stores, they are always training for new managers and they are willing to help customers unconditionally."
good,Good place to work and learn about car and car parts. If you have no knowledge like I did you can learn a good amount and people willing to help. Overall had a good work experience
good,"if they could pay more, I would of stayed, like the place for sure.  Learned quite a bit about cars, and the discount was nice when I needed to work on mine."
good,Great place to start any automatics interest. There’s opportunity for promotion within the company depending on the effectiveness of performance. Pay starts at minimum wage and advances.
good,"This place i highly recoment for a single person without resposabilities. Either partime or fulltime on the other hand, work enviorment was exelent but the pay is not enought to cover expenses.."
good,"Depending on the store one works at, the pace can be mind numbingly boring or stressfully fast paced. They have an understandable, if slightly over bearing, emphasis on loyalty programs and pushing sales."
good,It definitely been an experience working at O'Reillys . I have learned a lot of experiences working there . The parts industry is something I didn't think I was going to like but it's been a life changer
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door into the parts industry, the days go by quick as you are always busy on the front counter, and you meet a lot of great people."
good,I learned a lot working there The hardest part of the job is when its you have customer who needs a part and you cant find it for them.If you know your parts it is a plus.
good,"work hours from 8am to 9pm, 1 hr lunch with a few 10 min breaks, great work environment. faithful customers, opportunity for advancement, awards given for good work ethic. overall great place to work."
good,"worked hard, had fun, just wasnt paid enough. enjoyed selling parts. love working on cars.had great manager, the hours were okay just wanted better time"
good,This is a company to work for. It has decent benefits. The hours are flexible and can work with various schedules. There are a lot of locations to reduce commute.
good,Was an environment you can grow in. Management cares. Customers are mostly pleasant but its retail that is to be expected. I would go back if need be.
good,We start the day with a short meeting. It includes warm up exercises and topic of the day. Then you get a voicing headset and start picking tickets for truck runs and customer will calls. I learned a lot about all different types of auto parts.Management was questionable at times but the culture is good. The hardest part of the job is there is a lot of walking. The most enjoyable part is helping customers get the right part  so they can get the job done.
good,ITs not a bad place to work. You just have to learn not to really bring any drama to work. Just go to work and go home. The management was always ready to help you. They never stabbed you in the back they just wanted to make saure the work was done.
good,"10 years ago it was a great place to work."
good,i  enjoyed my time at this location! learned at lot and also made friends. customers were awesome. also the discounts i got on cars part were pretty cool.
good,"A day here consists of delivering parts to auto part places collecting returns writing returns, helping customers to find parts with the help of the computer and putting up parts that come in."
good,great place to work great discount on parts!!!! mangers are understanding that real people have lifes and will help accomadate work schedules Never had a problem that could not be fixed managers take care of most customer discrepancy's
good,"I liked working there. I made friends. I got to drive all around Portland, Westbrook, S. Portland, Gorham, Windham. I got to deliver parts to all these different auto places."
good,The job can be enjoyable but sometimes stressing It is a fast pace place with a lot of challenging work. It is not a job i would recomend to anyone who is not motivated
good,"Great job if you love talking about cars and are interested in hearing customers jobs. For what the company expects from you they could pay a little bit more, but overall it is a good work environment that is low stress."
good,Nice place to work there hands down everybody work there is real nice people. the  manager or real good with there employees from top to bottom all around the board.
good,got to drive around all day finding parts and delivering parts to different shops. When in store answer phone and take orders or look parts up. ring up customer orders.
good,"good place to work at,good pay,you learn a lot ,meet people there,build a good customer relationship,ever one works as a team,good employee discount,er good place."
good,Great place to work with rewarding experience and benefits great training classes fun atmosphere lots of room for advancement and great discounts only downside lack of employees in some stores makes for long periods of time with no days off.
good,The people are very friendly to wotk with. The customers are polite even though they are angry that their car is broken. My employees help me when I need it and they are very understanding about what is happening. The job is very laid back and it gives me more knowledge on how to fix cars.
good,Oreilly auto parts was a great experience in life. I was a sales rep and also a driver for the company. While working for oreillys I was able to interact with consumers which helped build my customer service skills.
good,was a great place to work had to leave due to transportation issues and found job closer to my home.the managment was a little iffy because it was a new store and we didnt have a assistant manager yet and the manager had a lot on his shoulders
good,Good work place but hours where all over the place. You could work one real good day and then have 3 short the next. Good people just hours are scaddered.
good,"There was always something to do at O'Reilly. As a parts delivery specialist, when I was not on a run, I was involved with stocking parts in the back of the store. My Coworkers were easy-going, but productive. It was an all around fun atmosphere."
good,"I sold parts on both the retail and commercial side of the business. As long as you are taking care of customers well, you will have a job. Some parts of management are better than others but over all they will do what they can for you. work place culture is all about team work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people that refuse to be satisfied, like the ones who are going to be angry no matter what."
good,a typical day at work is by putting up merchandise helping people find the right parts for their vehicles and also helping people on the phone. I learned alot about parts and customer service.
good,Normal paced learning environment... Compared to other automotive company Great starter company part time or full time average pay and benefits .....daytime hours are more demanding than the night shifts
good,"It is a very relaxed laid-back environment the people are great to work with the job is not stressful has very good benefits good working relationships good customer based relationships. are able to move up an advance if that is the desire in that particular company."
good,"Oreilly Auto Parts was a good job for me out of highschool. I started out as a driver, slowly becoming familiar with the different customers and their needs. I eventually became a parts seller on the counter, giving me the opportunity to hone my ability to talk with and comprehend the different type of customers that came in and also further learning about the different types of vehicle related components and their basic functionality. It was a good opportunity to learn about car components and enjoy socializing with customers"
good,I have been the assistant manager for almost 6 months now and could complain minus the money. The people are nice and so is the brand just don't pay enough for a family man trying to make a living
good,A work place that tried to make competition between stores to help drive sales. Enjoyed my time there and would recommend anyone to work there. Pay was well for management.
good,"Oreillys was one of the best jobs ive ever had. my crew was a joy to work with and I got to talk with a lot of interesting folk, in addition to how much I learned from the mechanics who came in on a regular basis"

good,"Is a great place to work if you are getting into the automotive field or a veteran. Great hours and co workers, but my experience management bad sorry."
good,I loved working at Oreilys it taught me more about cars and specific parts. It was great helping customers as well as making simple conversation about there automobile.
good,Working at Oreilly was a learning experience in the retail industry. I had a lot of one on one interactions with customers and enjoyed helping them figure out exactly what they needed.
good,On a usual work day when I get to work the first thing I do after clocking in is get with manager on duty and see what the day has been like. I make observations of what is left to do and what i need to do. As the day goes by I make sure my team members are staying busy and everything is getting done. Before the shift ends my main goal is to make sure every task is complete
good,ive learn so much about cars during my time in oreilly's. it was steady. it was easy and fast paced during the week ends or holidays. my co worker were amazing. they were always helpful. I had a great experience for this company.
good,"I help customers in getting auto parts that are needed to complete their projects. I also perform merchandising duties, changing out price tags and putting up sale signs."
good,"It was a fun store to work in with great co workers, and awesome costumers that would come in and it was a job where you can learn quite a few things."
good,Had a Great time working there. Recently personnel only wanted to do their own thing and not follow the culture of the Company. Not enough persons to handle the work load and the growth of the store.
good,If you feel retail is your game this company is a good place for a fast paced retail environment. You have a lot to learn and have to be quick on your feet helping customers.
good,"Typical day involved communication with customers to exceed customer satisfaction."
good,"It's a great company to work for but it can be stressful at times. The key is having a good store manager, a good team that works together, and the ability to listen and understand the customer needs."
good,Oriellys was a good place to work but was a temporary for me. The reason I left was to better my career and take a job opportunity at delta airlines. I would mind working at oriellys again.
good,a typical day at oreillys i did alot of part searching asnd organizing nothing to serious but it was strugglious cause i cant read or write so i just quit and left town

good,"Typical day at work was customers not knowing what they were looking for, but luckily for me i was very knowledgeable with parts and how everything worked. I've learn over time to manage to diagnose customer issues by listening to customer complains and seeing there vehicle and selling the right parts the first time and gain customers over time. most enjoyable part is customer asking for me to help them with there needs."
good,Always busy doing something. I enjoy that because the day goes by faster. Attending customers and commercial customers are the best especially when we deliver parts.
good,"Working at Oreillys was fun because my best friend worked there and was the one that actually got me the job but I'll never go back there but it doesn't mean that it's a horrible job, it's okay to get by."

good,it was a good place I loved all the people I worked with made the mistake of switching stores to help out another manager went from loving my job to hating to go to work every day
good,"It was not a difficult job. It's retail sales so you have the same issues in dealing with disgruntled, uninformed customers. Like most retailer now, they push hitting metrics and focus on add-ons, and up-sells more than caring about the employee or the customer."
good,"My store manager was awesome, however mid level management have a lot of responsibility but no power to make executive decisions. The working environment was friendly but had a lot of politics."
good,Everything was good with this company. The management was understanding and coworkers were nice. Sales are very important part of the company so always try to go on and beyond to obtain the merchandise the customer needs.
good,"The work environment is fast paced, fun, and slightly competitive. Management appreciates and recognizes the work of the employee and encourages you to go above and beyond."
good,Manager and employees were awesome. Had alot of help from other employees which made the work day a lot better and faster. I learned alot from the people and manager i works with about auto parts.
good,"Fast paced environment with lots of learning potential. Average customer service issues, more fair than bad. Interesting industry to work in, especially if you're interested in mechanics field."
good,This job could be very challenging at times but very enjoyable.  Everyday brought something different. If it wasn't the customers it was the employees and sometimes even corporate. They always made sure their employees were very well taken care of.

The management team is very good and was willing to help anyone in wanting to better themselves."
good,i learned about all types of motor vehicles. management was always giving positive feedback. hardest part of the job was trying to figure out all the different parts to find in the back storage

good,"Opened the store, checked in company truck, when finished work on returns that corporate asks for, checked in store to store transfers and ozark. If anything was missing I would call the stores and notify them to either send it or cancel it, then go onto our computer and change the quantity on hand. My most enjoyable part of my job is knowing my coworkers are doing their job and I do not have to worry about them messing up. My hardest and funniest part of my job is hunting down the missing parts and finding them."
good,Loved working here. The commercial customers are usually great and I liked building a relationship with them. My coworkers were pretty fun.

Management is great and the co workers become like family forever, the hardest part about the job is to over come the chalanges the customers through at you. Most enjoyable is when a customer comes in made and leaves with a smile."
good,This company opened me up as a person as I was shy and not someone who talked to many. This position aloud for change and to work on myself. My co workers were a great group and wasn't afraid to get your job done but also have a good time. hardest part of the job would be having to deal with disgruntled customers as this could be taxing based on them being wrong. So you have to deal with it on a situation to situation scenario.
good,O'reilly Auto is one of the best parts store in the parts industry. The culture it has set is one of the best. O'reilly autop strives to make customers number one.

good,Fast advancement!  Great auto parts.  Good customer service!!  Team environment.I stared out as a parts delivery driver. Awesome discounts!!
good,"There are departments that contribute a lot of stress to the rest of the company, but overall the company is good. The website I work on is a legacy system with a lot of clunky, sensitive moving parts. The emergencies that stem from maintaining this beast are the primary contributer of stress. Management is unable or unwilling to replace this thing with something better, meaning a lot of unhappy people working on something that needs to die."
good,good company but not room for advancement. It was a good learning experience for me. With good employe discounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help the customers.
good,Working with OReilly was a very productive and awesome learning experience. I learned how to look up part for vehicles and how to change out items. I enjoyed working with the company because it taught me a lot of things I didn't know and it allowed me to show my customer skills.

good,"So far working at Oriellys has been my favorite job i have had, the people are so friendly and the environment is really good, just need more hours.

good,I enjoyed working with other co-workers for I never had any reason not to. Management was great to work for. I loved learning about automotive mobiles and being a shift manager.
good,"I worked in the Distribution Center for O'Reilly and I have to say it was probably my favorite place I've worked. The overall environment of the warehouse made it a fun place to work and the other associates were very welcoming here. The management was a little lacking here but during my time with the company there were changes being made in management so I'll say it was a ""transition period"" I worked through. I learned to work in several departments around the warehouse and each one had its challenges but the supervisors made it easy and fun to learn. I did disagree with the team I was working with as an order processor seeing as I was the ""newbie"" and hadn't been around as long as many of the team members. I was alienated by my team but overcame this by befriending others in different departments."
good,Driving and meeting people and learning to pull parts and deliver them to different Oreilly stores and customers. Liked the hours
good,"This job is an easy job to perform on a daily basis. Most of the work consists of selling auto parts to customers and giving advice on products. I learned a great deal about sales when I worked for O'reilly Auto Parts. The culture there is to never tell the customer we can't get them what they need. O'reillys will go the extra mile and them some to find what you need for all automotive needs. The management at O'reillys is great to work with and very understanding. The environment is very pleasant and the people are great. The hardest part of the job is learning about all the products available for all types of automotive (marine, tractor, trailers etc,,,). O'reilly Auto Parts has a great culture and makes for a great job for people who love the automotive industry."
good,"Lots of room to grow as an employee, friendly environment and customer service at its highest level. Team company and goal driven"

good,"Good workplace, people are outstanding and friendly. Training is very good and you can cross train. In different areas."
good,"Stable steady work that will keep you busy and on your feet. Coworkers treat you like one of the family, and its a great job for any part-time student."
good,"On a daily basis I wore a variety of hats. I started each day as a bookkeeper and banker, switched over to a shipping and receiving clerk, hightailed it to the front counter to answer phone and complete counter sales, and at many point in the day delivered parts to one of our commercial accounts. Not often, but occasionally I acted as an arbitrator to satisfy an unhappy customer or was a big brother or sometimes a dad to an employee with troubles trying to help them figure out what decision they needed to make. Most important of all was keeping a smile on my face."
good,Busy pace with plenty of things to do if not assisting customers and always something to update job skills. Had issues with some co-workers not wanting to work scheduled shifts. but it was serving customers that made it very enjoyable.
good,Good company to work for but hires people with not enough knowledge about parts. Enjoy working with my co workers.  Great environment as well.

good,"i had plenty to do and various responsibilities. i did stock, cashier, merchandiser, builder, take down, and shipping and receiving. i learned all these positions not all completly but got to work in each feild at least somewhat. it was a great experience for me and very enjoyable"
good,"Great place to grow and develop skills. From the co workers to the management team, everyone is very knowledgeable and fun to be around. Each day was a challenge from knowing exactly what a costumer needed to having to adapt new information for the store. The most exciting part of my job was to see what new projects others would bring to the store."
good,I have worked here for 4 years. The people the culture and the competitiveness is awesome. The only downside is the pay. There are plenty of opportunities to grow if you show desire. You can get up to district manager position in about 6 to 7 years if you show initiative.It's hard work and it's not for the lazy. You are required to multitask and acquire plenty of knowledge about cars.
good,Less stressful than most jobs. Friendly coworkers and management. The hardest part would probably be attaining a full-time position. The most enjoyable part was getting to do what I love most: Driving. I also gained a better idea of how to transport car parts to other cities near and far.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,"o'reilly is a well organized and moving company with great part time and full time hours, also have to learn how to drive forklifts and stand up forklifts"
good,"Take care of day to day operations, I've learned that some are cut out to be in charge and some are not. I love the coworkers I have and have made many of friends on this job. have reached a place where further advancement may not happen with upper management changes. Customers are the hardest part of the job but treat people the way you want to be treated and you get that in return."
good,great company to work for. i left because they would not take preventative safety measures. Store was totally a target to thieves
good,Close group that became a work family and had your back. Everyday something new and kept busy. Advancement and promotions in house and wonderful training
good,Felt as though some management was more focused on having a person be hired based on the opening as opposed to person with some knowledge of the automotive parts industry or related field.
good,"I liked it but they let me go when I got into a motorcycle accident and couldn't come to work."
good,Working the parts counter answering the phones helping customers issues and replacing  parts on cars over all fun fast going days.
good,didn't know anything about cars or car parts but beening that I catch on easy learned all about motors starters how to but wiper blades on just love working there
good,"Plenty of learning from answering phones, to greeting customers, to finding auto parts for the customers needs. I learned everything about a car sometimes had to do some trial and error to figure out a solution. management was fair and believed in opportunity. Co-workers were helpful but, then there were those who slacked off. Hardest part of the job when a high volume of traffic enters the door and you are trying to help each and every customer accordingly. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers day."
good,"it was my first job, i was nervous at first but as the months passed by; I really got the used to working there. i learned alot from this job, how to look up certain parts, i know how to change a car battery, test for alternators & starters. I learned a little bit of merchandising & cashier, also how to cope well with other co workers. It felt like my co workers were my second family, i get along very well with pretty much everyone. hardest part of my job was making sure the customers were always satisfied and never disappointed about my service. My most enjoyable part of my job was that I was really happy with what i had and who i worked with, never had problems with anyone. i really hope with my next job i will feel the same as i did with my previous job."
good,Well i come in the morning i check the work truck make sure it ok to drive and then put the return up from the night before.  Then i count my register make sure i have a one hundred in it.
good,Fast pace environment where multi-tasking is a must. Excellent company. Most enjoyable part of my job is the people. Fun!

After you do that you make sure the manager or person in charge of your area pulled out the right parts and if so you load the parts in your truck and  head on out. When you come to your first stop you make sure you take out the right parts and dropped them off inside the store and get a signature.

good,"I enjoy working hard and getting the job done. Getting the job done isn't the only part of work, it's getting it done to standard if not exceeding standard."
good,Good place to learn about cars. Learned my geographic surroundings. An excellent place to overcome gender bias.
good,They are willing to teach everything you are willing to learn.
good,Good company just another corperate amercan place to work. Nothing great or negative to say
good,"Good place to work, with many benefits.On Fridays, there is free popcorn for all. Holiday meals such as Christmas are catered in for all shifts.Management is fair and balanced in performance and wage review.Co-workers are congenial and easy to get along with.The hardest part of the job is keeping up with disposal of the leftover packing debris, as there are many zones to monitor, and it is a large DC.The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what is to be done,and the cooperation of my fellow team members."
good,"A typical day at work was to deliver parts, assist customers with automobile part needs. How to install batteries and order parts. Management was good. The co-workers were helpful. There was not a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being helpful to customers. "
good,"Prior to accepting the merchandising position, I typically worked evening shifts without much fluctuation. The management staff was quite responsive with any training needs, and the district management staff was very accommodating with personal needs (i.e. moving, traveling costs, etc.) I have performed many responsibilities while employed with O’Reilly Auto parts, such as delivery, sales, management, and now inventory control. Every day was a new learning experience, especially considering I knew very little about auto parts when I was first hired into the company. I turned every day into a challenge to help me become a better sales representative, meanwhile, continually maintaining my responsibilities for each given position. "
good,Work would begin with putting freight away and just talking with fellow employees until customers would start showing up. Everyday you learned something new and were able to help more people out. 
good,"O’Reilly Auto Parts DC, Quality Assurance Material Handler		       	           May 2011 – Aug 2011"
good,"even if it was a slow day i could always find something that needed to be done.i learned about parts,vehicles and being in management. all my managers were fair and helpful in all aspects.i enjoyed all my coworkers as if they were my family.i didn,t find any hard parts to my job.the most enjoyable parts of the job was coworkers and customers."
good,The best part of the job is helping out the customers. Day in and out with the different issues that they have and helping them over come them.
good,very easy productive and fun workplace very easy to get along with asssociate
good,loved woring for them the management is awsome flexible schedual
good,helping customers assisting shops locate parts for customers
good,"Working at O'Reilly Autoparts was a great experience. Every morning all of the workers would come together and stretch out to get ready for the work day. Every smiled, even at four o'clock in the morning. The managers we're always very motivating, and there to help push the employees when needed. I enjoyed the employees, everyone who worked there were very nice and very kind. The hardest part was leaving the job due to my school schedule conflicting with the work schedule."
good,"Assisted and educated customers on parts and products, learned how to balance a cash register, management was organized and on point, co-workers worked together as a team to get tasks done, hardest part of the job was scanning in new products, and most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction the customers got from the great customer service."
good,I've enjoyed my time with this company but right now the advancement just isn't there.
good,"get your drawer ready . sell , sell , sell. that is your main goal besides providing excellent customer service whether its a regular or a new upset customer. As i mentioned before the main thing is sales but there's other tasks that need to get done while selling such as checking in the supply truck and stocking it on the floor, reset planograms , making sure isles and merchandise are clean and presentable while being plentiful at the same time, Machining rotors, the occasional swapping out a battery , installing light bulbs, ""being a mechanic"" assisting customers with identifying the issues with their vehicles, and sometimes installing certain parts as long as its not too time consuming. (all part of excellent customer service) . we also dealt with commercial accounts which made it crucial to be able to take a long order of goods accurately and without having to ask the customer to repeat themselves (most of those shop guys wont even give u a chance to ask them to repeat themselves they'll simply give u the spill on what they need as fast as they can and hang up on u cause to them time is money) showing them that u are listening to them and that they are important to you. A big part of the business is knowing how to look for parts in catalogs, such as special order parts or rare parts. At the end of the day you count your drawer and do the end of day procedures (if your on the closing shift) and call it a day."
good,"I loved going to work, because I knew it would be a blast. I loved what I did and everyone I worked with. The only thing negative I could say about the local store is the schedule was never the same from week to week. I couldn't make plans with my family like I wanted."
good,"A typical day as Store Manager included managing the schedule of store employees, ensuring the safety of the employees and customers. As employees of O'Reilly's our goal was customer service and to be a productive store."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming end opening and scanning in all freight. Once done with making sure the freight is accurate and correct I was responsible for making sure the items were put up in there correct place. Having good or responsible co workers is a very important part of putting up stock correctly. While putting up freight, setting planograms, answering phones and working with customers, one must still find time and make sure every customer is provided the best customer service possible, which was te igh light of each day for me."
good,involved discussing auto parts on a very extensive level. which is very educational and interesting.
good,I was an assistant manager of Outbound freight. I enjoyed to people who worked under me who I worked hand in hand with on a daily basis.Had to leave to take care of a family member who had fallen deathly ill.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts, Inc. strives to be the dominate parts supplier in all their markets. This is done by hiring and maintaining quality people who are customer service driven and enjoy a good working environment. There are many opportunities with O'Reilly, if a person is willing to relocate. Relocation is not required for promotion. O'Reilly likes to promote from within the company first."
good,"Good company to work for, very corporate, lotta different chemicals to work with, lots of computer stuff to know,  knowledge of car parts and other automotive tidbits."
good,"I was doing really well as a Tsm, was just about to break out of my insurance plan and about to go commission only and thats when the territories got re-aligned and i got the worst end of the stick.."
good,"We work nights, but that's essential for getting in and out of stores without hitting customer vehicles. We unload full pallets with electric pallet Jack's, lights inside the trailers and mostly new equipment. Route pay, so if it's a 12hr route and you do it in 10 you still get paid for 12hrs. Management isn't perfect but they try very hard to make our nights as smooth as possible."
good,"Answer phones, help customers by looking up parts, help determine their car issue/ recommend them to a shop, install batteries to headlights to wiper blades."
good,"Its a diversified place to work for with good working environment co workers are friendly with good teamwork towards each other and finally good customer service both internal and external customers"

good,"Great place to work, advancement is always available with work. Good first job. Good work-life balance. Under training you can learn more about the automotive world."
good,"Supervised and coached employees while managing customer service, sales, shipping and receiving, accounting, multitasking in a high volume atmosphere, with a win-win attitude.  Top sales leader, multiple awards achieved for great customer service and sales."
good,It would be a good day or a fast pace quick day. I learned everyday something new to help out the next customer having questions . Culture was always something to do to stay busy from helping customer to stock up the the shelf. Hardest part was under staff when busy while also answering phone calls. Enjoyable was interacting with customer and coworker.
good,"Oreilly was probably one of the most gratifying jobs I've had. The benefits were amazing, the fast paced nature of the work made the days fly by, and the management were very understanding and down to earth for a corporate business. My only complaint with Oreilly was they pay for they experience I had for the job. If the money were right i would have never left the company."
good,"Job is pretty easy going, just have to have basic knowledge of automotive industry, always learning new things, always room for growth in the company."
good,Overall  a great place to learn people skills and develop your personality. Working with customers will give you a variety of work experience which one could  use for the duration of life.
good,"Good company to work for. Opportunity to advance, and good culture. Vacation and personal days are a bit limited. Pay varies by position. Some very personable managers from my experience."
good,"Begin work at 7:30 AM, sharp.  Clock in, receive goods in the stock room.  Scan each item into the store system.  Categorize them for placing them on the showroom floor.  Check merchandiser software for daily tasks and holiday updates.  Print planograms (maps of how shelves, pegs, and items are to be arranged).  Clean designated area, including the products, and correct any price labels.  Post sales ads, specials, marketing materials around the store as instructed.  Clean restrooms.  Clock out promptly at 5:00 PM.  Occasionally assist delivery drivers when they are absent, but only per manager instruction. "
good,pay was a little low but had fun working there because of the people. the job was not too strenuous. had to leave because  relocated. would consider working for them again
good,If you do not have experience in automotive it might be a little difficult at first but over time you will learn more and more just helping people with what they need to fix their vehicles or equipment
good,Great experience if your willing to learn more about cars. you learn about car parts and their function. you get to learn about different types of car for those who like cars.
good,"This place was nothing more than a stepping stone for me and I knew that from the get-go. I needed out of my current role of long haul trucking and something had to serve as the transition from that to something else and these guys happened to make the first offer. That all being what it is, this place is typical corporate office work. The very things that the movie Office Space depicts. "
good,"Worked at three Locations. Most of the people I worked with were Great. I was Very fortunate."
good,"A very productive team that got things done, worked together to meet goals. As well as had a good time together. We were able to be one of the top parts sales store in my town because of our dedication to our customers and their needs."
good,Learning how every individual parts of the  warehouse To know where to find the parts to pull out for the driver to deliver the location that their sent to
good,"I was hired on at O'Reilly Auto Parts as a part time parts specialist, I was working almost a 40 hour week, I decided to talk to my boss about full time. At my three month evaluation I was prempoted from parts specialist to a retail service specialist, witch is a management position with override privileges and management duties, being the night time manager I have many responsibilities such as training the new hires keeping the store at above satisfactory expectations closing procedures and management calls."
good,This was a great job for me as I was looking for a full time job. The pay was just a minimum wage however I needed work immediately. I was sad to leave however I needed something full time with better pay.
good,"If you're a student or retired person, this is a perfect atmosphere."
good,"I really enjoy working for O'REILLY'S as a driver and I don't want to leave. The company has treated me very well when I have been sick and unable to work. I was really surprised that I can get the benefits I have, employee assistance, discount and other perks. I just did not for see this from working in the auto parts industry at the entry level."
good,"This is a great company to work for. The stores that I worked for were relaxed, upbeat, and really fun. Employees get great benefits and are well taken care of. The only downside is the pay."
good,"I love interactions with people. There are advancement opportunities. "
good,"Very professional work environment, awesome and friendly co-workers. Have lots of fun in a perfessional manner and met alot of new customers Was able to travel and work at the different stores around town to lean to ways an abilities to improve my work habits and ethnics."
good,"Overall, working at O'Reilly Auto Parts was a positive experience. There was always something to do. Dealing with difficult customers was the most stressful part of my days. As a woman, I got many more unnecessary comments that could have been saved for never. Working with the commercial customers was more enjoyable because they were familiar with O'Reilly and what parts they wanted."
good,O’Reilly auto parts is overall a good company to work for but could pay just a tad bit more. Great benefits though. They also have great career options other than working at the store level.
good,"Quality place to work, clean near and we'll run stores and good upper management.good pay for management but could pay team members better. It was a good experience"
good,"It depends on which store you go to. The hub makes the most money, and so there are better opportunities there. Management is alright, but depending on which department you go to, it can get a bit hectic and a little too fast passed."
good,"The pay isn't all there, work around 9-11 hours a day. If your willing to put in the work, you can move up in the company. If you are not willing to put in the effort and long hours to insure that the store is running well you wont make it far."
good,"Clock in for work, the whole crew stretches, you look on the board to see what department you're in, go to your department and get to work. It is a fast paced environment and all you are doing the rest of the shift is picking orders from shelf, loading the totes, then sending them off. There are 3 to 4 workers in a crew so you do have help. Most workers try to work fast to get the orders out but does not really matter because once youre done with your department, there is always other departments that are behind and need help. So you will usually jump to the other department lacking and help them until you all are finished. You dont go home until all the department orders have been sent out. Once you are finished you clean and pick up all your trash in your department area. Once thats done go to your supervisor to see if anyone needs help. If not you clock out and go home. Typical day working would be 5am to 3pm. If we were behind we would sometimes stay til 5pm. The pay was ok because of the hours you get."
good,Got to work in a O'Reillys shirt and hat plus whatever pants you choose. Get plenty if time for lunch plus a fridge if you bring your own lunch to eat
good,"O'Reilly Auto has taught me a great deal about the automobile industry and how to deliver great customer service. Management is great to work with and provides a great chemistry among the workers. Regular days are best defined as a busy line with customers, regular or professional. The workplace culture of O'Reilly dedicates itself to always succeed in having a great environment for all."
good,I like this company and enjoy my job. The career opportunities are there and the training is good. The benefits are good and available quickly. Good work environment for the most part.
good,"O'Reillys work environment is phenomenal.  At first it starts as a job and later turns into a second family.  Everyone there is so kind and generous.  In and out of work they will help you if you need it.  Depending on the day the pace of work can change.  It can be stressful at times, but a majority of they time it is at your pace.  As long as you got the assignments done on time and made sure priority jobs were finished ASAP, you would be just fine."
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Oreilly Auto Parts the environment was outstanding and the work was fast paced and busy and i enjoyed the general attitude and work environment.
good,"Well if your first shift like me , you would have to get to work at 5 in the morning. You clock in no later than 530 , process out a QR scanner , and go to your designated lane with your 5+ stores with 4 different waves. Basically what your doing is scanning totes , consolidating them if needed , and stacking totes onto a pallet. Once your pallet is full either you move the pallet yourself with a electric pallet jack or you notify your partner to move it so you can shrink wrap the totes to the pallet and have your partner load them onto a truck/trailer."
good,Great place to work. Schedule is descent  Didn't like working weekends because I was hired to only work weekdays.  Laid back environment.  Making deliveries was fun for me.
good,Great company and the people that i work with are amazing and get along and work well. The work place is amazing and easy going. the work days are long but you build confidence talk/ greeting everyone that walks in the front door and build relationship with your co-workers.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is a fun place to work. You get to find parts that you're not used to finding and you get to meet some really nice people along the way. It definitely helps you work as a team and teaches you time management skills along with customer service. I have learned a lot working for this company and would recommend it to anyone just starting a career or wanting to advance in one.
good,"The environment at the store is relaxed and easy going.  They are serious about taking care of the customers and customer service.  However, if there is no stock to be put up or no customers needed to be taken care of there is no big problem with you just relaxing a little.  The workflow is manageable for just about anyone.  Also, the management is very flexible with your hours and they are very easy going.  The biggest downside the low pay.  However, you might look at the lay back work environment being a trade-off for the low pay."
good,Out of all my jobs this one was one of the best. I really enjoyed what I did at Oreilly. It was stressful at times and sometimes I wanted to pull my hair out. however it was still a very enjoyable job.
good,"This was a great place to work, only reason i stop working was because I was having Medical problems. I kept passing out at the register. It can be hard for girls because men don't think we dont know anything about parts."
good,"It was a great job at first, and the after my first review ( 1 year ) only received a 2% raise which equals out to .23 cents. Was very dissatisfied with that, but continued to press on because that's what I do. Work back in the Hub Department which is back away from everything else, we receive 5 deliveries a day from the DC ( Distribution Center ). The people I work with I absolutely love and  I believe that's why I'm still there. I just want more for myself and I know I'm not gonna get it by continuing my career at O'Reilly's. Perfect job for person just out of high school or a retried person just wanting to work part-time."
good,"Excellent place to work for. Very accommodating to family/life emergencies. Coworkers were very pleasant and helpful most of the time. I one coworker treated me like a dog which made the work environment excessively stressful, which caused me to change departments."
good,"Busy phones, checking faxes, maintaining spreadsheets. Processing freight claims, department meetings weekly. "
good,"The typical day was very busy, on the go from 8 am until usually around 3 to 4 would slow down and pick back up until 5 pm. The hardest part of the job was heavy lifting and dealing with some accounts that were difficult and dealing with wet weather conditions. The hourly wage is slow, but they tell you that you get a monthly store bonus which they say makes up for hourly wage."
good,"I absolutely loved working for O'Reilly, but it was personal reasons that ended my job there. I would recommend anyone to work their. Great people to work with and managers to work for."
good,Oriellys is a great workplace environment for people who are interested in the automotive industry . Even people who aren’t around cars a lot will be able to fit in because of the friendly nature of the employees
good,"I love working here. I just dont make enough money. The people i work with are awsome. I've had some pretty lousy managers but my manager is new but he's doing a pretty good job. He works right along with us. He's also nice. Ive always said and went by ""you catch more flies with honey than vinegar."""
good,I initially accepted a position as a delivery driver and enjoyed it so much that when I was offered a position as a Parts Sales Specialist I eagerly accepted it. Shortly afterwards I was offered a position as the Assistant Store Manager and am looking forward to becoming a store manager. Great advancement opportunities.
good,I Loved everything about my job and those that I worked with. Management was fantastic. Everyday was different. There was always room for advancement.
good,The store manager can be an toosh but he really does mean well for your well being. The co workers are hilarious and keep you on your toes. Very relaxed and fun place to work.
good,"Work was fun.  Fast paced, but enjoyable.  Competitive.  I loved to rearrange and clean the warehouse and put like products together so they could be found more easily.  At first I asked for permission, but later was given the warehouse to do how I pleased.  But, I still asked for advice before doing any major movements.  I was a full time delivery driver and I loved every aspect of my job.  Unfortunately, I left this job for better pay."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Benefits were good, a little hard to get raises in order to make it with the economy. Coworkers were very helpful and fun to work with. Management was very helpful. Great learning experience. Working with the public and local businesses, getting to know customers and learning about vehicle parts and products is very helpful to anyone that owns a vehicle."
good,If you like cars and want to learn more about them and work on customer service skills this place is great. Every store is different though and depends on who works there.
good,"While working with O'reilly, I learned quite a bit about automotive parts and accessories, and there was always someone willing to help you understand if there was something you didn't. The management was decent, but the particular manager i had had no back-bone and couldn't make any decisions for himself, even if that meant hurting the stores profits. (It did) all in all i Would definitely work for O'reillys again given the opportunity and better pay."
good,"i enjoyed working here but the pay was low starting off, you get a small rase every six months but you still don't make a lot. you get a good discount on merchandise. i also like my manger she was really easy to get along with, and i would recommend this job to anyone who needs a reliable job with the ability to advance as a career."
good,"The day starts off with scanning new products into the system and restocking, interact with customer and deliver parts to professional customer. What Oreilly's taught me was how to better myself with customer service skill and their 12 month of culture related days."
good,"Driving was a very easy job. You have to have a clean driving record but the job is very easy. Selling parts was fast paced and exciting at times, but boring at other times"
good,"Good environment, great room to grow. If you’re a manager or above the pay is good. Under management is “meh”. I would not reccomemd this as an only job."
good,This is a good job but if you’re looking to make money here you’re at the wrong place you’re only going to make money if you’re a manager or above so just keep that in mind.
good,good for part time students. learned allot during time there. Good way to be introduced to the awesome automotive field. Hours always sucked if a student.
good,Great starter job! Dont look for a full time position they like to hire part time employee's. The job is very laid back. If you like dealing with customers its a great job for you!
good,The team you work with sets the stage for your time there. If you get along good with the store manager then good things will follow. Follow what he says and flourish. Nice place overall.
good,I enjoyed working around auto parts. Was cool being around people with the love for cars! I got to meet a lot of people and made some new friends along the way!
good,"I've actually worked for O'Reilly's twice. The first time i was promoted to the role of assistant manager but was only given an $0.11 pay raise. I was performing all of the roles of an assistant manager for $6.86 per hour. Needless to say, I moved on. A couple of years later i ended up going back for $9.00 per hour in a temporary parts counter position. I'd really like to make my way back again."
good,"Working at  parts store is a rewarding experience.Helping people in need fix an issue while they are worried about making it home. The hardest part of the job is customer service, sometimes doing what you need to keep a customer happy is not what you can do according to company policy. Along with trying to keep a store staffed with reliable people."
good,"If you know nothing or even a little but, shoot! Even if you know more than enough knowledge of cars then this is the place! "
good,"A lot of opportunity and room to move up. Worked at three different locations, one was much better than the other. I loved my first location (Houghton Lake), the management and coworkers were great! Then the other two stores I transferred too simply had lazy workers who were unorganized and clearly needed new management. Overall a great place to work! Just have to find the right one for you! They do offer insurance and other benefits but I didn't take advantage of them because they weren't very cheap."
good,"Excellent place to work, fast paced. Culture among my higher ups is amazing, they really make you feel like family. Managers are your best teachers and will help you in anything you need. Advancement opportunities are great and they make sure you succeed."
good,I started at oreillys as just a driver delivering parts. After 6 months I was promoted to a supervisor position in the warehouse. I routed the drivers and picked and pulled auto parts. I would assist customers and accounts.
good,Great opportunities for advancement. Great work place and such a great working culture. Very organized and workplace is extremely balanced. Would definitely reccomend to somebody.
good,"Typical work day was morning paper work and deposits along with coaching mentoring my team members in giving the best customer service. I learned leadership skills, communication skills, management skills, and customer service skills. Lived and displayed the companies culture values daily thru all our dealings. The hardest part of the job was managing 25+ team members as well ask get all the manager task done demanded by upper management and company. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team members; advancing their careers, personal goals, culture values and knowledge."
good,Most mgr are easy to get along with and I love helping customers. U stay busy and I am all about staying busy. And moving up in the company is pretty easy if that is what u r looking for.
good,"Never a dull moment here, great place to work and get job experience while in high school. Very flexible on scheduling and getting last minute time off."
good,"I check to see my daily deliveries, make sure my products are ready to go. When the deliveries are finished I stock, assist customers and be ready for whatever else is needed. I have learned much about different auto parts. The hardest part of the job is when deliveries need to be made and customers need to be taken care of at the same time."
good,"The job was right in my wheel house, provided extensive paid training, and managers were helpful when needed. Some equipment was a bit ou tof date but other than that O'Reillys was one of the best places to work that I have been at."
good,Management takes care of their employees and ensures that everything is handled. Easy to manage position and requires basic skills to accomplish duties.
good,"The retail part of this job is not difficult at all. Moving up in the company is the difficult part. If you want to be within a company to move up with and it not take 10 years, this is not the company for you."
good,"Productive, well organized, safe and fun environment, customer service oriented.  Training provided for advancement. Always opportunity for growth within the company."
good,"great place to work, great people to work with, very casual environment. If automobile repair is your love it is great. employee purchase plan is great."
good,"I love the work and the people I work with, including the customers I see on a daily basis.  As lead driver, I have more responsibility than other drivers, but I wouldn't change that.  I worked hard to earn my position.  The best part of the job is getting out and seeing people and even their pets!"
good,O'Reilly is a company that is quickly expanding through the US. It's a very chill and great company to work for. A typical day for my position is to ensure parts are accurate and deliver to stores in a timely manner.
good,"This was a great place to work. The hours were flexable. And the job duties stayed the same, while each interaction changed enough to keep you on your toes. "
good,"I would start my day by helping my co-worker unload the truck full of new inventory, then eventually scanning everything that came in. throughout the day we would put the merchandise where it belonged and from time to time i would go to the register when ever it got busy"
good,"Oreilly's was a good workplace. My shift was fun, hardworking, and had excellent team work. They had an excellent hours that work with my day to day schedule"
good,"Good, fast growing company with plenty of job security and lots of growth opportunity. Fair compensation and great company culture. Good place to start a career."
good,"This place has a culture like no other. High advancement opportunities and high job safety. Decent pay for part time, but full time is better as management because its not really enough to live off of every month. Awesome people with a low price garuntee."
good,"I enjoyed my time with oriellys, it was a place was i was able to learn and expand my knowleadge on autoparts and on leadership."
good,unloaded the trunk  in the morning sorted parts restocked shelves with merchandise drove parts to customers and auto dealerships also.
good,"Overall a job for college high school students. Good environment, easy to work with, good learning experience, great commission, friendly employees."
good,"When I started here I knew nothing about automotive repair. I advanced really fast and took on many responsibilities that were outside of my workload requirement. By the time I left, I took a lot of knowledge with me. The competitive edge here is solid to where it doesn't feel cut throat."
good,"I'd start out by putting away as much freight (Products) away on the shelves. I started to memorize where everything went after awhile, and I learned how to use the Infinity Parts System, as well as Legacy System. Learning about Auto Parts, and where and what they do was something I though was very beneficial. My co-workers i'd have to say were some of the coolest people I have ever worked with. It was not a hard job in anyway at all, and it was more of a enjoyable work place to be in."
good,love his job get sales bonus flexible scheduling great management time and half for holidays and paid holidays aftr 90 days of employment even get a easter bonus
good,"the hardest part in he job is to be in charged as a night manager that you be willing to do everything by your self and keeping your team member with the stuff that they need for example: password, money, or just help and the things that i liked the most was helping my customers finding their parts that they need, in my co workers we work as a team you ask for help and they help you and with management he was sometimes good and bad depending on his emotions but overall he does help you.i learned may thing at this job with there system, knowing the parts that customer need by your head, and also learning how to close a store by your self."
good,"I worked at O'Reilly Auto Parts for just at a year, and very much enjoyed my time there. Working in a retail type job, as always, you have your bad days due to customers and such. However, the system was great and made it extremely easy to cater to your customers in a timely and efficient manner."
good,most of the day is stocking parts and helping with customers and shop customers. ive learned many different parts and what are used to get the job done including the tools to do it. management is wonderful very flexible with scheduling and knows when to get stuff done with out having to really say much since most co workers at the jobs from clock in to clock out. the hardest part of the job is definitely the customers they believe in parts professionals but we do not know everything they wish us to and that can get you and irate customer but it is very rarely and containable. the best part of the job is most likely the satisfaction of a happy customer. right part right knowledge there out the door coming back for more.
good,A typical day for me was checking inventory and putting it in designated areas. Then going on delivery runs if needed. I learned how to do inventory well and I also learned a lot about vehicles. Management nd co-workers were always there when you needed them and fun to be around.
good,Everything from opening hours to closing hours were about Customer service. All the team members knew and were taught over and over again to exploit all other options before saying NO to a customer. hours were good staff were good.
good,good job jus feel like i could have been doin more and found a better job.wish the pay was better. manager thought they could talk to you any kind way but overall good job
good,"The work was fairly simple, a lot of team work. However, it matter most on you to get your own work done. Everyday, we would have to come in, and start our day by staging pallets. We would then stack outgoing product that was sent to the shipping dock from workers, known as pickers, working  in the rest of the building. As, being that I worked in car parts this meant that current Department of Transportation laws applied to what I was doing. Every chemical had to be properly labeled before being shipped out. It was up to all of us on the shipping dock to make sure that your product on the dock met all requirements. Help was always given when it could be given. It was not all work though, O'Reilly was nice in giving yearly bonuses, also buying lunch for all of the employees four times a year, and still giving one large company picnic once a year."
good,"Great place to work. Only issue is pay. Everywhere I've worked everyone was always cheerful and fun to work with. Advancement is available however, it takes an act of congress to get a raise. The better you do the more work is given to you with little to no pay raise."
good,"Great company upper management treats everyone like family , not always about the numbers but help you achieve your goals as well and dedication to the team members ."
good,"The company's values are great and something I live by, that is pretty much all the company has going for it, once it gets to upper management its all about filling their pockets with money while the stores suffer. Management members in the store are only focused on getting rid of other management members. If you liked high school drama this is the place for you. I was raised to respect my elders and to treat others the way I want to be treated, you wont get that here. The previous manager was on the right track, he cared more about his team and customers than himself, once he left there was nothing else for me here."
good,The hardest part of my job problem shooting to find fixes for parts that you cant just find in the computer or the books. Ones where they are putting parts on one make and model to another make and model. I love that I get to work with hand in hand with customers and co-workers.
good,I love the management team and employees.  Everyone is pleasant and eager to help the customers.  O'Reilly's is truly a place that provides great customer service.
good,I love the way you see promotion on the job and how they educate you to move up on the job. The company was willing to work with me when changes happen and I needed some changes to keep my job. The workshops I attended during the time I was in management educated me more for growth with the company and outside the company. The staff was willing to pull together to get large and small things done to better service customers. As a store in whole we had days where we had barbeques to just keep moral boosted and just have fun and get to know each other without the stress of work.
good,"I started working at O'Reilly about a year ago and they are a great company to work for, to get your foot in the door. I have been very happy with the management but I recently graduated and am looking to advance my career."
good,Great Company with proper structure and training. Expectations of management can easily exhausted with 14hr shifts and the indirect expectation to work 6 to 7 days weekly to absorb slower retail trends.
good,"I was a driver for the company and did inventory, cashier. I drove to different auto mechanic stores, did inventory when new parts came in and checked people out."
good,"Clientele could range from happy and cheery to morbid and downright rude (because think about it, they come to O'rielly's when they have car problems) and the employees could range from knowledgeable and professional to immature and unequipped for the job, so really and truly it's your outlook on the company that made your experience, and your location"
good,"Helped customers with parts and accessories. Learned about many different parts of vehicles. Management was casual and could be pleasant to work around. Co-works can be great friends but often were lazy. Hardest part was putting the daily delivery truck supplies up and doing inventory once a quarter. Best this was they tend to have fun, meet different people and see some awesome cars."
good,"Overall nice place to work, friendly people, productive, fast-paced work environment, and great pay."
good,"I work for this company for 1yr and 6months, I had a great team and manager was good. This was my first job when i got to Iowa."
good,"running in the zone and scanning for lost parts and finding part location  and placing them in the right area. locating damage part and placing in the right place. use of a scan gun diving a man up to pull part and order pick  to fill order and sent out to the store my using a headset."
good,"I Assistant Manager/ Retail Sales Manager I would have perform the typical management task, there was always something to do, and my job was to make sure that it was done in a timely manor. I learnt how to create a sales presentation to commercial prospects, while multi-tasking, managing a team to exceed expectations of the company and customers, Co-workings was friendly and modest, getting parts out to customers in a timely manor due to the number of delivery trucks, O'Rielly Auto Parts sold everything, it did not matter, auto part to a mop. Loved it.."
good,Learned a lot about customer service and satisfying customers.  Employees created a wonderful working atmosphere.
good,"running deliveries to local shops, I learned about different parts on cars, the co-workers were amazing, the hardest part of my job was figuring out the different types of parts for what vehicle"
good,busy steady work all day. management not the greatest but workable. hardest was following all corporate nit picking
good,I enjoyed coming to work.  Met a lot of new people and learned how to install some parts on cars.
good,Great customer service and vast auto part knowledge. Learned how to deal with varios people. Loved seeing pleased customers..
good,This company is a great place to learn while working. If one is interested in the automotive industry O'reilly's is a great stepping stone.
good,"Excellent company to work for. Benefits are amazing and beneficial. Customers can sometimes put up a fight, however for the most part are very loyal."
good,"I enjoy working with the team members and the customers at O'Reilly auto parts. They are good people. The manager is demanding but fair and helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning all the ins and outs of the computer program and what it can do, the the team members are always willing to help by walking me through it.  Helping the customers complete a DYI project with tips and knowledge makes all the hard work worth it."
good,Day to day operational management procedures. Assist with customers on the retail side as well as the commercial side of the business. Train and coach team members. The hardest part of the job was balancing the time needed to complete everything on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the best team members in the business.
good,"fast work ,you learn alot, 10hr shifts no matter what the weather is you have to deliver"
good,A typical day at work consists of being able to attend and sell clients auto parts. It is all about team work.
good,"O'Reilly was one of the best jobs I ever had, they promote from with-in their culture works weather on the job or in life, I've learned that I needed to do a better job of staying calm,for the most part the management team for the company is good most started out in counter sales and where promote. All of the people that I worked for or worked for me were top notch the best i've worked with. The hardest part of the job was finding the right balance from being in the store to trying to add more businesses to the store. The best part of the job was being the boss and running the store as though it was my oun parts store with not alot of interferance for the upper mangement"
good,day to day task of finding the correct part for the customers application. learned great customer service skills. management was great. co-workers were great. hardest part of the job was finding the hard to find parts. everything was enjoyable about this place.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phones, assisting customers. Stocking the shelves, basic janitorial services."
good,Decent place to work. Being a Delivery Specialist is an easy but demanding job.
good,Most enjoyable part of job was the interaction with people. Learned it takes teamwork to be successful!
good,"A typical day is spent assisting customer with proper part selection or minor installation for their vehicle. Always something to learn in an auto parts store. Co-workers very knowledgeable, management is hands on with some training. Best part about job was knowing that you helped someone with a DIY, fixable problem"
good,Very stable company that has not let anyone go due to economic conditions.
good,Decent place to work. However they don't pay very well. I made some good friends while I was there.
good,"Overall fun place to work. Hours and pay were overall descent, work was easy."
good,Great place to work especially for students who have to juggle school and work.
good,"Your always learning something new. Its nice getting to know different people as a delivery driver. The only time it's hard to work is during bad weather, especially when your having to lift heavy merchandise."
good,Love working for this company. The manager was nice and helped me advance. The employees are real helpful and so were the managers. I worked the hub in Dallas.
good,Enjoyed the time I spent working for this company they offer benefits though I wish they were a bit more affordable. Great friendly environment learned alot working for the company.
good,"Being able to work with customers everyday, fixing problems with cars everyday and learning new things everyday especially from the customers point of view when fixing the customers car"
good,I worked as a closing shift manager while in college and learned a lot about cars and retail. My manager was always very flexible with my schedule to make sure I had all the days off I needed.
good,"If you're looking to build your resume in management this is a great place to start. Promotions happen fast for those who want it. Dont be discouraged because you dont know about cars. This is a retail business, great customer service is more important. The company has on the job training software to teach you what you need about car related parts."
good,"I enjoyed working for this oriellys store more then the others. Great management, really nice working atmosphere nice who care. I was treated very well and felt like the team I worked with was a family."
good,Pretty good place to work. Staff is friendly and very professional. Can get lots of experience in the automotive and parts industry working here. Recommended.
good,"The people are very friendly and helpful. Some days are more relaxed than others. The work is easy and steady. The pay can be good; however, it just wasnt for me."
good,Nice place. Usually Monday thru Friday hours.  Able to meet new people and make lasting relationships with customers. Operate well maintained equipment.
good,It’s a relaxed job with it’s stressful times when they are super busy but they work with personal life and school schedules and is a super fun group of people to work with I just feel like they should take care of their workers as much as they take care of their customers.
good,"Company is good they just underpay, advance Auto was able to build next door and offer employees $3 more to start. They need to raise starting pay from 8-9 an hour to $11-13 an hour"
good,"Oriellys is a great environment to work, dedication moves you quickly from within. A great Segway into the automotive industry. Highly recommend to anyone who is determined."
good,It was a great place to work everyone was nice to me they will work with you if you just tell them everything that is going on with you and the benefits are really good once you make it full time and 6 months in
good,"It's a great place to work, you get out what you put in the harder your willing to work or fill in at other stores as needed the more likely you are to advance."
good,"I love my job here, my co workers are awesome and my manager is great, only down side is the pay is not very competitive. I wouldn't trade my job for anything,  just wish the pay was better"
good,"A typical day at O'reillys was always busy especially with their to-do list. I learned a lot about time management, along with holding the assistant manager position. Keeping employees busy makes the culture of the store pretty happy most days. The hardest part of that job was trying to find a part that was like 100 years old. I really enjoyed my job and the people that I worked with everyday. Weather day or night the crews were always happy and I had numerous compliments from customers on our customer service."
good,"You will learn a lot from training and from your fellow co-workers."
good,"The manager and co-workers were very friendly.  It's a very easy job: manager will assign you to work on a pallet, and when you're done, you ask for a different assignment and so on.  This was the only position I did and it get very repetitive and you might bored at time.  I recommend you apply at a department where manager could rotate you around so you could take a break from the usual."
good,Great work place good communication between management crew and non management. Great at having flexible hours and working with you on making you a better employee.
good,"Overall working for Oreilly Auto parts was an intersting and postive experince. I was with the company for almost three years, and i experinced alot of growth when it came to my knowledge of auto parts and automobiles alike. I also made carrer advancements becoming a closing and opening manager for the store location in Marysville,CA. I gained valuable caustomer service skills as well as managment skills that have helped me with even day to day interactions with others. I am grateful for the experince and would recomened working here if you enjoy helping people fin the things they need to help solve their problem"
good,"At this store the merchandiser is also the delivery driver for commercial customers, so every hour and every day is a little different but with the same routines. Store manager was great, he expect nice work but was nice and flexible. All positions required a certain amount of on-line training weekly so you are constantly using knowledge you already have and learning more. This position is about inventory, organizing, and cleaning. Attention to detail is crucial, and being able to read and execute a planogram is necessary."
good,Oreilly auto parts ensures that you have all the training you need to complete your job. They do everything in their power to hold a lasting relationship with their employees.
good,O'Reilly's is corporate ran but had a feeling of family. Most of those in management were there for years and even retired from it. a typical day was very busy as with most part stores. I learned a lot of my leadership and management skills from this job. The hardest part was finding good employees that would stick around. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers that would come in from all walks of life.
good,"Arriving and clocking in is like any average job, but after that it get different for everyone depending on what your job is. As i was a driver, i went out and inspected the vehicles. After the inspections, i started my shift and started making deliveries."
good,"It's an OK job. It's more of a job, if you are retired or a second job. As a merchandiser, I feel as if i will not move up with the company, although, I can do just about everything in the store, except open and close the store."
good,"I love dealing with my customers,  I enjoy being able to help them find what they need, no matter how difficult it may seem to some people. O'Reilly's is a good place to work, if you can handle the pace and dealing with the public."
good,Was always busy but not to the point of it being bad or stressful. Management and co-workers were very friendly and had no issues with getting days off for sickness/doctors
good,"I had a good experience for the most part when I worked here. They are willing to show you how to do everything and understand when you make mistakes. It was very much like entering a small family since they are all so close and that made the experience that much better. "
good,"answering phones, looking up parts with both computer systems and analog systems (books), delivering parts to professional shops, handling money, checking in and counting inventory, facing shelves, working with a small team of like minded people. good people to work with, able to flex a schedule to help meet family needs. great place over all"
good,i enjoyed working for this company very much. great employees and employer. marketing was what i did on a daily bases along with soe times taking parts to shops.
good,Very competitive within its own company unfortunately a lot of Gossip goes around in my experience a lot of disrespectful employees who don't receive reprimand for their verbal actions
good,what I learned is that they value honesty and integrity to get the job done for the customers and the shops they provide parts for. The hardest part of the job is to lift the heaviest rotors on the place to take to the vehicles however if you ask for help they will help you.
good,"My most enjoyable part of the day is, delevering parts to customers to make sure they are taking care of and making sure they don't need any parts taken back that they no longer need."
good,"A typical day is to start with ensure all prior nights orders are pulled, sorted and manifested to start your day. Once the daily cut offs start happening it is fast paced and also going which makes your day fly by. O'Reilly culture is in everything we do from providing great customer service or expense control. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new team members at the stores and developing that special relationship by going that extra mile.The hardest part of the job is traffic and weather delays.We can not control that and sitting in traffic never is fun. My manager gave a lot of support and was very open to new ideas or ways. He was willing to try."
good,"I delivered auto parts to the various auto repair shops around Prineville. If deliveries were slow, I stocked store shelves. I learned a bunch about auto parts. The hardest part of the job was varying work hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job duties."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for this company. Other than the occasional boneheaded customer, it was a relatively stress free environment. Left to pursue a different oppurtunity and promptly regretted it."
good,"It's a great company to work for, provided you fall in line with their ideals of a ""good"" team member. The company provides for great advancement opportunities, and you are always able to grow within the company. They provide good benefits and most of the supervisors and management are great people to work with. There is some hypocrisy in regards to their culture values, and day to day frustrations are numerous with not a lot of relief or remedy. While they respect everyone and have systems in place to show you that they care, there can also be a great level of disrespect toward a person who provides everything but doesn't fall into their ""ideal employee"" category. If you have any type of characteristic, no matter how small, that they don't like things will be rough for you...regardless of the level of skill and knowledge you provide and how hard you work. But, it really is a good company to work for if you want to learn and grow and become something better at the workplace."
good,I would say if one wanted a fairly easy job where you are one to one with customers doing customer service...filling out parts requests and just pretty much enjoying co worker/team player partership...then this is a great job.
good,"Good place to work. But once you get into upper management you can say goodbye to your social life. Most of the time it's fun, but it can get very repetitive."
good,"Was my first job-grew up around cars. Worked here for right under 2 years. I was hired as a minimum wage delivery driver, moved up to 9 and hour on the front counter with retail sales, finished out my O'Reilly journey making 10 an hour as a Merchandising specialist and City Dispatcher. "
good,I only worked here a short time but the time I did spend here was enjoyable. The customers were great and the staff was very helpful. Any questions I had were answered quickly and with patience.
good,"Merchandiser- Shipping & Receiving, delivery driver, customer service, restocking, general cleaning, sales/warranties/returns, phone calls, online orders, inventory control, hazard spill cleanup, online training"
good,As long as you do your job you have no problems. There is a lot of walking. But when available potential to transfer to different departments. Each department have different hours and type of work.
good,Long story short. Minimum wage job. Work isnt back breaking and most supervisors are good people. Its a place for car people for sure. Im only looking to leave because 9$/hr is not paying the bills.
good,Very steady work environment. Loved meeting people and helping them with their automotive needs. Management was very good and always helpful. Hardest part was having to work some holidays but I learned to adjust.
good,it was a good place to work management was cool and good atmosphere if your in to cars and would like to learn about diffrent car parts this is a good place for you to start on the other hand pay isent very great but the benifits are awsome.
good,"Working with oreilly auto parts was a a great learning experience, even though i had automotive experience their was some terms that i was a little rusty on . Great place to work if u love vehicles"
good,Good place to work.  Management and co-workers make it a pleasure to work there.  If you love being in customer service and have a strong love for automobile then O'Reillys is a good place to begin.
good,Have only been here for 2 months and started as a driver and now im being cross trained on the front counter. Definitely moving up fast. I still enjoy this job and am happy to be working with such a caring company.
good,They strive for consistency in truck release times. Loaders good at securing pallets.  Night dispatch crew are the best at helping you solve concerns during shift
good,Easy and fun place to work but must have some knowledge of the automotive industry to succeed and advance. Management is fair and understanding of their employees
good,"Busy the whole time I was there, started a small shop to help keep my bills paid ended up needing to find someone to run the shop. So I could focus on o`reilly."
good,A typical day consists of putting stock away and providing good customer service and make sure you have good sale numbers and sell related parts and stay current with your training.
good,"Day traffic pretty much stay steady."
good,The workplace was close to home and pay rate as well with benefits were excellent. Was quite challenging at the beginning but helped me improve my work ethic.
good,"Since my employment here a typical day is always exciting My co-workers or should I say extended family are great. Being that it deals with sales , the hardest part of the job will be low company sales which means shorter work days. The most enjoyable part is being there."
good,"I worked in auto parts while I was taking welding classes"
good,I worked there for a year and a half. Put in as much effort as I could and was rewarded for it with a commission check and a promotion eventually. Have a strong work ethic and be able to put up with some unhappy employees and you will be fine.
good,"I liked it at the Warehouse. The early morning hours were something I had to get used to, but in the long run, it's worth the trade-off. Great people and an understanding manager."
good,Lots of opportunity to move up in the company. Bad thing is you are very replaceable and treated as such. Great environment to meet new people and help them get the job done.
good,"I start the day by getting my lane ready to sort stack wrap and load the days shipment."
good,"A typical day would consist of me depositing the money from the previous at the bank, typing up part orders from local shops and delivering the parts to the shops.  I would also help customers figure out what check engine light code their vehicle had and what could be the possible problem and solution. In addition to selling parts to commercial accounts/shops, I would sell all different kinds of parts to regular customers I would help them install certain parts like headlight bulbs, batteries, and wiper blades.  Towards closing time I would empty out all the cash register tills, add up all the money from the cash sales, enter it to the computer system, and then prepare it to be deposited the next day and secure it in the store safe.  When closed at the end of our shifts I would shut down all the computers/registers, have everyone clock-out, review and approve employee hours of the day for pay-roll, and enter in all sales totals: cash, check, credit/debit, into the computer system. Once all that was completed I would lock all the doors, turn the lights off, set the security system alarm and I would be the last one to leave locking the door behind me."
good,"It was a laid back kind of job until customers came in all at one time. It was fun though. I liked when it was busy because it gave me work to do. Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of work to do when there wasn't any customers but I liked the interaction with different people on a daily basis."
good,"Stock shelves and put away stock while keeping other employees motivated."
good,"the job was awesome, the employees were awesome and would always work with you on schedules or last minute changes. I just loved everything about the job."
good,Getting to work at 5am and bringing merchandise to the sales floor. The best part about working that early was that you only had to deal with one manager.
good,"I like working there, I  have more hands on experience. And I am becoming more framiliar with all parts."
good,I would start my morning by checking my cash drawer and by making sure that i had all of my utensil's before starting my day. The hardest part was lifting really heavy batteries. I enjoyed helping the customers receive a good experience while being there.
good,A typical day at work was we started off with our daily stretch then we would get assigned our areas to work for the day. I learned how to operate an order picker and how to stock materials in an efficient manner. Had great co-workers to work with. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the stocking procedures. The most enjoyable was operating the orderpicker.
good,"I started out as a parts salesperson and quickly moved up into management leads. Day to day tasks vary in intensity and difficulty. Some days are slow and mostly involve tidying up the store and restocking items; while others are crazy busy with battery installs/wiper installs, and phone calls. The people i work with are very nice and fun to work with. The company as a whole is great to work for, but unless you are in a higher position than assistant manager, there is not much money to be made in it. In my honest opinion, like most other retail jobs, the employees are not properly compensated for experience/ job performance. I'm not saying its a bad place to work, just not a high paying career is all."
good,"I was a parts specialist, I would help customers figure out what they would need. Stock parts and organize planograms. Management was good, the manager was real flexible with my schedule. Co workers great."
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts has been a great company for me to grow with. I have many opportunities, and I have made a lot of friends. The pay is average for the retail industry. I have had both good and bad managers with the company. The company expects a lot from their store managers, and the work/life balance could be better. I work 55 to 65 hours a week. I get three weeks paid vacation a year, but I can typically only take one or two. Previous sales performance does not matter, only here and now. I don't think that is unique to O'Reilly Auto Parts though. I'm sure that attitude is typical of most retail establishments. The hardest part of the job is finding good people."
good,as far as job security you can count on keeping a stable job with this company. Advancement is up to you however
good,"Count parts"
good,"Strongly enjoy the environment, the people, the culture, and the customers. Lot's of room for advancement and great benefits."
good,Oreilly very fast pace job in the wholesale side of it when it gets busy. Always gotta give 100% customer service . Making sure customers dont walk out empty handed.
good,"The corporate structure is based off of the customer and the ""team members"" (employees) are made to cater to every customer individually."
good,"I was only a part time employee, but for the work, they pay fairly reasonable. If full time, they do offer a good benefit package. The atmosphere was great. Friendly employees, and great management. Always showed concern for family life when making schedules. Very clean place to work."
good,"Hours are good, tons of job security, pay and benefits were average, but workplace made up the difference"
good,"I arrive to work everyday, climb the dread three flights to find my world on the top floor. There must be a light or sensor that knows when I'm in my cubicle as the phone starts to ring as I near my desk. My typical day is usually reasonable suspicions, drug testing issues and querys to run reports."
good,"O'Reilly Automotive is probably the most ""laid back"" company I have worked for. During the three years working with them, Micro-managing hasn't been an option from them since I work based in Los Angeles and they are based in Missouri. Everyone is friendly and it's almost like working with family. My days are very variable, I work mostly on the road from event to event, I have office duties on scheduled days by myself, I also have travel days and long days of events from NASCAR, NHRA races to Car Shows and other General Market events. Currently we have 7 additional Marketing reps in my team and they are all amazing to work with, even though we barely see each other because of our different regions all over the nation. During my time working with O'Reilly I believe the hardest has been establishing a settled and stable life, considering all the travel, the most enjoyable? Know that you are doing a great job, get great feedback from all the people I work with and definitely the travel, you can truly ask me how to get wherever you want to go in the West Coast! I guarantee that!."
good,"I worked at store #533 in Dallas, Texas. I started off as a cashier then moved to a service specialist installer, then to a shift manager, then to an assistant manager ask with in two years. Great movement through the ranks and pay scale. Met and worked with with some great people along the way."
good,"The O'reilly auto parts company is a great company but has somewhat poor management skills, i was really excited in the beginning but after a couple management changes things went down hill even when i became a store manager i did not receive the training i required and was promised."
good,Always had same route & enjoyed the people I met daily. Learned how to pull parts needed before making run. Was always available for extra shifts when needed
good,"I enjoyed my time working at O'Reilly's. Throughout my whole time there, management was very flexible as I had a very busy schedule during my time there."
good,"I've learned a lot more about cars and car parts, then when I first started. Customer's, co-workers, and mangement have helped me gain knowledge and experience, it has helped me feel confidant in my skills knowing that I am providing overall good customer service."
good,"Overall orielly auto parts was a fun and exciting place to work, that proved to be challenging at times. A sense of urgency and a strong commitment to the company will allow anyone to excel in the company and advance through the ranks. From delivery drivers to district managers this company has a team orientation you cant find in any other parts store."
good,Great company to start working for to learn about parts for cars and knowing what they do and why. Overall great company and they do have a great culture and explaining how they became who they are today.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is a great place to work for someone who loves automotive work, but does not want to be a mechanic. You get to work with great customers and learn new things about auto parts everyday."
good,I needed more flexibility in my work life to be able to balance my home life and care for a child with disabilities. My current manager (while being fair to any other coworkers) adjusted my hours to suit my needs. That way I would be able to balance both.
good,"Oreilly has a wonderful fun working atmosphere. Iv'e learned a lot about management , production , and sales. It's an easy place to move up in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees and the customers."
good,It a good place to work for. The problems are there are never enough drivers so you end up working longer. Sometimes they keep people that should be let go but they don't because of money so good people leave because they dont want to put up with it which is sad. But over all it is a EASY JOB the only thing that is hard is lifting batteries and some rotors. You are in the truck more than the shop.
good,Customers come in knowing what they need I can help them find what they need I enjoy the interactions with the customers and helping them in every aspect that they need for their vehicle. Working for Oreilly’s is a pleasure due to the fact that you can Interact with the public is a pleasure
good,"It all started amazing and a days work was sp[lit between team members and not stacked all on one or another person. until you get into management it got a lot more difficult in a day. even though I say that its a great company, would recommend to anyone that wants to learn. I don't see the job as something lifelong if you are anything less than commercial manager. only downfall I saw was not so much backing by management in the basis of having enough staff and or ideas by the team that will help grow the company further. also not equal pay and responsibilities thru stores. But overall an amazing company ethics."
good,"Great beginner job for learning parts, on-site training, knowledgeable peers, good benefits, 401k offered, training rewards, not very stressful work. "
good,"At O'reilly's I'd say its more of a hit or miss. Really depends on the team work situation. But if you just get your job done you'll be fine! Works great, pretty easy going."
good,Learn how to install batteries and wiper blades. And also you learn about different parts for certain make model and year vehicle the work place is a great environment to be around with great customer service
good,"I had fun and compared to other jobs this was by far the easiest as a driver. Easy routes, friendly staff at every store, highly recommend company.Keep in mind you still have to do your part."
good,I really enjoyed my job working with public.... i would answer phones and place orders .. cash resgisters and planograms and resetting the store rearranging inventory and stock
good,I always enjoyed working at Oreilly Auto Parts. The day to day change of selling parts and putting away stock orders were needed to present different daily goals. It’s always good to connect with other car people.
good,I work there and it was ok good pay and great team. Great job for part-time and good benefits I would recommend this job for some who wants to work part-time with decent pay
good,"Always something to do even in your downtime, great atmosphere and fun coworkers. You're not restricted to just the store, making visits to other stores in and out of state."
good,"This was my first real job after high school.  A typical day would include customer sales, custom orders if a customer had a special request, inventory management.  Management was very understanding of the employees needs and approachable.  The workplace culture was great for a first job for anyone.  I learned important customer relations while working here.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult automotive parts inquiries from customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment with the team members."
good,"The management was really professional, I was a parts manager when I worked with them. Great prices, environment, especially at the South Haven, MI store."
good,As a merchandiser my duties intel  scanning in merchandise that is reserved from the D.C. the night before. After scanning in everything my next step is to put all the merchandise on the shelves. Once that is all finished I then do a walk through of the store and looking for products or ales that need to be counted or front faced.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was a friendly staff and I enjoyed the work pace of the job. I enjoyed the gits also. Management was nice also
good,long work days with lots of overtime. fast pace environment. standing on feet all day and lifting lots of heavy items. Lots of co- workers from all types of back grounds.
good,"O'Reillys is a great company to work for, for people who enjoy the automotive field. I made many friendships, as well as connected with people all around the Tulsa area who share the same passion as me. The only issue I had through out the years I spent working for the company was the politics and favoritism the played a role in the upper management positions."
good,"-Ask to find out what's needed that day, that time."
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts has a awesome work culture.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was being able to help people in need of auto parts experience
good,"This job was a blast. I learned how to special order custom or hard to find auto parts. I was a customer service rep, closing manager and a inventory clerk. The management team was great easy to work with as well as my coworkers. The hardest part of this job was the cycle counts that were done every month. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers find what they were looking for and helping them finishing any projects that they were working on."
good,"A typical day at Oreilly's for me is answering phones, greeting customers, checking in freight, bank deposit and change order, and delivering parts to commercial customers. I learned that Oreilly's is really big on customer service which i really like. I also learned how different parts functions. My management team lives eat and breathes the oreilly's culture. My co-workers are cool and down to earth very big on customer service as well. The hardest part of the job  is not be able to get the part or item the customers need, it disappoints me. The most enjoyable part of the job is be able to see the customer happy with the right parts for their car."
good,"O'reilly Auto Parts is a great company to work for. Very challenging when meeting your sales mark keeping up with parts, and dealing with those wonderful customers. All in all I enjoyed working for them Kept me busy at all times with being a parts specialist and training safety coordinator."
good,a fun and exciting place to work. Meeting new employee daily and learning more about the company on a day to day basic is great experience for future career advancement.
good,"Before becoming an employee at O'Reilly Auto Parts, I had always purchased parts there, and for one reason alone; the employees. Yes, Advanced Auto and Auto Zone have good people, but the employees with O'Reilly have always, somehow, been 'better'. And it's for that fact alone that I wanted, and received the opportunity for, a job at O'Reilly Auto Parts."
good,Will help you get on your feet and teach you skills that can help you at work and also acquire life skills to live well and healthier provides sick days and leave of absence in hard times long-term company
good,Working for Oreilly’s was a good experience. I was paid well for my Warehouse supervisor position and the benefits and schedule were outstanding. The company stock purchase plan is a great offer for the employees. This is a strong dependable company to work for. The growth opportunity is there and especially if you can relocate.
good,"Good company. They take care of the employees. They have luncheons and company picnics every year. "
good,Working at O'Reilly auto parts was fun and rewarding. I learned a ton about cars and about great customer service. Everyday is different because you have people coming in with car problems and each time you learn something new while helping people get back on the road.
good,Its a great place to work. Loved seeing familiar faces company takes great pride in their culture and mission. The hardest part of the job is when you get upset customers.
good,"This was a good place to work I would recommend it to anyone. The people and management are good people. Very knowledgeable and  easy to get along with, great positive work environment."
good,"Working at O'Reilly's was a great experience and I would recommend it to someone else. The TEAM always helped one another with picking tickets, or trying to get the routes out on time."
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure each customer receives  the highest level of satisfaction whith their shopping experience. Customers are what keep businesses up and running and making them most imporant is the key to success.
good,"Working in the warehouse first shift: starts at 5am and the ending hours vary. Sometimes you get off at 11:30 -12:30 sometimes no later than 4:30pm. As a Material handler/ Order processor, you use the Talkman Vocollect headset that tells you what products to pick from the shelf and which tote to put it in. When finished you send the tote down the line on the conveyor belt for the shipping and receiving department to load onto the trucks. I have learned that this is an easy job, but hard work. I know what is like now to work in a fast pace environment. There are three very important things that they are serious about - Productivity (you must move very fast!), accuracy ( you must pick the right products and put it in the right tote) and finally, attendance is very important you must show up on time for work. Management is great. Everyone is very nice, very helpful and team oriented. Co - workers are helpful and very nice. I haven't had any problems with them. The hardest part for me is getting my productivity up while maintaining my accuracy. Although I am still in training, I am trying my very best. The most enjoyable part is that the hours are great and you get your weekends off."
good,"Management team was amazing team organisation. "
good,it was hard work but it also made you stronger I didn't know nothing about cars before working there but I know a lot now. it becomes easy everyday you learn something new.
good,"I really enjoy working with people and the public, My first love has always been cooking. Auto Part is mostly a mans field of work.I enjoy my job but would like to return to what i like best. I learned that you can do a man's job and do things you thought you would never do {change batteries}, lift heavy parts and have the knowledge to do the job right. The hardest part of the job is making sure my inventory is correct and my prices are always right. But at the end of the day the most enjoyable part of my job is the people i meet, and having a satisfied customer, that will return ... thats what its all about making people happy."
good,I gained parts and vehicle knowledge everyday working at Oreilly's. Management was not to great though. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers but the easiest was working shipment.
good,"I was able to learn alot at this job. i went in to this job not knowing anything about the automotive field, now i can honestly say this is where I got my start. i work my way up in this job pretty fast and was proud of what i had accomplished here. I was given alot of opportunity here and an greatful. I really liked the people here and management was very helpfull, I even learned how to drive a standard shift while working. The hardest part of the job was the mental part when i learned how to do commercial sales, but i really enjoyed the work.,"
good,"Print reports, count deposit, make to do list for myself and team members   I learned what it takes to run profitable business by applying the guidelines set by the company. O'Reilly's  has a strong culture P.S.P Stands for Parts ,Service,People. There really was not anything hard, you get into a routine that needs to be daily. Helping customers, making sure they have an enjoyable experience. Customer Service is the key."
good,"I like what i do. just want to further my career. Like working with our manager, great person. Our work cultures are everyday curtisy. the hardest part of my day is trying to find thing that arent  put away right. I learn new things all the time. I ask questions about thinks i dont know. I like to figure thing out."
good,Been at O'Reillys for almost a year I'm a full time driver I like my job a lot I just drive and listen to the radio most of the day and put stock up. I wouldn't say it's the hardest job but it's not the easiest one my manager is super chill and understanding he runs the store like it's his pride and joy which is really awesome. He makes sure we are ok and that if we have any problems with family or our health to come to him and makes sure we can get the time off also job security is great after your 90day probation healthcare and all that comes quick. But ya not a bad place or people to work for but thats my store idk about other stores if they are bad or good to work for.
good,"The job was overall relatively decent. The only unfortunate quality was the fact the job was only part time. If it were full time, chances are I'd still be working there. Definitely enjoyed the experience I gained."
good,very busy sometimes but loved it and loved automobile parts. Helped customers out when they needed help and checked them out and cleaned up the store which i love things neat and clean.
good,No complaints about working here. Overall its.  Not that bad. Get great discounts rates. Downfall about the discount is its only for your vehicle only.
good,The work environment here is very stressful and full of ridiculous drama. Management is awful and does nothing to resolve conflicts in the work place.
good,The best part of working at Oreillys is the customers you become friends with the different mechanic shops that your store deals with. Management was hard to get help from. They do help you learn more about parts and how to diagnose vehicle issues.
good,Should get paid more. For driving back and forth from St Cloud to Orlando was a little dangerous for only getting paid $8.25 an hour. Great place to work in.
good,"Good company, like helping customers with any problem that arose. Enjoyed the atmosphere of the work environment. Only had an issue with the bad schedule"
good,my time at oreilys was ok though the store i worked at was a bit shotty with stealing customers i was submerged in severe workplace drama
good,Productive and stressful work place. Customer Friendly and employees friendly. Only Hire Part Time for 22 Hours a week. Enjoyed Delivery Parts To Customers. The Hardest Part Of Job Was No GPS In Trucks
good,Like to deliver to all the local companies meet a lot of nice people easy going customers first then big I do is take fastrack quizás than go outside n do a check up on my truck for dents scratches check pressure on tires check fluids n so on
good,Poor management no consistency within the company I’ve worked here 3 months and have had 3 different management and two different district managers would love more consistency
good,"I have no work life balance at this job, I most times work 6 days a week with a check gone soon after payday. I am a hard worker and I deserve better pay and better hours."
good,I lover my job here.  Sometimes I have to ask questions because I don't know all the car knowledge and the guys get frustrated.  Fast track is a very helpful learning tool that O'Reilly require us to answer daily questions .
good,I enjoyed working at oreillys unfortunately was in an accident and didn’t have the transportation to open the new store so I had my hours cut to nothing
good,not a bad company to work for. Just the manager at my store showed a lot of favoritism . he always had his employees come in early so he can leave early. Being salary had its benefits and he took advantage of them and his employees
good,Very fun and laid back place to work.  Pay was not so great and took forever to get a 50 cent raise.  Need something with more money.  Didn't really learn anything new considering I am already very mechanically inclined.  I was raised by mechanics.
good,one of the best places ive worked at until i was fired for not having relations with the manager. The End
good,This job is horrible. well depending who you are working for. I moved from the Austin areas to San Antonio and there is a big disconnect of job culture. the have a lot of learning to do from the way the business runs to the way customer service is given.
good,A typical day at Oreilly's I was Assisting people with their basic car needs as well as 18 wheeler needs. Would go around the counter to assist the needs of the customer and helped them make a good selection of item.
good,"The Job was easy for the most part. I loved it, and the people I worked with. The only problem I had was management wasn't moving at a steady pace for advancing me into management."
good,"its a Great enviroment but he pay just isn't good enough, great job to have if going to school"
good,fairly easy job on all positions . no knowledge really needed just be able to use a computer and remember the isles. 1 pro is that with the costumers u get u can usually learn something from them
good,it was a fun place to work. but some of the customers we delivered to were not really easy going. they were almost all rude and some were racist. i wouldn't go back there.
good,I met a lot of great people and poor managament my dm hated me for some reason causing my manager to stress i had a 40000 dollar goal for pne month and almost made it i did great and never took from this company
good,I worked for oreilly for not even a year and got switched locations and made hub manager. You have to be quick on your feet. Have to be willing to be patient
good,This is a very fast paced atmosphere or a very slow atmosphere.  The management is wonderful to work for however there is very few  full time people.  The normal day is only about 6 to 7 hours a day with no more than 3 days per week of employment.  The job requires you to drive and stay focused on your time as well as your driving.
good,"its an ok place to work for the team is awesome and at an executive level the company is great and has a good business culture but the upper management (regional and above) lose the culture and goal, they have their own agenda in mind and run the staff as they please not keeping in mind the companies goals or motto."
good,loved working their but could not afforded to keep my job and pay bills and have fun all at the same time. they have many chances to better your learning with the company. work days where long and fun we did everything stocking and returns to selling parts and delivering parts to costumers.
good,A typical day at work would start off with unloading the daily truck and unloading all the merchandise. I learned a lot about cars that I didn't know before such as car parts and their functions.
good,"A typical day was putting away the shipment of parts sold the day before, waiting on customers, installing wiper blades and replacing bad vehicle batteries. I learned how to order parts,not stocked, from other O'Reilly facilities and suppliers. In addition, learned how to check in shipments with a scanner, and to prepare electrical core sand batteries to be returned to rebuilders. ( The store I worked at, wasn't a place for people who are hard workers! ) The hardest part of the job was keeping certain employees from butting in front of my customers, The most enjoyable part of the job, was going beyond expectations of my manager to do things that no one else would do, such as reorganize the stock, move inventory to make it easy to find, organize the over-stock, and clean floors, bathrooms and onder the shelves."
good,It was good but people was not compatible of working together as a team. It was all good it was mainly well until they had a lot of people come in and they didn’t want to help each other
good,I enjoyed working at O'reilly's. it was great delivering to different customers was different and nice. It was great until my manager started acting different and funny.
good,Pay is main problem not willing to pay for expierence hiring green employees at cheap wages upper management shows little appreciation for hard work or expierence
good,"This was a pretty fun job, but they did not give many hours. I learned a lot, and the people there knew what they were talking about for the most part."
good,Honestly loved everything about this job. It was a laid back fun place to work. Co workers were fun and always got along. My only complaint was the old manager they recently let go.
good,It’s a good place to work. But I know I have something better for my future and hopefully I’ll find a good paying job that’s better. Love my customers. Just want something more.
good,"I would deliver auto parts to a number of mechanics, I learned some about auto parts, hardest part of the job was slow paced and would get sent home if no deliveries"
good,This was a great place to work. Unfortunately I ended up leaving to pursue full time employment. I loved being able to have a say in scheduled hours and getting overtime as needed.
good,Depending on what store that you work for you can go further within the company. I loved working with the patrons and helping them find what they needed.
good,You will learn more about cars here than you can expect. They will train you with easy to understand systems that will ensure you are very knowledgeable about what you say to customers about their cars.
good,"Great company to work for and have benefits, having good personality skills is a plus. If you need flexible hours this is the job for you, that work with you and come up with a plan for success"
good,Great place to work and move up in the company. They work around school. Holiday pay and full benefits. Professional work environment. For those who enjoy customer service.
good,I enjoyed working at O'Reilly's.  I felt challenged daily.  There's alot of resources available for you to use to help customers.  With going training.
good,"It’s been an amazing journey there I’ve learned so much through out the years with the company, and I’ve grown as an individual. I have plenty of customer service experience. As well as sales experience. With that being said I need something more. I’m seeking for something that will match my pay with my work ethic."
good,This was just another place in castroville that I worked while in school. Management was horrible due to the lack of leadership and knowledge of the job.
good,I enjoyed my job here it was a new Lou for me I had never worked with parts before but I took a leap of faith and went for it and loved it meeting new people daily was a success
good,"Productive good management, very good environment,fun workplace with flexibility in hours and very good the work atmosphere, everybody always helping each other"
good,It was a great place to work there great people and a great environment fast place Always on time with the deliveries manager was always there to help you out if there was a problem And he’s always there to help you improve your career
good,I really like working there i get to learn a lot of things about cars and the parts a car has. I enjoy learning more about cars because thats one of the things that interests me a lot.
good,Its a great place to work at I loved it. I will be back there soon as I can. Loved it people was nice n made you feel welcomed. The job was worth the money. Time was great. Off on time to do whatever you needed to do. An my fav was off on the weekend n holidays
good,Loved working there. Had the best deals. Was always nice to people and enjoyed helping people. They always worked the everyone and found the right part that the customers wanted.
good,"The job was as expected, the manager was not.  It’s to bad that employees have been in store so long because they like their job and company bennies are good for them, then comes along manager from——, they are afraid to say anything so they just take her poor management."
good,"Good entry level position, driving is ok for this company. It felt like the drivers get a lot of pressure to ensure relationships with shops, and the lifting requirements are a lot more than the minimum requirements."
good,Enjoyed the job. I liked helping the customers and most of the teammates were really helpful to me when I was new. Only left this job due to scheduling conflicts that couldn't be overcome.
good,"O'Reilly's Auto parts is a great place to work. I had no retail experience but I did have automotive experience."
good,"I sell auto parts and i am a closing and opening manager. I am in entry level management for the store and, i am also their main bilingual specialist."
good,Great place to earn experience but not good on pays. Great bonding with commercial accounts and retail customer. Parts price are acceptable and long lasting.
good,O'Reilly is a really good company to work for. I have liked the company and the people I work with. It helps to have automotive experience working at a parts store.
good,At this company if you have the drive and the willingness to learn you can start on the counter as a new hire and go to the top in 10-15 years. That seems like a long time but where else can you say that. Most people can work at a company for 30 yrs and never make it to low level management. Or you can work at O’reillys for 5 years and make it to manager and stay there at the store level and make good living and have better than average benefits.
good,"Oreilly auto parts was a great job. Good management who cared, and great work life. A good amount of job advancement for those who strive to  go up in the company."
good,"I am drawing from experience from almost a decade ago. My time at O'Rielly was fairly enjoyable. Performance based monthly bonus, good discount on products, and decent benefits from what I remember. There were a couple management issues that was ultimately the reason I left but later felt I should have stuck with this company."
good,"Great company, Other coworkers made it harder to catch on to the way of doing things everyone was to there selfs and not willing to teach me the way of there operations"
good,"A typical work day consisted of putting parts away, answering phone calls and locating the proper part for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was my regular customers."
good,the system was flawed a bit but we got it done we did our very best to satisfy every customer and manage all of their needs so they are a returning customer
good,By far the best company I’ve ever worked for vacation time paid holidays organized and mostly individual who know how to do their job. Friendly atmosphere
good,I enjoyed working with the people. Being able to help them find the right parts or tools to fix their vehicles. I did a variety of tasks while working anything from putting freight away to keeping the store clean. My old manager was supportive of my trying to improve my work performance in order to move up with in the company.
good,"I was given the responsibility to handle all aspect of Customer Service, including Point of Sale/Cash Register, and learned how to make the customer experience as positive as possible.  I also enjoyed working directly with the customers and solving their problems,"
good,Es buen ambiente referente a los companeros lo malo es que te empiesan part time y se tardan en promoberte a full time
good,"Great company to work for, some areas need improvement and a better look at what is actually going on. The company is growing faster then they are prepared for and some of their Culture Values get lost in the rush."
good,"Until I worked at the last store, Eden NC, I worked with wonderful people; we treated each other like family and we worked as a team. A typical day was pretty easy; I stocked the shelves, answered phones, ordered parts, and helped customers. I also checked batteries/alternators/starters, installed wiper blades and changed batteries in vehicles. I enjoyed my job a great deal until I worked in my last store at which time I quit after a month of being there."
good,"Working here part time, it was a great place to get in do your time for some money and go home. As long as you are a fast learner, and a fast mover this job will work for you."
good,Oreilly’ Auto Parts gave me a great experience. Company that actually invest in people & want to see them grow. They will give you all the tools & skills needed to be successful.
good,I was able to develop a rapport with all of my coworkers. There were many aspects to the job that aided in my experience as a delivery driver. I learned a lot from my first manager at Oreillys.
good,Fun place to work with a lot of opportunities to learn from experience. Little advancement in my store and raises were almost non existent. Good for young people but not for a career
good,"A typical day at work consisted of counting registers and getting ready for the day. "
good,I loved working at O'Reilly is was an awesome environment to work in. Everyone worked as a team. If someone was struggling everyone rallied around them to help.
good,"work less"
good,Great company to work for. I just needed a full time job once i graduated from high school because I had more time on my hands and i wasn't making enough hours. overall good job with even better discounts
good,Overall enjoyable place to work. Upper management was lack luster but the store manager was great and very understanding about any life issues. Was not a stressful environment work in.
good,Super fun environment to work at. You get to learn a lot about parts and what symptoms could tell you about what could be wrong with a car based on customers’ experience
good,"O'Reilly's is a great place to work ,the people who come in have a problem and it is up to the sales men if they can fix the problem or not. It gives you satisfaction when you can help someone with an problem and they didn't have to pay a whole lot. The price matching era is one of the best programs ever to come along because customers don't always  have the exact amount and when they don't the price match comes into play.  Customer satisfaction goes a long way."
good,"This was an amazing job. Low pay and hours aside, you got to drive and get out of the building where you worked as a driver. It was always a chance to drive around delivering parts as you listened to the music you liked and just get out of the stockroom."
good,It is a fun job and has flexible hours for going to school. My coworkers where fun to work with and the manager was fair and understanding of everyone's needs
good,i learned so much working with the parts and its something i enjoy now and would like to do again but i dont want to drive for parts again. i like the people part of the job
good,"It is a easy job I was still part time and asked for more hours. But no. I learned about customer service,putting up stock,answering the phone. being versatile in your job as a driver and counter person. But they dont pay u enough to survive on. No raises or advancement."
good,A typical work day was to hel customers get the parts that they need for there vehicles. Management was ok I guess when it came to asking for help and the crew members were always their if you needed help
good,i loved working with awesome people every day made lifetime friends learning new things meeting our customers and helping the customers who walked in.
good,Working here was one of the best places ive ever worked. It truly is like one big family. everyone always looks out for one another and all of out sister stores are filled with people that we all care about. Working at Oreilly was not only fun but it was also easy. Everyone had such a great time working together.
good,"O'Reilly's was a fun and different place to work. However, this was just a job and there was no room for advancement. The days varied between being slow to being very busy which depended on the time. The management got fired for stealing money and my friend and I got relocated with no questions asked to a different store an hour away. The hardest part of the job was picking up really heavy items and proving to customers I knew what I was talking about and taking sexist comments from customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with my friend."
good,"great place to learn about automotive 40 PLUS WORK WEEK = If you know what you are doing, management allows you to explore changes that will allow you and your team to work more efficiently. Cons. Does not pay enough. Salaried employees end up working 50+ hours a week. The subsidiaries control the parent company, instead of the other way around"
good,"I really liked working here and I think you would to if you try you would enjoy it if you tried it as long as you or willing to learn, new things I learned a lot about vehicles the pay is pretty if it wasn't for my weight bearing I would love to go back I just hate the driving points"
good,"I have worked in a variety of parts stores and was happy to see that the chain of command at this company was filled with former ""parts guys"". They go above and beyond to give you what you need to succeed and if you work hard and do what is expected you will do very well with the company,"
good,"I enjoyed working at O'Reilly Auto Parts. Pace was quick and time flew by.Bob was an Excellent manager.Vehicles were maintain properly. There was good team work.I received a bonus each month based on sales,good discounts all all parts bought."
good,It was an ok place to work until I passed out and was only aloud to do local deliveries. They put me in a vehicle for a 3 hour round trip twice a day.
good,some people have more flexibility in being able to work certain hours and others don't and at this location it seems like no one really has an option we just have to do the hours we are given whether we have that availability or not.
good,Hours go by fast. The pay is good for the amount of work. The other sales associates are more like friends hanging out together and the people that come in are generally friendly unless they are in a bind with their car troubles.
good,"Great company, you really learn a lot if you work in one of the stores. I worked here while I was going to school for mechanical engineering and never stopped learning."
good,Great place to work and shop. I love the open atmosphere and learning the jobs was handled well by the management team. Plenty of incentives to keep an employee interested in learning the job.
good,"Lead management is frequently rotated to different stores, but as long as you get along with people, can work with data systems and are comfortable being on your feet, this is a great job with the opportunity to help people."
good,Is good. Lots of room to grow and learn new things. I personally knew almost nothing about car but since working there I have learned so much in the last 6 months working there.
good,"Good hours, People friendly work place. Always something to do there. You get to be outside and inside. I got to learn new things about car parts. Opens your eyes about how many car parts and accessories there are."
good,I worked there part time selling automotive parts. I worked the counter and delivered parts. The best part of the job was seeing the customer being satisfied by selling them the right part.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts work environment requires all team members to listen to their customers and provide the best customer service. It also requires strict attention to details and problem solving skills.
good,was fun to work at until we got a new boss that was out to get me had to walk and work on egshells which is no way to work was happy when the boss wasnt there
good,Good place to work with lots of good people. They were very flexible working around my school schedule. I gained valuable experience working in a office setting.
good,"Oreily distribution center was a great place to work at because everyone there was friendly and kind since day one. It was a very active job which i really enjoyed and most of all, all the work i did was always presented on a computer screen so i always knew how much work i had ahead of me for the day."
good,loved working here. i learned something new everyday. and really grew my customer service experience i would recommend a job with O'Reilly to anyone with automotive experience.
good,"I've learned a great deal about customer service while working here, including how to handle unhappy customers. I have learned a lot about automotive parts."
good,"A typical day at work was spent identifying, locating, and selling proper car parts to customers.  I learned additional information about vehicles, as well as job practices and guidelines in the corporate work.  The hardest part of the job was the daily rushes, when many people got off work and stopped by to pick up parts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers identify products or solutions that could be applied to their vehicles to make them function properly."
good,i loaded and unloaded trucks. i filled orders. i took orders. i sent things thru UPS. i used the forklift often. i also stocked freight.
good,O'reilly is a good place to work if you have any kind of automotive experience that's going to school. You can move up while you are there but it could take years to do so.

good,I enjoyed working for Oreilly. The peoples are at Oreilly are awesome to work with.
good,a typicall day was 7-3:30 mon-fri. I ran the installer counter and delt with mostly dealer customers. I learned alot about mixing paint and going out to the customers shops and meeting with them face to face in there shop. The team was fun to work with and the only reason i left this job was to make more money. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the phone calls durring the real busy times. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the people.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was a lot of work going through the transition from Schucks to O'Reillys...but in the end, it was well worth it!"
good,I worked with the customers and helped with things that needed to be ordered or rung up at the register
good,O'Reilly was a great job with decent pay for me being a student but not enough to live off of. Everything was smooth until we got a new manager and i didn't like the way he managed so I left.
good,I was able to go out side and help customers with there cars and interact with people i liked working with most of the employees and i was able to diliver parts
good,good place to work   learned fast needed a job that pays more and a job that could work more around my schedule to   and family needed something more flexible
good,"We are very competitive with other auto stores. Will treat workers better, looking for advancing team members. Will train all workers, always look for new and better ways to create better customer service."
good,"Working at O'Reilly was absolutely awesome while I was there, as I was attending school at the time and they were more than willing to work with me in regards to my school schedule and work schedule being balanced. The pay was fine for the position that I held, and I felt that I received a fair amount of hours. Work was always fast paced, enjoyable, and exciting as I got to interact with new customers on a daily basis. The team at O'Reilly was absolutely outstanding and always worked together exceptionally well to accomplish any tasks needed, and ensure that the customers were having an exceptional experience. Almost all of the team members were very knowledgable in regards to the vehicles that customers were looking for parts for, and were very customer service oriented. I would absolutely suggest working here to someone that is looking for either a short term job, or someone that is looking for a job that will work with them on school hours vs work hours."
good,"Helping customers find automotive parts, Placing orders for customers. Learned information about automobile. Learned how to care for a customers needs. Relaxed and fair management."
good,is a good starting place and can be slow at times. But overall a nice place to work. Supervisors and well spoken and do the best can to accommodate your needs.
good,I really liked this job I moved up quickly became a member of management within 6 months. However the store manager would not allow me any flexibility with hours. I found myself doing more of his work and not getting paid for it
good,manager was in the office all the time I was left to train all staff and run the store. I was happy to do but would have liked to have been paid for the job and recognized as well.
good,The work environment is a very fun atmosphere. Before I started working for the company I did not realize there was so many Automotive Shops in the Troy area. I have learned quit a few country backroad routes while driving for the company.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. Did not make enough money. It is a great job for young people or retired people. Management often cooks lunch for the crew. Willing to work with your schedule to allow for time with the family, when possible."
good,A very great work experience. The is very little time to take any breaks unless it is your lunch break. There are many times when you have to take a later lunch to fill in for people who haven't shown up yet.
good,"This is a fast paced face to face customer service job, your overall knowledge of car parts and basic functions of vehicle systems will give you the upper hand. i worked for oreillys 1 year then i was offered a commercial managers position which i held for 5 years.only reason i left was because my district manager wasn't fair with switching my job title and compensating for my work. My time at oreillys was basically managing daily account transactions and maintain monthly account balances. Document/Maintain company delivery vehicles and submit quarterly reports, Also dispatch employees to various shops in surrounding area. Also maintain employee work schedules."
good,The company is a very laid back and fun work environment but the management at my store was a little off key on how to treat their employees and could use a few classes on respect and compassion.
good,Overall good place to work to be able to provide customer service.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with lazy coworkers that pretend that they are busy doing things but are really not doing anything.
good,"Hardest part of my job was dealing with rotten people. I understand you are going to have to deal with those kind of people everywhere, but when you are the only girl standing in front a bunch of mechanics, it can get uncomfortable at times. I learned a lot of things I had not known about before, such as car parts and how to change my oil. My manager was the greatest and he always helped me to achieve my goals for each month. My coworkers were average at times even below average. Kind of depressing but I was always there helping and giving pep talks to those who needed it."
good,"A typical work day consisted of checking in special orders for delivery or customer pick up, stock transfers for surrounding ""O'Reilly"" stores. Delivering parts to professional customers, pulling orders to fill invoices for deliveries. I learned patience and to keep a positive attitude no matter how rude or unprofessional the customers may have been. My co-workers were fairly easy to work with. The job itself wasn't hard, it was a matter of adjusting to different attitudes and atmospheres. The most enjoyable part of the job was building professional relationships with the customers and fellow employees."
good,"I enjoy working at O'Reilly Auto Parts.  The people there are extremely nice and very helpful.  I have learned a lot about car parts, that I did not know.  I have also learned how to check for parts and know what could be wrong with a vehicle.  I also obtained a little knowledge of the Spanish language.  I also assisted retail customers when needed and answered phones when I was able to."
good,"open store in the a.m. worked parts counter, maybe deliver, clean, erect new planograms"
good,O'reilly offers a lot of advancement opportunities for advancement. A typical day at works is roller coaster like my managers are great but your experience may vary the toughest part of the job is multi tasking when the store gets busy all while following the correct procedures. the best part of the job is how thankful the customers are
good,"I feel the most enjoyable part of the job is listening to customers and learning new things on the job daily, it helps the store and ur sales as well."
good,Love working here just cannot make a living on the salary the co workers are amazing and always willing to assist the new comer to the team always available first questions
good,Working for O'reilly Auto parts was a good experience. It was a good experience working with the company because I got to familiarize myself with vehicle parts and where they are located. Eventually I moved up from being just a drive to being a part specialist and that was nice.
good,Well i ended up trasfering from one store to another I loved working at both of them. Was just about to get a promotion. Then i ended up having to move areas.
good,Extremely busy environment with several projects and ongoing maintenance of high visibility categories.  Opportunities for advancement from within the company.
good,The store manager was amazing the the District manager was insensitive and disrespectful. Great co workers. Nice hours to Work. Worked a few weekends.
good,If your a girly girl why loves to have your nails done and have a bad back i don’t recommend this job to you! It was great at first but than i started realizing there was personal preference there & it was starting to get toxic & than the commercial manager started getting disrespectful she made the atmosphere unbearable.
good,"For the most part a great place to work. It's really hard to find people who are willing to work at all in this day and age. Then when you get a few, they seem to spend their time on their cell phones and sitting down instead of doing actual work, which makes it harder on the rest of the crew. "
good,"for my role of 5 years in position the company is great and my District manager is great but the regional manager caused me a lot of problems, has good benefits but you pay for all of them the stock plan is nice and the company seems to really care about the individual employees I do not want to leave the company just the regional manager"
good,This is a chill job perfect for anyone who is straight out of high school or someone looking to retire. You don’t have to worry about productivity checks or anything but you do get a evaluation and if your productivity is high you can get more money.
good,"High management take their role way higher then they should. They are just another company that takes and takes,  but working with the right crew you learn a lot and create a healthy fun positive environment"
good,I liked working at oreillys but it had two jobs at the time and this was my second job and could not handle two jobs. Overall Oreillys is a good place to work at.
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and ongoing. Learn to deal with different personalities and traits. Learn more knowledge on different tools to be used.
good,I loved working their the people where great and fun to work with helped  you with things you didn't know was always their to help you no matter what it was or you're of situation
good,"I loved being an employee at O’reillys, I loved my customers and the culture. There were extenuating circumstances that lead to my leaving, other that that it is a wonderful company."
good,"Its a great fun company to work for but the manager on board is a total deutschbag. I didnt want to leave the company, i actually like my job very much but like i said before the manager is very unproffesional."
good,"All stores operate differently but all have one common goal,  that's to provide customer service to everyone and always greet everyone with a hello or a wave"
good,I enjoyed the time I worked there and I appreciated them working with me if I ever had a problem. Always showed each other respect and always came across great customers.
good,"store manager was horrible"
good,Great company to work for.  Management is differing for store to store.  Very fast paced atmosphere. Friendly staff.  Competitive work place.   Great hours for students and retired workers wanting a few hours to supplement income.
good,"Fun place to work, fast paced , customers where not always to deal with but proper selection of employees helped, great group of people to work with on a daily bases"
good,"Didnt know a lot about car.  But the management should me and taught me a lot about car parts.  The also taught me how to find the items on the computers for the customers.  "
good,"Great job and easy, just lack of employees,  motivation, and better managment. It's very hard to get a fixed schedule and to get days off or any coverage at all."
good,The job task I was assigned was easy. Great respectful people to work with. They congratulate their employees on their jobs. Everyone looks forward to the company picnics. Also the Christmas party is a big event.
good,"Well I have been with oreilly auto parts for almost two years now and the crew I work with is the best. Each one is knowledgeable  in their own ways about their job  and then some have their strengths and weaknesses,we all know each other's strengths to best help the customers with their questions. I'd have to say that the best thing I got from working in this company is hearing the compliments we get on a daily basis about how we are knowledgeable on our job and the parts that we offer."
good,"Have to answer phone calls and help customers. Stock products. "
good,"I go in and check the safe make sure its at 600 cash. Then i do all the paper work, and get all the registers ready to start the day. Also check in that days new stock and inventory. Then i just help out commercial/retail customers till the end of my shift."
good,"The job itself was a good job. I liked what I did."
good,is a good place to start if u know some stuff about cars but management isn't good and most of the guys think thy know everything which sucks would be better if the actually took the time to honor their employees.
good,you dont have to go in knowing much about cars but you will sure come out knowing something i watched staff teach new hiree's so they bettered at the job
good,"A typical day at work is going to warehouse zones attached to you and stocking items craned in front of them."
good,"Its a great place to meet,help, and overall learn anything about buisness. Fast paced and does make the days go by quicker. Great people who care about customer service and quality of service"
good,"very low pay, but we work a lot of over time to cover or get a big check, but they take a lot of taxes from us. they make us cover for other emplayees if they dont show up. and next day we go home early."
good,Great place to work and great people. The wages are fare. As a manager you do work long hours. They do ask a lot out of you as far as all the paperwork as well as sales requirements.
good,I have been employed with O'reilly Auto Parts for 6 and  half months and I can honestly say that I loved working for them. the company is great and my co workers are wonderful. A typical day on the job is nothing but fun and laughter. As a female I have learned so much about cars that I didn't think I will ever learn.There are really no hard parts if you ask me because if you don't know nothing you just ask. when I ask im learning and that's the enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Greet the customers. Look up parts for them, answer the phone,and make the transaction. Stock the and face the shelves and keep the floors clean, and put away parts in the stock room. I learned a lot more of the auto side of parts.The management was good. We worked together to achieve our goals and got along well. Some of my co-workers were hard to get along with but,we worked together well and got the job done. the hardest thing about the job, I thought, was working the late shift. Some of the customers that would come in at that time were sometimes unbearable. I enjoyed serving the customers. Finding their parts and making them happy."
good,Everyday was different because of the problems customers had.  I got to help people fix problems with their cars.  Management had everything running smooth and the people I worked with were good people.
good,When I was working here I did anything from cashier to spending the day putting freight away. That was my favorite day. I always had fun after and always looked forward to going to work after school.
good,"As long as you do your job they leave you alone. Benefits are okay, management can be rocky depending your department."
good,"I really loved the people and the job, it was a great experience."
good,Solid Franchise with a Stable work Environment.  Must learn quickly to work in this fast paced environment
good,"Typical warehouse work easy an fun if u like to get dirty, fair management, learned very little I was a well polished worker before I arrived there but I learned a few interpersonal skills"
good,the company was good to work for had great benefits and paid well my co-workers were fun and enjoyable to work with
good,Overall it was a good job however management did not in many cases follow up on certain important delivery issues that I encountered during my tenure there which in many cases I had to make my own judgment call and had to explain later.
good,"enjoyable part about oriellys was working with different people and meeting them and how friendly people can really be....."
good,i enjoyed almost everyday i worked for oreilly's. even on extremely busy days i would take pride in the fact the costumers would wait for my help an experience/knowledge and advice. i always tried to be understanding an compassionate to customer problems an complaints.
good,"A typical day at work is many daily tasks to complish. Assisting customers; retail and commerical, doing returns, checking in orders, scanning in the truck(which is were inventory is scanned in to the store by scanning each product invidually), answering the phones my the three ring, offering to the customer the right information, right part, finding the part that is hard to find, finding that part the customer has no idea what it is called, offering the lowest prices and warranty, offering to the customer everything they may need to the job right the first time, making sure the team members are doing things right and if not address what is needed(management), getting my commerical customers the right parts the first time and as soon as possible, making sure they get their parts quickly as possible, SALE, SALE, try to understand anything the customers throw my way.I have learned that the customer is always right. So, try to understand what they are addressing to you when they are addressing it. The hardest part of my job is trying to make sure everyone is happy. Making sure that the walk in customers are happy, commercial, and customers on the phone.The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know I am doing something right. When I find that part that no one else could find and making my job fun to be at work. When you make your job fun it can be enjoyed. Also, when I make my customers smile it is a very enjoyable part of my job."
good,"fun job, learn automotive parts hands on easy job working with others working on cars"
good,Good job just can’t make a living with the pay and I don’t see a pay raise coming in the future hours were also okay but not what I was told when starting the job
good,I would have to say my favorite job ever!!!! Loved working at the location I was at! Coworkers were great management was great... all around best place to work!
good,It's a good company to work for but it's not the best. It has its issues mainly the pay and the incentives pay is very poor also if you work full time expect to have ot.
good,"It was a great place to work fun environment if you're into cars, after my store manager left to help another store they brought in a new store manager who was inexperienced and demanding. productivity went down, stress at the store rose substantially, and the staff left weekly/biweekly after a month or so"
good,A typical work day is very fast pace i had to learn a lot about cars and trucks and what kind of parts went where and my boss was really good about letting us off if we had something come up and work the hours we missed but the culture of working there was pretty intense only because I was a woman working in a mans job and the most enjoyable part was just learning so much about putting a car together and learning about all the parts.
good,no manager at this store. Store operates off of assistant managers. No accountiably for actions. Employees come in went they want to. Nobody in store to hold employees for wrong doing.
good,"Good job for young people learning in the automotive industry, however there's a quick turn around and there's a weekly goal to be met on sales if not met bye bye job.."
good,the work is easy. I never have a problem when it comes to knowing my responsibilities. Scheduling kind of gets in the way with my personal life some times.
good,too many hrs/ no enough time off for family had to work ever weekend and most holidays. I enjoyed helping customers find the parts they needed to do the job right.
good,I loved the store and the workers at the store. However the opportunity for moving up was not much and the pay and benifits isn't good. Be prepared to work in any weather conditions.
good,"customer service, inventory, parts ordering, receiving, friendly, computer operating system, stocking, parts look up in both computer and books, clean and organized work area"
good,"I really like working at O'Reilly's. Despite being retail, I learn new things EVERY DAY! I just wish that it paid more. I would be interested in advancement, but that would mean working weekends, including Sundays. That is my one gripe about this business. I honestly don't see how it is worth it to be open on Sundays. "
good,it helps younger teens learn the parts and names and the function that in witch they do and the local people around on there cars/trucks and customer service
good,"It's a great company, a good job to have and learn more as a sales associate dealing with customers multitasking with them calls and computers at the same time be ready for a rush here and there over all really good to better your skills."
good,"Typical day"
good,You are properly taught the correct way to look up correct parts for the customer. Great place to learn about car parts and how they work. Manager was my favorite but the management about him was scattered and doesn't communicate with each other.
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasionally bad customer and the most enjoyable part of the job was the cohesion with the people that worked there and the good customers that respected you on the daily job.
good,It's a good job and you're able to move up the company if you want to. There's a lot to learn and the discount is really good and comes in handy. There are several departments with different start and ending times.
good,I like working at Oreilly auto parts with my coworkers just wished that it would be better with pay and stuff like that. I wished that the upper management would like to help us lower management and see if we need help to learn things or what not
good,For the time iwas there i enjoyed it. Was alot easier than i expected. Daily routes and flexible shedule. Company vehicle with a gas card. They provide you with a company shirt with a patch after your 60 day probation.
good,"It was poor management and  favoritism when I was there over all great place to work, specially if ur just looking for a part time job because ur going to school or etc . You learn a lot from co workers"
good,"Clock in at scheduled time, grab parts to be deliveries, if no parts are on the shelf, do overstock report, clean, stock selves, or ring people out. Also answering the phone."
good,"A great place to work for, not the place you'd work at if you were looking to make good money, there is great chance for advancement though. There is chance for self improvement, taught myself 100 hours of training for sales and auto parts within a month. Management doesn't always hold themselves to what they say they are going to do and if you're looking for a job that will have your back even when you work really hard this is not the place for you. You work for the company only and they will compensate you to how they see fit even if it isn't much at all. Would give a 3 and 1/2 star rating if the site would let me."
good,"Interaction with many customers. "
good,The job allowed employees like myself to greet and meet many new customers. Which allows relationship and growth towards business activities. Everyday something I had learn something new to help my service.
good,"Working for o'reilly auto parts taught me a lot more about what I needed to know about my job. It's a fun, easygoing and friendly place to work. Management is very professional and easy to work around your schedule."
good,"very good place to work at. great culture happy employees. deliver parts to shops. clean delivery trucks , stock store ,clean store good place to work at."
good,Its been great working there just not enough hours for a family man with 2 kids. Other than that working with the people and challenges that come through the door are amazon
good,Opening and closing operations with the ability to manage employees and allow for advancement and tools given to handle customer problems.
good,"Management was very nice to work for."
good,"I still keep in touch with most of the people I worked with, the management was great and I really learned a lot from working here. A typical day was assisting customers find any part they need, I gained a reputation for being able to find the most impossible parts with a lot of the regulars, I got my enjoyment from the customers leaving knowing they have all the things they need for the job. Hardest part of the job was finding the right part or equipment many times I would use personal assets to find any information that the store part system could not find."
good,overall fun workplace and got to learn lots of parts which helped me advance in my career in the automotive and diesel industry
good,"The job was very enjoyable. I looked forward going into work daily. I was able to work a Monday- Friday schedule and they were able to balance work/personal life. I felt like I accomplished a lot in each day that I was at work. The huge part that was lacking was the lack of managerial skills from the store manager. He was a great guy, but was more concerned with being buddies with his employees than he was leading them. Overall, a great company to work for."
good,"I had a fun time working for O'reilly Auto Parts. I learned a few things about cars among other things. For example, if you make left hand turns while driving, you are less likely to get in a car accident! Some of my coworkers were great and some of them were not; I think that where ever you work you have the possibility of experiencing this. The day in the life of a merchandiser includes getting to work and checking in the special orders. Once this has been completed, it is off to the truck to deliver parts to the professional customers. Upon getting back, it is on to check in the freight order. These items come in everyday except Sunday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, Oil comes in on a separate palate. After everything is checked in, it is on to making sure everything gets out to the floor. I really enjoyed checking in the orders and utilizing my organizational skills towards the store front. However, I did not enjoy the oil order. Those boxes were heavy and a pain to move."
good,"I have learned many parts which are needed for all vehicles; trained to install many replacement parts; operate cash register and balance my cashier box at night; open/close store on occasions.  Enjoy working at O'Reilly's.  Wish I could work there full-time but they only hire for PT positions.  Have met several nice clients which when they come back to purchase other parts, etc., they ask for me to wait on them."
good,Management and my coworkers were awesome at O'Rielly. I felt like I had a work family and a family at home. I really learned how to deal with all types of people.
good,"I would typically walk in and get straight to my duties at work, I would put away inventory, check to see what blank spots that needed to be filled, and drove whenever clients would need automotive parts for their work. I always got my work done mid-day and would have nothing left to do for the rest of the day. I felt like I was wasting talents that I knew I could show to the company but I never knew what directions to take those talents because I was limited to what my job description entitled me too."
good,"providing customers with professional assistance in obtaining parts, advise customers of parts needs and recommend substitution of parts when a replacement is not available, service professional customer accounts and develop good sales relationships, follow and promote all company customer service programs. Providing leading technical parts knowledge in addition to having a good background in mechanics, excellent customer service skills, and above average communication skills."
good,"Enjoy your job, help others succeed , lead by example. Everything is good about the company other than doing your job the correct way. Also pay scale is not good."
good,enjoyed the job.  the pay scale was not enough to live on.  The hours were ok but were only able to get 30 hours per week so could not support myself.
good,I like this place because i got a chance to meet all type of people 
good,"Fun to work with but will not stand behind their managers. Takes good care of hourly workers and has a great bonus, and discount program."
good,Customer service is excellent in this company  however they treat their hard working employees poorly and they don’t nearly pay what they should to some
good,I really enjoyed working here the people I worked with were very helpful and willing to answer any questions i needed without being mean about it if I had not furthered my education I would probably still be employed by them.
good,Oreilly Auto Parts is a great company to work for there are tons of opportunities and career paths that are available  the company treats everyone fairly.
good,"O’REILLYS was a great company to they just didn’t pay enough,I was able to talk to my supervisor and let her know that I needed something else that was making more money"
good,I enjoy working there alot. I like the people I work with. It feels like another family. They will work with if you have and they do the best to make you experience working there good.
good,"My job driving is part time. The boss"
good,"O’reilly Auto Parts was a great place to work and would have loved to stay longer but unfortunately a family emergency forced me to have to quit working at the time. The atmosphere was great, fantastic Co-workers, I was about the be promoted to Assistant Manager when I had to leave."
good,"I started as a delivery driver and worked my way up to an RSS which helps manage store front, customer service. There were many store manager turn overs, delays between corporate and store for anything.It was okay."
good,"Good place to work, not many days off, you'd never get a weekend day off is probably my main complaint. Some store operations get to be a bit of a hassle, lots of stuff have to be OK'd by a manager, people are waiting while that happens."
good,"O'Reilly's Auto parts is a great place to work.  I had no retail experience but I did have automotive experience."
good,"need to have pto time so that you can gain more time for the family. "

good,Good job for the young adult . Not enough hourly pay for adult with family . Very difficult to stay above water at 10$ per hour. Scheduled hours are all over the place never have a set schedule.

good,"Good place to work, better than autozone."

good,"We strive to be a place for car people and when that happens it makes for a fun plave to work. Being customer service oriented makes for a challening balance between service and business, but getting an appreciative customer makes it worth it."
good,When I was hired for the 1st 2yrs it was a enjoyable work environment.  The we got a new District Manager and Regional Manager. The DM started hiring a new Hub Manager fro a competitor that wanted to run it like her old company and it destroyed the creditability with the customers and the company stores the the hub drivers serviced.
good,Like working in this field. Do not like the hours though being jumped all-around. Could not make many plans as there is not set schudale. Overall it is a nice company to work for
good,At certain times of the day you know when it rush hour and there was times in the time you could just sit and relax and slowly put up parts. All in all the place always had something going on but were always time to relax at times in a day.
good,"Working at O'Reily's was a good place with a good environment. "
good,"Various ways to up your money thru sales and promotions. Various ways to further your career if youre willing to put your mind on it, only downside would be working long hours if you have young children."

good,current manager downplays my role as an assistant manager. not a company wide thing just this store has poor leadership. ..............................................
good,Everyday brought new experiences. Helping customers fix their automobiles was a joy. The co workers were always willing to assist in any situation. Management trusted the employees to run the store in an efficient way.The hardest part of the job was making a schedule that was acceptable to all employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the great people I was employed with.
good,I liked working here the people I worked with were like a family. The DM for this district was nice at first then ended up corrupt.The manager I had ended up leaving to

good,"It is a good company to work for, the low is a little low but the discount on parts is nice. There is also a monthly commission but the percentage is low."
good,"Great place to work, there is always something to do! Employees are great, Customers are great, time to time you get the know it all or has no clue about their vehicle. For the most part great place to work."
good,"I always enjoyed knowing that my routes would be different. I always "
good,Every day was fun. The people and the customers were great. I enjoyed going to work. The management was fair to a point. they didn't really give me much of a chance to move up in the company but overall they were not bad. The hardest part of the job had to be manifest. Once a year oreilly members from other stores would visit one store and count every piece of inventory that is in the building.  The most enjoyable part was testing some of the equipment.
good,"One of my favorite jobs, would definitely work here again. The company is great and managers are encouraging. The schedules can work around your needs and pay is good for the job."
good,Great people with okay hours for part time. Always had fun working there. Got good discounts and an hour lunch break. Just keep your self busy most of the time and you’ll be fine
good,"Everyone within the company is pretty laid back, and work as a team! Some days more hectic than others but together we get the job done! Defiantly a great company"
good,retail business so you're going to develop better people skills because of the fact that you interact with people all day. management does a great job of leading and being informative.

good,I loved working at Orielly's. They really make you feel like family. Even being a woman in this work field they didn't discriminate. This place was always very caring and compassionate about the employees. And my manager was awesome and always understanding!
good,As a parts spealist you have several duties to maintain parts collected that are being shipped out to other auto shops in the area an other customers that come into the store.
good,"OReilly is a great company, I feel that the pay could better. I think there should be more promotions for women within the company above the store mangers position."
good,"You are expected to know all different types of makes and model from 1950s, industrial and farming equipment if necessary..."
good,"The experience working for O'Reilly Auto depends on coworkers, management and the public. If you have a active home life and require special days or hours off, then this employer may not be a good fit."
good,It's a nice place to work as long as you're not too ambitious. Good job while in school or training for something more substantial. Eventually it will be time to move on.
good,They do a great job of promoting from within. I love my job but they pay isnt fantastic. over all I've had a great time with oreilly  ................

good,"Contributed with a team to manage the flow of the sales floor. Multitasked sales, calls, ordering parts, inventory and quality control. I learned a great deal on how to supervise and manage a store. My management team was very supportive and helpful. Co- workers were great and easy to get along with. was not having enough hours in a day to help all of those in need. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers leave with a smile and the parts they needed to get back on the road."
good,"always something to do regardless with stock, sales, or deliveries... cleaning was a good part of it too, always a different and a variety of tasks to perform"
good,"Always busy, friendly atmosphere, excellent co-workers, excellent manager.  Great company benefits with health, dental, 401k and vision.  Good training programs if needed."
good,Company is very flexible with students who attend full time college. this is a great job if your a full time student or fresh off of high school.
good,Great environment. layed back. the employer takes care of his employees. Not many employees so management is great. Saturdays are halfs days and all holidays off.

good,From the moment I clocked in for my shift it was go go go.  I enjoyed the fast pace and the friendly environment with my ex-coworkers.
good,"The duties were always the same, but what made every day different was the customer interaction, needs, and satisfaction. Sometimes it can be frustrating but if you good at calming people down and having a good reputation of yourself it is easy. Customer service for sure and teamwork. It can be hard when working on a team and then someone messes up and I'm just delivering the exact serial number part. And well they call the store and then throw me under the bus and I just got to suck it up and excuse myself for the team. I guess also is the hardest part. Taking responsibility for your store/job. I love that I was working independently."
good,"i enjoyed the fast paced environment and all the car talk. Don't go into it without knowing a little lingo though...."
good,"The store i was located at was always on the top of the district in sales but we were never to busy so there was a lot of down time to just hang out, chill place to work if you are just looking for a ""job"" i wouldnt consider this a place to apply if you are looking for a career."
good,"This was my first favorite job, there was team work and the store manager was fun to work for and really used my strengths to his advantage. The atmosphere was just great all around."
good,"I'm what they call a satellite driver,no boss no one to report to. Go to work at midnight and end it at 7am. The reason I'm looking is wanting to transfer to southern California to be with family."
good,working and learning about vehicles from amazing people. It is a nice feeling to know that you can and did help people get and find what people need.
good,I greatly enjoyed working in an place where the boss worked just as hard as I do. I felt as if I could work for a place like that for a long time. It was definitley a moral booster.
good,"I started working with this company in the Mobile, AL area and after a few years transferred to the New Orleans, LA area. From my experience this company is VERY well run in other areas of the company, but here in the New Orleans area it is run very poorly and as a result they have a hard time keeping any loyalty or long term employees or customers. "
good,the employees and managers were cool and able to get alone. Work everyday was fun and interesting
good,"Low hours, great work experience. Great environment, advancement opportunities, very flexible scheduling. Good training."
good,Scheduling is often flexible and management is great. Coworkers that are real team players and a continuing training program that stays on top of new products. Very rarely is a store closed and overtime is out of the question. 
good,"I love the, they people there are very nice being Im the only African american girl that works there"
good,"Working at O'Reillys was a great learning experience. I learned about the retail industry and how to help customers find what they are looking for. My coworkers were especially helpful. My manager was always looking for ways to improve everything in the store, for both the employees and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people find what they needed and get their vehicles working again. "
good,the managaers are very easy to get along with i dont have any complaints about my co-workers its a good place to work i just dont get the hours i want and its minimum wadge and i want a higher paying job.
good,"Customer service, looking up and getting parts for the customer. Learned how to open and close the store, paper work, filing, receive stock in and DC returns. Training new team members to be an RSS. Management most of the is good, lack some in communication with team members and delegating assignments. Get a long great with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is not being able to find parts that our computer inventory says that we have. The most enjoyable part of this type of job is meeting new people and helping them find the right parts to fix their vehicles and all of my co-workers are awesome."
good,"I started working with this company in the distribution center in Florida. I had worked in 3 different departments before transferring to the O'Reilly store licated in London. Like all companies, this company has its ups and downs. Overall I enjoy my job."
good,"Always strive hard to meet company goals as well as helping you to grow up and move up in the company as well, the hours can be overwhelming at times but benefits and pay are good."
good,The company has some good and bad ideas.  They allow things that I would not tolerate.  I believe in a smoke free environment.  I believe in rewarding the hard work and getting rid of lazy employees.
good,"O’rielly auto parts is a wonderful job opportunity, especially as a first job. It gave me some very important skills for other jobs down the road. The management was nothing but good to me, and the customer service is probably the best in the business. The one negative is the hours you work. They are often understaffed with drivers, so you may have to work a few extra hours."
good,"A good culture to work in, nice people that works well together as a team. I would definitely recommend this place of business for future employees as well as consumers!"
good,"Enjoy working at oreilly auto parts good company "
good,Certain districts have its own issues they are working on but overall if you care about the company they care about you and put the extra work in. Very easy computer system for anyone to use and you will learn auto mechanics.
good,Started out rocky but got better after they realized they were expecting to much from me. Then taught me to go at a better pace and learn together instead of pressuring.
good,"I was promoted 4 times within a year of starting.  I started at the bottom level - delivery driver.  I was promoted to the counter and then, after showing leadership ability I skipped shift manager and went to assistant store manager and 6 months after that was offered a store to manage but instead skipped over store manager and went to territory sales manager - all within 18 months of starting.  If you take your job seriously, show up on time, work hard, put the customer first you WILL succeed.  At a management conference I met the founding family and met all of the senior management a couple of times (once during a corporate training and once at the management conference) and was shocked at how humble and customer oriented they are.  How many other 9 BILLION dollar companies have senior management that will hang out and chat over a beer while being themselves??  I'm in my 40s folks and have worked for Fortune 500 companies, made 6 figures etc...and have NEVER been surrounded with such a great family atmosphere from the senior leadership.  The only reason I left was for a special opportunity that I just couldn't refuse."
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts has a great culture. They try to promote from within the company when able to. New hires start at a little over minimum wage. So turn over can be an issue.
good,"I delivered parts to shops, put up freight from trucks, answered phones, helped customers find their parts for their vehicles, stocked up shelves, helped with check engine lights, put wiper blades on for customers"
good,"O'Reilly's offers a good employee discount. they also have a pretty flexible schedule. I did have an opportunity to travel while working for them, to be a part of setting up a new store."
good,"great place to work if you like to learn car parts, how to run business and deal with dead lines, "
good,"We had groups of customers and shops that we dealt with. They gave us the best experiences at work because they were business people, but still knew how to come in and make you laugh. I enjoyed my time at their."
good,"I love working here I am part time seeking full time employment I have been here a year and I need benefits and full time hours I am seeking advancement and growth, however at my location it is hard and has been a struggle for me to move up. I do sales counter, stock, inventory, go outside and work and do basic maintenance on vehicles. I pay child support so I need better pay and full time career I wish to move up in the company but if not I came to indeed to try to find me something else. I am not able to meet my basic needs for living in my area at this company. I need benefits and I have a lot going on but I would suggest working here to anyone I work at a great location and my managers are great!! Paid commission."
good,Fun to come in and work with commercial clients. Enjoyed working with fellow employees and le still taking care of daily tasks that needed to be taken care of.
good,O'Reilly is a great work place. I will continue to work here until I find a place closer to home and with great advancement opportunities.I enjoy and respect the promote from within philosophy.
good,"Always day in and out, we would be able to get the job done no matter what, being professional and proficient was our goal to assist the consumer in vehicle purchases."
good,"Management was amazing. They care about you and your family's needs. Fast paced workplace, but easy when you get use to it. The thing I enjoyed most was having a work family."
good,It was a good job lost of support from team members and management easy to learn very fast. Many tasked to do to fill in down time and always time to learn new things

good,"I learned alot from this company, there's is lot more to learn the people are very nice and they helped me a lot when I started.Advancement can be achieved if you work hard and show that your a leader"
good,"Primary goal was to find every part every time for any application. I took great pride in the ""Never say no"" culture that they had, and I have applied this to not only my professional career , but life in general as well. "
good,"With absolute no knowledge of cars especially not auto Parts but with the enough resources available and the good memory i have, a promotion within the first year in to "
good,"I like the job but I would prefer anyone the job I'm really just trying to better my career path Diesel Machanic "
good,I would never of been convinced that an Auto Parts (discount) retailer would have so many incentives to offer. I'm a delivery driver and it isn't the greatest pay...it's recent for the job. It can be stressful if a person allows it to be. I think it's a great job. I look forward to advancing in the industry and with O'Reilly's.
good,Absolutely wonderful place to work. There is a lot I don’t know about the benefits and such since I have been part time for the last 2 years. Would recommend to anyone who had an interest in vehicles to get a job there.
good,"I have worked at two different O'riellys one in my hometown of west plains and i loved my job there i was working at least 40 hours a week and had a fun time doing it it the current store im at i only get 30 hours per check which i do go to college wich makes it harder but i can not keep paying for rent,college and groceries and gas on my current checks"
good,They have a high turnover and seems to higher young and immature people to assist the customers with no knowledge of parts and who dnt respect themselves
good,I enjoyed delivering parts and getting to know local shops. I had a lot of freedom and opportunities to work overtime. I loved my manager and got bonuses on a monthly basis
good,sometimes management is not there to see all the things that are needed to help to company grow and sometimes even refuse to help when asked but turn around and get mad when their goals aren't hit
good,I absolutely love working here. The team is great. The environment is great. There benefits and room for advancement. Great part time job or for full time career.
good,"Stocking the store greeting customers as they walk in helping them with there questions and more. "
good,This company does a great job at focusing on customer service while still providing the necessary tools for workers. Employees receive fair pay and incentive.
good,Very easy going company. Great training and great compensation. I would definitely recommend working here. Only con is that pay starts a little low...
good,"its a fun work environment. you learn a lot about cars, once you move on with your life you will take with you a lot of usefull information that you could later apply in your own situations."
good,Working at O’Reillys was a great experience I had never worked doing retail before and then learned it was a job to enjoy! The benefits were great and day by day I got to learn more about my job as being a parts specialist.
good,I enjoyed working there because it was fast paced and you got to work around  a lot of people. I left the job for something I thought was better and I was wrong.
good,Oreilly can be a fun place to work with. They could be a bit more stronger in some ares like management but as can every department. Overall it is a good place and a great company to work for. Although they are not very cooperative with people who go to school.
good,"Oreilly's  is a great place to get started in the automotive parts business and give opportunity for growth often. Also, they offer a lot of training as well as ASE certification."
good,Very productive environment with opportunities for advancement. There is an amazing work culture and the pay is better than most entry level retail jobs.
good,Management is great here always willing to work to make employees feel like they are cared about and well taken care of. As well as the staff and team work well together in getting task done and communication.
good,This job always keeps ya moving. Answering phones and helping customers at the same time eventually becomes surprisingly easy. I recommend working there because you can be promoted fairly quickly just as long as you dedicate yourself.
good,"Set hours..sometimes work five to seven days a week due to shorthand..Manager was sometimes fair with schedule needs..due to i have doctor s appointment..if i would,i could work for them again..Great work training..eaay to comprehend"
good,Oreillys is a great company and a blast to work for. Always friendly and polite to the people who come into the store. Everyone in knowledgeable of the parts.
good,",Reilly was and is a good place to work if you are inyrested in Automotive  The oppuranty for Advacemet is excellent but is not required if you enjoy our job."

good,miss working there loved the commercial clients and loved getting out and about during the day. i definatly loved the people i worked with. i wish they would rehire. they have a no rehire policy.
good,"While I was only an intern for a short period of time and thus cannot reliably attest to the inner workings of the company as a whole, I can say from my experience, and through the experiences of people I know that have worked there, that it is a great place to work if you like cars."
good,"good place to work. great dental, health and vison insurance. i would recommend them to anyone who is willing to work and have a suppotive team behind the."

good,It was a friendly and fun environment. I have nothing bad to say at all. Just do what is needed and the job is pretty laid back. The customers are nice and they come back often. Even made a few friends through this job.
good,Good job security. Plenty of room to move up. Great benefits. Sales compensation. Always learning something new. Competitive pay. Plenty of locastions.
good,"O'Reilly is a great company to work for, overall. They desire to do inside promotion, which allows part-time workers to move into full-time careers with their very specific and do-able inside training formats. Management, overall, desires to move their employees into better positions, as long as employees display efficient work ethic with a positive attitude."
good,Oreileys was a fun fast paced job with always something to do. There was always something new to learn from day to day as u faced different problems and came up with different resolutions. If u love being hands on with automotive parts and learning new things everyday this is the place to be. On the other hand it can get quite busy and feel alittle overwhelming at times if u dont stay focused. Great work experiences and work goals!
good,"The job was simple once learned.  It was hard at times to figure the right part numbers correctly.  But once I learned, it was just a matter of pulling the parts, loading them and then delivering them to the various vendors."
good,A typical day at work is hot is sweaty. But time goes by really fast and the people are really fun to work with. The management is very understanding and will work with whatever problems you may incounter
good,I would deliver car parts to other auto shops using company truck and inventory on Mondays. I liked the training online and stalking items numerically.
good,"Very busy during the day,enjoy solving problems."
good,"O'Reilly is a good company to start with. The management is dedicated in providing training and support to team members. The employees are very professional and friendly as well as they are reliable and hardworking. If you are looking for a company that offers growth and opportunities then Oreillys is a good fit for you."

Strong development system for employees lending way to a strong, informed, and motivated group of team members."
good,O'Reilly was a friendly and inviting workplace where customers and employees shared knowledge and common interests in automotive products and repair. Working at O'Reilly helped me build my automotive knowledge base.
good,"order parts for customers and the store, help customers with their needs, test batteries, alternators and starters, turn rotors and drums, and most of all customer service."
good,Oreilly auto parts is a great company to work for. Advancement opportunities are always promoted within and confidence given to the internal employees to want to advance.
good,A typical day of work is pretty good its always fun helping the customers find the parts they need.  I learned its not always easy to deal with each person some are very easy others its not.My co-workers are all understanding and easy to work with couldn't ask for better people. The hardest part of  the job is doing someone else work when they leave their shift and all their work with you to finish. The most enjoyable part of the job is delivering the parts to the mechanic shop and watching them work on the cars
good,"Typical day : Shift started @ 7:30 AM- ended @ 4:30 PM  Monday- Friday.   Tuesday through Friday we would get truck , I would scan the items through our computer system then pack in carts. Distribute throughout the day on the floor. Then I would oversee the inventory, daily count on store items, place orders when needed. I would help customers locate and find parts or items for their vehicle, ran a cash register , looked up and called on parts for customers . "
good,"Very friendly place to work, being able to work one on one with customers was great. organized for the most part, management was great, worked around my schedule while going to school."
good,"worked with nice employees.. learned the different parts on a vehicle.. enjoyed doing the inventory and planograms / mods..."
good,"Very knowledgeable employees didn't care to take me under their wing and teach me the ropes. I became very skilled at trouble-shooting misc. problems with most vehicle types, and the parts required. They will alow you to advance, and you will be considered for raises if your review is up to par."
good,"I learned a lot about selling automotive parts. I learned a lot about ordering and stocking and facing products. I took on the responsibilities of manager and did all that a manager does, time sheets, schedules, opening and closing of store. got to travel a little to help set up new stores."
good,I am a hard working automotive parts sales and automotive concepts  employee.I pride myself on my automotive knowledge and on my never ending desire to stay as up to date as one can be I have had the honor to work with so many outstanding people in my career and have made the commitment to acquirer for my self the  things that made my co workers  outstanding .
good,"Great work environment to work at, very productive company, very strong management team, easy to get a long with everyone."
good,"stock sale floor, change sale floor plans. close and open store. manage employees tasks. customer service, order parts."
good,that job has the tendency of being a fast pace place keep up with people and help with what they need and stock and clean help each other and work as a team to get the job done
good,warehouse is very cool with adequate fans and ventilation. supreme layout of facilities makes the job easy. very clean restrooms and lounge. hardest part about this job is keeping yourself from buying tons of parts for your own vehicles with the greatest employee discounts i have ever seen! 2-3 15 minute breaks with 30 minute lunch. this company is all about culture and family with yearly events and has done a lot for our community in lakeland providing great jobs. i will always be proud of putting my work in at O-O-O' reilly's!
good,"I loved my job but I herniated a disk in my back, and had to go on medical leave for three months. They then fired me cause I did not have enough time in with the company"
good,A happy to work for my company because it a good company and it offers advancement opportunities.Also it always fun and pleasant to interact with new people on the daily basis.
good,"O'Reilly Automotive is a decent company that prides itself on knowing what consumers want and need regarding their vehicles. The employees receive benefits if full time and easily can work themselves up in the company."
good,ok pay decent benefits. opportunites for furthering your education and possibly creating job advancements from within the company
good,"I greatly enjoy my job, unfortunately there is not lot of room for moving up at this time. Management is amazing and get the job done while providing a fun work filled work place."
good,long hours for a store manager at 10 years ago pay level unfortunately but the products are there at the right prices and easy to sell
good,This was personally my favorite job I have ever worked. Everyone was always nice and they always made me feel at home. To this day I still look at them all like they were family to me. This is one place that I will try to work at again in the future. id like to continue my knowledge of vehicles and was going to do so through a program Oreilly auto parts had offered but was laid of before I had the chance to enroll.
good,"The store I was at was great you worked with awesome people, Being a driver was fun and the clients you met we're great people, this job was a great place to work but if you aren't all that into cars then this isn't the job for you because to advance you gotta know your cars."
good,"I would take parts to clients in Midland.  Help customers during down time of delivery.  Help with stocking and inventory when needed.  My co-workers were always teaching me about the different products and how to look them up and find in the store room.  The hardest part of the job was trying to find the address I would be delivering to, since I was not from Midland originally.  My experience there taught me patience and persistence."
good,I would start out a normal day by doing the stores returns manifest that was being sent back to our warehouse. That would normally take me approximately an hour and then from there I would proceed to help customers and my employees on the front counter. I managed 11 employees on a day-to-day basis. I had to delegate tasks daily to help promote an efficient and productive work environment. I would have to say that the most difficult part of working at O'Reilly Auto Parts was having to balance my commercial business customers with all of the the walk-in retail customers. All of our commercial business was conducted via phone calls & deliveries; so I had to find a perfect balance between the customers who were right in front of me and the commercial customers who were calling throughout the day. My favorite part of the job was working with the customers. I love being able to help a customer solve a problem. I genuinely enjoy working with the customers and watching them leave my store with everything that they came in for and walking out with a smile on their face!
good,"I start my day either counting and preparing daily deposits or creating a return manifest and accounting for parts to be shipped back to the distribution center. I also sell parts to both whole sale and retail customers I have learned how to control, cost, and maintain inventory as well as some basic investigative techniques to combat both internal and external theft. I enjoy the customer interaction and the satisfaction of helping them solve their automotive issues. My co-workers are fantastic people and I enjoy coming to work everyday. The most difficult part of the job is finding avenues for professional growth despite excellent performance reviews."
good,"As a loyal and dedicated employee, I complete my task throughout the day delivering auto parts and stocking inventory. When I'm not delivering, I will increase productivity for the store by performing retail service. The most exciting part I enjoyed the most was driving, because it felt like an adventure to me. The most difficult part of the job is having a strong knowledge of the vast varieties of auto parts as automotive technology upgrades.  We all work as a team, and I enjoy working with my coworkers all the time. I admire my manager's honesty as part of our team because with his sense of humor, he knows when to get serious and take disciplinary action. From this occupation, I have learned a lot about automotive parts and realizing how much pride I take in delivering them promptly."
good,"Typical day at work means climbing trains and inspecting cars."
good,a typical day is is very hot and it requires a lot of effort to succeed to get the job done on time.
good,My job was to review commercial applications and check if they were completely and accurately completed.
good,"A typical day at work would be like going in to have a store full of music, and friendly co-workers. I learned that no matter what, you will always be able to help anyone with their car parts needs. The overall experience at O'Reilly was enjoyable, no matter what was going on."
good,"Meet interesting people all day and assist in finding the correct auto part.  OE parts training.  Good management and opportunity for advancement.  Co-workers make the job because you see them every day.  Long hours but overtime available.  great on the job Training, no need for experience."
good,Management was very helpful. Very fun and enjoyable place to work at. Customers was very nice. There wasn't a hard part of the job and the most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,a typical day at work is a good day and i enjoy it. management is great as well as co-workers.
good,was a good job. unloaded truck put away merchandise. met new customers.
good,"The company as a whole is a good place to work for, sometimes management doesn't take responsibility for his/her own mishandling of team members and paperwork."
good,"I very much enjoyed working here. I learned more about benefits, loa, and how to deal with employees that have issues with lots of items. The managers are some of the best i have ever worked with. All of my co-workers are great people."
good,customers all day helping people get thier cars running. the average day was fun
good,"As a driver I would deliver parts, pickup returns and cores from commercial customers. Deliveries were based the customers daily needs, with the exception of stock orders."
good,"They could pay their employees more, but there is room for advancement"
good,"It didn’t pay much, but it was rewarding work if you were passionate about getting into the automotive industry. Management wasn’t the best, but I had a very new management team"
good,Loved the job. Left to go for a summer job on a farm. It was a great company great business to work for and excellent management. Good pay and decent hours.
good,Helpful somewhat  polite. Very great hours and always understanding. I really enjoyed  learning about different parts for  vehicles and interacting with customers.
good,"I love my job and the people I work with in all the locations I get to go to."
good,"Good place to Learn ,Many Maintenance skills . To become Certified on many Different Machines , and conveyor belt Maintenance , and Mac Rack Repair . Can’t wait to get Rehired at O’Reilly Auto parts .  Mike Blacquiere."
good,As a driver mostly on the road and driving. Not really interacting with any customer or any co workers except for those when picking up parts and dropping off parts. Really Chill.
good,Working 9 hour shifts at the counter was tiresome. At the end of the day I would be mentally tired but not physically. Make sure you have comfortable shoes because you spend all day standing.
good,Oreilly Auto Parts was a good job at the time of employment because I was finishing my last semester of college in which I graduated with an Associate's in Applied Science (Petroleum).
good,"I loved working there, great employees, awesome management, great with family issues, and the crew willingness to learn new things amazing. Usually every needed usually instock."
good,Paso rapido estar conciente de lo que realisas y Buena memoria
good,It was a great place to work.  It has its ups and downs but i liked working there. Great learning experience. I learned alot working there.   They provided alot of helpful training.
good,I had been out of the work force for many years. O'Reilly's took a chance on me which I greatly appreciated. I enjoyed the atmosphere in the store. Everyone got along . if you didn't know just ask. Liked meeting new meeting customer s
good,The environment was independently operated for completion of orders by a team. This job is very demanding in the aspect of being precise with the order numbers and insuring the accuracy of the product to the order. Requirements to be successful are work smart and interact only as needed with a positive attitude and limited time to spend on personal conversations.
good,I had a great time working for O’reilly’s auto parts i learned a lot about cars that I didn’t previously know. Learned a lot about work ethics as well overall dont have anything bad to say about them.
good,I learned more and more everyday on the job and met all kinds of new people who enjoyed working on cars. Even some people who could help fix my car from time to time
good,"The overall all culture of the company is customer service based. It helps to know about the automotive industry, however they have daily training dependent on you. "
good,Excellent opportunity to grow with this company. O'Reilly's has an excellent 401k benefit package. The training is great with keeping up on the customers needs.
good,Working at Oreilly's has taught me to be very organized. I have learned time management and is an enjoyable job. The hardest part is keeping the inventory in stock for customers.
good,most defiantly had a lot of training opportunity  and great customer service . also i was able to travel a lot and was allowed to transfer my job when i needed to move.
good,"Was hired as a Store Manager in Training "
good,A good business to invest your time in. You can receive benefits within your six month mark also easy to get pay raises and move up in the company thanks
good,It was a great place to work but when you have 3 kids and no help you can't live off the pay. I loved the work and the people but family is first to me. I miss this place
good,"Great company, & the home office staff are extremely helpful & efficient. It's a good place to work for supplemental income. I actually enjoyed the job."
good,"I came to Oreillys fresh from the mechanic trade. It did give me a bit of an edge but most of the products you sell you can easily become educated on with a few google searches, or by picking the brains of older employees. Great crew with a lot of varied knowledge on different vehicles and engines. The low pay is what made me go elsewhere. Its a great gig for retired people and highschool kids."
good,I loved my time with Oriellys. It was an amazing place to work 10 out of 10. My manager was the kind of manager who would get out there and bust his butt along side his employees.
good,Working with Orilleys has been a great experience with customer service. You learn to work with people from all back grounds and how to work through the language barrier. Working with them will help you to understand more about cars and gives you a great understanding of how that work.
good,This really is a great place to work employees discount is nice to have but the pay could always be better for a multi billion dollar company they should be able to pay there employees more. But what can you do either work and make what you make or leave and find something different.
good,"Fun place to work most of the time.  I enjoyed the people and liked their ""banter"".  Sometime personalities were in the way of improvement but usually new ideas could be implemented if in accordance with company policy."
good,This company had a system to study for general store and industry information.  Taking tests was normal to schedule for myself.  It is a large company.
good,"Answer phones, assist customers, put up stock, install batteries and wiper blades,front and face merchandise. I learned about parts,how to diagnose some vehicle malfunctions. Some managers were competent and considerate, some not so much. Hardest part of the job was changing batteries. Most enjoyable part was being able to satisfy a customer."
good,"It is a good place to work that does offer paid training but in order to advance within the company, the time for advancement does not allow a fast pace growth."
good,Loved working for this company as a store manager. The reward for a job well done is measured in monetary as well as earned respect. I truly enjoyed working for O'Reilly Auto Parts!
good,"Good store that I worked at, all the stores has different management."
good,This job was very helpful with learning helpful with learning customer service and being able to help people with their cars. Worked in two different states and they were both amazing jobs.
good,"The time I spent working at the O'riellys hub was fantastic. I wouldn't have any reason to leave except for the pay which is not fit for living in Renos current market. The workday went by very quickly as a long haul driver, and the work inside the building could always be finished long before the end of the day if you kept your mind to it. Through training with the more experienced drivers, I learned a whole lot about commonly overlooked driving etiquette and small ways to help make the road a safer place for others. As for management, I don't have the words to express how thankful I am for having the opportunity to have worked under such hard working and caring individuals. The management within the Hub get's things done while still making sure that the employees who work under them get everything they need to succeed. The culture is something that cannot be stressed enough, and they are constantly coming up with new programs to ensure that you understand what the missions of the business is and how best to implement it into your daily work life. All in all, definitely a wonderful place to work for if you are retired or looking to have a job that helps you get by."
good,"work was only part-time working only"
good,Fast paced and very competitive. Commission based sales along with a set hourly rate. Paid training and constantly learning new aspects of the job. Great place to work.
good,"great place to work, pay their employees well, learn a lot about auto parts warranties sales marketing and advertising very stead fast environment, advancement stops once you reach store management because most team members above store manager status stay"
good,The job itself is good. The training provided helps to make the job easier.  Knowing what your customer is looking for is sometimes difficult in this position but customer satisfaction is job 1.
good,"Productive, and all the employees are very nice it is a great place to work. A typical day at work is going in checking a list off on my delivery truck,delivering parts, and stocking parts in the store when I'm not driving.  The first and foremost important part of my job is delivering to customers and the second most important part of my job is stocking parts.  The manager and assistant manager are both great to work for.  The hardest part of the job is stocking heavy parts for example the brake rotors, and brake drums, they can be very heavy. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to the other employees there when there is slack time, which isn't very often."
good,"It was fun and out going we would always have cookouts and food, there is also alot of overtime if you are into that in the summer, my sup is leaving but she was the best!"
good,"good place to work, The turn over rate for store managers is very high. Health and dental insurance is very good.  I learned a lot about different automotive parts, and the mechanics of running a successful business."
good,I been with this company for 6yrs when it was checker auto parts I been with my manager for 6yrs I like helping costomers to look for there right part for there car.. The hardest part is finding the right part when the costomer modifies a car or a angry costomer..Most enjoyable getting a long with everyone.. Great management.. I learned everything everyday that I never knew before..Plus they give us great employee discounts
good,"Being in and out of the company truck all day. I was taught about different parts for vehicles, management was decent. Hardest part of driving was finding the location, everything else was easy and very much enjoyable."
good,"Relaxed job,most employees I worked with were laid back and great to work with. I was able to move up in the company quickly and they hired within. I learned inventory and stocking along with how to have great customer service."
good,This job is very family oriented and respectful. Could pay a bit more for what we do with over 5000 stores but it is a good place to work. Everyone is really nice.
good,"It’s an overall great place to work get a discount on about everything, people are great to work with but sometimes customers are hard to deal with but overall I have fun working here."
good,Good job but needs better manager. managers low ball on hourly pay. they promise one pay but on paper they change it and submit something else and low balls there own people over....
good,I loved working for O'Reilly auto parts. Its a very quick paced working environment. When we were slow we restocked shelves and cleaned the store. We got hour long lunches and they were very flexible with the schedule.
good,"I stocked the shelves, put up back stock, helped customers with all needs, and was a cashier."
good,Working in the HR department for the Salt Lake City Distribution Center has vastly improved my knowledge of the field. I've enjoyed both the culture and the challenge that is presented to me each day here at the DC. Often employees have left and come back because the culture is very different here then at other warehouses. I highly recommend the company and this particular location in general to work at.
good,"Almost every day was a pretty good day, not a lot of drama and probably one of the least stressful jobs ever. I like that they gave us training constantly, so that we could learn more about how vehicles worked and how the products we sold worked in the vehicles. Very fun and educational."
good,"There is always something to do.  Many deliveries per day, plenty of stock to put away, and plenty of customers needing assistance with sales.  Hardest part of the job is lifting items that are over 20 lbs."
good,It was a great learning experience. I enjoyed the work and the customers. I liked learning more about vehicles. I was able to do a little traveling while I worked with the company.
good,Time fly's by because everyone there is nice and funny. My favorite is the customers because they always come in and they know we can find what they need and help them with anything they have. There very nice.
good,The customers and work staff were wonderful the work intails a bit of heavy lifting and myself being only 115lbs that was a little rough but everything else was wonderful and everyone was very willing to tech new things and help out
good,"Being with this company, you have two options"
good,"Great company to work for, pay is little for as much as they expect you to work. Embraced women in the car industry. Manager was understanding when days off were needed."
good,"Competitive, compassionate company. Room for growth with a promote from within standard. If you are career minded, this is the place for you. Always bring your A game!"
good,Really helped learn different parts of automotive market.  I enjoy working there and would have liked it more if I would have recieved more pay.  Most part time jobs in this area are paying at least $12 an hr and it makes it hard to move forward in life when getting paid only $10 while going to school.  They did work well with my schedule which was nice.
good,"I loved  working  for  the  team.  Employees  were awesome  and  professional,  and  the  manager  was excellent. Everyone got the job done quick, and efficiently. No complaints at all we’re made."
good,I started at O'Reillys at 16 and they helped me get my foot in the door of the automotive world. I would highly recommend this Job to anyone looking to work as a parts specialist/delivery driver.
good,"Every one has diffrent roles in this company. Some help walk in customers, or mechanic shops. Answering phone calls all day long is one of job duties. If you are good at multitasking this is the job for you."
good,"It is a great company to work for! They are huge on promote within! And any job that pays good you’re going to have to spend more time there than at home that’s life. I’ve seen so many negative comments and I know somedays I have stressful days but in all it is a great company to work for! Also I see a lot of comments on pay I worked at autozone their pay was some what better however you never knew if you was going to have your job the next day, week or month later you never knew. And autozone didn’t promote within. When you buy, work, support Oreilly auto parts you are buying from a family owned company! Also I want to bring up pay again cause I seen so much about pay! I manage a slower store witch I’m prob one of the least paid store managers in my district. However I make more than all 4 of my best friends that I grew up with and they all have degrees and if I ever get to go to a bigger store (witch I will) I would make even more! They are some managers that make 140,000  a year pay if you ask me that’s not bad for a job you get to leave at 5 everyday Just me I guess!"
good,Productive and fun workplace. Everyone showed respect towards each other. Always helping out as a team. It was always helpful asking questions about vehicles.
good,"Provide customers with professional, clear and courteous service.Complete cash balance sheets accurately practice option and addon selling techniques."
good,Fun fast paced place to work. Enjoyed my time at O’Rillys. Loved helping customers find the things that they where looking for. Advancement was available but not to the position I was looking for
good,Many discounts were given on a lot of stuffs and a overall good workplace.I also had a great work culture and all of my coworkers were amazing with me .
good,"I loved working here. Great employees, great customers. My co-worker's always made it a pleasurable experience. Awesome Job!! Anyone would love working here."
good,"I have worked at O'Reilly Auto Parts for almost 8 years. Some has been part time employment, some full time. I never had luck moving up in the company so I had to find another place to work that paid a little that I could move up quicker in but I love it as a part-time job. My manager is amazing, super flexible with work schedule and it's a pretty laid back store to work in. I know not every individual location is like mine but I certainly enjoy working there."
good,I have worked it 3 different stores all was bout the same the manager was good most the people was but there's always a few bad the job was good easy relaxed and fun
good,I job is fairly simple.  I am at a desk for most of the day but the first year you do not get any benefits.  No vacation but you can work with your manager to get unpaid time off for doctors appointments and so forth.  They are very strict about time and attendance.  Not even one minute late.
good,"The job was a great job. A person would have to be able to adjust to the heat in the environment of a warehouse building, because the is no air conditioner in the summer months. the bay door will open to unload and load trucks all year round. Some time there are late and long hours because the fright has to go out."
good,"Pull tickets from various locations and pull appropriate parts."
good,"I really loved being part of this wonderful company! Even tho there management sucks, but just the satisfaction of helping your customer with there mechanical needs, or giving them advice on how to perform or install the parts."
good,I had so much fun working the my O'Reilly crew. We always got everything we needed to get done and had fun while doing it. I actually took a pay cut from my other part time job to be full time at O'Reillys because I went to work happy and not stressed like I did before.
good,"restocking, customer service, "
good,Positive management feedback with a team focused point of view. Every coworker is will to assist when asked. Management shows professionalism and positive guidance to every team member.
good,Great place to work you will enjoy the free lunches you get every so often management is great pay is great opportunity to grow is there everyone should work here
good,Typical day at work is merely just assisting customers and answering calls. You have plenty of room to move up in the company. My manager I had was very helpful in teaching you and cramming more knowledge into your head. He would on a daily basis get you to the place you needed so you could find the information yourself instead of just doing it for you. hardest part is summer time when everyone is out fixing their vehicles. Most enjoyable is probable the atmosphere.
good,"I have learned a lot about auto part, having never been a mechanic. The delivery part is easy for me, due to past experience with route sales. Co-workers are very helpful and eager to answer questions. The most enjoyable part for me is being outdoors again."
good,Enjoyable place to work great people and great attitude for the most part. When stress gets high all employees do what they can to help each other get through difficult situations and lack of bodies to grab parts and answer questions and give good customer service but as far as our compensation for our hard work and efforts could use some work I work 60 hours a week just for decent wages I enjoy my work but mostly enjoy the industry. My definition of a decent wage is affording the cost of living at 40 hours a week and Oreillys doesn't exceed my expectations as far as compensation goes. I would like to work in a place I enjoy but also meets expectations for my cost of living without needing overtime
good,Its very chill part time hours as a woman nice experience.i loved working there.You really get to learn bout car parts and other things. Really nice company
good,I was with oreilly auto parts for 7 years. i met a lot of good people and had good times and some bad.overall oreilly auto is a good place to work. driver and warehouse work is decent.
good,I worked for this company such an amazing Company I really enjoyed my job it was monday threw friday amazing benefits the pay was amazing i really would like to find an other ware house job like i had there.
good,Oreilly auto parts is a great place to work. They have great benefits. fantastic training. sales commission. and a competitive salary. I enjoyed being part of the Oreilly family
good,"I work here Part Time, I really like the customer communication that I have when I'm there."
good,working for O'Reilly auto parts was an amazing job. I enjoyed working with the rest of the staff and I loved helping customers solve their problems. At this job I learned to go the extra mile to help a customer find everything they were looking for even if I had to use other suppliers to get a product. I was in charge of managing delivery drivers and which shops needed their products the fastest. The manager was pretty decent but not always there when you needed something. The culture there was amazing. The staff all acted as a team which allowed for a very productive business. The hardest part of this job was the changes in the schedule. Some mornings I would have to open the store and other times I would have to close the store. The most enjoyable part to me was the thrill that came along with each customers vehicle problem and trying to help them find a solution. There was never a boring day and it was always a different problem.
good,"Not a bad place to work, I certainly liked working there. It's good if you have prior automotive experience, and the company itself was good to work for, however for starting positions, they only offer minimum wage, as most jobs do."
good,"Working for O'Reilly's has been an amazing experience. I have learned a lot through out my years working for them. Now I have management experience, and I enjoy working with my customers and helping them fix their cars."
good,Great job to have out of high school you get an intro to cars even if you don't know anything their program teaches you things to make sure you become succesful
good,"Oreiilys has a really good working environment, I would only change the management . But overall has good benefits and hours are decent"
good,I had my ups and downs here but I loved it. I moved up really fast and was well respected. it was hard sometime because I had people under estimate me because I am a girl. but I gained a lot of friends and I loved my customers.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is a place where the work is tough but rewarding. You really must put the customer first and be patient, but it is a good place to build friendships and make return customers. Moving to a management position is easily achievalbe, but hard work is necessary. Overall, the workplace is what you make of it, and the opportunities are plentiful."
good,Absolutely love this job and the present crew. Great company to work for. Very flexible with home life. Love what the company stands for which is customer service because they are all for just that!
good,Enjoyed working here! Employees were fun loving and always looking out for one another. O'reilly Auto Parts really emphasizes customer service.
good,"typical day at work.  come in on time go over managers expectations for the day and what he would like to see by the end of the night. go over expectations with my employees and explain what we need to have done for the day. goals, lunches (etc)"
good,"I really enjoy working with everybody. Best team work and I felt like family whenever, I come to work. Never felt left out in any situation."
good,"Small, personable, and knowledgeable company.  I'd not have left if it weren't for my need to relocate for my husbands job.  "
good,it was fun while i was there. advancement and pay raises took forever. left because of a better job opportunity. great for beginning level jobs.
good,Check in freight and stock parts on shelves and deliver parts How to look up parts on computer and locate parts.My manager is always helpful with anything I ask her.My co workers are  fun to work with.There is nothing hard about my job...most enjoyable part of my job is my commercial customers I deliver to
good,It was an overall great experience to work at O'rielys only issue was caught a employee stealing money and had to report him. To me no one is friends at work just acquaintances any employee can be bad in my opinion.
good,"O'reilly's Auto Parts was a good place to find employment for the time I was there. The majority of staff were nice and friendly to speak with, very helpful to customers and co-workers alike. The organization system took a little time to understand, but once it was understood it was relatively easy to find what a customer needed."
good,oreilly auto parts is a great career in the automotive industry. their customer service focus is unparralled. the way the oreilly culture fights for their customers and scowers the earth looking for your car parts is amazing.
good,"I enjoyed working with something to do with cars. I worked with a handful of nice people. Everybody was real caring and sweet. However I was the only female. In this small town it's not common for a female to know much about a ""man's job"" and I was reminded that everyday I went to work. Customers would bash what I may know because I am a young female. Even some customers would disrespect me and hit on me and make provocative comments while I would try to help them with what they needed. My manager was such a nice guy as well as the other employees."
good,"A typical day at O'Reilly Auto Parts would include thoroughly reading invoices and delivering parts. I learned how to prioritize when delivering orders in situations such as, ""who ordered their parts first"" and ""who is in need of their parts right this moment."" The best part of my day is getting to know the customers on a personal level from interacting with them everyday (some I still see today and converse with). The only difficulty was delivering in the ice and snow. It bothered me knowing that the customers would be waiting longer than usual, but they did understand."
good,Picking and packing at a fast rate helping team member to pick the right part by numbers and put in the right tote to send to the stores or warehouse.
good,o'reilly auto parts is a great place to work they give you the tools you need to advance with a great company and the shy is the limit
good,"My favorite aspect of working for O'Reilly was all of the automotive knowledge I obtained. Constantly handling the parts, listening to customers with their issues on their vehicles as well as our corporate customers, and all the ASE training that I was able to access. Truly a great company to work for."
good,The most enjoyable part about my job was interacting with the customers and meeting new people. I love my co-workers also because we all got along and made the work environment pleasant and friendly.
good,O'Reilly was a fun fast paced work area. Assisting the customers with the items they need making sure they are happy and satisfied. Answering phone call and assisting or taking note of what is going on with the issue or item they purchased and letting they know what we could do to help them be satisfied with the item or product. Handling schedules and managing the store. Making sure everything is right and in order for walk-in customers to see what they need without having to look all over.
good,The best thing about this job is that they were flexible when it came to working around my school schedule. They also promote fast in this company which is really great.
good,"Learned a significant amount of hands on skills and many common automotive maintenance and repairs. Primarily working with customers and as a result, employees there develop fine tuned customer service skills."
good,Great customers service and a fun family setting they go out of the way to help all customers and offer some of the best parts around.
good,"We learned customer service as in saying 'hi' to the customers as they came in and 'bye' as they left. We learned more computer skills as in checking for parts for their company. We learned how to change batteries, check diagnostics on the vehicle's, and we also helped take there items to there vehicles."
good,Working Directly With The Public Working With Commercial Accounts. I Learned A lot About Auto Parts Part Numbers Using Electronic Parts Catalog & Book Catalogs. The Management Was Very Strict But Fair If You Like To Work With People As I Do Then This A Good Job For You
good,"I worked at this employer about 5 and a half years."
good,One of the few companies that actually stand by their motto. I would definitely recommend this company to learn management skills. The work days are long and the most fun part of the job is actually showing up. Co-workers are very competitive in sales in a friendly manner.
good,"Everyday us unexpected you never know what will walk through that door. It could be the most simplest job to the most puzzling situation to get your mind racing for answers. I got to answer the phone and address the situation, greet every guest, and make them as happy as I can. Management is extremely well trained, issues are taken care of and addressed when need be, everything in the store is done on time. My co-workers are a joy to work with. Everyone works as a team to get things done, and seek advice from one another when necessary. The hardest part of my job is showing the customers that I am knowledgeable about the part or car they are seeking help on, or to be quick with my steps on remember part numbers and what associates with what. Everything is enjoyable to me at my job. I get to get my hands dirty, surprise people to new levels, and know they are happy, the tools i work with, and the new parts I see from time to time."
good,"Everything I know about vehicles I learned from working here. Either from co-workers or from customers sharing some of their wisdom from years of mechanical work. Manager and Assistant Manager, were amazing at what they did and offered to help with any questions I may have had in my time there. If they weren't able to answer right away they thought on it or researched it to find me an acceptable answer. My co-workers were equally as reliable. I couldn't have asked for a better crew to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job I'd have to say was the freedom to converse with customers and learn a bit about their projects and take away some of that to add to my personal repertoire of knowledge that I could later use on my own projects."
good,"Prepare money for register, and at that time, usually, the store would be busy with customers. Any special ordered parts that came in would be inputed into the computers inventory then swiftly contact the customers for the arrival of their order. Near closing, would have most closing duties finished, and then cash out and double-check the stores appearance to get ready for the next day."
good,I loved working for oreilys it is a safe work place and the people there have a good idea of what you will need as soon as you waoke in
good,"I enjoyed working here, a typical day would include me helping different customers find the parts and items they need. I have learned about different parts and products as ive worked there. The management was awesome there, they were willing to work with your different needs. The co-workers kept things interesting and fun and were very good at helping when it came to different things and questions. The hardest part about my job was learning the parts and what each one does. The most enjoyable part about my job was meeting new people and getting to interact with them."
good,helping customers with problems and selling quality parts
good,enjoyed it nice place to work and very reasonable shifts and work loads
good,I get along with all management personell and coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is understanding what the parts are that the customers explain.
good,U always laugh and everyone does there job but when sumone needs help everyone helps.
good,Handling order for first call. Making sure safty control meetings are finished. Inventory control.
good,"Safe and fun working environment. All training provided, plus its very thorough."
good,I was in charge of the csomersial accounts and walk in customers
good,Started with them right out of high school and they have work with my schooling since. Would recommend for anyone as a first step.
good,"O'reilly auto parts is a great company to work for.i gained alot of experience working for this company.I learn didnt thing every day, ive been in 4 different departments in the warehouse.My co-workers and supervisor is great we all work together as a team everyday of the week. The most enjoyable part of my job is working in different departments and working the overtime.My typical day at work is pulling/picking auto parts and driving a forklift."
good,"Every day there are some challenges, but not to many. I've learned to make sure to satisfy all our customers and to go out of our way every time for them. My co-workers are great because we all work together as a team. This job is not difficult, at all. O'Reilly is a great place to get customer service experiences."
good,A typical day at work was mostly spent driving from one shop to another.
good,"You should study a bit about cars if you want to be a successful employee. Most of the customers know what they are talking about and they expect you to know also. Details and specifics are a big deal as well as being able to keep up conversations about the latest trends and releases. If you really, don't know anything, at least keep a smile on your face. That usually helps customers ignore your mistakes."
good,Working at O'reilly Auto parts has helped me get a head start on my schooling and future career it's an enjoyable place to work at with lots of benefits lots of insurance options 401k stock options etc. I've been here for 2 years and I've also learned a lot about customer relations and how to guide them to their correct product and have built customer trust with our local store
good,I enjoyed working at O Reilly's.  Free training and plenty of opportunities to grow.  Learn something new almost daily. Employees are awesome and you never know what's gonna walk through the door when it comes to looking for parts. I would definitely recommend to others.
good,"i loved my job but i was there all the time, like 6 sometimes 7 days week and it wore me down to where i had nothing left. but i couldn't complain about my checks"
good,It was  a great job got along with other people .Did what I have to do and Ioved it.everyone got along with each other we all help each other out when everyone was busy even down to the drivers team work.
good,if you can sell car parts its a easy job but pays the same as flipping burgers without all the fast pace and smelling of cooking oil. it has its benefits if you want a simple indoor job dealing with unhappy people that have car issues. no one is happy about simple things like brake pad failure. well if everyone did corrective maintenence and didnt drive it til the wheels fell off... there would be many more happy customers
good,"Stocked shelves in the mornings when i got to work from the inventory that came in the night before, then unlocked the front door and took care of the customers needs when they came in plus answered the phone and took over the phone orders."
good,it was a fun family like environment. my boss's were easy to talk to and complain to.  hardest part of the job was lifting some of the parts. I enjoyed working on the computers and helping customers.
good,Oriellys was my favorite place I've worked the only thing is I wish they would up the amount of pay per hour. It was a great environment and I made long lasting friends there. I even bought a cake for everyone when I left as a thank you for the time there.
good,Fun and easy I had great support didn't want to leave but had to relocate overall great place to work and good opportunity to advance if your willing to learn
good,A good day working out of Riley's is having good sales communicating with your co-workers and commercial count and retail account customers helping them get what they need for them to finish their job and come back. We also compete with other auto parts stores for better pricing so we have a lot of good discounts for retail and commercial accounts
good,"It’s a good job with good pay, and you get to progress eventually. They’re serious about their productivity but if you’re a hard worker you wont have alot of problems."
good,They are a very good Company to work for. They were friendly and very helpful to work for.  They were overall nice People to work for. I liked them. I would recommemd them to everyone.
good,Good company to work for starting out(high school or auto industry)Worked for them for several years. Job isn't physically demanding. You will need to be good with numbers and understand the basics of a car and what each part does. Need to be knowledgeable and build a repour with your customers. Most would ask for me by name. Downside to working there was the pay scale was ridiculously low. Talking about fast food service low and not offered much on pay raises.
good,"retail, i learned how to be apart of a team. management was amazing. the culture was everything. hardest part of the job was dealing with angry people. most enjoyable part of the job was actually being helpful to people."
good,"Though managing this business was similar to the competition, I found some security issues and the training programs for new employees is not a credible program and there is not enough time provided to participate."
good,I really enjoyed working for O'Reilly Auto Parts because it was more than a job. It was a family cultured business where everybody helped and enjoyed giving the customers the best customer service possible. I would go back if I didn't want to find a career in my Information Technology field.
good,"I would recommend O'Reilly Auto Parts to my friends.  Starting pay is a  little slow but you advance with the effort that you put into the job training, computer modules, and your work ethic."
good,"It’s a good job, we get paid fairly and have good benifits. My previous manager, now the Wisconsin DM was the most amazing manager anyone could ask for. My current one has turned the store toward the worse and is making working there difficult."
good,"I would work for Oreillys again, if I could have Monday thru Fridays day shift. I don't mind filling in when needed. I really enjoyed  working for Oreillys."
good,"Great way to spend time around cars. Typical day would be stocking shelves helping customers with parts they need to make repairs, cleaning the sales floor, and stocking parts."
good,I loved & greatly enjoyed working at O’Reilly Auto Parts! I worked there for 3 years. The only problem I had at one point was an awful manager by other than that.. it’s laid back. No complaints here :)
good,Good job low pay and little benefits. Would recommend to anyone who wants time off during the week but not possibly every weekend. Amazing work ethics and good team work
good,"I worked there for a year and i was able to learn a lot about cars in such a short amount of time. now i can do my own tune-ups, change my light bulbs, air and cabin air filter. install batteries and a lot more"
good,This company is great company to work for. As a company they provide us works with so much benefits and opportunities to better ourself within the company.
good,"If you can deal with people who don't know what kind of car they drive, people who curse you out cause the part they need is not the one they want, and other people of that nature then you should have no problem working for O'Reilly's. Not every customer will be like that but some of them are. For the most part people just want to get in and out with the part they came for and will work with you if you are just starting and show some initiative."
good,"If I could go back and work at O'REILLY'S I would love to.Fast track but easy to learn. With certifications possible at all times. Advancement opportunitys, and with time full time manager. Caring company with hard working  employee's."
good,Usually i worked 12-9 and i enjoyed  going to work. made a bunch of friends there had fun while working but keeping it professional. i liked the fact that every one the worked there were good friends we would often go to places to hang out
good,Great place to work but if you work full time make sure you get the benefits of full time if you are listed as part time they will do nothing to correct the issue
good,"Great mentorship in upper management to provide you with every tool needed for the job. Awesome gatherings and family events. Fun and exciting. Benefits are excellent, company matches 401k, stock options, and they provide necessary Grant's for those in need during extreme situations."
good,"I don't know what the culture is like now, but when I worked there, it was a family atmosphere. We all knew each other in the warehouse. There were 2 shifts. Management constantly interacted with  regular employees. Company picnics, employee discounts, etc, etc."
good,It really is a great company to work for. The people are firendly and advancement is easy to obtain. You have all the opportunity to go as high and as far you want. you are the only one to stop you from gowning in the company.
good,"I had a fantastic manager, a great team, and they have awesome products. I loved that Job. I would be there today If I could have gone to the full time and more pay. This is a great job. I had financial child support obligations so the pay was not enough for me at that time, but if you're in college or do not have major financial issues bearing down on you this is a Perfect job."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customers find the part they are looking for and making sure they leave with a smile on their face.
good,"This company is great for your first job or for a second job, but not as a career. Unless you get into upper management, pay is relatively low. Its great for experience and for learning about automotive parts."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company> great team to work with> pay was very reasonable> benefits are one of the best offered.I recommend this company
good,It was a good for me when I got out of the Military. I need to get back into the swing of things for as becoming a regular citizen again and they helped me. I was the fastest moving employee went from a sales person to a store manager in 6 months
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts is Great! Great Management and the company has a very great many US Stores. Fun to work as a Delivery Specialist."
good,"There is plenty to do and you often have to work hard to get it done, but the culture here is second to none.  O'Reilly Auto Parts is a parts company that is run, top to bottom, by parts people.  They only promote from within and they are growing rapidly.   Would recommend!"
good,I got to drive around and build professional relationships with the customers. I learned to go to work for work and nothing else. Management changed one time and the new boss was great at what she does. That store is doing phenomenally now.
good,It's a good job so far I like it. I don't think I could stay because of the pay. If it wasn't for that I would consider it. I really only needed a job during school and this met those needs.
good,"The employees of O'Reilly Auto Parts are very passionate about anything with an engine and will go above and beyond to help their customers. The camaraderie between the workers and the customers is truly genuine and unique. "
good,Just work and mind your business. That is the most helpful tip I could ever give you... after your job is done just go home and mind your business. Make your money
good,"When I started I had the best manager ever, very supportive but when I switched to mornings I had the least supportive manager ever. I wish I would have stayed with the company, but I was too anxious about losing my job because of my numbers."
good,Loved working for O'Reilly Auto Parts. The pay could be better. Overall I established great customer relationships and still have an ongoing friendship with my past team members.
good,Oreillys is a great opportunity to grow your auto parts knowledge and grow your personal skills. Tons of availability to move up in the company. Best culture practiced at any corporate run company.
good,"Everyone is easy to get a long with.  Team helps each other with inqueries, finding products and loading products.  Allow you to learn as you go in order to be ready to move up."
good,We started with exercise also talked over problem.Working as a team warehouse equipment.Management was fair.Hard hot. dusty etc.Summer months make sure you drink lot of water.Party at the end of season people.
good,"i liked working at O'Reilly, it was a fun place to work with good people."
good,Still growing and will soon be the best in the industry. A few bad employees does not define this great company. Chances are given to those dedicated to be the best.
good,"Helping customers finding parts they need for there cars and ordering if needed, handling money while closing down the store couple nights a week.  Great people and friendly manager"
good,Working at O’Reilly Auto Parts is a fun and relaxed job! Working at O’Reilly I learned to be a productive sales associate in a family environment. I highly recommend it.
good,"I love working for Oreilly Auto Parts"
good,I enjoyed being part of this great company. sadly had to relocate but would of continued working there but i do have different job goals i wish to reach. A bit challenging in the beginning due to having to study the various type of parts a vehicle is equip with. Overall such a great work experience learned many new things and built my customer service.
good,"The atmosphere is laid back and helpful. Customers feel comfortable and management works well with student, or others who need help with their scheduled hours."
good,"Rewarding to see so many ppl learn and grow.  Love providing world class customer service.  Culture is where it is at with this company, where your not just a number your a face."
good,"I loved working here and would recommend people to check them out. My managers were friendly and awesome individuals. I hated to leave this workplace! Had to, but they were understanding."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of me starting in the receiving office, then moving out onto the floor to clear up some discrepancies. "
good,"Amazing culture. Company has changed over the years. Not necessarily bad, just different. Small store managers work quite a bit but, if you are made of the right stuff, you can move up quickly."
good,"At O'reilly Auto Parts I was challenged daily with a new scenario concerning motor vehicles and other machines. I have learned the ins and outs of many different types of vehicles, heavy duty machinery, and light duty machinery."
good,Oreilly taught me how human everyone in the workplace and in need can be when someone needs help. This company teaches its employees to genuinely help customers and practically make friendships with the wholesale guys who come in. (who happen to be pretty great)
good,"Great Company , You have a schedule you do what your told come in take care of your job and your customers and it is great also have lazy people and proactive people but that's everywhere"
good,"- The typical day at O'riellys would consist of helping customers get the correct car part they need. Possibly helping to diagnose a problem, and installing the occasional battery or wiper blade."
good,Team work makes the dream work. Work on being a team and helping each other to gain success. Great staffing and managers always willing to help out with any situation.
good,Oreillys is a great company to work for. I needed a bit more money to I took an opportunity elsewhere but would go back in a heartbeat. Everyone is so helpful at Oreillys.
good,"I worked at 6 duifferent locations while employed by Oreillys. It was a company that treated me good in all aspects of the job. Friendly work environment, lovely management, will always recommend as a job!!"
good,meeting new people everyday     new parts daily   busy all day  set up new routes daily    parts reports  over/shortages nothing hard about job at all
good,My typical day consisted of delivering parts to commercial customers. I also helped put incoming stock away. Helped pull ordered parts for delivery. Assisted customers in the retail portion of store. Really enjoyed working with the staff and management.
good,I loved this job great management and team members. The only reason I left is because it's very hard to get full time and pay was not great. This job taught me a lot about vehicles and parts.
good,"Love the people i worked with, and there are many opportunities to advance with the company if I ever contemplated that, It is easy to move up if you work hard enough for it and the work flexibility is dependable."
good,I really enjoyed working for O'Reilly's.  I was part time as I only worked the week ends and occasionally after my manager shift at another company.  I got to help people solve problems using my automotive experience.  It's a VERY relaxed retail environment.  It was a lot of fun.
good,They were like another family. the team was great! majority of the customer knew what they want. if a customer didn't know what was wrong a sales associate always knew what was wrong.
good,I liked it a lot they work with your schedule and it's easy work. Helping and talking to customers is the best part. While learning the different parts on cars.
good,"you would have your start up meeting, your assigned a zone in which you must pick that day. you talk to computer through a headset and read the bar codes to it and it will tell you what part to pick and to place it in the desired tote. the management is good. the supervisors are very cool and easy to know. they have an open policy to complaints and such things that need improvements.  the hardest part of the job is keeping up to pace while picking large tickets with multiple pieces. the most enjoyable part is the people you work with,"
good,"I started out as a driver and loved driving. This was a very simple job of dropping off car parts to clients,answering phones and easy paperwork. I learned from the guys who come in, since I'm a female what the different car parts do. I did so well with learning the daily functions I became Asst. Manager. This job became hard. You have deadlines to meet, I'm now in charge of employees and their task. I became responsible for the store and all cash flow. Management kind of says okay its 5:00pm see you later and your on your own. You hope you can do it, if not you make a the best judgement call you can and move on. The co-workers I have worked with treat you very well and its a team. The job can be very rewarding when a customer comes back to me and says ""You gave me the right part and you made my odd job work great!"". Its nice to hear from different costumers that you do a good job."
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Couldn't ask for a better place to work. Unfortunately I left, I trained at a store in Leesburg while they were still working on opening the Eustis store. Once the store was opened I started out just driving, but was quickly promoted and was doing commercial work. I worked closely with my manager to train doing store stock inventory, daily returns, and store to store stock transfers."
good,"The company offers wonderful training opportunity, great benefits some upper management lack some communication, but over all great company."
good,"always got had a blast with coworkers we were all into cars so there was a connection between all of us. I got to learn all about the parts of cars, the biggest factor was having to do a inventory check when things were not in order."
good,"a typical day like any day varies according to customer(s) through out the day. I've learn that customers come for friendly service as well as product and the knowledge to do a good job on their vehicles."
good,"Like most any job, the work environment is almost entirely based upon your co-workers. If you don't get along with them, you probably will have a bad time at work."
good,Awesome customer skills and most returning customers where awesome. I learned lots of patience and great work ethic. Loved all the great customers and coworkers where great. Being the night manager was a tough job.
good,A fast paced environment with constant opportunities to learn more about automobiles. Management is constantly looking for people who want to advance themselves and contribute to the team.
good,"Every day is structured with a to-do list and all employees have assignments to be completed to the best of there abilities. They have an excellent on going training program for both new employees, current employees and management. I've learned a lot about how great customer service and being a team player is the best way to success. Management is well informed to help teach and train. Hardest part of the job is multi-tasking on busy days while staying calm with minimal mistakes. Most enjoyable part of the job is having respectful fun with co-workers and being thanked by another satisfied customer."
good,Great place to start working if your getting back into civilian work and /or want more knowledge on vehicles and customer service skills.
good,O'Reilly was a fun fast paced work area. Assisting the customers with the items they need making sure they are happy and satisfied. Answering phone call and assisting or taking note of what is going on with the issue or item they purchased and letting they know what we could do to help them be satisfied with the item or product. Handling schedules and managing the store. Making sure everything is right and in order for walk-in customers to see what they need without having to look all over.
good,"Start my day with the store managers, going over sales goals and sales reports. Going out with manufacture reps on sales calls and promoting current programs and promotions. Ensuring customer satisfaction in all markets. I have learned more sales tactics and finding out what the customers needs are. Being able to make cold calls, start new accounts and build customer relations. The struggles of my job is when i promote our stores and our great service and the store lets me down by not taking care of the customer as i had promised. The best part of my job is that i love dealing with my customers and their needs."
good,"Awesome working environment, great culture!"
good,Very strong Culture. Challenging position with possibility for career advancement.
good,"I started out working here as just a part time job thinking ,me being me. Energetic and motivated beyond belief could make it to top by all means necessary.Great place to work. Besides the pay rate i love this place."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working with the company. A typical day at work was fast-pace, challenging, busy and exciting. I've learned in management that through hard work and working as a team, goals can be accomplished. I was greatful to work with a lot of highly experience individual in the auto parts business. What I enjoyed most about my job was helping my customers, making sure that their need were meet and parts was delivered in a timely manner."

good,I have spent the last 19 years and have learned a lot.The company has grown a lot over the years its a great company and now I'm looking to try something new and to put my skills that I have learned to good use.
good,"Worked at Oreillys for alllllmost 2 years, it was great. Great discounts. almost 50% off anything other than oil. I love cars, i love working on cars. So it was an enjoyment to meet the same type of people and make a new friend every week. Now on the the bad stuff ... =(  When good workers that actually knew what they were talking about started quitting, boss hired a couple ""dumb"" ones. annnnd the place started to get alot of wrong parts...So many times a day i would have to watch over all the younger kids on what they were doing it got very annoying.. But overall i would work there again any day if they would pay a little more than 7.50 to start... But oh well =]"
good,for the most part I would just pull parts and drive with a lot of customer relations thrown in. I did enjoy that but I am a lot better as a warehouse man
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this company. My managers and co- workers were awesome!
good,"A typical work day there consisted of faced paced ,mutitasking and delevering superior customer service to customers"
good,Good company for students but they dont pay you what your worth!!!
good,"Fun work place. The Do-It-Yourself and Commercial customers were treated like family when shopping in our store. We would have Customer Appreciation Day, which consisted of giving away free promotional merchandise: frisbees, stickers, etc., carwash, food, drinks and music. We were the Racing Store because of Alabama Motor Speedway and the Phenix City Dragstrip."
good,"Worked at the parts counter, learned a lot about cars and how to test batteries,starters, and alternaters. Very pleased with management, have great career opprtunities. Hardest part of the job is getting the customer the right part and information about the part or products. i enjoyed seeing the customer walking out of the store happy and satisfied."
good,"The job is very much a busy area.  Every day is something very different. All team players work as a group,  with many responsibilities to make the store successful."
good,"I loved driving for OReilly. At the Greensboro DC, employees and supervisors are supportive and maintain positive attitudes. I recommend the company and the GSO DC 19 location for drivers. Work isn’t hard. All of the transportation department are helpful, motivating, supportive, and have great attitudes. Open door policy. Would definitely come back! Only left due to personal scheduling requirements and family related issues. Awesome place to work!!!"
good,It is a good job to have. Great people and lots pf laughs. Feels like going to work with friends. Management is also very understanding. I loved it there.
good,Oreillys is a great job to work in.. I started out a driver and left as a assistant manager... you’ll learn so much and take it everywhere with you! Oreillys is number 1
good,"Work is easy and fun. You learn as you go.. here and there youll get difficult customers, but over all its an easy job very hands on , if your not a peoples person , its not the job for you."
good,This job was one of the best jobs I have had. The company is very good to work for. The people who work there are great to work with. If your in school they work with you or if you have kids they will work with you.
good,Took care of commercial customers. Fulfilled orders. I learned most of what I know about customer service and retail working there. It was a great place to work for with a great upbeat attitude. The manager was always there and was always helpful. My favorite part of the job was helping people and making their day better.
good,"Work atmosphere was okay, some homeless though crawling around gotta watch out for our vehicles as there are no cameras which the company should invest in would be nice. Though there are ALOT of talks in the company which makes it unprofessional."
good,You learn alot about various responsibilities and you get opportunities for advancement and great benefits. You get great discounts on parts for your vehicles aswell.
good,Many overlook the opportunities that O'Reilly Auto Parts does provide. Giving that one wants to advance and willing to put forth the effort the opportunities are there.
good,"Awesome benefits and great people from the top down. Everyone had fun here,the only problem was driving in bad weather , which comes with a driving job .Also great discounts on auto parts."
good,If you are a hard worker and know a lot about cars then this job is made for you and you do alot of planogram plus you just get to have fun of what you do
good,Overall I enjoyed working there because of the fast-paced environment. Transferred me from store clerk to delivery pretty fast with better pay and more hours.
good,This company is a great place to work. The benefits are good and there is room for.advancement. The training is updated daily and the management works with you to accommodate your schedule. They pay commission based on your personal sales or the stores sales so everyone receives extra in their paychecks once a month
good,Fantastic company. Corporate is very employee concerned and works hard to take of team members field management works well with the store managers the district managers always have your back.
good,"A typical work day involve daily maintenance checks, pull and deliver parts ordered by professional businesses in the local area by driving a company provided vehicle.  Excellent work place culture with fair and equal work assignments."
good,"The management varies from store to store, I am lucky to be in a store with a well-rounded team. The pay is low considering the area and that a lot of fast food places make more starting pay than we do. The company does provide anual raises, holiday bonuses, and commission, which is very nice. They also encourage team members to be active, and a contest to further encourage it. For completing training and daily questions, you earn points to bid on gift cards. It’s nice."
good,Great hire from within philosophy and remains consistent. Company builds 150-200 stores every year throughout the United States. Training available for individuals without vehicle knowledge.
good,20yrs and loved everyday of it!! Leadership and culture bleed green and hated to leave. Training was the best and opportunity for Advancement is great!
good,"Love the culture of this company I usually work with a smile on my face, other than lack of pay I cannot complain much about this company. I hope my new position here is everything I’ve hoped for."
good,"Oreilliys is a good place to work. You are always moving heavy items, but using a pallet jack helps it more to move. If you need help loading or unloading, these people and your manager will help if you need it."
good,"Good people, great culture.  I worked here through college and all the changes that has brought.  Manager has been extremely understanding of schedule, allowing me to work through school."
good,Never a boring time with working for great customers. It was a great opportunity to help a store reach million dollar sales a year for several years and a great opportunity to understand about parts and what they do
good,I love the job and the people the management is great it's just the pay is not enough if the pay was better I think I will retire from the job over all good people to work with
good,Only thing that was not right was that my job title changed to a higher authority but my pay rate was not changed. If a title changed the pay rate should too. Don't hide the title and act like you didn't know.
good,"Management is wonderful and promotes a friendly work environment. Getting to know various mechanics is also a plus. Drivers schedules vary, but the Merchandising Specialist position is fixed, which was very nice."
good,Great place to learn something new while working. Hands on experience of helping customers with multiple car repairs. Such as battery and head light replacement.
good,I came from a competing parts store and joined the O'Reilly team. They quickly gave me a chance to prove myself and received recognition and opportunity to advance.
good,I like working with my fello associates and all the management until the last store i was transferred to that stote manager dose not know how to  talk or treat most associates or wemon.
good,"A rather fun place to work. Acted as a hub delivery driver. Normally you grab your first load, set it into the company truck, and drive your route to deliver to other stores in need of parts for their customers. Some of the faster routes brought you back in time to help fill orders until departure time. You never work the counter, and drive a company vehicle. A great job if you prefer minimal customer contact."
good,Everybody has a good time at work.  It's mostly laid back with moments of customer rushes.  Manager is a respected leader.  All full time and some part time employees have a good knowle about their jobs.
good,Would really like to go back if I could they treat you really well like family.management is amazing very fast paced before you know it your day is done.
good,"Busy work environment, constantlyon the go, answer and help customer find the parts or accessories they need to complete the project they are working on."

good,I loved working here! Management is great. The company stays true to their core values. They value their employees and treat them very well. Would love to go back. I loved my job and the people I worked with.
good,O'Reilly Auto Parts is an incredible place to work.  The company is willing to train team members even with limited automotive knowledge.  They have a strong culture and live by it organization wide.  They understand that it takes people to run and drive the company.  They typically open 200 plus stores across the U.S. so there is plenty of opportunity to advance in any number of career fields.  They believe on promoting from within so they always look internally for promotions first.
good,"This company was very good to me. I was there 11 years and loved every minute. If I didn’t want to raise my baby at home I would have never left. Good parts people are getting rare. If you have the initiative to learn, oreilly will give you endless ways to advance in the company"
good,Was a great place to work. Had lots of positive worker and mentors. Was a great learning place and a great place to work. Working there was a pleasure.
good,"I have worked at O'Reilly's on (3) different occasions, and have never had an issue with them. This is a good company to work for, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
good,"Although I enjoyed working there, and the possibility for advancement, they pay stinks.  I had ALL the responsibilities of a manager but the pay was not worth it.  I left due to the fact between the costs of daycare and gas I wasn't really BRINGING anything home."
good,The job was fast pace at sometime and slow at others. The management was one of the best I have ever seen in a work place even when I was not working I could go in to a store at they where super friendly.
good,O'reillys vaules their customers and try to use their mission statement to get the job done right. Safety is a must and trying to be there for thier employees helps
good,"Open store check payroll, count safe setup register. prepare nightly deposit. open store check in stock truck(nighty). all done while taking care of customers and putting up the stock truck."
good,"This was the best job I've ever had. Initially I didn't know too much about cars but as I completed training and engaged with customers and coworkers, I attained a lot of knowledge."
good,Help customers with car problems get them the right parts for their cars install batteries check batteries alternators starters for customers stock shelves and customer service.
good,Cars and car repair is not really my forte buy I did have fun in this company. Everything was fair and everyone is so welcoming. Starting salary is not bad considering I just drove all day
good,"I loved working here. I didn't want to leave. I would come in, select the products I was delivering, matched them on manifest then drive off delivering them. I was alone with nobody over my shoulder, the time whisked away, then I was done."
good,Professional parts people that are knowledgeable caring individuals. Willing to assist customers with applying wiper blades  and installing batteries. They truly enjoy working with each other.
good,Good management and co workers good work environment great customer services clean stores good customer s helpful employees and teamwork stock ed shelves
good,"i like working in auto part shops, nice enviroment, great communication with team crew, fair discount for employes, even hours regular work schedual, i had no dificulties in any place so far"
good,Increase in pay is not what one would expect and advancement with career opportunities. Great place to work if looking to retire and enjoy your job. Nice place to enjoy your job.
good,"-I rarely had days that I didn't want to go to work. I loved my all of the people that I worked with! Everyone from the highest ranking person there to the lowest was very kind, funny, helpful, ad encouraging. So a 'day in the office' was a breeze. -After I walked in the door I would say hello to everyone as I clocked in for the day. Then I would go check the board for which daily tasks I had been assigned. Over the period of my shift I would complete the tasks between helping customers find anything they needed in the store, or by searching the computer for specific items. Depending on if I was the first or last driver of the day would determine if I was the one to check in or park the delivery vehicles. Then I would clock out and say goodbye to everyone. -When I first started working at O'Rielly's there was a different manager than the current one. I believe the current one to be exceedingly more efficient. He definitely bonded well with my crew at the store that I worked at. Changes were made that were challenging to cope with at first, but soon made sense and became easy to follow. -Working at O'Rielly's was never 100% simple and smooth. There were times when some of us would have short tempers or customers were getting on our nerves. But we sure did a good job at holding our composure and making sure that every customer was satisfied. -The original goal that I had for applying to work at O'Rielly's was that I wanted to have a higher understanding of vehicles. I wanted to know everything from the specific parts that make them run, all the way down to the tools that were"
good,The job was delivering parts. It was fast paced but fun. You aren't stuck inside all day. The management is fair and easy to get along with. They offered a bonus every month in addition to your wage.
good,when i first stating working for o'Reilly's I knew nothing about warehouse work at all. the too the time to train me efficiently so i can be the best at the job and i was.
good,It's a very well and clean place to work in I love working here at orielys the people are great and helpful the management is great and the employees are too
good,"Started working there on May 15, 2015.  The manager at our store is simply awesome.  He cares about the employees and goes to great lengths to make sure we feel appreciated."
good,Fun place to work with...could hire better leaders instead of managers but all in all perfect place to start from the bottom and work your way to the top in know time.
good,This company has grown and many changes taken place. They are a good company to work for with decent benefits. There is room to grow in the company so take the chance
good,I believe in Oreillys always have. Used to be real family type business. Went through a big change with Oreillys growth. It's a great company still just not so much family now just greed. Young guys know it all and don't know the Oreilly way. 25 years with them and it's time for a change
good,A lot of potential for a young person starting out.  Lots of room for advancement.  Bennefits are very good.  I made many friends there and the company is really growing and going places.
good,"A typical day at work included delivering auto parts to mechanic shops around town, assisting customers locate auto parts in the computer system (and in the store) both in person and over the phone, doing minor automotive work such as installing new battery or windshield wipers, and restocking the store. I learned a lot about different car parts, and the location of some that I didn't know before. The workplace culture was relaxed, yet professional. I made a few friends working here, yet they didn't impede on my on the clock abilities or duties. The hardest part of this job was the scheduling. Sometimes we would not know until the day before the new schedule came out what days we were working the next week. The most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction I had with the public. Whether it was the mechanics out in the field I was delivering to, or the customers in the store, I enjoyed my time with them."
good,Orielly was the only job other then the medical field I will work. Co workers were very professional and very helpful all the time we worked as a team.
good,"my day start off with a fifteen minute rally meeting in the morning and for the rest of the day I will be scanning items meeting ,y quote for the day."
good,One of my most favorite jobs I have ever worked for. The Manager is amazing and she definitely understands how important team work and family are. Would recommend it anyone.
good,I have really enjoy d working for this company I'm just ready to move on to another challang in life.  From their culture to the corporate employees I've never had an issue in my time here.
good,"Great work place, you get to learn about vehicles and the components. One of the greatest things I liked was the employee discounts we get, so if you are a car person you know were your money is going to end up at."
good,"I loved working for O'Reilly, the olny thing that I did not approve of is the  management that I had towards the end of my time working there, that was not planned, at that certain store. My issue was with the manager at that time and not the company itself."
good,Good work place the pay isn't all the way there. Good people and management easy to learn the system. Helpful with customer service...................
good,"Like I mentioned it's a great place for part time students or full time retired employes. I am looking for full time job with good benefits and a higher pay. I have worked at Oreilly's for over 6 years and now I am looking for a work place that I can grow with. I have a wide variety of expience.  Cashier, customer care, cash handleing, and keeping my work place clean."
good,Work at your own pace. Respectful staff and employees. Paid vacation. No more than 30 pound lifting. Safe environment with security. Put in days you need off 2 weeks in advance and supervisors acknowledge them accordingly.
good,"Great workplace and customer's provide different stories with their car. I have learned to listen to the customer to the full story and to provided the best service I can. The workplace culture is a great team, always willing to help each other out. Management is very flexible with my school schedule."
good,"The days were start out very so, especially if you were in the mornings you won't get busy customers until the afternoon."
good,"Great place to work.  Enjoyed my time there, I did leave for more money, Upper management was always available, always had an open door policy for and issue presented at a store level."
good,"O'Reilly has shown me how a good job with a solid culture can be best for both the customer and the employees.  My job required both hard work and flexibility, and provided a challenge while not being overly stressful."
good,"we were not required to wear uniforms like many other part stores, don't get me wrong we did have a uniform shirt, but I felt like we were more able to get on the same level with automotive shops and with the customers. When you go to get parts on your car you don't want to have someone that looks like a car salesmen help you out. I would rather find someone that looks like they have actually worked on a car before."
good,"Awesome place to work, good pay and benefits. Lots of overtime. Only issue is with immature employees that name it an uncomfortable place to work at times. Keep to yourself and ignore the drama and you'll be happy"

Provide cashier services as needed and count down drawer at the end of the day and make deposit into the safe.

good,"This is a fun place to work.  Everyone chips in and gets even the most menial tasks done. "
good,its a great company it self theres just bad management the company   has good discounts and benefits. i was a order selector and pulled part on a cherry picker
good,"This company, although hectic, was very fun to work for. I was able to get a sense of accomplishment and i was able to feel important, due to being one of a few who could find almost anything we were supposed to have. We generally got there, and put away new items for the first two hours, after that, we would start counting the warehouse. I learned how to use the system so i could be clerical. The management was mostly clueless about how QA worked other than our supervisor. My co-workers and i got along for the most part. The hardest part of the job was finding the items that were missing."
good,"My day starts off with me and the manager entering the store an hour early before we open the store. This helps me scan all the inventory an hour early before we open our doors at 7:30am and ready for the customers. I get along with all our employers but mostly by 8am im on the road delivering throughout the rest of my shift. When not delivering ill stay and help walk in customers even go outside and see what they mean when they cant describe their problem. The hardest part of the job is their is none very easy and understandable we are provided with computers to help with people , the best part is when the customer walks out of the store knowing their vehicle will be running in the road again."
good,They offer many different option/benefit for employees. For sure would work there again.
good,Good place to work starting out. The daily operations are simple and easy. The employees and management work together to complete tasks.
good,everything is well. plenty help for their employees and they value them. supervisor  miss understood the date of my return and wrote me up didn't feel it was right. other than that I loved the place.

good,"O'Reilly family structure, everyone that works for O'Reilly becomes part of a family."
good,"I was I believe the younger Store Manager for them in the southeast at the time I loved the job I was good at it,Taking store management takes alot of your home life with this company I was single at the time so that was fine.I managed 15 employees roughly I was in charge of payroll P&L inventory, hiring , training ,Firing.

good,This was my favorite job I have ever had. I would arrive early and prepare a sheet or daily duties for the parts specialists to perform before their shift end. I Help do it yourself customers find parts for their cars. I would also take high volume sales calls for auto shops around the area (52 accounts) I would pretty much always stay late. Occasionally I went to other stores for inventory counts. It was also my responsibility to perform the monthly cycle counts for my store. I loved every part of this job.
good,"Did all around variety of duties in this field. Was efficient in this job ,because I worked as a mechanic for years prior to obtaining this position. I had insight into parts problems from the job end previous to working here."
good,"management is really good. It was really fun working there, plus all the customers always made my day. I got to know a lot of customers, and it was just an awesome feeling when they ask for you by name. I would have loved to stay there, but unfortunately it didn't work out."
good,i learned a lot and also taught all the manager in the dc what i new in the returns department.got along with everyone and did not have to much drama.
good,"Great company, plenty of chances for advancement if you have the right attitude and aren't afraid to work."
good,"I learned that sometimes, you need to be more careful about what you are delivering, and where it needs to be delivered. I have been doing just that."
good,Fast paced but great place to learn about automobiles and expand on hands on skills.
good,"A day at work would consist of providing excellent customer service to all customers. Listening and answering any questions to help assist all customers so they can make their best decision on repairs and purchases. Selling automotive parts is always exciting, because I have always loved cars and working on them. Automotive repairs and parts are second nature to me. The work environment is always professional and enthusiastic. The team is always there for one another and also competitive when it comes to sales. I strive on building a relationship with the customers so every customer feels that it is not only a business, but part of the community."

good,Working for this company allowed me to learn many facts about cars. Most of the things I learned helped me in my personal life in terms of when to do oil changes and when a new battery is needed. I enjoyed working with all my coworkers and appreciated the breaks throughout my shifts.
good,I love working for oreilly everyone is fun to be around we keep its a fun job i learn a lot about car parts
good,O'Reilly is a fast pace environment to work at. easy to get along with everyone. but working for the warehouse gets really hot during the summer time. but during fall and winter times it would get very cold there to work at. and they do recognize you for your accomplishments. but they were long hours to work.
good,Pretty cool because i want to be an auto/diesel technician. i also think the job will teach me a lot of new things and i will gain more knowledge for what i love.
good,As they are I moved up within the stores and had a very great time doing so. They wanted to see the store and everyone grow within and helped doing so with everything they offered.

good,"It's a great company to work for if you look to make a life-long career with a company. Many ways to advance, and to do it quick! Must be hard worker willing to put in much overtime, as you are treated with a lot of autonomy as if you own your store. Great benefits, and good pay for the job required. Can be stressful in slow seasons, because some pay is commission based, but preparing with long term goals makes the job less stressful."
good,I love working on automobiles so I enjoyed delivering parts to all the shops in town and getting to help make old cars new again. Watching the progress of each car was cool. Love being on the road too

good,Working at O Reillys taught me a lot about different parts and how they work. The managers were very helpful and were very willing to explain things when i needed help.
good,"o'reilly auto parts is an amazing place to work, and has a wonderful training environment for younger adults trying to learn in the workforce. A typical day for me at o'reillys was really fun, i met quite a few interesting people, and learned so much about vehicles. The management was outstanding, they were very understanding, and quite nice people. the hardest part of the job i would have to say is trying to explain to your customers what you can and can not do for them. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be learning everything that i did, because that is the most important part of a work experience for me."
good,"The only reason I left is because I had to work closer to home and there was nothing available for that. I miss it sometimes. I hate that some people had their own agenda but for the most part, the culture is amazing there!"
good,I really enjoyed working at the auto parts store  very fast paced environment friendly staff work area was clean the people were very hospitable and not rude
good,"Very productive environment, laid back break room, amazing co-workers, and most of all, awesome team work! I learned that no matter who you are everyone needs help sometimes. Management wasn't perfect but no one is. The hardest part of the job was finding places to put pallets that we had no room for. Everything was enjoyable about this job! What's not to love!"
good,"Oreilly is a Great Company to work for, at this time I feel  that I need to further my career and look at outside options and see what other companies have to offer."
good,Working at O'reilly Auto Parts has been an amazing experience. Its a great learning experience for people how don't know much about vehicles and want to step into the world of learning. For those that already know its a great way to keep up to date on new car models and communicate with others on how to maintain and repair newer model vehicles. I'd recommend this job for anyone whether they are interested in vehicles or not its an overall great work environment and the staff is friendly and welcoming to everyone.
good,Loved it great place to grow and the more self motivated you are the faster you grow with the company. Hardest part of the job is getting a customer that gives you the wrong information about a vehicle they are working on.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts has a great work culture focused on taking care of the team members first, and encouraging the team members to take care of the customers."
good,No problem very easy to speak to your bosses. Wages are kind of low but not bad in this market. Great place of business and the discounts are amazing. Benefits are expensive.

good,Would greatly recommend this company. Excellent workplace. Was able to excel in many areas and do more than just one job.
good,"O'Reilly Auto Parts was my favorite place to work. I was a Delivery Driver Specialist. My responsibilities included delivery and pick-up of auto parts, customer service and inventory checks. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and managers. My manager, at the time, was very open and understanding with personal issues and scheduling. He was very polite, nice, but professional. Being a delivery specialist you work not just with the people in the store but also with local mechanics and even going to different O'Reilly stores. Every O'Reillys store I've visited because of my position were very kind and helpful and make you feel part of their team as well. Aside from on the job training and skills it also teaches you life skills because many of your co-workers are knowledgeable in cars and their car parts. Also the mechanics teach you a few things about car parts, what their used for, when you'll need them. You also, at times, work closely with the district managers. With every single person you work with they really encourage you and make you really feel like an important asset to the team.

good,"Working there often gets you questions about mechanical skills. All too often we was asked questions that only a mechanic would know, we are sales associates in the store not mechanics. The company itself was a good place to work."
good,They are a great company to work for as long as it is not in a small town where you can only get hired if you know the manager or the DM i worked with them in Houston for 18 + years when i moved to Brownsville i figured since i had all the experience from Houston it would be easier to get in with the company again but every time I would apply for a position they would give me the run a rouound around

good,"Amazing experience and great discounts, great experience In learning various problems and correcting customers issues and great overall character building for customer service"
good,I believe just about every job your over worked and under paid. I loved working for this company. I pretty much did everything except run the place or first call. The only reason I left was at the time I had young children and couldn’t be home with them. My boss didn’t want to work with me and it’s not that I asked to take off or anything. I asked her after being there about 2 years if she can change my schedule to days. She had me working nights 3 days in a row. Other than that it’s a really good job. The pay should be more but it’s good to start off at.
good,Its fun with great employees. Our management is awesome and work with everyone round the store. God fearing people with good hearts. The whole place full of laugher and smiles. I love working here!!!!

good,everyday was wonderful working there i really enjoyed driving it made me so happy to know that i could fill the needs of the customers we all had fun working together managers and all
good,Good job it’s tiring but you’ll get used to it fast. Also they give you a thing where you can get an employee discount which is great. The only thing that sucks is that you only have 30 minute lunch not 1 hour.
good,"I enjoy working for this company right now, I went in with zero knowledge or experience with auto parts and they taught me everything and were so patient with me. I have grown very attached to my team and am sad to be looking else where but I am excited to start my career now."
good,Every day was different. You learned a lot from your co-workers. There is always something to do. It was like working with  family over time. Great company to have been apart of.

good,had to pick parts for the stores to deliver on the trucks make sure you pick the right part no matter what it is some of the are very heavy for one person to pick by themselves
good,Wants people who will step up and work hard.  Has continous training to make sure employees are up to date on all new products on the market.  Will look to promote within
good,I enjoyed working with the retail and comercial customers. Oreilly has so many opportunities to advance. They let me use my 20 + automotive experiance.
good,For the most part the benefits are ok but the pay isn't enough to live on and pay for health insurance unless you're in management...the hours are good for the most part
good,"Great company to work for, I love and enjoy every moment of it. They really treat there people well and always look to promote from within before hiring from without"

good,Its a very nice place to work at.The people there are nice friendly and i love the way we all work together. The work is not hard at all.

Never once have i ever been mistreated by any co-worker. My manager is very considerate if I need time off and very involved with all team members. The hardest part of my job is when we order parts and they don't show up and we have to tell the customer we do not have it, knowing they needed it like yesterday."
good,Always stay humble and ready for what’s next  never settle for less also it’s always a good idea to learn the people that you are around takes you a long way ..

good,"LOVED my job at O'Reilly Auto Parts!!"
good,Overall it’s your own space and time. I love the fact that employees treated other new employees like family. Customer service is nice and very helpful.
good,Fast growing corporate company that has stayed connected with their roots creating a family business like atmosphere.   The company started as a small family business in the 1957 and has maintained a promote from within approach to building itself to a corporate leader.   Having all the corporate decision makers with experience on the parts counter makes a big difference from top to bottom.
good,"Great place, Great management, Good Job. Lots of opportunity and fun people to work with. The job was fun and a learning experience. would work here again but compensation is poor."
good,"at o'reilly auto parts if you have a rough grasp of automotive knowledge, in a few months you can become a shade tree mechanic. With experienced workers and easy technology, you learn a lot"
good,There is constant on the job training and learning so your self development is always increasing. Went into the company not having extensive automotive knowledge but the training teaches you a lot and there is tenure within the stores so you will learn from all walks of life from Parts people to Service Writers to Installers that work for the company.
good,"I had a great experience working there, I loved the people. Helping customers and outside vendors was definitely the best part about the job, I worked closely with management and it was great to see them at work with their employees."

good,"An amazing place to work with great benefits. They work with your schedule, and you learn so much. I am currently in management, and the store I am located at has a fast pace, so you are always busy, and always learning something. I love it."
good,"Spent a lot of time with people of other generations. This gave me an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. This was a very fun work environment. There were goals and objectives for each team member, but upon completion there was compensation or a reward."
good,"Considering I've grown up knowing a lot about cars, this was by far my most favorite job EVER!! Would I go back?? YES! Most definitely.... Want to talk about being treated like a family these people know the true value of being the star employer!! I would most definitely recommend working for this company!!"
good,Only reason I left was because I had to relocate home.management there was understanding .my coworkers were excellent the store manager was nice but firm and about business
good,I worked with some real good people that helped me move up quickly and taught me a lot. I also got to help people with their automotive needs which was something that I have always liked doing.
good,"oreilly takes care of there employees, there is always something going on with the company  were any employee can be a part off. There is always opportunity for advancement."
good,"Certain Oreilly locations really radiate the culture we are supposed to have and in the locations, if you are lucky enough to be at, your coworkers will feel like family. I love my job and most of us pull our weight. But there will always be a weakest link. It’s up to them if they leave or become better. The benefits are great and the company overall is a great one to work for. It doesn’t take long to advance in this company if you work hard."
good,"Working at O'Reilly, my first manager was actually someone I can trust and would work for again. They will teach you about automotive parts and retail"
good,"O'Reilly very well might be the best company I will ever work for in my entire life. I cannot put into words the amount of knowledge and skills I was given while working for this company. They take care of their people, they take care of their customers, and I never leave work feeling bad for not being able to take care of my customers and their problems. We will always make it work and never say no is most certainly the truth."
good,Typical day at oreillys auto parts. i would clock in at nine. wait for the merchandise truck to pull in. they would drop pallets off. we would scan every product into the computer. then when finished the team would put everything in proper place. when finished we would clock out at 5 am and proceed home

Being able to answer questions most people wouldn't think twice about asking a ""girl"" but this ""girl"" lives to work on cars!

good,"lots of people. Each and everyday there was something new to look forward to!he culture was laid back, the pay was not a lot but u didn't do that much, i was a night manager and i didn't like the hours . the hardest part of the job was the turn around on people and it looks like they hired anyone he says it all. Best job in the world if money is not important to you. Hours are flexible. Typical 5 day,8 hour shifts with a break. Able to make your own decisions. Decent benefits. Hardest part of the job is when customers come in with a broken part."

good,good job never stressed gained friends was home by 9pm every day only thing i  would change would be the inventory system it is stinn in a green screen

good,My time at oreilly was a great experience the people there were great. The very first day working there was fantastic the people and the environment made me feel at home. The people there would feel like family and getting to know your customers was also a plus because you would memorize their name when they would come through the door made them feel welcomed. I could go on and on but I would recommend this job to anyone that shares the passion of cars and wants to feel appreciated.
good,i had fun learning more about sales and more about the people working there they had a great motive and they are nice to ever one that entered the doors
good,"This is a great company to work for and I hated to leave, but my school schedule forced me to make a decision. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Make sure you work in a nicer area as the customer base will be friendlier and make your life easier."
good,i would defintiley recommend anyone to work here so much fun get bonuses. the managers are not stressed about the job super eaSY GOING...NOT A LIFE SENTENCE THO OF COURSE
good,"I don't agree with the Temporary position at O'Reilly it is a bit conflicting. With in that time frame (6mos) if they don't hire you, they want, they will have to let you go. Overall it is a fast paced company I enjoyed my time there. Now I am out searching for a more career advancement"
good,very productive and never was bored orwithout work i really loved the job it was just extremely hot in summer time of course because it is a warehouse and i was pregnant at the time and couldnt take the heat butover all a fantastic work environment and staff and great pay with benefits

good,"Delivering parts and supplies to customers in a timely manner. Learning locations, types of clients, and very fun to work there at O'Reilly's. There are all kinds of cultures working there to help with all types of customers. The hardest part would be, there is no room to put supplies and parts. We need a bigger store and a more organized store. There are some good suggestions to help customers keep up with their purchases. Such as, having a wallet card or key chain card to keep up with the purchases for the customers. This way, no one certain person has to keep up with the customers products they have purchased."
good,Amazing company to work for. I loved working there! Sometimes it got crazy and overwhelming but some how we always managed to get through the week! Amazing team staff always looking after one another
good,i would scan in truck. sort everything by ales in totes. then stock the whole store. i would also do deliveries for other o'reilly stores. also for shops around the area.

good,"I came to the Greenville store about 4 or 5 months ago.They were in shrinkage for the last three to five years. It took me two months to get the store out of shrinkage, the inventory was always 5,000 to 6,000 short all the time and our last inventory this year  we were less than 1,000 and still found more to the good. I feel they will use your abilities but not pay for them. I was wanting to get my own store, but I changed my mind seeing how they operate. I have had to learn a lot on my own as far as being manager. I'm just looking for something new and not as stressful. I work hard at everything I do. I have excellent customer service , work ethics, etc."
good,"Overall, I think it’s a great company to work for. Great benefits along with great culture. There are options to be able to advance higher up in the company as well."

good,There were a lot of opportunities for advancement and management was always willing to have their people succeed. A lot of training available. Team environment.
good,This was a job through high school program.  I only worked about 2 hours a hour.  Everyone was helpful and understanding. And fun to work with.  Taught me about responsibility.

Management and supervisors always made sure we where a team once it came down to working and coming together."
good,the delivery driver position was awesome and fun to do got to talk a lot of people but people would call in on us and that was not fair . Driver would cut us off and then call in and blame us for mistakes they committed.

Hardest part was probably the walking and standing the whole time other than the breaks and lunch but that was the only downfall. Really loved working there but had to quit due to me moving to a different state. I learned how to drive the city counter boat and the order picker (which was my favorite thing to do)
good,I loved working here learning new things about cars everyday. I also enjoyed going to work knowing i was meeting new people everyday. But it just came down to it that I wasn't getting treat right thru the company so I had to do what was best for me.
good,"I love working for Orielly. It taught me a lot of skills that I needed."

good,"Loved working for this company there are multiple opportunities to promote oneself. Everyone there was kind and don't mind helping each other out when needed. We were puller and made sure every product that was ordered was returned by each designated cut off time. Management were really friendly as well and didn't mind lifting a hand to help others who were falling behind due to large amount if orders. The hardest part was just the heat but that was easy to get use to we usually just made sure we all stay hydrated, we always had gaterade or water stationed in or department and through out the warehouse at all times. I enjoyed doing my work as time went by quickly and smoothly. Everyone became a family together."

good,I started out as a PT key holder and within 7 months I was promoted to assistant manager. Four months later I was promoted to store manager at a different location. Then the further my career went on with the company I managed the store that I started at and then was asked to move to manage a mini warehouse and store. The most favorite part of my job was seeing different people daily and beating the targets that were given. The company also has a great culture. Advancement was incredible.
good,I have worked for this company for 14 years and the culture is what has kept me here.  They believe in promoting from within and I have worked many positions over the years.  I started out as a delivery specialist and worked my way up to store manager.  I no longer work in the operations side of the company as I am now working outside sales.

good,"Oreilly Auto Parts is a great job to learn about customer service, marketing, interpersonal skills, problem-solving, and patience. Being the family mechanic for a rather large family, I always dealt with parts. I enjoyed working with a company like Oreilly's. The only downfall is being in retail did not provide enough compensation for me to build a family, own a house, or have children. I was raised with my grandparents which instilled a certain sense of loyalty to the company that is providing for you and it is unfortunate that I have to leave them after four years. Although, I am very excited to start a career that would be able to provide what I need to build a family, etc. I would recommend Orielly Auto Parts to anyone looking for a starter job out of high school to gain an understanding of business and marketing."

I'll tell you what this company bought out murrays, but is as close as you'll get to that neighborly feeling. it is a great company, but unless you get into the corporate side,or get a store management position, the pay will only be decent.

I work with an amazing group of guys they all know what they are doing and what they plan on doing. The management is an amazing so far one of the best managed companies I have worked for. The hardest part about being a parts specialties is when someone asks something you don't know you never wanna tell them something that is wrong for example I have had a guy ask me something about the diesel fuel in his truck how it was jelling up "" i told him i don't know very much about diesel engines but I will try my best to help u as much as I can"" he respected that and complimented me on my honesty with him.

Customers, workers, management, everyone got along and knew what to do and everyone was family."

Always tried to maintain good relations with my coworkers, including the Manager.  When we had a disagreement about what was the best thing to do, we came to an agreement as to the best way to handle it.
