rating,review
bad,"This company mistreats minority employees and will hinder your growth.  There a 0 African Americans recruiting professionals  in HR.  In speaking with other employees,  they also share the same view."
bad,Realogy is the worst company i have ever worked for. The management is only focused on each other instead of focusing on the employee and HR seems to back them up
bad,Join this company only if you need to list something on your resume. Get some experience and leave before they burn you out. Perfect company if you don't have a family. Medical coverage has got to be one of the worse for a huge company. Raise are 2% at most but medical goes up every year. Don't count on H/R for help ( read glassdoor about H/R). Most employees handle the work load of two people.  No bonus for hourly employees. And Communication does not exist.  I do not understand how this companies win the most ethical award. Honestly i just can't figure that one out. I really wish the board members would do some kind of under boss like event in this place.
bad,I did not like the fact that when I wanted to move up in the company they would move me around so I decided to move myself around. The supervisor I had have her favorite picks.
bad,Compensation is lower than most. Benefits are similar to most; nothing really stands out. Career advancement does not happen too often. Many departments operate as silos. Not a fun place to work.
bad,"No room for advancement, worked hard did not get bonus. Uneducated workers"
bad,"Fast paced, unforgiving culture and lack of respect for sales people. No life outside the company and no time for personal life is accepted. Just a poor experience."
bad,"Authoritarian CEO"
bad,"Now that I have a new job in a healthy work environment, I look back and realize that Realogy knows exactly what to say and do to impress everyone except the full time, long term employees. The facade has worked really well with job candidates, the press, college interns, trade associations, and philanthropic organizations. Every single action made is purely for a photo opp and a press release. Managers who foster a hostile work environment are paraded around like heroes to distract from the fact that they're actually really horrible people. Doing good work and producing real results doesn't matter. Management respects people who are overly aggressive, rather than kind-hearted, down to earth professionals who are the best at what they do. Across the board, people are paranoid about losing their jobs and feel the need to prove themselves which is also creating a nasty work environment. The negativity is spreading like wildfire and it's sad to say that most of the good people are leaving as soon as they get another job."
bad,"the office is nice - near Bloomingdale's on E 59th and very convenient. I have spoken to my manager perhaps thrice in 16 months.  zero actionable support, process, tools, or structure."
bad,"Company culture is driven from the top down, and the senior executives treat employees like they are a hassle, not an asset. Cliquey, heavily political, back stabby."
bad,HR lacks support of employees lower than top-tier.  Many open-ended investigations for employees that complained about their supervisors.  Lack of female support in the IT department. Many employees did not get annual reviews for years.
bad,I was a contractor for a short time at Realogy. The staff seemed very tense and reserved when upper management was around. It was not a comfortable atmosphere. All the seating was in an open area surrounded by glass offices with upper management. There were layoffs going on while I was there.
bad,"""Leadership"" is not qualified but promoted for cheerleading upper management.  Very little room for advancement; culture is very much a sorority.  Focus is not on delivering exceptional work or being innovative although both are heralded as though they exist.  Realogy purchases an annual ""Ethical Company"" designation...and that's where it ends."
bad,Newer management and CIO make this place unbearable to work at. Staff is overworked and expected to take more on. No communication among management and upper management.
bad,"The culture is horrible and management is out of touch.    HR does not care for employees, so bringing concerns to their attention is a waste of time."
bad,Realogy provides little to no benefit of continued education if outside the corporate headquarters.  Constant threat of layoffs and an expectation to work long days.
bad,"The company expects more and more from its employees but gives less and less.  Raises are horrible and and have been for years often not even covering the rise in cost of your health benefits.  When decisions are made that will upset the employees, those decisions are not communicated to the employees and when questions are asked, management ignores them because they feel we are not worth an explanation."
bad,"Realogy or Coldwell Banker takes advantage of its employees to the fullest. No communication from upper management and supervisors donâ€™t offer assistance "
bad,This summer they just cut their workforce by half transferring jobs to 3rd party vendor for pennies on the dollar. Upper management has no idea what the job entails with most not having a real estate background. Going above and beyond as an employee means nothing if you want a promotion. Lower management spend day on the internet avoiding helping anybody that may need it. Training is terrible
bad,"A typical day at work included fast paced work learning to prioritize at a new level depending on need or request.  Management is not supportive or encouraging and all about what you can do for them.  They do not care the least bit if you are overburdened.  They only care if the numbers look right, so they will look good.  Essentially, the job entails making money for others and you will be just a number.  They do not respect women and do not value education.  The hardest part was trying to get everything done in a day and the most enjoyable part of the job was the rare, but appreciative Tenants and Owners who valued a detailed, personable, and educated professional who had their best interests at heart."
bad,Having spent 14 months with this organization as a commission-based broker I found little to no support within their system. Two managing directors were terminated including one senior level director who was in charge of the state. Minimal oversight given and after I left there was a 40% turnover within two regional offices. In spite of an intense campaign to solicit new business the organization had marginal success in 2011 -2012.
bad,Managements only concern is money and they are always cracking the whip. Many work life balance privileges were taken away from our department but it was good for a while. It's become a nightmare and not a place I would recommend.
bad,The company had just split into different divisions and there was quite a bit of disorganization.  I really liked the people I worked with.  Everyone tried to help each other out.
bad,There was no room for growth and dead end job went on several interviews and  was declined each time not much opportunity for growth within the department and within the company a lot of Outsourcing of jobs and layoffs
bad,"Help Desk department (recently outsourced) was a career dead-end."
bad,"HR is beholden to Executives so if you do experience harassment do not engage HR.  I witnessed a couple of situations a Vice President ""hitting"" on subordinates, creating a ""no win"" situation for the employee.  On one occasion the alleged victim was terminated. It is a decent company but will require political maneuvering with older white men to advance within the profession. A great place to learn about the industry and the franchise model. It needs a culture change but ethics are stressed from the top down."
bad,Unreasonable expectations surrounding workload.  Constant pressure to keep the pace with little or no respites.  Poor work life balance.  Benefits and paid time off were average for the size company.
bad,"Good work life balance.  The company is extremely philanthropic.  Depending on which department you work in, your hard work and efforts could go unrecognized and your workload can continue to increase without any relief or concern by upper management."
good,"Realogy dictates the company as a whole follows the strict guidelines in having the most Ethical company in the world. I have seen and been involved with pushing matters to the side that needed to be addressed. Managment abuses their coworkers with empty threats of lay offs in order to get the employees do to their job with being fired on the employees mind, company has very low morale."
good,Wish this company valued their talent more. There are a great group of people who are very talented that have been reduced to just coming to a job for a paycheck. When you loik into their eye you can see they once had dreams being at this company.
good,"Started off as a fun exciting place to work, but that has gradually deteriorated. Company is not doing well and this is evident in the consistent employee turnover. Just not a great place to be anymore."
good,"Majority of team are disgruntled and overly negative.  Management claim they want to hire qualified individuals but then treat them like small children.  There's high employee turn-over because of this hostile work environment created by Managers/Directors that would rather gossip about staff than act professionally and respond to staff feedback.  Training program is non-existent and seems disorganized.  Processes are in place and technology is available but are under-utilized causing major inefficiencies.  Managers are used to an archaic method and are resistant to change. Processes should be properly explained to all team members and there should be uniformity.  But there isn't.  There are constant policy changes that aren't explained to staff, which makes training new staff problematic."
good,"Job is ok. Lots of drama and pettiness which can make for an uncomfortable work environment; managers can be difficult; health benefits have changed multiple times since being employed there - getting more expensive while covering less; pay is far from competitive or comparable to other companies; depending on position there's not much flexibility with hours, as well as no bonuses for some while others get thousands; lousy raises that often don't make up for cost of living increases. Your employment, and how ""good"" it can be, will depend on your attitude and what you're willing to deal with."
good,A typical day at work is very busy filled with meetings.  A good group of co-workers helps to make the day go by while still being able to focus on the job at hand.
good,The department was out sourced.  Very little time was spent on training and working with new applications.  The department was not properly prepared...
good,"Place referrals, multitask between programs managing real estate transactions. unorganized and lack of training. every man for himself kind of environment."
good,"The company needs fewer high paid executives micro-managing and more concern for updating very outdated technology and providing REAL training (not just shadowing) for workers."
good,"good team good work and open door policy.  Allows you to speak your mind. if you have big 4 experience, this is perfect place to go to as they do not like training anyone  they expect people to just hit the curb running."
good,"In my opinion, employees account for 50% of the success of any company. The other 50% is attributable to its leaders. Change in a company's culture causes its leaders to also change in how they operate the business. They begin to manage rather than lead as they once did and no longer guide their employees to understand and adapt to the change and the new expectations, and how to become the best they can be in their current or changing role. As a result, the once committed and loyal employees begin feeling undervalued and unappreciated for the knowledge they possess. There is no more coaching, mentoring or encouragement because the demands of the changed culture does not allow the time to lead which ultimately does not have positive results in the long term.  "
good,"A typical day consist of making appointments and meeting with end users all around the Bay Area to assist with printing issues, email setups and new PC setups. A big benefit from this job was that I was able to learn and navigate Mac OS's and different Mac Products that I didn't have much experience with. The most enjoyable part of my job is fixing issues for end users and seeing smiles and relief on their faces."
good,Management did not support new field technician with constructive criticism or leadership when problems developed. Communication was lacking and unreasonable accountability was demanded when conflicts arose.
good,"OK place to work depending on which group you are in."
good,"IT Helpdesk was outsources to another company, for less money of course. So support went from great to users constantly complaining to deaf ears. The pay was ok but 1 to 2% increases a year hurts, especially for the hard work and multiple hats you are asked to wear. OK for a paycheck but not a long career move."
good,"The culture was to work as an Indepent IT Support Analyst, to train yourself on new application roll-outs(minimum training) to manage yourself, minimum interaction with supervisors and managers. DO your job show up on time and you would not have a problem."
good,New leadership bringing fresh ideas to stimulate growth.  Company is on a good path; needs to continue making tough decisions on talent.  A bit to New Jersey centric.
good,"It  was  temporary  job for  me.  People  was  nice  helpful  except  for  one  of  manager. Relaxed, no one  standing  over  your  shoulders. Lots  of  emails  for  vendors  and  brokers  it  was  tax  seasons. Repetitive data entry. Hour  lunch, leave early   on  Friday, take  a  break whenever you  want."
good,"Working at Realogy was a new earning experience for me in real estate. I enjoyed the comradery and exposure to many new nuances of the industry. The town hall meetings were a corroborative means of sharing communications throughout the company. I did not find my duties as challenging and expressive as I would have liked. I felt my duties were micromanaged and I would encourage change in that area, at least in the department I worked in."
good,Lots of changes driven by market conditions.  Must be comfortable with fast moving shifts in brand marketing.  Must be comfortable with self driven project responsibilities.
good,"Tough industry, major leadership changes are helping.  Good example of developing leadership pipeline.  Needs to aggressively pursue more innovation in aging industry."
good,I really have nothing I want to share about working for this company. You would need to work here and form your own opinion.
good,"This desk is ran link an overseas call center rather than a functional superior Service Desk. A desk should have a strong operations manager/team and care more about customer service and quality over quantity. If you're concerned with numbers then you might as well call it what it is - a call center, not a Help Desk. Operation wise this place could use an entire overhaul as well as possible outsourcing this entire desk off-shore."
good,was ok to work at. good work life balance. madison is a very suburban place to live in. no city life. although morristown is close by so that is a good thing.
good,"cold calling realtors, setting up follow-up meetings, core consultative selling atmosphere."
good,A typical day at work was rewarding when knowing clients were happy with the assistance they were given and appreciated it.
good,Great people to work with but stuffy atmosphere. The commute was also almost an hour plus.
good,"Large company, room for advancement. Worked there for 10 years and made allot of long term friends not to mention references that have helped me get jobs in the past."
good,I work a full-time service desk position involving phone and remote support. A typical day involves accepting incoming phone calls from real estate brokerage firms across the United States.
good,"Very flexible with family, great employees all over the world to help.  Work from home experience. Vacation, PTO and sick leave earned every pay period. since I wasn't directly under Realogy the pay raises were not very often."
good,"I managed technology teams located in Florida, Maryland, Minnesota and Massachusetts-  and was responsible for all telecommunications systems- PBX, vendors and Telco's for Southeast, Southwest, Mid-west, Mid-Atlantic and New England states.  We were headquartered in New Jersey but was able to forge a great team covering all of the regions- working to include all of the US offices  (over 1000 Real Estate offices)"
good,Answer and resolve internal and external users password account lockouts and resets. Troubleshoot and resolve wireless devices.
good,"You have no education, or previous experience in the field. This organization does a poor job at selecting supervisors and managers with leadership skills. Good pay, but the company hasn't given bonuses in 3 years."
good,Realogy is a great place to work.  Employed with the company for over 5 years. Realogy helped me with going back to school to get more training. It sad we are being displaced.
good,Each issue the Agents called in for had a specific department to assign incidents to.  I was basically a glorified admin. assistant who could reset passwords and help people with access to Microsoft 365.
good,"You are either in the all-boys club that runs the company, gets the raises and additional benefits or you aren't. Which is why I am seeking a new position."
good,"The job was easy and the people were nice to work with.  Although they say they are voted best in ethics, they are not a very transparent company, leaving you in the dark about so many critical things.  The company was a great place to work, but upper management is sketchy with supplying needed information regarding the business and your job. Upper management was rarely visible and in touch when needed."
good,"I have been with Realogy for 10 years.  I have enjoyed working for the company and believe they are determined to succeed.  "
good,"I don't like the way that my manger handle the way that I was released. I know it was more personal than business."
good,"Its a solid company, with allows folks to grow.  I think it is a good place to work, and allows employees access to opportunities they may not be afforded in other organizations."
good,Realogy is not an easy company to work for. You get compensated very well but work environment can be very stressful. Employees are nice people and very helpful l to each other
good,The best part of the work day is it always goes by so quickly. It can be fun and challenging and keeps you on your toes. Co-workers are great and supportive as is the mgmt.
good,"Good benefits, great environment. Employee morale is high. Danbury Cartus office is well run and most departments are accepting of innovation ideas."
good,"Account Management of an extensive book of business.  Strategically plan and execute upon business and marketing initiatives.  When I am not in the office, I am traveling around the country, attending and exhibiting at industry tradeshows and events."
good,They nurture your professional development more than I've ever seen or heard of at any company.
good,When I first started working I new very little about Real Estate and Legal issues. Since working at Realogy I have learned alot about the business
good,What I really loved about the job but itâ€™s very laid-back you donâ€™t have to dress up very comfortable people are cool but thereâ€™s no advancement here. The  salary is decent but thereâ€™s no advancement youâ€™re stuck in your department or just shuffle to the next department
good,"While the company is great to work for, it can be overwhelmingly at times. Much of the work is outside of the original job description. Amount of time given to the position doesnâ€™t provide fair compensation."
good,"Working at Realogy I have learned a lot and made so many collogue and friends. Enjoyed working out at building during lunch time and feel relaxed."
good,"The company challenges you to do your best, and to strech yourself to ultimate capabilities."
good,"Low stress environment for the most part."
good,"answer e-mails work on files for sales and brand deals for C21 Real Estate Franchise.  Great co-workers, have taught me how to balance the priorities between Brand and Sales deals.  Best part of day is being able to have positive interactions with our Franchisees."
good,"Stressful handling customer complaints daily."
good,"â€¢ï€ ï€ ï€ Indentified and resolved vendor purchase orders to ensure timely payment."
good,Great atmosphere and wonderful management. Work is distributed at the start of each day and we would begin to examine the applicants mortgage information. 
good,"Very busy position in facilities/property management. Many phone calls to resolve problems daily. Upper Management were supportive. Hardest part of the job facility moves. Enjoyable part to be able to communicate with others and resolve their problems and facility walkthroughs on Friday's. Learned some acccounting, property management and facilities management. Enjoyed free lunches, the exercise room, healthcare, location close to residence and bonus structure."
good,"Managers didn't provide training, Large caseloads in a large room with too many people. Noisy environment, encouraged or given  any credit for helping other employees with their caseload. never"
good,I have very few things that are bad about this place. The balance is great and you can ask for a shift you prefer if it is opened up. People here are not grumpy. Even the management is nice and they do micro-manage
good,"I was based in the field, meaning I was only at the greater NYC headquarters once or twice a month.  A typical week for me involves domestic travel to meet with Owner/Brokers, Developers, Architects, Construction Managers, Interior Designers,and Politicians.  I focused on Site Selection for new offices, and all necessary due diligence involved in the process.  I cultivated relationships from 'Cradle to Grave', and once the offices were opened, I transitioned into Mergers, Acquisitions, and Joint Ventures with other culturally aligned companies within that region.  We provided internal financing to help companies acquire and grow market share."
good,"Excellent culture and benefits. SVP and above leadership is fantastic however middle management's focus is more on image/perception than their specific job duties. In my observed opinion, results-oriented performance is not considered a pre-requisite for interdepartmental advancement."
good,I have been a consultant here for 18 months.  I really enjoy my job and environment.  The management staff that I work for are great at coaching and are technically astute.  Their competencies reduce the amount of stress on the job...
good,"Time stayed there was the best time of my career. I want to say that when I was there, I was able to interact with lots of people in different departments at company holidays."
good,"Typical work day was dealing with brokers and deadlines for the real estate side of the business."
good,Worked with a great group of people who were collaborative and engaging.  Ability to work remotely was a large plus.  I was provided with the tools and assistance to excel.
good,Once you get used to the environment it feels good.  It is good that you don't work in a cubical or have a manager down your neck.. but.. there are times when too much exposure to a manager is bad
good,"If you are not in IT, you will love it, as a helpdesk person, missed out on some of the culture there. I saw the overall work place morale, and spirit de corps, was good."
good,I enjoyed working with this department and even though there was a lot of different tasks and job responsibilities it was still a good company to work for.
good,Overall this is a great place to work. I learned the ins and outs of the Real Franchise Business.
good,It was a very productive office but even at that it was an office that worked as a team with different departments for activation and decommission of circuits.
good,Temp position where we worked as a team to process documents needed. It was enjoyable work and like the people I worked with. I liked having to read the agreements to confirm if needed.
good,"Incredible executive group, that is both extremely shrewd and exceptionally humane. This is a place where if you work hard, and youâ€™re talented youâ€™re gonna make a name for yourself."
good,"typical day at Realogy wire Dept.  wires came in and  we audited them, the processed and then approved. what I learned is that 21 people can and do work well as a team when we all have the same goal."
good,I enjoyed my time at Realogy.  I held various roles over the years and learned from professionals in various cross functional teams.  I would highly recommend Realogy.
good,Superlative leadership team sets the tone for a great and forward-looking company built on rubrics of integrity and deep industry knowledge but still seeking and leveraging latest technology to grow even more.
good,"â€¢	Operate as service point-of-contact for help-desk, helping to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve approximately 10 tickets per day. "
good,Had a great time working at Realogy and was able to increase my skills and experience.
good,I have been with Realogy since 2007 and they have treated me very well. I am looking for new opportunities while I am working on my MBA to gain more experience otherwise I would not be looking elsewhere for work.
good,"Working for Realogy is a unique experience in the corporate world, Realogy's employees are known for a high skill set and level of professionalism.  The experience is priceless."
good,You have to make sure to advance in the company because there are a lot of layoffs.  The company always makes sure to cut jobs before they cut the higher ups that do not add to much.
good,"Great org that cares about their employees!  Glad to be part of this company.  The people are terrific and the focus on the community, ethics and diversity is wonderful."
good,You are called upon to wear many hats in a very fast-paced and ever-changing environment. The workplace culture is demanding and stretches all aspects of one's business and management acumen.
good,Great company to work for. Worked there for 14+ years. Long term good place to work for. Providing work life balance a priority for the company.
good,I will work there in future if they offer me a different position. Great ethnic company .Great employees. Beautiful facility and location. Give great holiday parties. Chance for advancement through out the company.
good,"Most ethical group of people, taking Real Estate to the next level!"
good,"Typical close period days for me: Is mainly one of receiving and pulling information from various sources, ie, Oracle AR/GL and/or the Business Technology Team. This information is then reviewed and journalized accordingly before being sent to the Accounting Manager or Director for posting. (Most International Account entries go to the Director for posting). This is any where from a four to six day process.  During this time BS accounts are previewed for any discrepancies that could range from unexpected entries or intermittent entries by the Finance Team. "
good,"Busy and productive environment."
good,I liked my manager.  He made it a good place to work.  I was an IT Field Tech and I liked going to the different offices.  It helped keep my morale up.
good,I liked my manager.  He made it a good place to work.  I was an IT Field Tech and I liked going to the different offices.  It helped keep my morale up.
good,"Realogy employs lovely people and is in a great location. The work was simply not challenging to me, but the pay did commensurate with the responsibility."
good,"The company has a great culture, people are nice and willing to help and teach. Managers and directors are easily accessible for suggestions. The company offers a great personal life-work balance."
good,I enjoyed all my years at Realogy and hope to be able tm return 1 day.
good,"Really was a great place to work. I worked with amazing, smart and hard working people on my team. Our group was very busy, but we still found a way to have fun :).  I learned a lot about real estate franchise and trademark infringements, I got to work with new databases that I never used before. "
good,Developed and designed training materials for realtors and their brokers on how to use new electronic tools in their business.  Helped to increase their 'book of business by learning these e-tools.
good,"Great company to work for, great environment, company treats employees well and fair. However, job security lacking. Corporate structure. Great Benefits."
good,Great working here is great. Good opportunities. Laid back environment. Good location. If come in as a contractor try to get hired asap!! Laid back bosses.
good,"I liked many things at Realogy.  The People were friendly and professional.  My daily tasks were: ticket queue monitoring, issue resolution.  design and implementation.  Meetings, reports, etc."
good,Senior management takes no consideration of its lower level employees.  They will hire and fire indiscriminately with little to no warning and without even alerting your management or director.
good,"I have learned a lot about real estate, you must be detail oriented, very accurate, the typical day is like very busy entering data into the system and downloading information from other site.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you work with a piece of mind, very good environment and a great place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful."
good,"A typical work day at Realogy I consider to always be a busy day with great working environment. When work day is this busy, I consider it to be a great day because by the time you know it, the day is over already without feeling the time. Realogy taught me a lot when it comes to interacting with end users, working with management from director all the way down to the newest employee since we all get along pretty good. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with angry with angry users since our job is to make them happy by providing the support they need to be happy again."
good,High volume work load on a daily basis.  Wonderful management and coworkers. I learned many different aspects of the Real Estate and Franchise Industry.  Enjoyed my experience at Realogy.
good,"Realogy Holdings Corporation is our parents company. "

good,"Great company to work for, cares about your professional development as well as your personal life. There is a lot of growth potential and room to advance within."
good,Enjoyed working in the Network Run security group. Learned Juniper and Fortinet firewalls. I was on a short contract project with the company but from what I saw while I was there it was a wonderful and respectful atmosphere.
good,A peaceful working environment with nice management and easy going people. What I really love about this job is the fact that I always can't wait for day to break to go work due to the fact that I get to deal with different people on a daily basis and the fact that I  always encounter different issues when talking to my clients.
good,"An excellent team to work with. The company is highly focused on ethics and keeping a healthy work environment. No routine, very dynamic and intellectually challenging."
good,"A typical work day includes negotiating client contracts, consulting with lenders and escrow companies and cold calling."
