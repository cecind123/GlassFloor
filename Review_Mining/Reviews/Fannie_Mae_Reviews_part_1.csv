bad,"Don't waste your time. This is a company that will use you and toss you aside when they don't need you anymore. Upper management is good but  I've seen much better. They implemented the philosophy called WoW Way of Working. It's horrible! It should be called MoM Micro of Management because it's a micro-management philosophy. It's designed to root out anyone that is not a Yes man (or woman). If you have the audacity to question one thing, you're labeled a troublemaker. And everything is based on metrics. The only reason managers are there is to go to meetings. That's really all they do. They're not needed as most departments can work successfully without them. "
bad,Fannie Mae as a comapny has very good benefits.  But the manager that I reported to was not good at all.  Although i worked 15 to 16 hours a day he was only stuck on the fact that i had to pick my kids and drop them off at home around 3:00 PM and be at work back at 3:45PM.  Fannie as a company has a benefit that gives employees that flexibility.  The company is filled with managers that micromanage if the employees physical presence than the actual work they do.  Because of the benefits the company has i would love to go back and work there anytime provided the team is good.
bad,Do not work here unfair work environment management is awful extreme corporate management people cannot advance never ever recommend the absolute horrible place
bad,"My last assignment was Remote with 50% travel - great job. My other assignments were in the office and the culture was great and collaborative, a real team environment."
bad,"Very bureaucratic. Discrimination. Racism. Backstabbing. Lack of career progression. Too much pretense. "
bad,"Very weak, No focus, Limited insight, very bad culture, no mobility very bad environment"
bad,Fannie Mae is completely mismanaged.  The biggest problem is people there are almost like government workers with the entitlement and knowledge they won't get fired.  The tech organization is poorly run and lack of focus.  I would stay far away from them as a company.
bad,"Treated contractors like they were unworthy of working there. Contractors were not allowed to park in certain areas in the parking garage sometimes there were no places to park. Parking in the surrounding area would result in being towed. "
bad,"Management does not care about its employees or their interests. They just expect them to work 15-16 hours a day and keep producing. They never back you up. You have to fight to justify your work. They work you like dogs and they do not pay overtime. So be prepared for long hours of work, with no direction from management and no support. One big clueless company with no direction and Capitalism at its peak."
bad,"A typical day includes dodging the many bullets and knives being thrown front and back. Extremely cutthroat and riddled with unethical behavior and activities."
bad,Fire drills and choas reigns.  There are many good people but culture has not changed from days of high turnover.
bad,"The culture at Fannie Mae has been in place for decades and still resists attempts to make positive changes. Fannie Mae took advantage of the federal bail-out, going on an employee and consultant spending spree that brought them many new employees who had the capability of changing the culture. Instead of keeping open minds, management decided to eliminate the very people who could have made a difference and saved the company. It should be dissolved and liquidated as soon as possible for abuse of taxpayer funding."
bad,Highly toxic environment with incompetent management and unprofessional behaviors. Promotions are based on relationships instead of domain acumen. Significant amount of bloat in the organization and both middle and upper management use IT buzzwords without having any idea as to what they mean. This company needs tremendous cleanup and officers need to take action and accountability for bad behaviors which have resulted in a horribly toxic environment.
bad,"Lack diversity, don't want to change environment  for better, race discrimination is a constant them, over paid over retirement age employees who lack up to date skill set to advance company growth.  Race discrimination  not only witg employment but also with housing community and lending. Inappropriate behavior by management is condoned. Overall company is not a place that is for communities it serves, people, or employees."
bad,"Fannie Mae promotes a culture of micro-management, led by dinosaurs who are unwilling to embrace change.  They make statements and announcements about embracing change and new ideas, but it is all smoke and mirrors.  "
bad,I worked for The Fannie Mae Contractor Pomroy. IT was bad Morale and the lowest paid IT job f my career. No one stays there long because the pay was near the poverty level. # months was too long for me.
bad,This place is a train wreck. They are not interested in best practices or improving computer processes. Frustrating place to work. Constantly being told to not upgrade or update more efficient processes.
bad,"Poor Planning, Poor Management, No Training Worth While, No real Advancement, Team Members and Management Don't Listen to Suggestion for Industry Std f"
bad,"My experience working at Fannie Mae was horrible. I was treated with hatred, bigotry and ambiguity by co-workers. Management and HR did nothing. Actually took the side and lied for the perpetrators. Minorities are not welcome and I certainly felt that way. I witnessed whites sleeping on the job, watching moves and sports for hours at a time and taking over two hour lunches. Management was unconcerned about what whites did and fired highly qualified minorities for no reason and made their jobs impossible to accomplish. But if you're white your job is secure and you probably love your job and have job security and only great things to say about Fannie Mae."
bad,Management asked for added tasks and penalized you for your methods or efforts. There was no work-life balance and when asked to spend added efforts on tasks... no feedback was given prior to penalizing employees.
bad,This is not a great place to work.  Diversity is a joke.  I really don't have one hundred and fifty characters to describe this work environment.  Caution!
bad,Laid back environment with very little possibility for job advancement. Strict hours of operations with lots of bureaucracy and paperwork involved.
bad,"The most difficult aspect of this job was that the client would not spend the money necessary to build a program that would sync the operations. Therefore, skilled employees were cutting and pasting all day, taking a toll on morale."
bad,Well i didnt learn anything .they always want u to move fast they always got smart with me i will never go back there in work.In kim was not a nice person for her to be a manager.
bad,My manager would do everything in his power to steal my ideas of improvement and to make my life miserable. I would make suggestions in one on one meetings and he would explain how it wouldn't work. To then turn around and give those same ideas to his manager.
bad,"I worked for CGI, and my client was Fannie Mae. CGI was a good place but they are a sub contracting agency. Only so much they can do. Fannie Mae decided to move my project internal without adequate warning."
bad,"High stress due to tight timelines. Bad place to work"
bad,No productive work. Only tickets tickets and tickets. You're hired as a engineer but you only do operation work. Lead acts as a manager and assign you random work.
bad,Terrible management. Lack of communication. No room for growth. Would work on scheduling meetings only to have chief of staff go into calendar and change meetings without letting anyone know.
bad,"During short time there I had 6 bosses, two whom were in Washington, so many reorgs. Moving Washington office to downtown with more layoffs to come. Dallas office also moving as well."
bad,Work here if you are a white male.  Only way you'll get ahead.  Look at the leadership team of the company.  All white guys.  HR department is full of discriminatory behavior.  The guy who runs it is unethical.
bad,This company is so unbelievably incompetent they cannot get rid of their poor performers because they have no way of identifying their poor performers. Employees get shuffled around from project to project or even promoted if their boss thinks they are incompetent because it's almost impossible to fire anyone.
bad,"It was my most challenging work experience yet. The projects were very date driven with out any comprehension of how long they would actually take..a project was even reworked 3 mo prior to going live..where the scope changed, new contractors were brought it...it was a mess and was full of bugs when it was deployed."
bad,"It's not a good job,I didn't like it, 1800 flower was not a good company for me. It's not steady employment, it was a seasonal job. The people were okay but just not a job for me."
bad,"not a place to build a career"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers as well as the voluntary projects that Fannie Mae participates in for the homeless, etc."
bad,No room for advancement and most departments do not work well together.  Management needs to see what is right infront of them before they start looking to replace staff.
bad,"Good Pay and I believe that’s why people stay for so long. Its not the quality of the work, but the pay. Some departments are flexible with Work from Home benefits, while other departments aren’t as flexible. "
bad,"As with many companies, employees' experiences depend on the group in which they're placed. I was placed in a group that was run by a wonderful Sr. Director-level manager, but also a micro-managing tyrant of a (junior) Director-level manager. I was cited from coming to the office 3 minutes too late. My fault alone, absolutely, but the fact that this sort of petty nonsense was given even one moment's attention speaks volumes."
bad,"Good company to work for. Flawed business model, Hours were manageable. Co-workers intelligent. I learned of the mortgage crisis of 2008 two years prior to it happening."
bad,"Nice place to work and grow your skills. Good salary and benefits. Location wise also situated in convenient easy to reach locations across Virginia, Maryland and DC"
bad,Learning the business and how secondary mortgage market works.  There are a number of people across business divisions to interface with and build E2E knowledge to get an enterprise level view.
bad,"Tough place to work, decision style is more by ""whimsy"" than based on previous actual experience. Top performers are the ones that make ""easy"" look ""hard""."
bad,Not much growth technically but you learn about the REO business
bad,"restatement project was a scam, they hire fulltime employees then fires you to make an example out of you to justify they don't need fulltime employees as managers/directors get kickbacks from contracting"
bad,"Opening the store, doing a bank run for deposits, packing candy and waiting on customers. The most enjoyable part is repeat customers and their family. The hardest part is new manager and upper management constant change of procedures."
bad,"You basically have to get a job through a staffing agency, or have to know someone who knows someone, I've known people to have been on contract for 5 years and not becoming permanent to receive PTO or sick time. No benefits for 5 years is not beneficial at all. Provide more of a ""Google"" atmosphere instead of a plantation Fannie you have the money to do it. And get rid of the whole ""corporate attire"" you never deal with people in person it should just be a casual dress code....start there with incentives."
bad,"All the rumors are true, They treat contactors like dirt and dump all the hard projects on contractors to manage or complete.,It's a big Co. but that was my experience."
bad,"My direct manager was not good, with respect to managing people, and growth. Only concerned with task management, not people management. Untrustworthy, many members of the team have left under his tenure."
bad,"This is a good company to work for if you aren't a contractor. My experiences working here weren't the best, due to my contractor status. I'm sure they treat employees far better."
bad,"I worked for 3 departments at FNMA. I had problems with Managers at all these departments because of serious discrimination problems they had against me. When I complained about those issues to their managers, nothing was done. On the contrary, I got a black mark on my records. At the end, I was laid-off unfairly after 5 years in there. People that were the favorites of the managers were not laid-off. In fact, one of them is still working in there (already for 10 years). When I tried to reapplied again to get into FNMA on several occasions due to a job need, I was rejected immediately. I don't even try anymore."
bad,"As a contractor, management is terrible at providing feedback. Checked clock for time in and time out. Limited opportunity to develop skills further. The hardest part of the job was dealing with favoritism and looking for opportunities to learn. Feedback was also very skewed due to favoritism. Employees handpicked which contractors they wanted to train up and then show to others that they  were inadequate."
bad,"The major positive is the work-life balance, and that the work intensity is not very bad. The work can be interesting, depending on the groups."
bad,management sucks not a very great place to work . it is a mix bag and it depends on what kind of project and team you land in that decides your quality of life there.
bad,"I was promised a 20-25% bonus when I agreed for employment, but only got 15% when it was actual time for pay.  I was cheated.  Leaving Fannie Mae asap"
bad,"A typical workday includes working on planned documentation and infrastructure setup  tasks as well as handling ad hoc requests for changes  from business customers as necessary."
bad,"No work/life balance, unstable environment, but good pay.  You have to kiss butt to move up in this company.  So very political."
bad,Started out with great management team but was moved to a lesser management team and non-interactive or communicative group.
bad,"The climate of constant change at this company makes it very difficult to get a handle on the direction that the company is moving. Expect to work very long hours and weekends too in some cases. Teams and processes are in constant flux since the left hand does not always know or care what the right hand is doing. Turnover is some areas is pretty high. Company benefits and salary are decent. At year end be prepared for a low rating even though you worked your tail off as it is required that 10% of the company must receive a ""does not meet expectations"" rating."
bad,They have been trimming the herd for years now; constantly firing full time employees and replacing them with contractors and MSPs. Those that do remain have to do the work of almost 2 people.
bad,"The daily review quota is hard to accomplish depending on your team managers' requirements. All have different requirements and not all managers follow the same company procedures. The good ones stand behind the reviewers on their team; unfortunately, others don't. While some managers are very good, there are bad ones that have no business in management or appraising, including top management. The training and overall communication is very poor."
bad,No recognition for talent and skills. Quality of employees poor. A lot of office politics. People trying to keep their boss happy to get recognized. My way or highway culture by the bosses
bad,Management had no experience. Trained for less than a week. Pay was okay. A lot of favoritism. Workload was not equal. No room for growth. Free month end lunch.
bad,The enjoyable part of the job was the work and the hardest part of the job was the constant changes in management and job titles.  The workplace culture was not open to more that one interpretation.
bad,"I do not recommend this company to anyone.  At one point Fannie Mae was a great place to work, but now it is not.  Management sucks and the way they treat their employees is awful."
bad,"Very less work load. Lots of free time. Very immature company not for strong technical professionals. Every one is busy for keeping their job, Technology is out of date. 70% of the time is spent on irrelevant meetings . If some app. group wants to demo an application they invite the entire technology team ( around 3000 resources)... like a show. "
bad,"This is a nice company to work nice employees."
bad,Fannie Mae offers good benefits along with a great work life balance.  The company is dedicated to its employees and the personal development.
bad,"Remote agent for DO/DU, assisted customers processing of loans. Reviewed information and gave technical assistance to customers in a call center environment."
bad,"If you do good work and work hard, that's about 50% of your advancement potential. The other half is how well you play the political game, how well you come off as a ""corporate citizen"" by showing up to as many meetings as you can, signing up for as many volunteer activities as you can, and schmoozing with as many managers as you can. HR dictates pay and titles, not management, and they are stuck in the past with their outdated policies. They use a stack ranking system, which ends up being a horse trading show among managers during ""calibrations"", a system that even Microsoft abandoned once they realized it didn't work."
bad,"Had me move to Dallas, told we had four to five years work, told everyone to go out buy new houses, cars and renew our leases, then the Friday before Christmas told us we could finish the year and would all be terminated on 12/31."
bad,"The culture in the last four years at Fannie Mae has been changed to that of hiring practices based on nepotism and cultural identity. Mostly, if you're SE Asian; from India or Pakistan, you're almost certainly guaranteed a job there. If you're not and happen to get in on your own merit, look out. Your position is volatile and will be scrutinized that much more because you're not a ""member of the club""."
bad,I haven't been there for six years and FNMA is still trying to fill my position/staff that department.  My manager was unavailable.  No real training was provided.
bad,"Firm is in receivership, yet still retains arrogant leadership.  Severe limitations for advancement, with upward mobility based on loyalty to leadership."
bad,"I held several positions, including managing a team of production support personnel.   My team was dedicated and hard working.  Being able to help customers resolve issues was very rewarding."
bad,"No comment.....management was not the best, Started in Bethesda move to DC in 2010...Change of management -with an outstanding review - I was laid off because of company loss."
bad,"Draconian Delivery, lots of chiefs trying to say they had an impact to save their tales in front their bosses. Pedigree and passive aggressive behavior is a must.."
bad,Promote diversity as a company as a whole.  FP&A team experiences heavy turnover due to lack of better management in the Finance Division.  Well paid job in DC area
bad,The balance of work and life was fine but the management was very unstable. Good compensation for benefits but lack of structure and managements inability to give direction and manage people made work extremely difficult not to mention the hidden office politics. I felt like I walked into a political war zone and everyone was out to assasinate the person next to them. In all I wish I would have stayed with my previous employer but hindsight is 20/20.
bad,"The company consists of hundreds of fiefdoms all fighting for authority and recognition. Very quickly you will get the impression none of the work really matters and the company doesn't value you. All the developers I have met feel the same way to varying degrees. The only people who seem to stay are the innocent and the unmotivated."
bad,"This is a great job if you have kids, like to keep your heads down, and just coast. It's also a great starter job. But if you have ambitions and push the ball forward, go somewhere else."
bad,Contractors aren't really treated well. There are a lot of layoffs and budget freezes for even full time employees. The managers are too busy to help new employees/contractors
bad,Caveat - this review is subject to the fear inducted into the corporate culture due to the negative press during the housing crisis not to be considered relevant to current conditions
bad,It was OK the one thing I didn't like was working on the line. Clocking in was easy. Work environment was not so good. If you ask for help people will help you
bad,"This is Fannie mae's mission ""We help our partners house America and create opportunities for people to buy, refinance, or rent a home."" and they do a lot of volunteers to help rebuild destroyed homes. Well, if you are sticking to your mission, forget the outside volunteer and at least look at your employees. Think about how many people your fire and lay off each year and put them on the streets from foreclosures. If you want to change the culture, start from the top not from the bottom. You will never change the culture of a company that way."
bad,"Not a pleasant experience. The work is farmed out and the teams are very disjointed. In addition, they have a rule where contractors cannot be ther for more than 18 mo."
bad,"Politically charged environment.  Many people are nice, but it's not uncommon to have people disparage others for their own gain.  I would avoid working here"
bad,The overall job was cool but the company is very cliquey if that makes sense. The managers are not managers and they will back bite you whenever needed. They do not work for a common goal it is definately who you know basis there and that will determine how you progress at the company.
bad,"Collaboration and ""team"" are somewhat elusive at Fannie Mae per my experience.  With the exception of the CEO, executive leadership work in silos and talk badly about each other behind their backs which sets a tone for everyone underneath.  It feels like people are constantly ""building their resume"" and personal brand over working together as a team; i.e. competing for taking credit for ideas, decision, etc.  Overall the management team seems to significantly lack people skills.  There is also significant organizational chaos - lack of roles/responsibilities which leads to negative morale, redundancy and gaps of productivity."
bad,Good Management and Culture. Location is great easy to get to and from. Overall good company to work for and learn and grow in the mortgage industry..
bad,Fannie Mae was top heavy. It had Directors with no direct reports. Too many overpaid employees who lacked skills and relied on junior staff to get the work done.
bad,"Good place to work, great benefits.  A company that will stand behind communities and work with the people."
bad,"Since I was contracted per 6 months, This was a chance to test my claim productivity in multiple systems (Gov't and Private) for handling all the mortgage servicing overfull from all partipating national banks."
bad,"Great place to work. If I didn't have to relocate, I would still be there.They educate you completely about the loan process, and keep you completely aware, and trained with the ever-changing student and housing market."
good,be able to handle and to make sure to perform the following daily duties:
good,Not good place to work if you are a contractor. Regular staff employees get all the perks. Contractors do all the work and never get any glory and have wait for ever to get hired permanent if it happens at all.
good,"Management was not easy to communicate with, manager would take 3 hour long breaks in the mall while still on the clock. Store was not clean, we had lots of bugs and did nothing about it - regular cleaning and sweeping did not help."
good,Learned new technologies and how to perform in fast pace enviorment. Day starts early and can be long to meet the dealines. The best part is you have basketball hoops on site.
good,Worked for Fannie Mae on a temporary basis as a paralegal.  I did not have interaction with facets of the company nor did I received any benefits or have an opinion as to the inner workings of the company or staff.
good,Great work environment. Company is going through a major growth period. The culture is relaxed but very faced-paced. A lot of the units are in go go go mode but rarely take the time to think strategically.
good,Weak leadership with a very loose drive to carry out corporate culture. Company goes through so much Reorganization therefore the job security is minimal.
good,"Different, but interesting.  The training is very informative, excellent instructors. Never a dull moment. Be an agent of change, and overall be flexible. Sometimes things change at the last minute."
good,"Very structured environment. Come in and do your job "
good,"your career here is dependant completely on who you are working for and what your relationship is with your boss. also it depends on what your boss's relationship to his/her boss. if you want to work here, you have to enjoy the good times and when things go bad for you, you just have to convince yourself that it is not your fault. otherwise you may suffer inferiority complex since people blame others a lot here"
good,"things are done more for check marks rather than  for people or company advancements."
good,"Working under a very political environment. "
good,"Pros : Great work life balance, enough oppurtunities to learn, above average pay if you manage to get growth in the company  "
good,"Nepotism is rampant.  Many managers incapable of duties.  contractor duties increased almost daily but when discussing compensation, nothing can be done.  Learned a lot but was unimpressed."
good,Fannie Mae is an older company that has had its share of ups and downs.  Fannie Mae has had several layoffs in the last 15 years or so.  They always seem to bounce back depending on the economy.
good,"Unless someone is driven to innovate and do things differently, can't complains on the benefits and work/life balance. If you want to advance your career, this may not be a great option."
good,"Fannie Mae started out well but bad decisions in management staff created a toxic work culture, even though many of my peers were fabulous almost half of the staff in the department has left, many with no other job prospects. The pay and benefits were great but not enough to keep me in what seemed to be a tyrannical environment."
good,"The environment there was sometimes lively, but mostly dull. Overall, working as a team was the most enjoyable part during my 6 months there."
good,"Good job,but impossible to become a permanent employee. Able to work remotely; no managers breathing down your back. Fannie Mae is trying to model itself like Freddie Mac since they will not have a price advantage in the future  Fannie Mae is also building a new headquarters in D.C., so they need to lay-off people to save money."
good,"Fannie isn't the most stable company to work for and the culture is a mess. The pay is good and the expectations are low, so it's easy to see why it's where you would build up experience and leave. It's not a long term situation to be in if you want to grow and learn."
good,"I hate the hours I work...would be a lot better if they didn't have the shift that I work...IT ISNT NECESSARY, but other than that it isn't too bad"
good,"Good company, but lots of politics"
good,Management was poor. A lot of people do not know what they are doing in every department I encounter and at every level of employment.
good,Tons of work sometimes but the culture could be better. Sometimes the day can go by fast. There are many work which you can challenge yourself and show what you can do.
good,"As a contractor everything is good the pay and benefits. With this company your contract can end at any given time its best to continue looking before your contracts about to end. Other than that the work place is great, quite, meetings aren't to long and traveling is taken care of the company has it's on Shuttle bus. For a contractor the job is good up until the end and for a full time worker the job is great."
good,"Employees and contractors come and go, a revolving door."
good,"I had a great 1 year stint at Fannie Mae. In a short time as less as 1 year, I learned a lot of skills in Business Analysis and Data Analysis in an agile environment."
good,Despite all the changes Fannie Mae is still an old boys' club without advancement opportunities. Layoffs happen about once a quarter. It's a good stepping stone but if you want to grow this is not the place. Benefits are better than industry average.
good,"Job security is low, there is no room to grow.  The benefits is very expensive, no match for 401k and retirement.  Great communication with co worker but management lack of knowledge and experience is low.  We learn off each other as in coworkers."
good,"Its a nice place to learn about the mortgage industry and the work environment is very flexible."
good,Very well diverse company with constant change. This company work with a high percentage of contract workers which is not a good fit for an associate who is looking for a career and growth opportunities.
good,I was hired for a particular type of job within 6 months I was chosen to do more unique/ quantitative projects in addition to my regular responsibilities.  My co-workers are nice people.
good,Company very subjective to raises and promotions; not a good atmosphere.
good,Very corporate.  Individual issues were not resolved without multiple meetings and approvals which took too long.
good,Not a good place if you are in the middle of your career. If you are on cruise control heading towards retirement and want to collect a decent salary and take a lot of time off this is the place.
good,"Typical day involves answering customer interctions via phone,email,and live chat"
good,"The people at Fannie Mae are incredible. Everyone wants to do a great job and help the housing industry. The management culture is trapped in the past and slow to enact change. Annual reviews compare people against others with similar titles but very different jobs rather than their personal performance, causing a lot of tension each year among the workers."
good,"If you are lucky and is on a project with competent management, it is a good place to work.  Benefit is above average if you negotiate well."
good,"The company offers good work life balance, flexible work arrangements and good compensation. The managers are terrible though and there are TONS of people who have been at the organization 10-25 years who aren't adding value, but won't leave. Everything - no matter how small the task or issue - becomes a long, drawn out back and forth between conflicting parties within the organization. There are too many people involved in decision making which slows things down. Its a good place to work if you want nice benefits and have a lot of patience to deal with stubborn people."
good,Upper management needs a lot of work but the company pays pretty good and has great benefits. The company is currently going through some major changes.
good,"If your looking for a job which is the same day in and day out, this is it. Lots of politics and even if you excel at your job, it's likely a minor mistake can result in a write-up or negative review."
good,I only was there to fill is for someone on maternity leave. My time there was good. Nothing strenuous. Nice people. Comfortable office. Great cafeteria.
good,"There wasn't much room to grow in the teams I worked with. I was expected to just finish the work I was told to. No opinions by the team members were entertained at all. The team manager wasn't very supportive. In fact, team members were hesitant to say anything to the manager and to keep their job, they would just focus on finishing their work on time and wouldn't want to be available to other team members because of work pressure."
good,"Fannie Mae is fast-paced but overall has a positive work environment. The hours were not very good, but it was a good first job for me, and it worked well with my school schedule."
good,"Racial stigma, no advancement, fair pay, outside insurance, paid time off"
good,Lack of diversity. Senior Management was not concerned about the work environment of their team. It became a toxic work environment with some reorganizational changes.
good,"Currently the company is going through a difficult change from water fall to agile development. The managers there are trying to get everyone to pull more weight then they can handle and reduce cost by doing so."
good,Culture was extremely biased in favor of minorities.  Promotions were based upon race quotas more than qualifications.  Management openly showed favoritism.
good,I submitted daily tickets for database issues.  Created a script to convert to convert files from CSV to XML format.  Ran and monitored automated jobs.
good,"The people managers are not experienced. there is no bunus."
good,"Its a nice place to work if you don't want advancement. There isn't a lot of organization but the atmosphere is laid back with causal dressing everyday. The hardest part of the job was not knowing who to contact within the company for questions on processes. Co-workers are friendly and stick to themselves most of the time. You are defiantly pushed to learn new processes and finding new ways to improve the work flow, however it takes months to a year for upper management to approve anything."
good,This was a 3 month contract role where we reviewed Repurchase Loans.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and enjoyed having a large cube and my own laptop.
good,A good place to work.  People the are respectful for the most part.  Not much room for growth and advancement.  Not sure on job security.
good,"Had fun working as part of team. Great work environment."
good,I would be very meticulous regarding your solicited position management style and competency to lead effectively.
good,Great people with good intentions peforming an important mission.  Challenging when it will not be a legal entity in the future and layers of lay-offs occur seemingly at random.
good,"Overall, the pay is good,"
good,This company is run by the federal government and has no sense from day-to-day or anytime in the future what the future holds for it. Management has lost all value for the employee.
good,"Contractors while treated as part of the work team, they are not included in activities such as accomplishments celebrations, team building events, town halls.   "
good,"Even though, I and my team are hiring to do transformation in new Fannie Mae West Technology  center in Dallas, they are still running like government company where no one want a change or transform and keep everything as BAU.  Too much politics and playing favoritism among people instead of recognizing the talents and hard-work.  Top leadership and people below not necessary have same visions or agreement so it is hard to achieve bigger goals."
good,"Too many people who play politics and instead of working.  Too many back stabbers, liars, and cheaters.  Managers turn an eye blind.                                "
good,"Some departments lack good culture and leadership, which includes all talk and no action. Some depts. are average. If you want decent pay and benefits, then this is a place to consider.  What was a fairly secure place to work has now become a capital one type of environment where even high performers are let go.  Very political as well."
good,"Management was playing ostrich, so problems often got ignored. At the same time, every single stakeholder that might possibly be involved with a project was informed so that no one would feel left out or a vital piece missed. This made for slow process."
good,"Given it was a consultant approach, work wise very focus and under strict time management"
good,Hexaware is a great vendor to work for. Thy have long contracts which won't have your anxiety high concerned about if or when you contract is scheduled to end.
good,I typically audited the calls and credit card information to ensure no mistakes was made while the data was being entered. I also dealt with customer concerns and any customer issue. The workplace culture was awesome the hallways was lined with trays of  candies. The work enviorment was relaxed. the best part was ensuring customer satifaction the hardest part was resisting the candies.
good,"I learned what deficiencies to look for in order to get a loan re-purchased for non-compliance.  It was a repetitive process.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning more about the secondary mortgage market.  This was a temporary, non-permanent job."
good,"There are a lot of decent and very talented people at Fannie Mae. I wish that I could have been hired directly instead of being a contractor, though. They rely too much on contractors."
good,"Job tasks were assigned by service delivery coordinators who also had the ability to perform the exact work assignment, but instead used their seniority to oversee, railroad and stressfully drive the technicians in the completion of the task they had been assigned. Most of the techs were always being overloaded with task assignments, never being monitored as to which assignment needed extra time to complete due to the nature of the task vs the end user being serviced. The equipment was always on hand however there was alway a demand to show favor to the end clients whom the CDC's would want to impress with quick customer service turnarounds that only benefited them credit wise."
good,"The job is not particularly demanding. The company is making a lot of cuts, so there is some job uncertainty. Career advancement is extremely slow, as there are ""time in place"" requirements. Management is not particularly impressive. IT is absolutely terrible, and makes work difficult."
good,Must have the ability to multi-task and work in a very high pressure environment. Must have the ability to meet deadlines in a timely manner.
good,Fannie Mae is currently finding its place in the future after conservatorship. Fannie Mae has always had great benefit and a good work life balance. They were very good to me and I wish them well.
good,Compensation above average. The company continues to struggle to find a successful nitch in the marketplace while proving job security and advancement to long term employees.
good,"-I learned a lot about property preservation and working HOA's"
good,"•Perform transactions related to the funding and delivery of whole loans and securitization of mortgage backed securities (MBS) and monthly servicing activities. Analyze data, research issues and exceptions, and resolve discrepancies. Ensure adherence to internal controls and regulatory standards."
good,This is based on the IT portion of the company (not the financial side).
good,"Good company to work with."
good,"Overall the experience was exciting and new.  The staff  very open door policy supportive, informative,  I had minimal high level IT experience provisioning virtual memory and building servers, but was given the opportunity to become acclimated in order to succeed in the position to act as a liaison prior between internal clients and  IT analyst prior to assignments.  Great experience!!  Great team of knowledgeable professionals who  willingly shared that knowledge in a highly intense and fast pace environment."
good,Team members were nice to be with and friendly. There are some quite tech savvy people out there. Project changing all the time and challenging business knowledge wise. Very nice area to be with.
good,Overall a good company to work for.  Hard to move within the company unless you know hiring managers.  Had a great 15 years in supporting business analysis.
good,Fannie Mae has great people to work with and for the most part the company has a great employee culture. Depending on the business unit and your management you will have a great experience or a negative experience. A lot of reorganization’s do happen there and you can end up working for a completely different business unit depending on your organization and if it dissolves. You
good,Fair experience. Good benefits. Very organized. Fast paced. Very competitive. Flexible work arrangement available. Great salary. Good for working mothers.
good,"continuous changes and re-organization was demoralizing to most people, lots opportunities to do the right thing constantly changing leadership and direction meant keeping up with deliverables difficult"
good,"Lacks diversity of culture and thought"
good,I enjoyed the work that I did. The Holidays were celebrated and fun. The Restaurants in the surrounding area and the Cafe were great. The job that I did kept me busy from start to the end of the day.
good,"Fannie Mae is a good place to work, it has good transportation to work from the metro and has metro benefits. There is teleworking fror some people but not everyone has that option."
good,"Fannie Mae is a company in transition.  The recently departed CEO was able to turn the ship in positive direction but the effect hasn't fully trickled down the management chain.  The benefits are great, including 20 days of PTO after your third year, 6% 401K match plus 2% automatic contribution, 20 days of paternity leave, and an onsite cafeteria and gym.  The flexible work arrangements depend on the unit; some units allow wfh all the time while others do not allow it all (not necessarily dependent on job function).  Fannie is transitioning from a mortgage conduit to more of a risk transferor while under the governance of the FHFA (Fannie operates like the regional Federal Reserve banks - it is an independent company but overseen by a government entity; i.e. GSE).  While there is movement to a more open and transparent operating environment there are still many ""old school"" managers operating quid-pro-quo on a day-to-day basis.  This is generally fine for many business functions but makes technical and automation projects to improve business functions challenging."
good,I have expierenced very good and bad times while working at Fannie Mae. I find that it all depends on who your managers and VPs are at that time. It really can go to one extreme to the other in the time it takes to re-.org.
good,I learned a great deal at Fannie Mae. They have a high commitment to governance and compliance for all software releases and upgrades. They run a very effective ePMO.
good,"Constant growth, change, and upward momentum. Working for this company has helped develop my professional business skills as well as my personal life."
good,Productive and friendly work place. Not very friendly for flexible working hours. The management is accessible and listen the concerns and do the needful.
good,A nice place to work. A stress free atmosphere that allows you the time to complete your job. Management will assist you in areas that help may be needed.
good,"Great company to work - "
good,"There are many cultures within Fannie Mae so depending on where you work you will either see the best of Fannie Mae or the worst. Not much time is spent in meetings. Some areas of FNMA are run with transparency and are on par with the best corporations out there. Others are like mom and pop shops with one manager or director having too much leeway..Systems work and when they don't, the company adresses the issues to fix the problem."
good,Great place to learn about mortgage business. I worked as a contractor and it was hard to get a permanent position but it was great in helping you grow
good,"I liked Fannie Mae as the system in Fannie Mae is well documented. Technically and technologically good. But one thing I did not admire, was too much of similar kind of people. There was no diversity."
good,"Fannie Mae prides itself on providing work/life balance.  I have had the opportunity to take advantage of flexible work arrangements for which I greatly appreciate.  However, as far as being valued, ""value"" as defined by management tends to differ from ""value"" as defined by associates."
good,Very goal oriented and always kept in the loop of what was going on and how we were achieving our goals. Loved the weekly update meetings that kept us in the loop
good,"Productive and fun workplace. The company has been going through a lot of cultural and technological changes, which has positively impacted the work environment at Fannie Mae."
good,"opportunity to learn lot of technologies."
good,"Fast pace, lots of stress, if you do your job too well they pile more on you. Big systems and a lot of different technology. Fun at times, important work makes it stressful."
good,"pay is good. a lot of politics going around at the office. some of the offices are outdated and could use a renovation. overall, the people are nice, and the benefits are good."
good,"I contracted at Fannie Mae for a very short length of time. I don't have to many memories of working for Fannie Mae. Basically, your typical desktop support position."
good,This is too time consuming people who are job searching don't really have the time to waste doing all of this.  Consider moving this portion from the survey.
good,"It is realy very nice place to work , I like to go back to it someday , I have worked with very nice team and the like me so much , I appreciate their help ,"
good,good work/life balance depending on where you work in the company. Going through some culture changes in the near future which is very exciting for the business.
good,"Nice Place , Team was excellent, Less stressful. Located in NOVA Traffic big challenge. Near to place where i live. Cafeteria is good. Office location is across hilton."
good,"Too large to fail and too ""complex"" to fix. "
good,"1st responder for Windows 2003, 2008 and 2012 tickets also monitor and respond for AIX, Solaris and Linux tickets. Facilitate bridge line for Business Interruption outages."
good,Great place to learn and expand your knowledge within the industry.  In my 18 years at Fannie Mae I learned every facet of the mortgage business.
good,"Relaxed place to work. I played ping pong every lunch break. However, my manager wasn't there for 70% of my internship, so I didn't really enjoy the lack of projects. I sought projects out from other departments and received little work."
good,"Pros:"
good,A typical day at Fannie Mae was nice and easy. I learned how to open and close federal cases and what it takes to become a paralegal one day. Becoming a paralegal takes a lot of hard work and studying it's not an easy process it takes time to honestly understand the meaning and understanding what a paralegal does for Fannie Mae home owners and the department as well. The management team was fun to be around watching them help their customer's save their homes and their families well being. The hardest part about working in the paralegal department was making each case was in the right file. If the cases where mixed up it would throw the department of it's balance. The enjoyable part of the day was helping my supervisor open and close cases.
good,"Senior Managers say ""I want"" rather than ""How can we help make this happen?""  They don't listen to program management SMEs.  Their planning tools and processes are not at all in sync with the other organizations in the company.  It could be a much better place to work.  Most Directors and VPs can't see the big picture."
good,"Many reorganizations is hampering the overall atmosphere. Learned some great Agile execution and programming skills, and will certainly find use for them in other organizations."
good,Review residential mortgage appraisals for re-purchase purposes. Corporate environment. Work at home opportunities.
good,I have no comment to make about my previous relationship with this former employer.  I left due to a reduction in force action.
good,"While at Fannie Mae, my Executive Team was being offered packages and my job was in jeopardy of being eliminated.  The culture was down and I wanted to grow in my position."
good,"I did Appraisal Review for National Underwriting Center (NUC). Wrote 3 to 8 reviews per day. The position paid well, the tools were top drawer, but there was no job security. Basically had two weeks notice before 60 people were let go. Merry Christmas! This is not an uncommon experience at Fannie Mae."
good,"Hired as a contractor. Challenging workload. Great tools, colleagues, and pay. No job security."
good,"Cleaned office buildings,performed up and dusting,pulling trash,cleaned restroom,restocked paper goods,swept/vacuumed floors and mopped floors. I learned some great housekeeping skills."
good,"We are in a busy office but have a lot of fun!"
good,"my contract ended and was a good company. It was a challenged and I enjoyed the challenge. It is not for everyone. Need a lot of experience for positions.,"
good,"A typical day consisted of reviewing loans and due dates. Making decisions on if a loan could be modified or not. As well as talking to developers, contractors, and lenders. Submitted all time sensitive information to those authorized to request it.My co-workers kept it adventurous through contest and conversation. The hardest part was having to send someone to foreclosure."
good,"A typical day is fast paced.  My responsibilities include completing account related activities, and speaking with mortgage customers.  The hardest part of my job are the unrealistic unexpectations placed on associates by management and the lack of real recognition.  The associate is NOT valued in my position."
good,"Perform post-close underwriting review of non-performing loans, performing loans, conforming and jumbo loans. Underwriting review includes Desktop Underwriter (DU), Loan Prospector (LP), Zippy, Wells Fargo ECS, Emits, and manually underwritten loans. Analyze loans for deficiencies related to the pre-sale underwriting decision and identify transaction components that indicate fraud. Perform fraud related research using third party tools. Provide written feedback to lender and issue repurchase letters according to agency matrix."
good,"If you want a steady career development, then this is not a place for you. If you are passionate about your job and want to make some changes happen, then this is not a place for you. "
good,CGI/ Fannie Mae was a very challenging ans insightful place to be a part of. My co-workers and my team was a good group to be apart of. Management could have did a better job with the work schedules.
good,"The one thing that baffles me about Fannie Mae is; how do you lay off masses of employees (who received good reviews and were in good standing) and after a short while, the company re-posts open positions that are the same positions you laid off? Why doesn't Fannie Mae reach out to those affected employees and humanely offer them those jobs? The unemployment rate is high, and you have a database of qualified ex-employees, some of which are still looking for work. Fannie Mae, it would be a great move in the right direction!"
good,It is a fun place to work but there is no job security. place where we can learn a lot.
good,Even though Fannie Mae is going through tough times the morale is good amongst employees. Everyone works as a team.
good,"I very much enjoyed my work at Fannie Mae.  Concern I have is that it seems to me there is incentive to encourage older, experienced workers to retire or in some cases get pushed out so that young contractors can come in to do the same job for far less.  I can't say I did not enjoy working there as I very much did. I encourage individuals to negotiate salary and not allow there to be an effective downturn in valuing analysts.  If new employees do research and won't work for less than those already there, this pushing out of the old to bring in the new will not be incentived."
good,The benefits are outstanding. Flexible working hours depends on the manager. They have holiday parties for the staff. They have SERVE events to help the community.
good,"Advanced and a diverse workplace which emphasizes client commitment and cordial relationships enabling both personal and professional growth along with companies progress as a leader in innovating to simplify and better meet the housing needs of today’s families, providing financing for quality rental housing in every market and for helping lenders serve today's home buyers and homeowners."
good,I used to think I would retire at FNMA but the culture is changing and I no longer feel that way.  The department I worked in was very stressful without needing to be.  Not sure why the changes.
good,As a college hire I felt that there were better places to start my career.  Many people at Fannie are hard working and many people are also lazy.  Good if you want to push yourself and know how to be a self starter
good,The compensation is great but the environment is siloed and you'll lose your skillset because you won't be exposed to technologies the way your role/position should be allowed to. Management isn't great and is focused on using their direct reports as a means to make themselves look good.
good,Comfortable and friendly work environment with a diverse workforce. Exercise facility and easy access to the W&OD Trail. Walking trails and ponds on a park like campus.
good,"Fannie Mae was a good company to work for, but sometimes people / groups get reorganized into other areas that may not necessarily be related to your career goals or your skills and experience."
good,I loved the job I was doing but the management needs to learn how to balance work/life for the employees. The demand and stress on the production/application support is very high.
good,"Cutting edge of technology, talented people that are very knowledgeable in their area. Very fast pace with aggressive timeline for implementing a project."
good,FM is a very good work environment for full-timer developers. A bit flexible on  remote working based on project. We will get work and life balancing. One should look for full-time as the benefits are pretty attractive. The contracting life in here is not easy though.  The work culture is nice especially during year end time.
good,"The particular area I worked is a very stressful position/environment. The benefits and salary are awesome, however it takes a certain individual to work here"
good,"A typical day would be to sit down on a desk "
good,Can be better when no longer under conservator.  People are nice to work with. Opportunities for growth are limited; however they do exist mostly in DC.
good,"managed staff"
good,"Great work/life balance. Easy to work with everyone. Good benefit, especially health insurance program. However, it is hard to advance in the career. It is hard to apply for a higher level position."
good,"Fine place to work, nothing great but not a horrible job. Very slow paced. "
good,work day consists of review of files specific to finding underwriter discrepancies with the intention to eventually request a buy back from the lender.
good,Work is not very interesting. Management does not seem to care about mentoring or teaching its analysts tasks to do. There is no coordination between the management team and analysts. I did not enjoy this internship because I was stuck in the office with nothing to do.
good,"The nature of work amicable, providing wide range of opportunities to learn excel and showcase the learning experience. Exposure to new technologies . Good Team spirit among various teams"
good,"Excellent Environment for a Business Analyst to learn and contribute."
good,This job taught me how to deal with different customers. Management was wonderful. They were very understanding and helpful if you had any questions.
good,Great place to work. Co-workers were great and learnt a lot from them. Would recommend others to work for Fannie Mae
good,"Vey Productive environment, opportunities to lear newest technologies"
good,"Contract Position with flexibility, competitive salary."
good,I managed the overall functions of the office including a staff of 12. The center was a pilot program for Fannie Mae.
good,With so much uncertainty facing the company it's hard to justify some of the long-term plans that are being made.
good,"- Great Management, Good work-life balance"
good,Supportive management and good workplace to work. Well managed implementation and good knowledge sharing. Shifts can be better managed and user training should be arranged.
good,All was hunky-dorie until the CEO and CFO got caught in a financial by cooking the books and ripping off millions and DODD-FRANK legislation helped to cause our country to fall into a recession.
good,"Fannie Mae is a company with great compensation and benefits.  Employee development and open door policy is strongly encouraged.  The company culture is constantly changing.  The company is currently pushing 'Ways of Working"" and an open work environment.  The company is also currently preparing for a move to downtown."
good,"Fannie Mae WAS one of the top companies to work for before the subprime boom and the market fell.  The culture was great and people really advanced at Fannie.  However, in time it became a very different place and the click culture which happens at many fortune 500 companies began to exist at Fannie.  The company has reduced greatly and I don't know what it has become currently.  Many of the staff who were there when I was there are gone and have either been laid off, fired or left."
good,"Great place to work depending on department and structure, management sometimes not transparent with staff about decision making"
good,"Great company to be a part of.  Working remotely I had constant communication with my team.  All work was done independently at home, no micro-managing."
good,Fannie Mae is very ease place to work. It's a place where can learn a lot about the insight of mortgage-backed security market.
good,"A very interesting place to work. My overall experience was pretty good. My department was a specialty group, the fit was unique, the work culture was very empowering."
good,i learned a lot about an office setting. hardest part of the job was the public perception.
good,"Overall, not a bad experience. I worked in the mortgage fraud research department."
good,"Ambitious and moving forward, just a lot to be done with limited resources. Several exposures represent significant risk to not just this LOB but the overall brand."
good,"Great work/life balance as long as you are not in management - then you work constantly.  Comp and benefits really can't be beat.  But the culture, while changing slowly, still makes it very difficult to advance from within."
good,"The work at Fannie Mae is interesting and challenging. There is a good work/life balance and good benefits."
good,"As a contractor my experience was different from that of an FTE. I did not receive FM benefits or participate in the programs reserved for employees. I was treated well, received high end equipment, and we placed in a favorable work environment. The people were friendly and very willing to assist in all matters. The building was always clean and well maintained. An in house cafeteria was available as well as a very well furnished gym."
good,I have worked as consultant here . Client was Fannie. The managers are helpful in coordinating to the client and taking care of their employee.  It was a good experience.
good,"Overall I've had a good experience at Fannie Mae but the culture in technology is shifting towards hiring exclusively foreign workers from India.  If you're American, you will feel out of place here."
good,Work life balance is non existent. But the people are cool and work together well. Interesting fast-paced environment. Lots of growth potential.
good,"My team is a ""reactive"" team in that our work direction came from client requests or issues.  My direct management team exposed me to growth opportunities within the organization.  My team members are great and always willing to be helpful and work for the greater good of the team.  I learned all I know about servicer oversight here."
good,"Fannie is not the same anymore. Management is the issue, not sympathetic at all. They are great managers then there are a few that makes Fannie Mae wonderful atmosphere dreadful at times."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Fannie Mae. But advancing either in management or ""full time"" is very hard UNLESS you are ""friends"" with the right people. No matter your skill or experience they are going to hire who they want even before you interview. Their minds are already made up before you apply."
good,"This was a good company to work for however the industry as a whole for REO asset management is slowing down. I have my real estate license and wanted to try to sell real estate on my own, this is why I left. I learned a lot from this company I manage a large portfolio of real estate, which meant once the property was foreclosed on I would work with local contractors to get the property repaired (Painted, carpeted, roofed) once the property was repaired I would find a local broker to list and sell the property.  I trained and hired and managed a network of brokers to list and sell my assets. "
good,"I worked at Fannie Mae as a contractor, and the team I worked with was very supportive, but upper management treated us like second class citizens. Rules were made up on the fly to cause a hostile environment by upper manager, although my immediate management team protected us. Overall, it was an experience I works not want anyone to go through or myself personally to relive."
good,"good to work within team environment, should have good working knowledge and skills, also mortgage experience required to work."
good,Fannie is a company with an excellent cause and a monopolistic business. As a business it will always continue to make money and as such compensation and benefits are good. But senior management leaves a lot to be desired.
good,A typical day at work includes LOTS of meetings so sometimes it is hard to get tasks accomplished.
good,"I was there before the metaphorical ceiling fell in. Most tenured people refused to believe Fannie/Freddie were about to change radically, and wanted to return to 'the good old days.'"
good,Lots of interoffice politics. Steady work flow and opportunity for advancement. Culture of teamwork with good benefits and fair pay. Overall good benefits.
good,Very stressful work environment. Constantly trying to hit sales goals each month. Virtually no career growth available in our office. Friends at work were cool.
good,"This is a good place to work, but IT is highly departmentalized and there is no room to grow. To add to the cons, there will no longer be an internal IT since its outsourced to a large IT consultant company.  Workplace has friendly co-workers and is uaually isolated depending on your job. Extreme secrecy between contractors and full time employees."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Fannie Mae however, I feel they should be more involved with job placement when roles are eliminated. Rather than laying employees off they should identify the employee's skill set and see if there are other roles within the company that may be a good fit for the team member.  I also feel that management should be held more accountable.  It seems as though if someone has a management title and speaks poorly to the character of an employee, there is no further discussion and management's word is automatically taken.  Those types of discussions should be thoroughly investigated with all involved parties."
good,"I enjoyed working at Fannie Mae. However when I was assigned to a major project and the manager was not happy with my findings, I was terminated.  This was a compliance role that required complete transparency."
good,"Love Fannie Mae.  I have had some wonderful opportunities to learn and grow.  "
good,"Work day can be normal or very long it depends on the issue. "
good,The best thing I can say  about fannie mae is the pay was great it was also a relaxed work environment however I was told I would be on a two year contract but the assignment did not even last a year
good,"The company provides great benefits however as an employee if you are not one of the friends of management then you are treated poorly.  There is considerable bullying and gossip and click of people who do not consider the feelings of others as necessary.  Typical work day is 10 to 12 hours inputting information, meetings and phone calls.  Management expects long work hours."
good,"Managing vendor and their responsibilities."
good,"Its very good experience working Fannie Mae, good people to work with and looking agian to work with them. Very friendly and help full Team. Good to work."
good,I have worked at Fanniemae as a contractor and the work environment was great.  work culture is also good since they have flexible work hour and team build activities.
good,Fannie Mae is a productive workplace and environment that provides the opportunity to expand career opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with.
good,"Explored more on AWS and well coordinated meetings everyday. Mastered ci/cd process with a great team. Acquired better knowledge on scripting languages like Shell, Python"
good,"great company to work with. Benefits are good, positive environment. Work life can be challenging at times but not that bad. not cutting edge but not legacy too."
good,"Nice place to work, very busy"
good,Great company to work for.  Greta pay and benefits.  They believe in training their people.  Good balance between work and play.  Liked my team.  Promoted from wthin
good,Wanted more opportunity; the position was very limiting.  I do not wish to provide any further information about this position at Fannie Mae. Thank you
good,"work environment is good,supportive team. was waterfall methodology, learned really good stuffs.small cafeteria and less choice of food. Good parking."
good,Great place to work. Many great people that you get to work with. Great benefits. Good pay. Good commute depending on where you live. Good training available.
good,"Love the people, they are the most enjoyable part of the job.  Very rewarding job providing home ownership to people.  Hardest part is finding a balance between work and life."
good,"Fannie Mae provided significantly beneficial and valuable experience. There are few places to gain expertise with, and be involved with a  GSE. The experience offered the ability for me to gain expertise regarding the development of the future trajectory of the entire industry."
good,Environment was fast paced and focused on skills for life.  Every day was a new adventure with competing priories and initiatives. Leadership clearly articulated the direction of the organization. Customers were at the center of everything we do.
good,Great place to learn and grow. Employees skills are enhanced yearly with the assistance of great management and resource tools. Constantly learning and able to provide your input at all times.
good,"Fannie Mae is a great place to work.  They have awesome benefits.  The downfall depends on what department you work in.  Some managers are micromanagers, while others are amazing and treat you as the responsible professional that you are.  I personally love Fannie Mae and would recommend working there."
good,"Challenging and competitive environment, but most employees are dedicated to the core values and working toward a common goal. Work/life balance is good depending on your manager."
good,"I was there for an internship, the team I was with helped me be very well equipped for my future career. When you ask for help , everyone is there for you. I felt comfortable everyday, not out of place. A nice cultured environment."
good,Had a good manager who trust people for the work that was given to them. I was a contractor at Fannie Mae and i don't know about the benefits. A place to learn new things.
good,"Working here is sometimes dull, but always stable and rewarding. The work-life balance is great and people here are always helpful and kind. Overall, if you're looking for a cushy job where you'll learn a lot, this is a great place to be"
good,"Fannie Mae will always be in my memory as one of the best places to work. It provided an excellent opportunity for career progression and  a friendly and supportive environment of true professionals.  The firm is now under constant pressure and reorganization, which has impacted morale in certain company departments, but I pray for a quick resolution so this great company can return to its glory to serve its purpose to the market and consumers as well as internal stakeholders."
good,I served as the temporary director of communications for the Southwest Regional Office for Fannie Mae's community outreach division.  The staff were welcoming and knowledgeable.
good,"Fannie Mae was beginning to enter a very difficult time in the housing market and regulatory environment when I left.  "
good,"Great pay, benefits, and work life.  Significant cost overruns in every area due to atmosphere where no one questions expenditures in an effort not to ruffle feathers of other senior positions.  The employee state of mind is come to work, keep your head down, don't ask questions, and do your job.  Questioning any decision or offering new method of efficiency will be perceived as challenging your superior and life will be very difficult from that point out."
good,"I was working as Sr. Oracle DBA as well as I was involved in Physical Data Modeling and Performance tuning."
good,"Overall this is a great place."
good,A typical work day at Fannie Mae was sometime very busy but exciting. I learn all the diffierent procedure to complete my daily job. I work with a good team at Fannie Mae. The hardest part of the job is when the system go down. I enjoy my work and taking classes to improved my knowledge of the business.
good,It is a good place to work. Get to work close with the management and give advices and take ideas. Fannie places lot of people with technical knowledge
good,This was a great company to work for - and enjoyed the work opportunities and challenges. The colleagues appreciated my contributions and were always willing to help in any ways.
good,Developing meaningful data visualizations that help the management and the team to monitor and analyze the growth of the organization. Also bridging the gap between mere data and meaningful data visualizations that project data for critical decision making.
good,A good company to work for. Productive and fun working place. Worked on challenging projects. Great employees and management. Great place to work for. Everyone is so helpful and willing to help at a moments notice.
good,"Good working environment, but job uncertainty prevents people from staying long.  Nobody knows what will ultimately happen to the GSEs.  Good benefits with flexible working arrangements."
good,"Quite fun place to work, with opportunity to learn and improve. Red tapism however is quite extreme and in my opinion affects the bottomline of the company."
good,"I learned a lot during my time at Fannie Mae. It was an overall great experience. I enjoyed adding value to company, helping them reach company goals."
good,I had the opportunity to develop my strengths and focus on those areas. The current culture and overall direction of the company are headed in the right direction to impact a broad sector of the economy.
good,"I truly enjoyed this company and felt blessed when I got the job. People in the department I worked in came to feel like family. "
good,"complex and good place to learn mortgage industry."
good,"Assisted Managers, Loan Officers and Processors solve problems"
good,"I loved working at Fannie Mae Candies.  The atmosphere and morale there was great.  I worked in the Accounting Office, and samples of the candies were placed on tables throughout the plant.  We could sample as many and much as we wanted and on Fridays, they had the discount sales for all employees, where we paid a little of nothing for the best tasting chocolates in the world (To me).  The plant worker were very friendly.  Once a month, we did inventory of the whole plant, that's where we got to meet all the different employees of this company.

good,"The overall compensation is competitive.  However, there is little fun working here."
good,"Challenging and rewarding place to work. I learned a lot about banks, mortgages and how FM really assists all home owners with their mortgages and the American Dream!"

good,"* Typical day includes strategic project management, staff management, meetings..., problem solving, etc."
good,"Good company, great people to work with."
good,Some of the smartest people I have ever had the pleasure of working with work for FNMA. Most rewarding part of working of FNMA is being able to make a difference in peoples lives.
good,"Its a nice fun place to work with excellent opportunity to grow and develop career, the working atmosphere is very amicable with all the stuff you need on time without any delay"
good,Good place to work. Good work culture. Enjoyed the relation with the team. Pay is good as well. A little flexibility for contractors might be more helpful
good,Latest Software Methodologies and practices. Brilliant and Bright Team Members. Latest Tools and Technologies. Respect for people from all diverse cultures.
good,Reasonably comfortable place to work. Advancement limited and confusion re-organization to meet scope of control guidelines which eliminated or reduced management positions
good,Fannie Mae compensates its employees well. during my tenured with the company in the REO department  the leadership was terrible and the workload was extremely excessive.
good,I had a great time working at Fannie Mae. The corporate culture is very employee oriented and there is a lot of room for growth. The commute was not ideal but the company offers work from home solution.
good,"Company as a whole has a great mission and is really focused on bringing affordable housing to communities, management with organization lacks efforts to rewards employees."
good,"The workplace culture was adequate. The training in place was more than sufficient, there is a good work / personal life balance.  Having work from home days was a great bonus."
good,"With a good manager, this is a great place to work. Great benefits. Work life balance / some corporate nonsense which seems to be present regardless of the employer."
good,"Fannie Mae is a great place to learn to new skills and the work culture is improving for young talent with the new leadership. However, management team are not as engaged with employee's career development."

good,"Company was very generous to its employees and everyone was ""family."" That changed when the company was taken over by its regulator and the future of the workplace became unsteady. It is back on track and its affordable housing mission is once again front and center. I loved the mission and the people. It's a great place to work!"
good,"Typical day at work"
good,Fannie Mae is an excellent company. I worked there during the restatement period which was stressful. I feel like they have bounces back and provide a great service. I would give them a second chance.
good,"a different assignment each week"
good,"Fannie Mae is quai-government organization, therefore there is a great deal of bureaucracy, which is not employee friendly, the management staff is very much, if they like you on a personal level, you have an opportunity to advance, if they don’t, your career will be short lived, going to HR for assistant, will only make it worse. I enjoyed the people I worked with daily. The company has continual downsizing regardless of department and that had people on edge and stressful.  Fannie Mae offers very competitive pay, however the job became very boring due to micro management, there really is no thinking outside of the box."
good,"Supports affordable housing"
good,"I came from a mortgage banking background so getting on at Fannie Mae meant I would one day be able to write my own check.  It's not until you get behind the veil that you realize the full implications of ""quasi"" governmental.  There are multi-layers of redundant oversight.  It is frustrating and wears on you, but you are fairly compensated."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with ping pong tables, a respectful environment, and staffed with highly motivated professionals."
good,"The people at Fannie Mae (in the Chicago Office) are great to work with, and very helpful.  Most employees work remote; therefore, the environment has changed immensely."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with daily. Good overall job and work life balance. Enjoyed the overall culture; however, continual downsizing had people on edge."
good,"This place is a mess today. It's doing a lot to change and will be an employer of choice in a few years."
good,"My review can only be written fro a contractor's perspective.  I enjoy the work I am tasked with for the company.  As a project manager, overseeing the quality assurance program and professional development team is a challenging duty which makes the day go by quickly."
good,"Production driven environment. "
good,"As a entry level employee without a college degree, my growth was negatively impacted."
good,"Largest secondary mortgage market firm"

good,"If you're willing to over look sub-par compensation packages and management that believes in minimal rewards, this place has a lot to offer to learn -- both technology and process wise. I spent 10 good years learning here that groomed me for challenging futures."
good,The best aspect of working at Fannie Mae is the quality of the individual with whom we work.
good,"Great company, heavy bureaucracy and politics. culture depends on the team and manager you work with. and not consistent across the company"
good,smart people. good compensation in general. good life-work balance as well.
good,Run the Facilities of a large datacenter for principally the banking finance industry.
good,"While at FannieMae I learned a wide variety of things from Mortgage Insurance to Securities investments, that play a role in today's market. I also was able to continue development on SQL using Oracle Toad and Microsoft SQL Server 2008, in order to create reports for executive financial reporting. The co-workers have been great and probably some of the best I have ever worked with."
good,Worked for a great boss. Knew I could do a great job and let me move forward on projects.
good,Great environment as there is no growth in my department and no where to move other than a level 2 support agent. Hours of operation and the ability to work from home is a wonderful experience.
good,This was a fun and interesting place to work. I enjoyed learning the processes and being molded into the kind of employee Fannie Mae needed me to be. I am smarter and a more efficient worker thanks to this company.
good,Will have the opportunity to get exposure to a plethora of new technologies and workstreams. A good place to expand your skill set and establish cross-departmental collaboration.
good,"Good place to learn new skills and advance in career. Had the opportunity to wear multiple hats and learn to juggle different responsibilities which included writing and maintaining requirements, coordinate and work with test team, work with DB team in getting and maintaining requirements, work with users during UAT, worked as a Proxy scrum master and hosted scrum ceremonies and maintained Jira board after coordinating with team. Made sure requirements were met and timelines were followed."
good,"A typical day at work begins with daily staff meeting, daily JIRA board update and review mtg., WoW session updates twice weekly; problem solve daily customer issues and/or opportunities; troubleshooting, collaboration with internal customers re: complex deal structures, manual workarounds, system enhancements, responding to all audit requests and facilitating all audit walk-throughs; committing & delivery of multifamily housing."
good,Great or terrible depending upon management.  You must constantly ask for advancement opportunities if you wish to go that route.  Flexibilities for the jobs are not applied fairly within the same organization nor beyond it.
good,"Good place to work however some manager do not know how to follow the policy. Texas location is great. "
good,"There's a lot of political tic-tac-toe going on... Too many org changes to cater to certain VPs likes/dislikes. They also seem to take outside judgment to heart. Too much validation from consultants to appear ""hip"" or ""with the times"" to potential customers/vendors."
good,Learned the American work place ethics in a hardworking minority group. Workplace was mostly focused on the deliverables and productivity was measured mostly by the output. Most enjoyable part of the job was how easy it was to get into the building and start  working on the project deliverables that are expected from the employees to finish. That guaranteed job security for the new employees. There was not too much time left to maintain work-life balance.
good,"Overall, Fannie Mae is an awesome place to work and retire.  The benefits are amazing, 401k is great, quarterly bonuses if you meet the criteria set forth by management. The company has some good managers in leadership roles unfortunately my department was not one of them.  If the opportunity presents itself I would encourage you to come work for FNMA."
good,I was a contractor with the company so did not have much interaction with the wider organization but interaction overall was great and team was quite supportive.
good,Good place to work.  Good benefits but little opportunity for promotion.  IT groups are laying off senior individuals and only hiring junior level people.
good,I was given several opportunities for advancement over the years.  The company makes every effort to improve where needed based on the satisfaction surveys.
good,The contract work was great for hours and exposure to higher-level work. Had I had the opportunity to convert into a full-time employee I definitely would have accepted the offer.
good,Compensation and Benefits are excellent. Job work life balance is a positive. Overall Job culture is great. My time with Fannie Mae was quite positive overall.
good,"Management was very personable and approachable.  There was great flexibility and work/life balance.  IT was easy to get stuck in some positions going several years with no promotion, but overall a good company."
good,"Excellent company to work for, your experience is will differ greatly depending on the team. I would recommend someone to work there and the company is  headed in a good direction."
good,Leaders in the industry though going through a transformation which is not an easy task despite the good intentions.  New mid level management is changing the culture from Main St to Wall St and in doing so is shedding experienced staff quickly to add to this inward focus.
good,"Company is changing. Long hours"
good,"A fast paced and very corporate atmosphere with ever looming layoffs. If you are able to get into the right department, you may experience a thriving career under good management. If not, you may be subject to company downsizing."
good,"- Support Request on how to use ServiceNow within the Change Management Module"
good,It was a good experience at Fannie Mae. I had lot of opportunities to learn new things everyday. It was a good working environment. Management system was good too.
good,I learned a lot more about industry standards. The managers were eager to assist with any questions or concerns surrounding the system or collateral issues that may have been evident.
good,"Although, it was a good place to work. I found the pace too slow there. Too many people just do enough to get paid and that is it. Management is also very young not experienced."
good,"Conservative and highly risk averse culture - They need to catch up with industry's pace of technology advancement. Also, process overhead needs to mild down to some extent, too much process hinders with the pace of technological advancement and fast paced development and enhancement"
good,"Great work environment, pay and benefits. Awesome balance work and life. Tuition Assistance available to anyone if want to get  a degree. If want to grow professionally need to relocate to TX or DC. CA office is a small regional office with little opportunities to transition to other areas."
good,"Productive and Agile and fun workplace with ping pong table. Great to work on latest platforms available, great work life balance, wonderful co-workers."
good,"The job was ok, the people were great. The biggest drawback was the restructuring of HP to HPe for the Fannie Mae performance engineering, lots of the jobs were shifted to Texas."
good,"Great workplace environment, vast arena for gathering experience and knowledge.  Not much room for advancement, but extremely talented professionals."
good,"Results oriented professional with over a decade of demonstrated excellence within the Mortgage industry. Strong experience interpreting and applying analysis of loan components. Knowledgeable leader conducting prudent lending decisions through analyzing applicant credit, source of income, property type, loan type, assets, debt ratios and collateral appraisal reports. Strong negotiation and analytical skills with advanced knowledge of real estate practices, legal knowledge, secondary marketing, and mortgage servicing. Highly skilled at researching and applying applicable criteria, identifying program risk, preparing reports and communicating results/recommendations. Effective and goal oriented team player to achieve business objectives and volume goals through superior service."
good,Overall the company was a good place. Upper Management needs to listen to their employees and implement some of our ideas.
good,It is currently going through a major reorganization/restructuring.
good,"Nice Place to Work with great benefits."
good,"I Really Enjoyed working for Fannie Mae. I had a great team, enjoyed my manager and the company culture. Very overwhelming workload and out of date systems were the negatives."
good,"I felt my manager wasn't management material but I really enjoyed my coworkers.  A typical day at work was approving/rejecting agreements between the customer and the company.  Once that project was complete, however, there wasn't a set duty to be performed.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing whether or not I'd have any work to do that day."
good,made outbound calls offering mortgage assistance. creating appointments ensured the proper paperwork is being sent in
good,"Workplace was alright, people were intelligent, too political, management was mediocre."
good,"Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise chartered by Congress. Fannie Mae helps strengthen the U.S. housing and mortgage markets, and to support affordable homeownership."
good,"Fannie Mae is a great place to work with awesome benefits. But, the work/life balance is awful."
good,"Good company with deep mortgage industry skills - spans liquidity creation and regulatory adherence to promote greater home ownership in the US; asset management, capital markets, relationship management"
good,I truly enjoyed working for Fannie Mae. It was a face paced environment and I learned a lot. I enjoyed the different departments that I got to work with.
good,"Great company to work for. They make sure their employees work in a comfortable environment. Also, people are friendly and willing to assist when needed. Benefits and compensation were just great for me. Only down side, most of their employees are under contracts"
good,"Meetings and project work. Wow lean management system takes up the majority of my day which includes daily huddles, problem solves,  floor walks , coaching and process confirmations."
good,"Good place to work and balance of life, good working culture"
good,Gave me a great opportunity over 7 years to grow and learn about the business and how to better implement program management office capabilities. Focus on delivery!
good,Current and previous management has invested a lot of money and time on the employee including investments in two new buildings and an open work concept.
good,It is very relaxing place to work. They provide you with laptop so you can work remote. Good place to learn new skills. They hire College students both intern or graduates.
good,"This company has great benefits , however its very difficult to advance in your career. its not what you know its who you know and if you are in their favorite list."
good,"The standard work week for Fannie Mae is 37.5 hours  The benefits are excellent and the number of holidays and vacation is better than most employers.  The organization is going through an over haul of the working environment.  At this time the reviews of the change are mixed, however the intention is to streamline and ensure all divisions are working with the same guidelines."
good,"Good place to work for a team player. Good befits. Help with student loan payments. Regular business day 9-5. Hardest part of the job, not enough time in the day if you are busy, but you always have help. The company uses Wow (ways of working) to encourage team work. Lots of interesting projects. Projects to give back to the community."
good,Fannie Mae is a good place to work that focuses on being a good corporate citizen by encouraging and empowering people to serve others and their communities.
good,Offer great benefits and work life balance.  Advancement opportunities can be driven by internal politics.  Nice new facility with opportunity for a relaxed work environment.
good,"Can be stressful at times, but compensation and benefits more than make up for the long hours."
good,"Culture changed because of the political and economic climate. This was a great place to work and begin a career. I learned a ton about DC and housing finance and the role that FM plays. After Fannie (especially those people in DC) go to work for the government, but it is a great job for any career-- finance, housing, policy, etc."
good,I loved my position but manager over me was on her way out and was just unwilling to help or listen . She did not like contract workers and showed it. But would go back
good,"With this being a contractual position it was good, I took on the position to see if I liked this type of environment.This is your typical corporate environment if you are looking for the big office feeling this is it. Recognition wasn't common so many individuals which caused it hard to stand out.  Good management and work-life balance."
good,"Most days can be collaborative, working with internal and external customers. Good company culture. Learned that your quality of work is not enough; connections and ""who you know"" is key."
good,Company provides great pay and benefits. Opportunity to learn and grow in a fast paced and high stress environment. Work - life balance is a challenge. Ability to multi-task and meet deliverables is a must.
good,it is an super company i have ever work with it was having a free time to work and great environment having good managers and support team members and really good in payments systems
good,Great company to work for.  Very good place for younger individuals to learn and excel in the secondary mortgage industry.  Management team is very experienced and dedicated to their overall mission.
good,"A very good division of Fannie Mae to work for. "
good,A very good company with work and life balance for employees at all levels. I was a contractor then converted to FT and have worked in various business lines and roles. Enjoyed the projects and made many friends.
good,"Over 8+ years of professional IT experience including 3 plus years of experience on Big Data,"
good,"Fannie mae overall has a good workplace climate, I think it depends on the management you work for."
good,You learn new things. I know things about chocolate I never knew. And they are expensive. He team work was at a level of 7. I've worked 11hr shifts and haven't had a brake..the team was out standing
good,"Well, good until I got laid off.  Other than that I liked the company.  Never planned on leaving.  "
good,Great place to work!!! I really love my co worker/ teammates! I have gained so much knowledge from management and enjoy working in the department that I currently working in.
good,"Great Company and great working environment. Culture is very good and everyone is very professional.  "

good,"Learned how to deal effectively with local elected officials and community leaders. Learned the critical dynamics of the real estate and housing markets, and their impact on local citizens."
good,"Fannie Mae offers great work life balance.  However, job security is hard to find there right now.  Senior management is seeking to streamline the work force regardless of the risk to the business."
good,"I was a contractor at Fannie Mae for a month, so I wasn't there long enough to form an opinion. On the surface everyone seemed pleasant, some of the FTE's I meet had been there for over 10 years so that says something."
good,Good place to work but the strength of the organization is it's people...they are dedicated and are helpful.
good,"Management has high expectations. Co-workers are great."
good,"Overall Fannie Mae is a good place to work with.  Benefits are good, they're big on training.  If you're a full time employee, it will be hard for you get laid off, except in special circumstances where you are a poor performer and don't improve even after training and coaching.    I gave management only 3 stars because not all managers are made equal.  Some of them are too political and think only of their own advancement.  Executive leadership is a different story -- they have a vision and takes the whole company towards it."
good,No job security.  Great co workers.  Great location in Addison Texas.  The politics get old.  Work home life mix is good.
good,"The company overall is a good company, found it to be rewarding in the sense that they have daily meetings that can be beneficial (Learning experiences) around 50% of the time. The company out sources work to servicers, difficulty of the job is to get the servicers implement the changes in a timely fashion, this would assure that losses would be reduced."
good,"1, Research topic picked"
good,Fannie Mae is a great place to work. The culture is fun and the flexibility is key!
good,"Most of the account/projects team members are very skilled and we successfully planned, developed and deployed project in record time."
good,"Decent place to work, but bar is always raising.  Reviews and advancement are at discretion of your manager.  Fight to get on the better projects and teams, it'll affect how you do at the end of the year."
good,It was a good experience working with Fannie Mae. They have offices in Reston and Hundern at VA.  I worked with many projects as Test Manager. I used to look at the entire account for HPE.
good,Very good experience working here at Fannie. Learned new technologies and lots of process oriented methodologies implementation and streamline the deployment process.
good,Was a contractor  at the time ...the company  was very professional and family oriented.  Keep everyone updated on different changes moment to moment.  Excellent trainers and open door policy
good,"My work as a Fannie Mae intern was focused on helping staff with existing projects. This included debugging, quality assurance, and data pulls. Working here was a good educational experience and the intern atmosphere was quite relaxed."
good,"Plenty of opportunities for learning through in class and online training resources and brown bags. Great work/life balance, and best pay & benefits I've seen in this area so far."
good,"pay is good. "
good,"It was a great place to work.  It was hard if you wanted to return back to Fannie after leaving difficult.  The overly encourage internal verses external, not a good balance.  "
good,I learn a lot while at Fannie.  Management was keen on growing in knowledge and providing big picture of corporate vision.  Interactions between departments was encouraged.  I was able to sharpened by management organizational skills.  I was able to develop excellent business relationship with client around the country.
good,"- Cultural diversification and respect for all races, ethnicity and background"
good,"Fannie Mae has an important mission and believes strongly in its customers. There are numerous opportunities to serve the customer and the community. As an employee, it is empowering to see the impact that we make."
good,"As the job culture is very good, I like working at Fannie Mae.  I never received much compensation benefits despite working  late hours and weekends when i was an employee.  Job Security or Advancement is literally dependent on your manager.   Job Work/Life Balance i would rate as 5 as the upper management is very considerable trying to keep the team happy."
good,"its a good place to work. My contract ended so i had to leave. But I would like to work there again if there may be an opportunity. My teammates were great, even though the management was going through a major change, everybody put extra efforts to do their jobs."
good,Fast Paced; Fair amount of overtime; Competitive compensation; Limited growth opportunities; I would like to see Fannie Mae invest more in staff training programs.
good,This workplace provided a great deal of satisfaction in that the goal of the unit was to advance and include affordable housing options for buyers.  Work days were typically challenging in a good way with many opportunities for cross functional team projects which was exciting.  Peers seemed to be of above average intelligence who worked hard but kept in perspective why we all did what we did.
good,"The first six years (+/-) were very interesting and challenging. I survived several rounds of layoffs until I was placed in a job, for the last year or so, that consisted of doing the same task seven to 12 times daily that ""almost"" could have been done by a computer if programmed correctly. It was not challenging and, to be honest, very boring with many days involving no communication with other staff members."
good,"The work is challenging but the employees are very competent, knowledgeable and extremely helpful which make the work day enjoyable, pleasant and fun."
good,Fannie Mae is a good place to work. Work/life balance is very much a part of the culture.  The compensation is good.  The challenges are in part driven by being a public/private entity beholden to many constituencies.
good,"A typical day included reviewing 100-150 claims per day, and decision the claims. I learned how to review and decision different claims, like MI claims, property reservation, hazard claims, and reconciliation claims. Management was great at Fannie Mae! Workplace culture was fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job was getting to work, due to major traffic. I will miss the experience of coming to work everyday, and the people I've met."
good,My career grew constantly while I was at Fannie Mae.  They were very supportive of helping me achieve a work-life balance that worked for me. I had the flexibility to telework and work part-time. I also was able to flow between being a people manager and an individual contributor with no problem and no affect to my compensation. I was able easily to relocate with the company as well when I desired to be closer to my family. The culture was very accepting and the benefits were typically ahead of the curve.
good,"There is lots of room to grow with Fannie Mae and are interested in what you want to do. They will listen to your concerns and help you transition into new roles if available. Incredibly talented and hardworking employees, but managers are very busy and sometimes hard to get in touch with. Lots of contractors so turnover happens pretty frequently."
good,"very competitive, I liked the vision and the business model. I like the focus on the customer and the community work. Some of the best leaders."
good,"Excellent work environment as a contractor with coworkers (full time and contractors)."
good,"A typical day might start with generation of meeting agenda, dictating and filing of meeting minutes, editing of PowerPoint presentations, making travel arrangements, submitting expense reports to generating client billing statements.  All while taking incoming telephone call from clients and co-counsel, responding to emails and updating client files."
good,"This is a fun place to work. The people here are wonderful! This is a great place to gain experience in the early childhood field. This site is a accredited, very clean and organized."
good,"I've worked at Fannie Mae for more than four years. I've gotten the opportunity to learn a lot and be a team lead while working with great people. Fannie Mae is appealing to me due to the multicultural environment, flexibility to work from home and the extra activities that Fannie Mae is involved in like Help the Homeless Program or Walk for a cause."
good,"Excellent envirnoment in Fannie Mae to work. It was great experience to work•	Overall 8 years of IT experience including 4 years as Oracle Database Administrator"
good,"I enjoy working here, great salary and good benefits. However, uncertain future and threat of layoffs are concerning. Lots of red tape for project execution."
good,"good opportunity, consistent in change, benefits are some of the best in the business. very corporate like structure. more management than needed."
good,The job is very interesting as the no day is similar to the last one except during close time. The procedures are same but the fund accounting transactions are always complicated and fun to work with. I feel like I learn something new all the time.
good,"A convergence between IT and finance; with the addition of business compliance application. The company business server was regulated by me - to enable post UAT production. Loans, credits, and debits were monitored and reported on - using the IT link - maintain the company's finances."
good,Really like it. Very nice firm to work for. Management is very good and takes care of employees.
good,"The company helped several homeowners. "
good,A friendly and productive environment!! A great place to work for!!!!
good,Offers you a wide range of work experience. Hectic one day and can be relaxing the other.
good,"My first full time job, a good place to work and learn with balanced work and life."
good,"As part of Daily basis We resolve Tickets and configure Monitors and try to see where we can do more enhancements."
good,"Fannie Mae has a great mission, and continues to do what is best for tax payers."
good,"A great place to work before the government took over. The organization had a lot of very talented people from top schools; however, given that company had a salary freeze - a lot of the top talent has since left the organization."
good,"FannieMae provided good work-life balance for working parents.  Management was generally fair, however there is much politics there.  I didn't feel challenged enough where work became boring sometimes.  It is very difficult to get promoted.  You have to find a job on a different team to move up levels."
good,"A good company to work, flexible work arrangements, motivating management and fun workplace with ping pong tables. Nice cafeteria. A good learning experience."
good,"productive, agile, fast work space, working with various different asset management transactions and lot to learn from it.always on the go and relax and lots of fun to work also"
good,"Love the work balance life here. The only problem is that this place is full of contractors to do work. Whenever new technologies come out, the team gets to play around with it right away."
good,Good company to work with advance technology and highly motivating management. Benefits are good with flexible work hours. Nice cafeteria with coffee shop.
good,"I very much enjoyed my work at Fannie Mae. Concern I have is that it seems to me there is incentive to encourage older, experienced workers to retire or in some cases get pushed out so that young contractors can come in to do the same job for far less. I can't say I did enjoy working. I encourage individuals to negotiate salary and not allow there to be an effective downturn in valuing analysts. If new employees do research and won't work for less than those already there, this pushing out of the old to bring in the new will not be incentived."
good,Fannie Mae is a great company to work for.  It offers work and life balance and its compensation package is very competitive.  People and culture are great.
good,"Professional and Friendly environment. Glad to be here, even for a short while. I will work again for this company anytime in future and I recommend this client to all my friends."
good,"Experienced people to work with"
good,"Culture is amazing. Leadership encourages collaboration, work life balance and innovation. Constantly trying out mew things. Encouraging people to test and learn. Growth is stagnated."
good,Good place to work. A little backwards. Not many rooms for growth. Could be a little better. Trying to improve opportunities for growth. Looking forward to seeing the future.
good,Typical work day gives opportunity to work on several different technologies and vendor equipment. This provides a continuous learning environment for those so motivated.
good,"Benefits at FM are amazing and they're constantly adding new perks"
good,"Fannie Mae is a great place to work, if you have the drive to move work forward. It does get pretty busy and involves a lot of cross-functional collaboration. Its easy to get lost in a large company like Fannie, if you are intentional about driving your own career."
good,At Fannie Mae hard work is recognized and rewarded. Leadership is focused on the future and ensuring the company is ready for any changes which may come its way.
good,Friendly environment with very helpful people and lot's of willing mentors including upper management. Very talented and smart people. Good collaboration across board and lots of usage of tech (as it is a FinTech company)
good,good working culture with tight security policy excellent communicaton as well as friendly co-workers. Good Management commitment and excellent bonuses
good,Great place to learn and work.Well life and work balance .Was never micromanaged or something as long as work was being done .Would love to work here again in near future.
good,"I enjoyed working for Fannie Mae, great place to jump start your career path in real estate. If you get an offer to join take it will definitely be worth it."
good,"I worked at Fannie Mae as an intern and enjoyed my summer there. Good learning experience, great management, and great culture. Good work life balance and benefits."
good,"Many people misunderstand the role Fannie Mae plays in the economy. Fannie Mae has never provided a mortgage to a single consumer. Its job is to accelerate liquidity in the market by purchasing loans from servicers, so the servicers can continue to provide more loans. I worked there during the housing crisis in Credit Loss Management (foreclosure management). It is hard work. It is honest work.

good,"My typical day of work as a Foreclosure Prevention Specialist II consisted of multiple tasks. I conducted one on one consultations with homeowners to discuss their current hardship with their mortgage as well as explained multiple retention and liquidation options that may be available to them. I also went through homeowners complete financials to help them determine what program is most suitable for their current situation. I also collect several financial documents from each homeowner to submit them for the particular review they are interested in. I worked with over 1500 hundred different Fannie Mae Servicers during my time at Fannie Mae. The Servicers provided me with regular updates on the status of the homeowners review. During my time at Fannie Mae I learned how to successfully manage a pipeline of 80-120 homeowners on a consistent basis. I worked with a small, tight knit group of colleagues in our department and we assisted each other by taking incoming calls for each other when we were already on a call with a homeowner. Notate each others accounts if we speak to a specific homeowner. The hardest part of the job in certain situation is letting a homeowner know that they aren't eligible for any mortgage assistance options. This was rare but something that happened sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was making a difference in homeowners lives on a daily basis. It was also rewarding to receive thank you calls and emails from homeowners that I helped save their home."

good,"A typical day at work would be me coming in saying hello to all of my team members.

The hardest part of my job was being the liaison and trying to reverse a foreclosure decision that was made by mistake due to the servicer's lack of knowledge about the current policy and procedure.
