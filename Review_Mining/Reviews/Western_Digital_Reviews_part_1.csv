rating,review
bad,The job is normal. Not so hard. Beginners level entry job. Broken promises. A lot of Filipinos at WD. Be careful for your lunch bag. People will eat you food.
bad,"Turnover is an issue, but they refuse to invest into making temps full time employees.But they would rather spend money on useless overtime. Don't bother."
bad,Lacks attention to innovation and performance.  Clique core of employees requiring political assimilation and acceptance for long term employment or advancement.
bad,"Even with 20 years experience, you have no job stability. "
bad,"This became really old, really fast. Management are only concerned with their egos. Nepotism and cronyism is rampant. They waste so much money it’s not even funny. People “commute” from other states every week and stay at expensive hotels like they live there.  If they didn’t keep throwing away on unnecessary travel they might have a chance at survival."
bad,"Mandatory overtime, calling sick on your overtime day counts as your regular day of work, supervisor would make me work mandatory overtime even when i tell him im busy that day"
bad,"Hyper-focused on metrics and micromanagement. ""boiler room"" mentality. Serious Nepotism happening. Resistant to any and all positive culture changes. PTO is actively frowned upon and even told it will be denied if you arent hitting your number. Work/Life balance is a dirty word. Office is an outdated cave. Depressing place to work."
bad,"Awful management, they love to micro manage, boiler room mentality, taking PTO is actively discouraged, often held hostage if you aren't making goals/quota. Almost no work form home option. No work-life balance.  Management has hired family members and and doesn't hold them to the same standards others are expected to meet. Terrible office, in dire need of an update that corporate has NO interest in doing. Cant speak to the greater WD org, but the Tegile division is awful. Run away!"
bad,"Upper management is terrible. Constant layoffs."
bad,"Senior and mid-management was incompetent, and largely did not have a 1st line manager. When I did, they were discouraging in their  approach to managing and negative toward the work. They provided no leadership. They did not live up to the company ideals."
bad,The only company I've worked for in my 15 year career that I would strongly warn against applying for. (unless you know how to work the political corporate ladder)
bad,"Its purely business, no considerations for employees. They are very pushy in a way that at the end of the day, they will push you really hard to work and when you messes up they treat you like a criminal. And one more thing, their system is like “its not WHAT you know,its  WHO you know”.."
bad,Western stinks!  Management got jobs because of nepotism.  Most folks did not last long.  You were given a lot of work without direction. When someone in senior management thought it was good an idea then you followed it.  They spent money on consultants that did not have value.
bad,"Western digital acquires startups without any business plan or road map. Once acquired, they hardly invest in people or product. The acquired division always runs in a silo. Never integrated with the parent company. The higher management just talks about revenue without addressing what they need to do to get there. After a year, they will sell the product and people to a minor player. And 50 to 60 percent employees are laid off. Make sure you join a company that values you."
bad,"Western digital was a great company to work. However; due to the acquisition of Sandisk and HGST, the culture is very poor. Low morale due to constant layoffs and jobs are being outsourced overseas."
bad,"The technology is pretty exciting and there are some great folks working there."
bad,"Management are terrible...in it for themselves and don't empower their employees.  The management of the ""new"" WD is from HGST...lack leadership and very selfish.  Find other places like Seagate to work if you want better management and leadership!"
bad,"In regards to workplace culture, no end in site with merging with 3 enormous Corporations"
bad,Western Digital is a company that not a friendly place to work.  Upper management doesn't know how to run it staffs.  I am not recommend to work here.
bad,"If you dream of becoming a fire fighter but could not cut it, WD is the place to be! Be prepared to battle fires daily in a high pressure situations. One little spark can spread like wildfire within a matter of minutes."
bad,Management doesn’t manage. Upper management doesn’t care. Most employees work VERY little. Compensation is a joke for a company in the Sillicon Valley. Look elsewhere.
bad,I was hired by HGST and enjoyed the role and team.  As expected the company went through a significant change when Western Digital acquired them and new management was brought on board.
bad,"Engineering Manager rarely gets through a meeting without losing control of his temperament and raising his voice to someone. I left a contract to hire position, not wanting to hire on to that kind of manager."
bad,"they seem to really take advantage of the temporary laborers by not paying the cost of living for the location and hiring about five times as many workers as they really need."
bad,"May be once upon a time they used to be a strong company. But what I saw there - poor management, talented people are not appreciated, low work ethics - literally - people come to work to get their paycheck and do bare minimum. I think they lost their way."
bad,"WD is run by about 5 leaders and no one else matters."
bad,Management prefers to keep cheaper technicians and engineers over long term loyal employees who sacrificed holidays and weekends away from family and friends. Even those with college degrees will get passed over to those with a simple tech degree from a trade tech school when layoffs roll around or when departments cut back on staff. Firmware engineers are even required to work on Saturdays and they are salaried. I  would stay away from this company at all costs.
bad,"Personal life was expected to take a back seat to work, no matter what the circumstances. Regularly thrown under the bus if it meant you or me. Powerless to get changes made to improve the environment."
bad,Different groups segregate based on ethnicity. WD likes to bring a lot of engineers over from Asia on work visas with suppressed salaries.
bad,"this should be addressed on an individual basis, there was no meaningful work available, the company direction during my time was in a constant state of flux"
bad,"The most incompetent engineering technical group I have come across in 15 years. They can not even communicate with minimum English competency. Fierce infighting to ride the ""gravy train"" of a monopoly. Rampant nepotism and cronyism of an ethnic sub-culture. "
bad,Unfair compensation between similar performing individuals at same level. Salary adjustments only as part of counter offer. Decent delivery driven culture but no work/life balance or value of employee talent and compensation. Good place to start from a learning perspective but not a place to continue to work at.
bad,"My co-workers were wonderful, but the job was hard as it dealt with collections of hospital bills and at times trying times. The management was easy to work with and gave you the tools to do your job."
bad,"Good working environment,Team work -decide together to solve issue and good management that care of all employee ,and few benefit that provide to all employee ."
bad,"This place was a great place to work for when it was Hitachi GST.  WD purchased, and the environment went down hill.  It was a tensed place to work at.  If a manager didn't like you, you were gone.  The HR department was a joke, there was nobody to speak to.  There is favoritism, if your in a certain click or kiss up to the right management you have a better chance to stick around.  They expect you to work lots of hours, over the weekends, and holidays... But have no problem getting rid of you if it helps them bring in someone they ""know"".  "
bad,"Working at WD has been very stressfull, they do not have a clear plan to tackle the work. They do Layoffs every 6 months making workers lose confidence and have stress, because they don't know if they will get let go."
bad,Good place and fullfill all staff needed. All staff is very nicely and good place for lunch nor dinner. Clean places and friendly. Can enjoy during the work.
bad,But their Human Resources department are very unreliable. As well as their payroll department. My experience with some of the personnel was not very positive.
bad,"I worked for WDC for more than 15 years, and while I hated the style of management and the ugly politics people played to get ahead, I stuck around for the friendship of the people.  Management here is the pits and all of them get there playing dirty politics and backbiting.  These people thrive on tooting their own horn with little achievement, but management loves them because they see a bit of themselves in these people.  For example, one VP of firmware was promoted to the post, despite him being one of the causes of company spending billions on a failed enterprise product launch, due to his strong political connection with senior management.  The shame was that the guy who grew the company’s profit by delivering highly profitable data center drives was shoved aside to promote the other guy.  Senior management even gave the politician credit for products everyone knew he had nothing to do with!"
bad,"The acquisition of SanDisk has been challenging as WD management teams attempts to live out the San Disk culture.  It is as if an old, draconian team is trying to be young an cool.  Cannot teach old dogs new tricks."
bad,"Some executives ok, most were not"
bad,"Western Digital was one of the best places I have worked for to begin a career as an engineer. They provided lots of opportunity to continue growing as an engineer and there were never shortages of new technology to learn. "
bad,Employees are generally good people but there are serious management issues.  Management consistently expects exempt employees to work 50+ hours per week but provides no additional compensation.  Employees are treated as headcount and layoffs occur anytime employees are not over utilized.  The bonus structure is based on nebulous corporate metrics and do not accurately reflect individual contributor performance.
bad,"A 20bn company formed by the merges of 3 big companies in the storage space. Integration is  still slow (very delayed) and ongoing, which means constant recorg without clear communication of objectives"
bad,"No life balance, focus on delivering products at all costs. Expected the engineers to work late at night and at least one day during the weekend. One VP was infamous for arriving on Saturday and walk the parking lot counting cars to ensure enough people were working the weekend."
bad,"The company pretty much defines what it does only on the basis of marketing and doesn't really have a vision to lead and innovate anymore. No more vision for technology, only to make money. If you want to really explore and innovate with software, unless they already know someone will buy exactly that, they just don't care. As such, the company is entering a period of stagnation, especially with the decline of drive sales."
bad,"The group that I was working for was almost entirely let go. Afterward, no one knew how do basic product procedures because the management let the persons responsible for the procedure was let go. I will think twice about purchasing a WD product again. "
bad,"I had the best team. My co-workers were great, we helped each other to have a better production. clean environment. helpful staff."
bad,Day to day testing of the SMB storage server appliance in a test lab environment. Hardest part was being managed by several supervisors. Enjoyable part was the paycheck.
bad,"Politics, deceit, incompetence, poor benefits, industry is in death spiral."
bad,Due to the acquisition of Sandisk and HGST - WD's culture is messed up and management is not aligned on goals in regards to company mission or culture. They don't encourage or allow flexibility or work from home that much. Not much progression internally and most important thing is that management is terrible - they are going to take the company down. no value for their employees.
bad,"No one responds to emails."
bad,Company lost its way and let go some valuable people that could help.   To many changes with no clear road map going forward.   Too many directions with no real process.
bad,"I found there was no work life balance. It seemed every deliverable was due at the same time. Being a subject matter expert on four IT projects was flattering, however it meant I was working 12-14 hour days for over a year with no end in sight. Each IT project  wanted 30-60% of my time, not including day to day manager activities. After ending up in the hospital with chest pains, I delegated some of day to day tasks to my team members. Daily decisions which business unit got helped--It was a relief to be laid off."
bad,Unstable industry resulting in multiple abrupt layoffs. No attempt by the company to relocate employees into other departments/positions. Managers/directors overly cautious to not step on other managers'/directors' toes to the extent where productive communication is stifled.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"A somewhat progressive environment that took the occasional chance despite a staunchly corporate environment suffered from a series of mergers and acquisitions. What remains is a soulless, unimaginative, ""old-school"" company that relishes the old way of doing things at the cost of employee happiness. "
bad,"unhealthy politics "
bad,"loved the guys I worked with, but company lacked strong management, too many V.P. of... who didn't care about the workers just the $$. I seen a lot of smart and talented people leave because WD doesn't promote well from within."
bad,From day 1 my manager was angry at me. He seemed like he was trying to intimidate me when I was just there to write code. I saw his boss pull him twice into an office when he got angry at other people. Once was at the IT guys and I don't know who he was angry at the other time. I never had the experience working anywhere where I would make sure I had a defensible position while trying not to look like I was doing that. I made a point not to leave an unattended cup of coffee or anything in my cube in case he dropped anything in it.
bad,"Good bonus, not so good medical and dental insurance. People are usually friendly. Not as stressful as compared to other semiconductor companies."
good,Too much expectations. Bad management. Leads in positions that they are not capable of doing. Being trained by people who are asking you if things are right.
good,Western Digital gives you a great foundation to learn all the systems and get into a great rhythm. There are great people in teams that are enjoyable to work with. Little to no opportunity for growth.
good,"In the Milpitas campus there are over 2,000 employees that work onsite. You get to meet a lot of people with different backgrounds and cultures. Good place to learn and grow."
good,"Management doesnt know how to manage business or sell products efficiently. Otherwise, it is a good place to work, energetic team, friendly and helpful people."
good,"Just who you know = not what you know "
good,Lots of meetings and typical corporate politics hinder the focus of the company.  Great technical teams but Management could be better to align with mission statement.
good,"All in all the company was a good to work for. Pay was OK but the constant layoff's where hard to take. I was in one. "
good,It's productive and fun being work with them. I learned how to operate machine's. Management is good. The workplace is good. I love my job but my others co worker's did not do ther part sometimes. When they have a free meal.
good,"WD is a no nonsense company with little empowerment and most decisions made at the executive level. Company has major amount of debt to pay off, which forces the executive team to focus on getting maximum postive operations cash flow."
good,One of the most interesting jobs I have had and the people there are pretty sharp. The downside is that depending on your team your chances for advancement are limited. Some teams give out promotions like candy while others are much more stringent. Also the work life balance is pretty bad for some teams.
good,"I love this company because the work here was not hard, its easy but the bad thing about it they don't give permanent position before. But I've heard they change that now."
good,"The hardest part is deal with people"
good,"I have no comments"
good,"I worked at WD for 3 years.  During this time WD culture changed from good to bad rather quickly.  At the time of departure, the culture and personnel changes left many programs in flux.  Bonuses were nice for the first year.  Raises and promotions are few and far between.  Limited professional growth."
good,Management needs a more progressive and comprehensive approach to problem solving.  Non skilled management personnel in the Semiconductor industry.
good,"Branded Products Group: Potentially interesting work, but in a toxic political environment."
good,"I loved working at WD for 7 years, then I got a new manager. Things went downhill from there. Before my new boss, reviews were very high, never a strike against my quality of work. After new manager, ratings very poor. Six months later I was laid off after putting up with my manager bad mouthing me in public and I wasn't even there! A rotten manager ruined my career there. WD sucks."
good,"All hi-tech companies are fast paced, with the normal challenges associated. The difference is how the management handles these challenges. Most significantly, whether or not a team-oriented atmosphere is fostered. WD as a whole is a well run company. WD Media, the division in which I worked, did not foster a culture conducive to teamwork."
good,"friendly stuff and coworker,the have a nice room for orientation,they have everything in the office for the applicant need for work.they also provide uniform,boss are very nice to all the applicants"
good,Great co workers.  Management is terrible.  Benefits are poor.  Long commutes.  Salary is very good.  If you like working on older 200mm equipment this is not a bad place to work.
good,"its okay to work because you have a 3 and 4 days off but its also"
good,There is a very fun game room and great activities for employees trough-out the year. Overall there is a good environment but little job security for individuals
good,"overall i think the company lacks deeply technical representation at all levels.  Combine this with a significantly large corporate culture, and an equally large human resource department and you have found your retirement location!"
good,The hardest part of the is in handling a production where in you need to monitor the line(need to make a call inside the company) even on your rest days or even out of you duty hours.
good,"Employees are seen as expendable.  I survived multiple rounds of layoffs in the 3 years I was there, until I didn't...   There is extensive use of contractors to make their bottom line look better and not have to pay full benefits.  "
good,Here looking for a new job after layoff in April. Spent the last 3 years dodging other layoffs but now my time is up. All our jobs have been sent overseas but we did get to pack up most of our equipment and train the new workers.
good,"The company is run by a management who mimics communist countries. I learned that hard work does not always pay off. The workplace culture is not academic. The engineers have the common sense of a child. The hardest part of the job is not the technical aspects, but instead having to deal with office politics and people who try to sabotage your projects. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving the building. Employees are not valued only profits and shareholders matter."
good,"The salary and benefits are not very good. There is no job security."
good,"Good work environment, but bad executive management in BU level, a lot of wrong acquisition led a lot of layoff."
good,70 hours / per week was the norm.  lately this has improved since the merger with HGST.  Promotions and raises were nearly non-existent for upper level engineers.
good,"Vertical Integration"
good,"You enjoy working with peers, but management is blind to the work that is done. They are also unable to balance work load appropriately. they give some workers too much to do, and some hardly anything."
good,Company still carries an out dated culture. They are trying hard to change but legacy executive members are dragging its feet. A lot of nonsense reorganizations are happening throughout the company.
good,"High tech company with opportunities in multiple areas of research and manufacturing.   Located in Silicon Valley, making it a fast pace environment with competitive companies near by."
good,"Western Digital acquired many other companies such as SanDisk, HGST ans so on. So there are still many company cultures. It looks like does not settle down the unified culture yet. sometimes this kind of situation makes employees feel confused. "
good,"HDD business is a saturated business and will probably go on for another 5-10 years. SSD is here to take over. Western Digital is a great company to work in with ever changing technologies. The only downside is the management. They have vision, but it comes at a cost."
good,Company influx due to integration of recent acquisitions and changing storage industry. Limited upside for professional growth as component storage industry is contracting.
good,"Better than the Gulag, and great to work with the main engineering teams in Fremont, Malaysia and Thailand."
good,"The company revolves more around making the numbers, the runs the shipments over employee recognition.  There are basic learning classes for everyone but advance learning is limited until up to management."
good,Good people working in a rundown facility. The old IBM buildings built in the '50s. Job was fine while it lasted. Most of the people who work there are decent people.
good,"Overall a great place to work lot of intelligent people to work with, great experience for interns, but poor business mindset with the upper management."
good,Western Digital Corporation is a good place to work though the benefits and compensation is that compitative compare to all other same side corporate companies
good,"I liked working for Western Digital.  The company has a lot of good things and bad things going for it.  They have aquired many companies over the years.  They are currenlty letting go many, many people as a result.  They believe in sending US job's outside of the country,"
good,"I worked in the magnetic recording industry for 18 years as a modeler. It is a rough business. I enjoyed the line of work. Numerical modeling of physics and engineering problems."
good,"A great place to learn to be independent. Many uses the company as resource of knowledge and a stepping stone to progress in their career."
good,"Some of the groups here are great and have supportive, participant managers. Unfortunately poor managers are not weeded out, especially when protected by other old-timer cronies. I saw little done to encourage collaborative behavior, rather finger-pointing was condoned in the department I worked."
good,"There is always opportunities to learn.  Great engineering teams.  A lot of smart and dedicated people work there."
good,"My co-workers were great, but management only cared about numbers. This lead to them not caring about their employees' well-being. Constantly forcing people to work over-time, work on days off, etc.."
good,"Western Digital actively acquired new companies, and attempted to integrate newly acquired employees into WD culture.  It was difficult to do, and not always successful."
good,Management demonstrated poor leadership and lack of concerns for your carrier path. No direction and no goals were ever  provided. Management reactive behavior rather than being proactive and being thoughtful.
good,"The meeting schedules never end, but overall the work experience is leading edge. "
good,"Company overall is doing very well. It has good position in the storage business after the WD, HGST merge and the acquisition of SanDisk. It has a solid position in the HDD business, meanwhile also a significant presence in solid state storage. The Fremont wafer fab has been affected during the merge and acquisition periods: management has been changed frequently and only become stable recently. Work culture is results driven and emphasize on cost saving and lean manufacturing."
good,"WD has gone through a lot of changes with numerous mergers and acquisitions.  As such, the culture is in serious evolution.  There are a LOT of very talented people but there is also a LOT of politics in upper management making execution less crisp."
good,"After many corporate acquisitions, the company is splintered. Especially in Customer Technical Support, 3-5 different systems of assisting customers and closing issues are still employed."
good,"Good place to work at"
good,"I learned a lot in this company. My coworkers took their time to teach me and advance my skills in the computer industry. I would recommend this company, however, there are many lay offs through the year."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with on a daily basis."
good,Co-workers are capable and hardworking. Management has little respect to employee. The hardest part is the volatility of the industry.
good,"The management was good and was given lots of exposure in new products and projects."
good,Schedule rotates between working 3 days a week then 4 days a week. No holidays off but then schedule makes it a holiday every week basically.
good,"A typical company. Will survive from economic ups and downs.A company has been keeping money-mading for over 10 years. High level management has been changed very often, it just made a lot uncertainties."
good,"Big enough to buy the competitors, instead of compete and innovate"
good,I enjoyed my time at Western Digital. They welcome families to work there and don’t discriminate. Managers are involved with the employees and have good relationships with them. They serve employees lunch twice a week. Bonuses twice a year. Activities. It just drains you physically and mentally. Sometimes emotionally.
good,"A pretty average tech company overall. SanDisk and HGST acquisitions from years ago have only just begun to integrate. Slow moving, below average benefits, probably a good place to park yourself before retiring."
good,"Good experience, cross functional teams were very professional and leadership supportive. Good company to start and to grow professional experience for life."
good,Western Digital was a nice place to work.  Good salary and benefits and lots of good people.  Unfortunately they had grown over the years through acquistions and didn't do a good job of integrating the various companies.  In the end they decided to close the facility I worked at leaving me out of a job.
good,Typical corporation to work for.  Reasonable promotion opportunities.  reasonable salary.  Reasonable bonus opportunity plan.  Reasonable compensation overall.
good,"nice employees, good perks, good company overall. but as any large company there are drawbacks - too many managers with too many short sighted decisions."
good,WDC provides incredible learning opportunities. There is some empowerment to a certain degree. But there is very little scope for growth and the company does not promote from within.
good,"I've been working as a temp in Western Digital for almost 2 years now. Its a good working environment, full of co-workers you would easily be friends with, interesting technology you would be able to explore and fair amount of breaks. Although the company is competitive among shifts and work starts early, VERY early. It's difficult  especially for those who live far, even with the provision of a shuttle."
good,"A good place to work with but career advancement is very slow, some operators who have been working with the company for 20 years are still operators until now...."
good,"A typical day will start with meeting of the outgoing and incoming personnel. It is not uncommon to find out information about a issue was not disclosed. "
good,"work until you move on, nothing too exciting, not much mobility upward.  Work for a paycheck and go home.  At times feel like a robot going thru the motions"
good,management not very clear and impactful in terms of leading and vision. It's easy to get lost in the process with little to no leadership. Day to day activities may feel slow and not progressive.
good,"It was okay, I was there for a short time because there were better opportunities. Our company was acquired by western digital, so under my contract, I was obligated to support transition for 6 months at WD before I could leave."
good,"A good place and culture to start a carrier with a good benefits and working environment. You can learn to improve your communication and management,the technologies for technical sites"
good,I've working at this company for 15 years.  Every working days is a challenge.  There are good days and bad days. If you like working for a fast pace company.  This is the one.
good,Never organized very stressful and a lack of getting people home when important but very good people . always kept me filled with food. Never a dull moment
good,"I worked for Western Digital for a couple years. I wanted to stay, but my particular organization is having problems deciding what it needs—whether it wants to focus on process or strategy. There is a lot of processes and the organization wants to be strategic but then falls into processes over innovation."
good,Good place to learn hardware and embedded engineering but software engineering needs work.  Currently integrating several companies so road maps and departments in constant state of flux.
good,"WDC is known as a harddrive manufacturer, however it starts to grow business into system and enterprise storage. They acquired tegile and upthere last year which is a good start of the strategy."
good,Needs improvement. I don’t understand why they allow someone to sleep while at work. When someone complaints for harrassment I think they should do something right away and not just ignore it and even make people think twice that they shouldn’t complaint because nothing is going to happen anyways.
good,It was great while it lasted... 4 plants are closing in US and 1 in Asia in a short period of time. Further lay-offs were made without much attention. Unnecessary projects are eating up salaries of those that are working. Culture is good. People are great. Just depressing to see a colleague in the office one day and not the next. :(
good,I was a contract employee there for 4 plus years and never received an offer to be a direct hire.  I enjoyed working on second shift which fit my schedule.
good,"Coming to work on time is very important , showing the level of respect for your company and your fellow colleges.  performing your job with the best intentions and quality that you can provide. learning from co-workers is an advantage. And should be two sided. As for management I think an open door policy and transparency is a key to successful and smooth relation ship between Management and employees. Family atmosphere because we all are humans and together and as team is much better for each one at the end. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communications. and being a part of the team and perform well is so enjoyable as being an effective part of the team."
good,had a very good partnership programme. worked here for about two weeks. The company had flexible working hours. A pretty big cafeteria but works can be really a lot sometimes.
good,Six years in the company and my salary isn't good. But benefits are okay. I must also say that I gained more knowledge during my six years.It's a fun place to work with.
good,"Fairly competitive with the shift in management and locations.  There is always a fear we will be laid off, but that's corporate capitalism. Remain positive and you will be ok."
good,"It is not a too bad place to work, but also not too good either. "
good,People don't like mandatory overtime and the manager schedule over time without asking your availability.  You will get write off if you don't do over time.
good,"I was the only intern and I think there was no proper structure for the internship program when I joined. I was given a task to create a desktop platform in python and I had no one to help me with it. Without much knowledge, it was quite difficult for me."
good,"I work from my home.  My co-worders are spread around the country but corporate is in Irvine California.  My typical workday is sitting behind a desk analyzing data, sales trends and forecasts.  I manage item creation as well and many other details.  Management at Western Digital is all very nice people.  Western Digital just acquired Sandisk and Hitachi and we have been under integration.  The culture is changing and still undetermined.  The most enjoyable part of my job is quiet time when working on fine details in a spreadsheet or ""when"" I get to be around co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the stress that you encounter from customers and simply trying to get it all done during stressful weeks."
good,"WD is the biggest storage company in the world after the merger with HGST and Sandisk. Overall, very good opportunity to learn about storage industry."
good,Overall review meets company standards. Coworkers are friendly. Managements staffs are great. It's a good place to work
good,I loved my team. Very pleasant environment to work. My co-workers are all very nice individual..working hours 9AM to 6PM.
good,Management won't hesitate to cut head count.  They push employees hard from top to bottom.  It's not a fun company to work at.
good,"Everyday is challenging and excited, with great leaders with fore-sight. With on-set integration, there will be great synergy across the organizations."
good,Was great place to work as an intern.  Worked on interesting projects that directly impacted product shipping out of the factories.
good,Western Digital was a good and fun place to work . My  co- workers are very supportive.and willing to cross train when ever we get  a chance.
good,"The people are very hardworking, loyal and have hope for the future.  As with many companies in Silicon Valley, Western Digital is undergoing a lot of changes, but I believe the organization will come through it stronger than ever."
good,Fast pace manufacturing environment.  Techs are always under pressure to meet deadlines.  I spend 75% monitoring tool repairs and the rest working on projects.  In early and out late is a typical day.  My co-workers are great and they cover each other’s back.  Hardest part of this job is the shortage of manpower and the high number of down tools.
good,The company management has a good record in business management
good,"Too many unnecessary meetings, bu many experienced people."
good,"Ik kwam binnen zonder enige logistieke ervaring en heb daardoor geleerd hoe het in de logistiek er aan toe gaat."
good,"co-worker are pleasant, with minimum supervision where everybody work as a group."
good,Entrenched in the industry and major player.
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"I enjoy flex hours which allows me to manage my personal business while getting my work done at WDC. "
good,"The company was reasonable to work form.  Many long term employees but not a lot of advancement after the merger of HGST and SanDisk."
good,"I enjoyed my time at western digital. The company pays well and offers great benefits to it's employees. The only thing I didn't like was the work culture. While I was there, it was a very traditional company without many work functions."
good,"Love to work at this company lot of good people most of the engineering are nice and very professional,  The only reason why did I  left because my salary is  not enough to live in fremont area. I worked here  for 5 years and did not get permanent."
good,"A large company with multiple different cultures within. WD and HGST integration over with, but WD and SanDisk integration just peeking. Seems like too many layers of management. Job Security and Advancement poor on the HDD side. Unlimited vacation in US for exempt employees, but controlled by direct managers."
good,Poor internal communication between departments. Thus resulting in a lack of information to obtain needed materials to provide quality work. A lot of turnover with merging brands.
good,"Western Digital is a stable manufacturer with solid business. Work load and life balance are highly dependent on teams. Can be super busy and 24/7 on call if you are related to production line. It used to keep a start up style with fast moving attitude and less politics. However, after integration with HGST and San Disk, everything has changed."
good,"Good workplace, friendly staff, great management, nice environment, competitive working habit, relevant salary, economically material and resource management"
good,Since I became a part of Western Digital's culture overall the experience was a 7 out of 10 on a scale of satisfied. Management need to change in order for the company to improve. While working there I learned that in order to keep your departments budget you must purchase and upgrade for severals personal gain. According to my moral and ethical work ethic this is wrong.
good,"My direct manager has been fantastic. He has invested in me and my career in an immeasurable way. I was exposed to many different levels of manufacturing and engineering and was able to fine tune skills. I used excel a lot. "
good,"People generally stay at WD because of their peers. People are generally very friendly, and encourage extra-curricular activities."
good,"I enjoyed working with engineering teams at WDC corp. I usually worked in electrical lab environment using oscilloscope and other tools, and reviewing drive logs for historical operational events, to diagnose and to determine root cause of failure. I was a very hard worker and friendly getting along with everyone."
good,"This company is famous for cost optimization of the products and not for developing new technologies. It is a good place for routine work but not for challenging research and development activities."
good,"Went through outsourcing experience"
good,"Work 4 day per week so nice.I was learn more experience in this factory.get more friend..work together at the same time..So far..management Ok.work place culture so good..the hardest part of the job is loading and unloading..that is can make me work no life.all the man power did'nt want to do that job.break time too short..but that job non stop work.push and unload from 7 to 7 pm.so far..this job ok..but that job not equavalent with our salary..get work so hard.the most enjoyed part of job is wetchart open cassete and lab guy.Lastly, thankfully because give me chance to work at this company and give me spoon rice to my future."
good,Management classes given by company.  Worked with different culture of employees. worked with good group of supervisors which helped a lot in the beginning. Managers listen most of the operators and they keep all kinds of favorites which downs the morale of the supervisors.
good,western digital dominates the disk drive market; good to work in the advanced technology group.  the office working environment is reasonable and like typical big company.
good,Company is good to work for.  Strong Change management is key to the success of Western Digital. This will help with their aggressive goals of harmonization.
good,"Work schedule set in stone, no holidays off. Same schedule every week but you get 3 days off then 4 days off every rotation so its basically a holiday every week anyways."
good,"we hade diferent kinds of fun such as get together at the park two times a year, ping pong table at the break room and we had fun. also, when the company profitabl free lunch and bonus."
good,"During the merger with SanDisk, there were countless layoffs that took place at the Irvine headquarters due to obsolete positions and outsourcing of positions overseas. Job security was terrible despite management informing employees that they were safe from the layoffs. Truth be told, upper management makes all the decisions and the manager of your department has no say in the final decision to weed you out. However, my brief tenure there was a pleasant one nonetheless. Management treated me well and I learned a lot from the senior staff members who were warm and caring about your development there."
good,The hardest part of the job is when you are sleepy you can't sleep because you have to finish your responsibilities . I learned that the most important thing in your job is your time.
good,"Not a bad place to work."
good,"Based on the interest, tasks can be challenging. Good work life balance. Enough oppurtunities to climb up the ladder till 10-12 years of experience after which will have to switch to manegerial ladder."
good,"it was a turn off to work with so many lifers.  The company was trying to reinvent itself but there were too many old timers stuck in their old ways. Lots of changes going on with the acquisition of SanDisk, HGST and others."
good,"12 hour increment shifts working for a magnetic head operations company, that works with many major companies as our customers.  Were hold the electronic future in our hands with this company."
good,"As a Device Material first check machine status(down for maintenance or up for production) Tech qualified machine to run regular "
good,"Busy place to work at. Expect tons of overtime, "
good,It is a good place to work but with many former IBM employees here sometimes it runs too much like an IBM shop.  Good people here turn out great products.
good,"People are being motivated to do better, work as a team with full cooperation between teams."
good,"Everybody here is very friendly and gets along well. Politics within the department is the only thing I would change. I am currently a temp, it is very difficult to get converted to full time employee if you don’t know someone within the department."
good,"Typical day at work will contain at least 1 meeting explaining why 100  new tests cannot be reliably correctly implemented in 2 days time."
good,"I can work with urgent request, can work under pressure over time."
good,Western DIgital has its perks as a well developed company with many shifts available.
good,Overall great job.  Lots of work to do never a dull moment.  Enjoyed doing new product launches.  Sense of pride and accomplishment.
good,"This company was good to work for, Time there was a very good learning experience. The management was a bit tough, the salary was ok."
good,"The last year had been bad for WDC. But it is now turning the corner after all the business headwinds and internal re-orgs. Next few years should be good."
good,"I was able to work with some great people, with sound leadership and hire the best employees that made my job a delight."
good,Very good workplace culture with good management practice. Supportive management with good work life balance. Lot of opportunity for technical enrichment.
good,"Work in a clean room, fixing tools for manufacturing. Learned mechanical work and have long hours. get a lot of days off and free bagels every Monday or Friday."
good,"Typical day: work on my projects in early morning, Work with other team-mates and other groups throughout the day, attend meetings, etc. Occasional work with customer's systems and engineers."
good,"Involved in the design and development of a data warehouse environment based application for studying various segments of the customer base and for regular reporting. Primary responsibility was intended to extract, transform and load data into an Oracle database and maintain existing Data Warehouse."
good,"Very busy all day, heavy calendaring, interaction with executives."
good,WD acquired SanDisk recently and the new company culture is not as great it was in Sandisk. The new leadership doesn't have the same connection that the old one did. A lot of attrition has occurred in the last two years due to the same.
good,"Good colleagues, but managers sucks. They only care about what their boss thinks about themselves. They like to belittle you in front of others to make them look manegerial"
good,Could be worse but could be better.  Atmosphere is very political and many managers are self-seeking.  Company has been performing well and seems to be well managed.  Top management is stuffed with white males.
good,I worked in the position as an IT. I like my work place because I have worked in a professional and friendly environment. Everyone in the office is friendly and wants you to succeed.
good,the company treats it's employees very nice.  I was very happy working there.  the company takes care of it's people. their Xmas bonus is quite generous.
good,"A good place to work, with opportunities to grow and advance, with a nice benefits package.  Very nice perks, such as free breakfast, coffee, sodas and fruit; also, very good, free lunches."
good,There is nothing to brag about. It does not have the hype of other high tech companies. Compensation is an average. The SAP team knows they will be gone after the top management made a decision to move to Oracle ERP.
good,The co-workers at Western Digital are very nice; managers and directors are good at technologies; the whole company is well-organized.
good,A typical day at work is always a busy day but manageable and fun environment because the people i work with are very friendly and family oriented. Management in our department is great. The only hard part of my job is if no one's around when it comes to very critical and sensitive matter but I guess that's where our training comes in handy when where under pressure.
good,"Great opportunity to learn, grow and improve. Frequent product release cycle allowed for a consistent pipeline of new consumer facing software solutions."
good,"- Improve operational activities and implement new procedures to monitor progress."
good,Fast pace environment with challenges and opportunities everyday. A place where my skills were developed and my talents were recognized. Rewarding in the end!
good,There are some really good people that work out of this office even after numerous reorganizations.  It is a  challenging time in the desktop storage industry and WD seems to be making the right changes to weather the storm.
good,"overall ok company, good people, flexible hours, good pay however with a log changes in merge recent years, good for young people"
good,"I like the team I was working with, all of us were productive and fun. such a great experience in a good company such as WD. Development of various diagnostic and optimization tests for hard disk drives, including media defect scan and defect management, improving product quality and reliability."
good,"Very large, financially sound, but their HGST SSD group is poorly managed and has failed time over time.  The group came from a previously failing STEC which HGST bought, and STEC would have been out of cash within a year.  They are a kick the can kind of staff and have been lucky.  I do not recommend going to this SSD group as they just made significant changes that again place them on a failing path, and they are kicking the can again."
good,"I have been working 60 hour weeks lately - there is no way out of it. "
good,"enjoy working with the local team."
good,Great place to work. Good people working with us. Engineers were always respectful.
good,The drive industry is very up and down and WD is no exception.   Layoffs and hiring cycles were so frequent that people tended to be in job protection mode.
good,"Western Digital Corporation is an American computer hard disk drive manufacturer and data storage company. It designs, manufactures and sells data technology products, including storage devices, data center systems and cloud storage services"
good,WD can be a little chaotic with lots of projects with imminent deadlines. Executive management is focused on doing what's best for business even though that may not match what is best for you as an individual.  Individual managers have always been nice to me and look out for their employees.  It is quite rewarding when you get a project out and its successful.  Lots of hours put in on the weekdays and weekends though.
good,Good place to work. Offers good career growth. Great location in the Bay Area. Work life balance could be better. From what I understood it seemed like people liked working long shifts.
good,"Preparing/cleaning before and after the shift."
good,I felt good working for this company. I wasn't surprised with being let go for corporate downsizing. They had been making cuts for the past two years. I worked well with others there and I was sorry to be let go.
good,"on call all the time. the co-workers are great but we do not get compensated enough to work the hours we work and to live in the bay area. my manager is great, but I think i was lucky. there are some managers that might no appreciate the work that is put in"
good,"It's such a big company that the culture is not the best.  I prefer a smaller company where you can build friendships and have social interactions."
good,The work day is 4 day morning shift and 2 day off after that 4 day night shift 7am -7pm and 7am -7pm.  I'm learning how to work at the production. So far the management is good. All types of culture is working I get experience with work Indonesians and Nepal people. The hard is when the product is urgent the most enjoy is the working place all keep smiling..
good,"Apply here if you love the corporate atmosphere--it seemed like a great place for a lot of the people that I worked with, but not for me. The management seemed to be very involved, which is good."
good,"- very nice and clean places"
good,"Overall nice and good place to work with strong support from all the way top management."
good,"In my time at Western Digital, I had the privilege of working with a great number of fantastic, passionate, friendly and engaging people. Through this experience, I learned a tremendous amount about engineering and manufacturing. In my role at PCBA functional test engineer, I was able to visit Malaysia, Thailand and Brazil in order to coordinate and train factory staff. My regular duties entailed designing test equipment and software for high volume test (up to 70 Million pieces per 3 months)."
good,In mechanical engineering there's a good variety of design tasks different programs.  The team worked well together to derive good engineering solutions on consumer electronic products.
good,Management working to make working at the company enjoyable for employees. Small company feel; large company presence.
good,Very slow in developing new technologies; but they are effective in making great drives.
good,Work culture promote leadership and talent growth. Teamwork emphasis and non toxic environment. Upper management provide clear goals and directions for development team to plan and implement.
good,"The top management is good in getting the benefits for the employees. Big Thanks!"
good,"I've been there for 18 years and worked my way from a low level job to manage European Sales Operations and Logistics divisions. I've grown, developed and enhanced my abilities to manage people, identify areas of required improvement and build teams that achieve and succeed in a very challenging and at times unstable workplace environment. I enjoy the challenges that have faced me and I am now looking to change roles and be based in the UK as I have been travelling back and forth from Southampton to Amsterdam for the last two and a half years."
good,"Good Atmosphere requires more salaries competitiveness,, Great Management . its a very challenging position since you're dealing with computers requires great technical skills also customer service orientated."
good,Great place to work. Very professional and great training. I rank this place highly. This place is a great company to work. Company seems stable and you can learn a lot of new things.
good,WD is a good place to work if you are able to get a permanent position which includes benefits and sick/vacation time.  The overall environment is good but some of the management and decisions don't allow people to work in unison all the time.  Good place to start out but not sure if it's the best in advancing someone's career unless they go to another company.
good,I was grateful to work for Western Digital.  I learned a lot and had a lot of autonomy.  I enjoyed working closely with the engineers and securing patents for the company.
good,Working in the Data Storage industry can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. But you have to be able to manage and prioritise your workload. Working with agencies and customers worldwide.
good,"Open email's, respond or forward to one the employee that worked with that location."
good,"Technical Project Coordinator – Branded dept. "
good,I am always interested in challenges that comes up with the kind of job I was doing. I am a fast learner.I can do a job without a full supervision with the guidance of a full instructions.
good,"No work life balance from WD legacy side.  Worth it for bonus, ESPP and LTI.  Merging WD, Sandisk and Legacy IBM/HGST was painful every day at every level.  It was like a start up at 70k people who had no clue on how to go forward."
good,"-Good team work"
good,"people are doing their best, but are being stretched thin."
good,"This company so many activities i have learned. Worldwide productive. Beautiful company,many applicant apply in this company but not at all we hired. I'm proud to be part of western digital"
good,"Many leadership changes and numerous acquisitions, still working itself out"
good,"Strong MNC culture"
good,"good environment but low pay rate. co-workers were great food from cafeteria had everybody sick. good bonus for employer of the month,top seller and perfect attendance."
good,"Transport pick up at Teck Whye Lane"
good,"Good place to work, good hours. I don't have much to say  I'm a contractor looking for new opportunities in the company or the Bay area. I'm sure must people are happy working here."
good,"3 companies coming together. SanDisk, HGST, WesternDigital. Lots of overlap and duplications of functions and technologies. Leadership fragmented and infighting between companies. "
good,i enjoy this job a lot.  Its a very fun environment.  I love my job and enjoy coming to work everyday.  The people are nice and enjoy working with them
good,"Challenging for a Financial Analyst, but they do not train you.  Co-workers are afraid to get involved in any project outside their specialty, for fear of getting more work piled on than they can handle."
good,"Every single employee is pushed to the limit on a daily basis. The company culture is to always do more with less people. As a result, every single team member has an outstanding work ethic. Working with such a team can be extremely gratifying. "
good,"co-workers are ok"
good,"Fast paces global engineering work. Checks test results, document passed test, write report and notify engineers on each failed test. Conduct failure analysis if need. Start new tests from engineer's check list with special requirement."
good,"My position manages busy executive calendars and details of the most confidential and critical nature. "
good,I enjoyed working for this company they were kind enough to hire us all back once Read-Rite Corporation went bankrupt and they purchased Read-Rite.
good,Very busy fast pace company.  Employees need to be quick and very alert at their post. The employees are very minimal and when you are there you have to move quickly to get your quota's
good,"Good encouragement from management to learn and try new tools and technologies. "
good,"Formerly HGST and then acquired by WD, this place became more and more competitive due to the merged environment."
good,"Western Digital has tough deadlines in all areas and is going through a transformation.  Great CEO who communicates vision well.  It's hard to have a work/live balance because the culture is ""all-hands-on-deck.  However, great people work there and standards are high which is good."
good,"WD is a large tech company that operates via scale and small margins. As such, the company generally takes a frugal and concise view on things like perks. WD cares for its employees and (at least in my experience) values work-life balance."
good,Worked for WD for almost 6 months. They provide very good compensation for the employees. Since it's a manufacturing company there are Unions even at the managerial level which isn't good.
good,Good to work for. They know how to show their care to employees. Many events are holding during years. I love their events with mini games and raffles.
good,"Showing up for work every day was great.  "
good,"- Leaves depends on manager, but are usually flexible"
good,Overall a nice journey for 15 years of so. Gathered lots of experiences along with advancements in career.The disk drive industry is kind of saturated in terms of Technology and growth.
good,"When working at  western digital I learned about the mobile hard drives that we use every day to help with the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, from the phones to computers. Western Digital makes these wafers that are the same size as a cd music disk but they're a little heavier due to the wiring and gold embedded inside. We would archive the data that was written on the boxes the wafers came in, inside a computer then send them off for another process. Hardest part of the job was the clean suit you would have to get used to while working the long hours. We worked 12 hours each day and 4 hours overtime. The most enjoyable part was getting paid a big check after working only four days and the positive and productive environment. The people there were great the management was strict due to the ""Clean room"" environment employees worked in, but that was to be expected overall pretty cool place."
good,Best part of the job was opportunity to learn and work with a dynamic team. Great leaders who drove shares from ~$30 to over $100 in a short time span. There has been a lot of changes since I left.
good,"- Improving my skills such as: communicate with engineers & NPI team, daily reports to customers, Yield report to NPI,etc."
good,interesting manufacturing processes
good,Good work environment. Got along well with others. Working on special projects foe Enterprise division. responsible for qualification process to meet customer requirements.
good,"Fun and interesting Engineering Department."
good,"It is a good place to work, but there is a lot of change going on which makes things unstable. There are layoffs every couple of months. Personally, I have had great management."
good,"Western Digital is a great company to work for. The pay is not great if you don't have a degree, but it is fair. I would recommend this job to people."
good,"Generally, it is good. I learned a lot in my work. But the payment and benefits are not that good compared with a lot of companies. What's more, the storage market change pushes the company to transit. It is experiencing a lot of changes now. Hopefully, it is going to be a giant in the storage world."
good,"WD was a very nice place to work, very friendly and helping people."
good,"I appreciate the WD culture does challenge you to have pride in your added value to make the company. "
good,"I don't have a lot to say. I worked there for a few months and they were nice. I never got a project or any real experience, but I did learn a lot from their educational program."
good,"WD gave me a job during the Great Recession so I feel a lot of loyalty for this organization. As large as it is, WD can seem a bit anonymous --- but there are some very talented and wonderful people that I had the privilege to know and work with. If there is any suggestion I could make it would have to do with improving the project management aspects of the New Product Introductions. Management and company culture are average . . . but WD makes so many products for so many applications they'll be busy + profitable for a long time"
good,"Productive and fun workplace, enjoyed working with others"
good,"WD is a place where someone fresh out of school should be, its fresh and progressive and always looking ahead. I was there for about three years and I had great co-workers and Supervisors who taught me alot and shared thier knowledge. Highly recommend WD, a wonderful place"
good,"Since my hobby is messing and fixing computer, I've found Western Digital is an excellent place to work to earn a living and please my curiosity about Western Digital Hard Drive technology. I learned that fixing a damage Hard Drive is actually not that hard as I imagined before. There were two types of Hard Drive: SATA and PATA. I remember that hardest part of the job was to be patient and really careful when it came to fixing the bended pins of the damaged hard drives. However, after that part was finished, putting them to the next phase of testing is the most enjoyable process since I could manage and test more than 12 units at the same time."
good,"Good company to work for, depending on organization. Good salary and benefits. Satisfying work assignments. Good team members. Good culture. Good manager. Good products."
good,"people over there are very nice, they helped me to polish my language skill. Also, the intern activities are fun. Besides work, our intern has our own activities to communicate and helped each of us to join the whole group. My work is to optimize the running time from one of the programs has been written by a former engineer. It is my first time to see the code not only written in python but also in other language and involve together.  This brought the work from the textbook."
good,"Job starts at 5 am and lasts until 5 pm."
good,"Great company to work with. The culture is very friendly for new parents. Offers flexible hours for new parents. Good management."
good,"Western Digital is a great place to work that has solid leadership and a great culture.  Market headwinds have affected the company, yet the leadership team is decisive, forward looking and has created a great work culture while combining three fortune 500 companies (WD, HGST & SanDisk) into a storage giant."
good,"I worked at WD for over 5 years - two years as a contractor and three full time.  I worked with a fun, talented, motivated team of network engineers. I felt challenged and positive when doing my job.I really enjoyed the culture and energy of the entire company."
good,"Good place for opportunities to learn, supportive environment.  The team I worked with was smart and understanding, nice people. The management style was somewhat hands-off, didn't micro-manage which I appreciated. There were some people whose social skills (on other teams) left something to be desired, and management seemed not to notice/care.  That and the mandatory 24/7 production support while still maintaining new development would be the only cons."
good,"Day comprise of HR advisory and generalist functions.  Coaching managers and employees on employment practices, training, employee communication and relations."
good,Fun work place with talented workers.  Opportunities to serve the community and spend time with other employees.  On site health care center makes addressing personal health care easy.
good,"Productive workplace.  You will learn and improve your skills.  People are nice.  Salary and benefits are good.  Hopefully the company would be stable in the future so they will not have to go thru ""reduce in force"" situation"
good,Nothing much is happening in terms of innovation or creativity. Management believes in releasing the product quickly and be the first to market. Quality is compromised on lot of areas.
good,"Great place to be, overall. Management is stable and has been in place for many years. Company stock has been preforming reasonably well in recent years."
good,"I love that Western Digital is concerned about each employees  health. They have a whole floor called Wellness Center, that provides Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Physical Therapy, etc services to each employee."
good,"I have to say this, WD has a great work culture.Management is pretty relaxed and you would have a huge role in decision making. I  really liked the fact that they gave me freedom to work from home which was really great since It killed my 3 hour commute to work. So, overall great work culture, people are pretty chill and motivating."
good,Great engineering group to work for. Used leading technology and people. Compensation and stock offered was competitive. Would work here again if offered.
good,Senior management have an excellent handle on the markets and have positioned the company to succeed in the future. They have a wide range of excellent products.
good,A good place for learning and technical skills' improvement. Working time is flexible. Many people are friendly and helpful.
good,Enjoyable working experience along with other functional teams. Lots of activities to participate after work organized by employer.
good,"While issues can be different from department to department.  Overall, the managers seemed to care about work life balance and appreciated the engineering team.  Also, the higher up engineers seemed to have a lot of weight put on their recommendations."
good,"The role was good fun and rewarding both financially and satisfying.  Growing the customer base, managing the team, launching new products quarterly, handling negotiations for contracts, pricing, sales channel agreements all were rewarding.  I learned to work with remote teams, across EMEA and the world and work with different cultures/personalities. Working with Europe in the day and US management in the night.  Daily conference calls and cash/invoice sales targets at quarter end are the norm.  A challenging environment with rewarding conditions."
good,"There are a lot of good, smart people working here. However, it seems that the ""vision"" changes with every release. Upper management wants one thing, it is delivered, then they want something totally different. "
good,good working environment nice director friendly workmate
good,"Stressful, but productive culture; 24/7 production line;"
good,"Virtually started my career here was would have been happy to have retired here, but the facility was sold to Motorola where I worked for a couple more years before moving on to Zilog.  "
good,"I am a Wafer Manufacturing Specialist. My daily jobs is to ensure all production tool's availability at maximum uptime with minimum down time. I do from PM, functional trouble-shooting, Tool upgrade, and new tool installation. I am a first line of defense for my company production lines. Since I am taking care of multiple tool sets, everyday is a new challenge which make me a better learner, and a better technical person. Though my works is not easy; however, I am fortunate to work with a very supportive team from manager down to co-worker. I feel like I always have their support whenever, and whatever I do. A hardest part of my job is to keep up not only with all changes from engineer in my company but also new technology from vendor. You must be an actively learner to all new changes , and technology. And that is the reason for me to keep working, and looking to new challenges."
good,It's a great company that let's you work in a very fast paced and independent work environment.
good,"Coming from the legacy Sandisk, there are good mixed of new culture when Western Digital acquired Sandisk. Sandisk strong culture of innovation and getting things done are mixed with strong ethics from Western Digital."
good,"Pros:"
good,Muy buena empresa con gran cultura proveniente de empresas anteriores como IBM y Hitachi.
good,good company to work for. they allow you to learn things with manry different internal courses. salary is comparable with other companies.Co-workers are  very nice.
good,Western Digital was a great place to work. There was always a chance to learn more. The management was great and there was a flexible approach to work.
good,"Not always, but Western Digital is not big on spending money for software tools.  It isn't always obvious, as most engineers figure out ways around such things, but it does happen.  Other than that, it's a good company to work for.  The company has switched to a Scaled Agile Framework, which keeps people thoroughly engaged.  It's about 3 quarters of the way through that adjustment."
good,"The company's well organizational culture, great benefits, productivity, traning courses provided by the company. Friendly co-workers, fun place to work."
good,"Many knowledgeable people there that shared and mentored me."
good,"Company arranges many interesting events for interns."
good,"Started off on the phones helping customers resolve installation issues, helping them resolve warranty and return issues. Later went to monitoring calls that came in and found that some customers were not treated in accordance with company policies. The job was very rewarding helping both the phone technicians and customers."
good,"Interesting job but little chance of advancement for my position.  Politics are a major factor in the work dynamic and if you do not conform, you are not going anywhere."
good,It was a great place to work. I enjoyed all employees that I worked with and supporting all levels of employees at the company was very compelling for a company their size.
good,"We play volley ball with together about 30 minutes everyday. Besides, we can eat breakfast and drink coffee about 15 minutes. Sometimes, we went to lunch with our supervisor or our manager."
good,Culture is to respect your peers and management.  Reward fairly with promotions.  Gym on site to promote healthy environment.  Friendly people and very organized.
good,"good training on machines to compete the work"
good,A leading technology company in the challenging space of storage. Keeping up with market forces and continuing to advance product technology is increasingly difficult. Weather WD will continue to meet this challenge or management will fall short remains to be seen. Retention of staff in  the current tight market for engineers is particularly difficult with the best performers being easily lured away by other technology focused companies. Increasing salaries for the engineering staff is going to prove necessary going forward.
good,It is a good company to work for in my opinion. Great for a new software developer. A typical day is filled with meetings and training activities. Driven by the evolving culture of Agile.
good,A great place to work and great people and work environment.  A lot of company culture and initiatives.  Some perks offered as discounts.  A lot of healthy living initiatives.
good,Being productive can help the firm increase and utilize the capacity of the human resources it has.Workplace environments is a key determinants of the quality of their work and their level of productivity.
good,"traditional engineer working culture,"
good,Can work really hard. Being strong for a new challange Working. Not give up at anything as long as i can do it. Hope can be the best if i got a job. Western digital is best company but i want more futher future job.  Can learn a new things is the best of my life.
good,I had a great working experience at western digital. great management and great co-workers. Learned a lot a daily basis. i really liked working for western digital.
good,Work is the same wherever you work but it is the people that makes the difference. I had a positive experience with the team at Western Digital. From management down were very supportive and easy to work with. There is respect and great team collaboration.
good,"good people to work with, and lots of overtime and travel arrangements are necessary, holidays are fun and friendly, and a very casual environment, jeans all day, lol"

While things weren't perfect, and I didn't agree with everything the company did (ie use TCL) it was definitely a nice work environment overall.

I worked in a 24/7 manufacturing facility, there were a total of 8 of us in Production Control, two per shift. The hardest part of the job was starting work at 5am and working until 5pm.

I would drive to different store locations (i.e. Best Buy, Target, WalMart, Costco) and make sure the product was placed in the correct are with the correct prices. I also made sure the displays were up to date with the most recent product that was out. I worked alongside three other college interns around the United States. The area I was in charge of was Orange County. Western Digital gave me great insight in what I wanted to do with my career."
