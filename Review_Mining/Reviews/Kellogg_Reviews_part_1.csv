rating,review
bad,Working with the other schedulers was stressful and a very negative enviroment. They singled out certain union workers if they dared to question them. They did not follow the union rules for scheduling. They were poor at training and at 1 point stated I had last the longest then anyone else. I wonder why. There was absolutely no communication it eas a poor working encieomwnt
bad,"Very bad agency "
bad,Was so excited to get hired.  Thought it’d be an exceptional experience.  Boy was I fooled.  Miserable from day one.  Minimal training.   Lots of office politics.  I wasn’t one of the “good ole boys” so I didn’t have a chance.  Beware.  Stay away.
bad,"When I first got there I didn’t have any training, but I like the fact that they do train you and that the training it paid. It is not easy work and the work is not for everybody. It is fast paced and it is a very stressful environment. I traveled an hour everyday there and back just commuting and I had an suv so I spent $120 a week on gas. Good job for people who DO NOT have goals and ambitions to become something in life."
bad,"Don't waste your time. Management sucks. They dont respond and falsely accuse even if you have proof. No raise, no advancement.Environment not great at all."
bad,"They laid all of us off unexpectedly"
bad,You are a unit of production.  Kelloggs is a gigantic corporation and they do not have time to waste on people.  Get this straight:  They big you small.
bad,"don't really have much to say about this job except I don't recommend it to anyone , no hours per week,and drive to far to work for just an hour or two"
bad,No chance of permanent work all on a contract basis im afraid unless you get lucky. Internal agency they have there is clueless and never paid correct
bad,Lots of Reverse Racisim and 85 percent of employees were Oprah Winfrey looking people who wanted you to work while they play on the phones and make comments about you. It's the absolute most horrible job environment  ever.
bad,"Chaotic and disorganized. Over run by incompetence. Continuous payroll issues, I never knew when I was scheduled to work. Have a punishing punitive system for missed time, and seem unable to properly apply personal time. Would not spend anything on tools materials or parts- a dying plant. The culture is over run by a clique of very old entrenched employees that use the union to abuse new hires into quiting."
bad,"I was a merchandiser here from June 2011 to January 2015. My experience as a merchandiser was awful. It was a mistake ever applying. I remember after they hired me I was driving to one of the locations on my first day and I thought for a second about turning around. Looking back I wish I did. That alternate reality might have been better for me. I wasted all those years working at a company that kept me on part-time forever despite being a great worker. All that hard work was done in vain and after my employment with them was over all I had to show for it was a car that accumulated 200,000 miles. I remember the work environment was very toxic. I did not receive a warm welcome whatsoever. All the people I had to work with and around at the stores I serviced were beyond rude and hostile. That bad energy was unrelenting and permeated every aspect of the job leaving you feeling completely drained and defeated after the work day was over. Working here almost ruined my life. Last I heard they got did of their merchandisers. Thank goodness. If only they would have done that back in 2010 things would have turned out better for me."
bad,Poor communication skills. Favoritisms I recommen for no one to work here very unprofessional. No one to go to when you have a problem out there. The branch is no help.
bad,"You are just a number and will be threatened/harassed on a daily basis. You will not have any work/life balance, job security, or recognition for how hard you work."
bad,"A typical day includes many meetings with very little productivity.  Workplace culture is depressing.  Unclear roles, responsibilities and clarity on priorities."
bad,"Bad experience, wish it could have been better but I left for school moved to Oregon didn't understand what the manager wanted maybe because I was,young but I still worked hard"
bad,Needs work . Management is ok but no communication from upper management as far as Human Resources. They never question on why they are loosing all of there good employees because we are just a body. They don’t care which is really sad .
bad,"Not at all what is discussed in the training. Also there is no communication amongst management. Very unorganized, they are always all over the place and never know what they want the employees to do on a day to day basis."
bad,"My typical work day,would start early oin the morning as I would drive to first of many vendors to stock Kellogg's merchandise. I would obeserve their current inventory then restock what was necessary, I would update my manager on my progess throughtout the day I learned My managers  were fair  and communicated well with me. The work place culture is to be courteous and efficient this   job was not difficult to complete ..I liked the freedom of being  able to go to different locations everyday and meet people"
bad,Poor leadership coupled with coercive management style. The company is willing to sacrifice the employees first when things get tough. The company would take from the individual contributors to save themselves.
bad,"Company doesn't care about employees or all of their hard work. All they care about is their pocket, preached about work life balance..no such thing. was there 6 years got 1 raise. Laid me an 6,000 others off, day after layoff CEO got an $8,000,000 raise"
bad,"Wouldn't refer anyone to work for this company. Horrible management staffing and improper treatment of loyal employees. "
bad,"Keebler was a good company to work for,kelloggs not so much.kelloggs had poor leadership from the get go,they constantly made poor product choices,constantly made poor market choices.We hoped at the end they would sell off the Keebler line to another company,but they have decided to go back to a market strategy that before 2001 they lost money on."
bad,Empty promises for advancement . too relaxed work environment. Have to work harder without acknowledging an employee's efforts to make up for others lack of work ethics.
bad,"Kellogg was one of the best companies that I ever worked for prior to the blending of Snacks division and the demise of the company.  No one's position is safe - no bonuses are paid, even with top management still receiving theirs.  All benefits including company cars were taken away.  Horrible environment - no one is happy or wants to stay.  Working the positions of up to 4 people now.  THOUSANDS of long time employees let go - or no reason other than bad upper management.  Do not work for Kellogg."
bad,man they work you like a slave you sweat and cry hands are cracked and ashy and you hurt like heck i wuld never ever ever go back a day in my lfe thus is so crazy
bad,"During the entire time ive been employed at this facility i felt like each and every day could be my last. The corporate raider come down threaten to close the facility bullying their way to obtaining a labor agreement that is by far more in line with socialism then standard emoyment in the united states. Corporation run by a bunch of Austrailian businessmen. Management at facility is agressive, demeaning, and unprofessional. The union supposedely representing the employees is in bed with management behind scene. Really the only good thing to say about place is money is good if u live to work instead of work to live."
bad,This place would sell thier own mother if it would get them one more nickel. The upper management are a bunch of bush league hacks that got fired from previous employment and landed here at a discount.
bad,excellent place to work. Cant wait for my next opportunity Familiar with AEM Campaign and Analytics............................
bad,Management was rude and never answered  phone!Then believes lies from another store and u get term and doesent appreciate u only the coworkers did! The person that does the scheduling doesent know what he's doin either!I wouldn't recommend working for them!
bad,"Never will I work for this company again in my life. they are so unorganized and very uncomfortable place to work at. "
bad,"I worked here for just over a year and it was okay at first. I liked the flexibility of the hours. I only worked part time so I didn't receive benefits. By the end of my time there I was EXTREMELY unhappy. My direct manager was great and I have no complaints there. However, she was under a ridiculous amount stress and she told me the goal she had to meet and what her schedule was like and I couldn't believe it. I met several full time reps and they were ALL miserable. I never met a single person that was happy where they were the entire time."
bad,"I hired on as a part-time merchandiser. It sounded great at the time; easy work for decent pay. Wrong !"
bad,I worked for this company for 9 years its the worst company I ever worked for.The company was great till Kelloggs bought them.they treat the employees like garbage!!! The older guys that worked for the company for over 15 years were forced to interview for their jobs again and then got down graded to a merchandiser. Our pay also got cut 3 times. so whoever says that this is a great company is full of it.You work around 10 to 13 hours a day and they hire a bunch of clueless idiots that dont know anything about the job and make them managers.they even call you on your day off.and if a manager in a store treats you like garbage and insults you. Human resources does not help you.they prefer to get rid of you instead of defending you. so do your homework before you work for them.
bad,"In this job, I never know what my hours are or my job is until the day before."
bad,Traveling to all types of different locations to stock products and build relationships with all types of different people was a blast
bad,"I worked for 2 weeks, and I liked it. But they didn't like me. Was told I talked too much, and find that odd because i'm on a computer all day. I didn't have a problem with anyone there. And liked everyone in fact..As with all companies , you cant get an interview or are not qualified. But get hired threw the temp services for the  same job for $5 dollar's or more less and hr! And why are people going back to School?"
bad,Working for Kellogg through Manpower is like being treated like a second class citizen.
bad,"Les salariés sont au bord du burn-out, personnes n’est motivé et n’a envie de faire des efforts lorsque le comex (ou ce qu’il en reste) nous vous donne pas envie de travailler"
bad,"If you aren’t union, Kellogg is not the place for you. This company let the union urinate in their product and did absolutely nothing about it. There is a very mutual sweep it under the rug mentality when it comes to issues involving the hourly. There is no work life balance. The company actually suggested to its employees they get personal assistants to take care of their personal lives so they could work more. This is at 40k a year salaries as well. Do yourself a favor and do not even apply."
bad,there's a lot of responsibilities. Very fast paced.  Unorganized.  So much products wasted when line overflows. Mean and disrespectful people. Not enough training. One week training for each job..the only good thing about working there is the money.
bad,The typical night consists of being overworked on daily basis because machines are ran too fast.  You are constantly panning on and off cookies because wrap machine goes down all night.  Good thing is the people I work with are really nice.
bad,"Union workers out of control"
bad,This company is fading fast. They laid off 1700 workers recently. I would not suggest joining this company on any level. Long hours for little compensation. They keep adding more responsibilities with no addition of compensation.
bad,kelloggs treats their employees very poorly i would not recommend anyone to work for them. i worked for them for 2 years and was not treated very fairly only being given 15 hours a week with a family to support and no benifits and knowing that there was plenty of work i could have been doing. and the company forced my direct supervisor to do it all because he was a salaried employee.
bad,"Unfortunately the New Mexico Office is poorly managed, hostile and compensation won't cover the lack of integrity some management and employees lack.  Benefits were good.  By far the worst company I've worked for.  14 hour days, no help, no guidance but a lot of blame and getting thrown under the bus."
bad,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but I feel I have to.  The leadership in this plant is horrible.  I cannot believe these are managers!  Very biased, not engaged, and don't care about the people."
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for. My immediate manager was awesome, but terrible upper management. Was informed after 4 years that I along with many others were being laid off, then they hired all new employees the next week, well they are trying to hire new employees. Box sizes were downsized a few years ago and the price went up."
bad,Very long hours.  Management focuses on the negative.  Nothing ever seems to be good enough.
bad,"This company is very bad to work for in the Chicago, they keep cutting pay and overpaying executives! They force product out to hit stockholders expectations and really put stress on the reps at street level by doing this, this is NOT a sales job you are a mobile stock boy. You will not advance is this company if you are a ""white male"" you have to be a female, or minority to really be on the fast track. They really love promoting African American people which is great but 90percent of them are not qualified enough for the jobs. They should train then evaluate performances before awarding the title. Poor culture, bad pay an awful place to work on the DSD side. Take this job as a last resort and keep sending out resumes until you get out of here, unless your a minority they stay forever! No matter how many times you screw up, they will NEVER fire you!"
bad,Appreciate five work from home days every month and many nice co-workers.  Favoritism is awful with too many team leads and team lead support roles on each team.  Battle Creek team doesn’t like GBS employees and contributes to negative culture.  Work load is heavy and difficult to take time off.
bad,Plant Manager and assistant plant manager likes to watch people on cameras 24/7 at home while drinking Hennessey they both rude nasty for no reason worse place I ever worked your like slaves working there they will fired you for stupid stuff and if they out to get you they will the supervisors are scared of them them 2 bullies up in the front office.
bad,"Bullish management, toxic culture, weak and inconsistent training."
bad,"I used to love my job and the was proud to work for Kelloggs. Through the years, after the lies and everything that kellogg will do to ruin the trust you have and the security you have. By far the most disloyal and worst company I have ever worked for in my life! Kellogg is all about the dollar and nothing else. Period! You are just a number! I would never in my life recommend Kelloggs simply because of the greed and managers that lie to your face! They make me sick!"
bad,Full time employees will be forced to work 7 to 20 days in a row no day off in a 12 hour role. The benefits are good but the work environment is not. Management always try’s to sweep situations under the rug. No respect for family or employees you’re just a number to them.
bad,This company will tell you they do not micro manage and they have an open door policy but that is completely false! It ends up being used against you later in time. Also conversations had with management are forgotten and also used against the employee. Terrible management skills all around and terrible work environment.
bad,"I have to say that all the opinions i read of this company are a reflect of how political this company can be. "
bad,"Management our never on same page they our like the blind leading the blind so mis manage its sad, Management don't follow union contract and union is just as bad"
bad,"Company doesn't focus on innovation rather than finger pointing or blaming also nepotism is a huge problem here and is the reason why they can't get a leg up with other competitors, if they could actually promote and hire people with skills and talent they would see themselves in the red but they wont and will keep running the show as just a high school popularity contest."
bad,"Work is all you see. No family life. Immediate managers/supervisors are untrained, unskilled, uneducated, have no knowledge or are clueless  on how to manage and handle employees. They are on the cutting edge of being bullies and know they can get away with it."
bad,"I work in maintenance. The manager is way out his league. He has no idea how to effectively plan projects. There are many things that he is deficient in, most notably how to treat people. "
bad,"seniority doesn't apply, so favorites or good at sucking get the best jobs,worse management I've ever seen in 30 yrs of working.backstabbers and money grubbers everywhere. people making 28.00 hr and stealing from co workers rampant."
bad,"As a front-line leader in this company, you will deal with aggressive, entitled employees who have been allowed to run rampant for so long that they have zero regard for policy/rules.  On the flip side, upper management/HR refuses to terminate bad employees, or simply returns them to work after termination.  Front-line leaders are told not to pursue corrective action, as it may hurt morale and the relationship with the union.  Remember, you're only as good as your most resent screw up... Regardless how recent it was."
bad,New/Old Mgmt. clashes with neither understanding what the other did on a daily basis. Mgrs. with no DSD experience managing systems unfamiliar to them
bad,Had ups and downs ending with kelloggs shutting down all distribution centers nationwide.  Ran the place as shorthanded as they could which put a huge strain on family life.  Never knew when your workday was going to end.  Had many 14 hour work days.
bad,The plant isnt to bad other then the 16hr force once a week and a divided union. The managment team is ok at best and are lost on what is going on most of the time. The people at HQ look down on the plant people when ever there is interaction. Family time while working here will be little to none as you work 7 days a week and will be forced into a second 8 hr shift. If money is what drives you this is the place if start to hire they are cutting jobs.
bad,the hardest part the superior where not managing the job they on to as for 12hours a day that makes our job diffical we where working 12hour a day.i ve gain exepi
bad,"Did not like watching unethical personnel moves and a dishonest, cheating P.M.  This was a good place to work at one point and was the best job in town before new manufacturing and warehousing businesses came in."
bad,"Kellogg has a very poor culture, does not provide opportunities for advancement, without standard processes or practices in place. The culture and the minimal and inconsistent advancement opportunities makes this a very miserable company to work for. Trouble retaining talent and attracting young graduates. Beware if considering joining Kellogg."
bad,"The problems with the job are a result of poor upper management. Suits with no real clue about how their ""big ideas"" actually fail as they filter thru the system. ""Plus outs"" or shoving a bunch of extra product down stores throats, leaving the stores angry, and the merchandisers and sales reps dealing with multiple cases of unwanted product and no place to put it, day after day and store after store. And, Kellogg's is cheap on pretty much every level. The hutches sent for displays are thin, flimsy and inferior to the competition. Holiday or special event product is mismanaged by sending too much to stores that can't sell it and then not being able to order more for stores that have sold out. A simple production issue that never gets resolved."
bad,"Horrible company, middle management takes no responsibility for anything nor do they help their sales force in any way , essentially leaving you on your own little island . They pay merchandisers 10$ an hour then expect you to drive all over at their whim to do work. Hours are long, you have basically no life an  no real chance of advancement. Work here at your own risk"
bad,"I worked anywhere from 12-16 hours a day, I had 14 accounts and I had to order for them, work the order I wrote, sale, manage my team, make 5 pages of notes per member daily, always conf calls, never had a lot of help, was expected to work 1200 cases by myself, not gay fairly at all. The culture is the worse I have ever seen, use to be a great company but in the past 4 years, its the worse company."
bad,"this place is not what it appears all though the money is good but the head aches that go with it is really not worth it,"
bad,"Where do I begin? I think about how I was before I had this job and how I am now and its like....I dont even "
bad,"I have 18 years in the retail grocery business and this was the worse job ever. No gas rembursment, poorly managed, hostile invirement, and no room for advancement. I worked there for 9 months and did an excellent job. I got one complaint that was not even my fault and they fired me 2 weeks after the inncodent. "
bad,Great products
bad,Kelloggs is a big company but working in their call centers is just not all that great. You are expected to work long and hard and for little pay and benefits with no promise of advancement.
bad,They will work you to death. The company could care less about your well being and if you get to spend anytime with your family. Upper management will lie to your face. HR is is clueless and never has the answers to your questions. There is alot of favoritism and things such as scheduling and overtime are not done fairly. The only good thing about working there is the pay.
bad,"After 8 years of employment, all sales Merchandisers Truck drivers and Warehouse workers were told they would be out a job in 6 monthes,Serverance was based on average hours worked.We worked hard and derecated. To bad management was not that good,upper management.Salesmen were great."
bad,"Poor management, long hours with no days off.  Favoritism,  schedule changes without a notice, does not care about your family life, no follow thru, never any positive reInforcement. All negative."
bad,"It is a hectic work environment, very poor management, there is no proper training on equipment, some parts of the plant are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. "
bad,Management is a revolving door. Safety is a joke. Dirty conditions. You work 12-hours a day / 7-days a week. Not a Great place. The culture is Toxic. No longer a proud employee and family oriented company. Its all about cutting corners.
bad,"expect 7 days a week and being forced for a 16 hour shift at least once a week. First starting you will be thrown around to multiple shifts, likely working each shift at least once every week. If you like money more than family, friends, and time this is the place for you. If you prefer not to be treated like corporate slave, id suggest you walk away. Once you start, its hard to walk away due to the pay and benefits. As we all say here, signing the job acceptance is signing your soul to Kelloggs. So think carefully what you chase after."
bad,"After seventeen years as a DSD  truck driver working for Kellogg's mine and many other jobs are coming to a end. At one time this would have devistated me to loose the job that I have always loved, but not anymore.  Kellogg's is not the company that I was so proud to be a part of anymore. Any management or sales we had that had been with the company for any length of time had been forced out. To save money i guess, they lost decades of trust and relationships with store managers. From that point on it was auto ships and forcing unneeded product into backrooms, taking advantage of store managers trust. But it didnt last long. pretty soon they caught on and every delivery was a fight.                                                               Then came the assult on the drivers. Having a camera staring at you  and the road at all times second guessing every move, is pretty unsettling and i never quite got use to it. We were told when the cameras went in that they were for our own protection from being fired, but it has been several years now and i have never heard of even one attaboy, but quite a few terminations.  Kellogg's installed GPS locators in our trucks (several acccutaly) but none have ever been able to show a map or give directions. Wouldnt have mattered if they could have I guess as I would have been fired for looking at or touching it on camera.       This is not the company or job it once was so avoid if you can.  As for me getting a job with another lousy company wont be to hard so I dont "
bad,Bad place to work will work 16 hour days because no-one every shows up for their shift will work until a week before your 90 days they will let you go without a reason would not work for this company or buy any of there products again
bad,"fast paced production line very manual, long shifts. feast or famine production schedule."
bad,"not a healthy working environment, management made the daily grind uncomfortable."
bad,If you want hours never apply for this company. YOU GET 0 HOURS 0 Benefits. I transferred being promised 28hrs and got less than 10 . No communication and 0 milage reimbursement. Poor management with 0 communication skills.
bad,"dont waste your time management is a joke unless your their favorite your not going anywhere,co-workers were always in the parking lot it;s disgustin g in there people sticking their hands in food that was to be made into patties for customers"
bad,I worked at Kellogg's for a few months and it has not been a good experience.The work atmosphere is really competitive in a bullying type of way.There are cliques and nooone wants to show you how to do things correctly.My work hours were cut because I was put on a lazy team and we couldn't meet our deadlines.
bad,Expected a lot more from the company leadership. Passive aggressive culture creates a lot of rework. As every company has great talent however it is not always recognized nor valued.
bad,"The way they bring people in now and as transitional is so unfair if they need the people hire them and treat them fairly "
bad,Kellogg Company is a corporate monster that cares nothing about their employees. Many lawsuits have been filed and won against them for under payment.
bad,They didn't care about thier employees.  Over worked under appreciated.  Forced into a stressful environment just to please the top management and ONLY upon there visit to the warehouse.  Besides those brief visits the place was a circus. Lack of management and incompetent supervisors whom never had the proper training nor people skills. The pay was the only thing keeping any employee there.
bad,Good luck getting hired and you better be black. They work you to death though a temp agency then promise you stuff that won't hsppen.Overall I would sguest looking elsewhere for better employment. This was a waste of time.
bad,"I loved my job,  I disliked the company.  Management was the worst.  I don't know of anyone who liked working for Kellogg. Everyone I knew was looking for another job."
bad,I loved my job and hated the culture. Kelloggs bought out Keebler and then disbanded most of it's current employees. I was part of over 1400 people let go in August of 2017
bad,This was a temp job I was chosen to be the temp lead which was a good experience. the company mad vegan food and wound up going out of business with out any notice.
bad,It is hard to have a life working for this company. Hard to balance work and home due to your undetermined scheduled (12hr shifts) from week to week. Also for example you may work good for a while  and then work will slow down and you may be laid off/ or hard to get hours like you were (work schedule isn't consistent). It is fast pace and physical if you are looking for that but if not then the work could be very  overwhelming and training is very poor. And very few employees are friendly. One of the pros of this company is that the benefits seems to be decent.
bad,"The culture is extremely cut throat, no mercy when working with employees.  Many departments show favoritism.  Would not recommend this working environment if you're looking for a good culture."
bad,"After working here for 4 years, I thought that this would be the place I would retire from.  I enjoyed my time and the people.  Unfortunately, the past year the plant has gone through major changes and many good people were let go.  The morale has really gone bad and people don't care anymore.  It became just a job.  Left to go to another company a few months back and I have not missed this place."
bad,"Not the same. I was once proud to say I worked here, but now I cannot say that.  The pay is still good, but the culture and atmosphere here is terrible.  I think we should have voted a union in a year or two ago."
bad,Treats employees terrible no time off not considerate of family issues and racism exists. Favoriteism low seniority work over 32 hours a week overtime
bad,I was a part-time merchandiser they quit scheduling me for work. Then quit contacting me all together. Never gave me a reason. Never told me why. Didn't even pay me my last pay check. Don't work for them. They suck. My RSR blocked my number. My manager would respond to my emails or texts. What cowards. By the way I was only employed for a single month.
bad,"was hired as a seasonal b which means temp. right after hired was laid off was not able to hold on any longer. would clean machines,  learned a little on the forklift."
bad,i started working here couple months ago and i say this company sucks especially the hours. i like the job is just the hours. mostly they can give you 12 hours a week sometimes 4 hours a week and even 0 hours a week. don't work here trust me its not worth it.
bad,"I Cant stand this company, never know when you will be home, at the mercy of your higher ups and alot of meaning less ""safety"" teaching they preach but never put into practice"
bad,"This was absolutely one of the worst & most dishonest companies I ever worked for.  A department micro-manager who never smiled and gave special favorite treatment to her female supervisors while overloading her male supervisors with work. Managers who confide in union stewards and disclose information to the hourly workforce that breaks down teamwork among the supervisors who are really trying to support and lead their operators.  I personally observed foreign material (red and black plastic bits) contaminants in the food but was told to continue running, then I was scolded for waking up my manager in the middle of the night to inform her of the contamination. Very childish workforce of older women who gossip and complain about each other instead of focusing on their jobs, while the company is afraid to discipline in case they upset the union. They also will not pay you for your time - - and they want you to lie on FDA paperwork so it appears their processes are food safe. Absolutely soul-crushing. The successful supervisors are back-stabbing 25-year vets promoted from the floor & they do not want to help new supervisors succeed.  The rating system is a complete joke, doing the actual tasks means nothing if your manager does not like you. My manager told me that my safety observations did not count because she did not like the font I used in my reports...this led to my efficiency and performance being questioned.  I finally left when my manager threatened that I would lose my job and not be able to make my mortgage.  Stay away.  And for your family's health, stay away from"
bad,"Working for KBR is not a rewarding experience, it all starts with very poor managers. There were some middle level supervisors who did help get the jobs done. Many good fellow workers there, and again from Multi-National sources, I enjoyed working with them the most. "
bad,Lied to at interview that I would stay within an hour of my home. Was driving over 900 miles a week when I left company. As a Territory Sales Rep you are dumped on and blamed for the salemans mistakes. Reimbursement is only OK if you stay in your area which will not happen. Before you take this position ask to talk to other TSRs.
bad,lack of production but a good pressure free work environment.
bad,They say they want to listen to concerns you have but all it’s in one ear and out the other!! When people that are capable and qualified for an open position they say we used skill set to give the position to a less senior employee. That’s not a good business practice at all. The moral is low among employees due to the treatment of upper management!! This is all very sad because this use to be a great place to work!!! Hr is on site but don’t ask any questions because they have no answer. Call in to speak to them get voicemail and normally don’t get a call back!! Pathetic!!
bad,"To be successful in today's marketplace, large companies must understand the importance of people management. This company does not and focuses on putting people in management positions that do not have the ability to manage others effectively."
bad,"I had the bad experience to work in a hostil environment."
bad,great pay and benefits but you get no time outside of Kellogg and can be forced over for 16 hour shifts at last moment.management has no clue on how to run things and they make your job harder by making dumb decisions
bad,"It is not what is used to be. The people used to be valued and they are not any more. The people being put in manager roles are not ready to be managers. Meetings, there are so many meetings, in which are a waste of time. Things that could be addressed in a single email are turned into a meeting. The culture is one of stress."
bad,The employees were all really great. fun to work with. The job was strenuous on my back and hard on my knees. ...............................................
bad,Worked there for almost 9 years. Very good benefits. Would of still worked there but they closed all distribution centers nationwide. Management was decent.
bad,The company restructured itself and combined what 2 or 3 people were doing into one role. This has left several associates with a full desk more than they can handle and when they seek out assistance from their manager they are told the job may not be suited for them..
bad,"Definitely not a job for the minority worker.  I felt looked down upon by upper management and never was given a chance for advancement, even though my reviews were always good."
bad,"As a line operator, we were once listened too and had a voice and part in the plant operations. We had a safety and clean plant also.  Over the past 3 years, everything has dropped. Morale is bad. People only stay because they are paid well for the area.  The production is down, safety is bad, and quality is poor, not like it was before. I hope it gets better as I have to ride this out."
bad,This company has a great reputation that is not warranted. HR backs management and not employees. I experienced bullying and harassment by my director and reported it to HR. It was a set-up and they chose to keep a poor manager instead of the employee that got the job done for over 14 years.
bad,"Kellogg's has a lot of potential, but they are not friendly to diversity in many areas.  We worked a lot of holidays to have the Monday after the holiday off for inventory."
bad,Management is absolutely ignorant around there and unless they like you your not going anywhere and youll have to pick up everybody elses slack because their all out in the parking lot getting drunk. So unless you like total caos and feel like tearing out your hair everytime you work dont waste your time and you'll be a lot better for it.
bad,Corporate was a joke.. employees were a joke.. forcing people to work 16 hours a day to keep from paying for more help.. a joke will never purchase kelloggs product ever again
bad,"I would say Kellogg's is a great company to work for overall. I enjoyed my time there for the most part. I say there's lack of career advancement opportunities because, depending on the department your in, in order to advance you might have to relocate."
bad,"If you're good at lying and sucking up to the right people, this is a place for you. Management team is a joke.This place is not about what you know but who you know. If you are starting your career, this is not a good place to learn and advance your career. You won't learn anything but to see how some managers or supervisors can get away with laziness."
bad,"Kellogg's is closing all dsd so no jobs to apply for. Spent six years of my life with them changing things every little bit affecting my family and my life, only for them to decide to change the way they do business and 4500 people lose their jobs."
bad,"Make sure you read the small letters also in the handbook!"
bad,"Put in 5 years and was let go when they closed all dc in the u.s. it was a fast pace work environment I loved my job and put in multiple 16hr days , and 60hr weeks."
bad,Pay is good but you can be required to a 12 hour day with no notice. You can be required to work 7 days a week. Management is poor and the further up the ladder the worse it is. Work is OK but sometimes you may have to lift 50lbs all day up to 12 hours. You get  a paid 25 min break for every 4 hours work. Management is cut throat. They will throw you under the bus to save their own hide.
bad,The field sales teams have changed every year I was there.  The company tried too much change each year.  Often we found ourselves referring back to how things used to be.  Must get out of the past.
bad,"Horrible place to work for someone like me. Have been sacked for making an issue about harassment so there my honest review, however I was impressed by the technologies they're using in whole manufacturing process."
bad,"Organization is Very resistant to change, insular and bureaucratic. Lots of tactical activities...leadership lacks strategic vision and capabilities to transform the 'old' sleepy company to a winning CPG organization. Company does not invest in talent, no real career paths."
bad,Working for a week as a Operations Supervisor in Cincinnati.  Did not tell me plant is going to be shut down in a few months.  All Staff is bare bones from 5 years of cutbacks.  Major food safety concerns with QA being nonexistent (not performing any daily checks).  Mgmt performing bare minimum food safety to stay legal.  Morale extremely low among all workers from bottom to Supervisor level overworked.  All equipment is older than dirt.
bad,"You will work 7 days a week for years on end until you move up the seniority list (after five years I still got forced and never made it to day shift). The seniors love screwing you over so chances are high you will get forced to a weird mix like first shift on Saturday and third shift on Sunday, it’s a blast when you have to return to work Monday for your normally scheduled second shift. The union members are weird and cliquey, they know nothing about solidarity and brotherhood and will rat on you any chance they can. They used to have employer paid insurance which was amazing and double time on sundays, the senior baby boomers in the union ruined that. New contract is coming up next year and I would bet things will get worse. "
bad,It was union what more do need to say. The employees with the most seniority dictated and would run the lives of anyone under them and management could care less. very stressful place to work
bad,Was a great job till they laid-off everybody . I enjoy working with Kellogg for the past 10 years was part time at first 5years then went full time just the past year and if I knew they was going to laid off employees I wouldn't of went full time.
bad,"Kellogg's Company is shutting down the DSD division leaving several of my fellow co-workers unemployed. During the transition, Kellogg's company has been fair with compensation and keeping us informed about the lay off."
bad,Forced overtime hardly any days off. No time for family. Cereal is more important than human existence. Moved from shift to shift with less than 8 hrs notice.
bad,"Kellogg's Snacks used to be Keebler Company "
bad,"Very strange company, not much of support in the field, they train you in in head office not full relevant , it’s not always relevant to the role, they set you up with buddy, who trains you on the role, but if you don’t have grocery experience you may struggle, they leave you alone most of the time but a lot of meetings that are full of hot air, you fell like an estate agent wanting to stand out, their awards are very much about the how."
bad,"No comment - it wasn’t what you would expect ......................So much potential to do so much more"
bad,Kellogg is a  good company to work for but opportunities are limited for people of color. The company in based on relationships and who you know. You can quickly fall out of favor  when management changes are made.
bad,"Working for Kelloggs was a great learning experience of what a business shouldn't run like. The hours of the job were great, however the demands in which sales reps are asked to meet are unrealistic and are not on a store to store basis. The demands of the stores in which a sales rep calls on are unrealistic and bowing down to ensure they receive what they want and also take care of the company and the customer are demanding. Must have a thick skin and the ability to push back. "
bad,well one thing i can say is when it was garden burger very good company to work for.
bad,"I worked hard for this company for 18 years.  The job work/life balance was pretty good until the last 3 years.  Things seemed to have changed though, and the work became more and the hours just kept going up.  My position required Saturday work, which over the last 3 years ranged anywhere from 10-13 hrs.  That was starting to wear on me, but I kept at it and did what they asked me.  The typical work day would be to start at my assigned store for that particular day and perform whatever tasks my Retail Sales Rep or District Manager had for me.  Most work days, not including Saturday, were between 8-10 hrs.  I learned during my time with Kellogg how to deal with people better, as far as selling and working with store management in ways to enhance our product experience at their store, so both them and the shopper benefited. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting other people and working with other people selling, building displays, and just providing good snack foods to our customers with top notch service.  The hardest part of the job was the ever increasing hours for any given day, and on those Saturdays that I talked about above, starting my day when my son was still asleep and not getting home until he was already asleep again for the next night, and if I did get home early enough to see him awake, I was usually so tired from being on my feet and moving stuff all day that I wasn't in any shape to do much else.  In overview, working for Kellogg for 18 years was enjoyable up until the last 3 years, when cost cutting measures seemed to have taken over the thought process."
bad,Company closed all of the distribution centers in the United States and put 1100 people out of work because that is what Walmart wanted then to do so they agreed
bad,I am not happy working here and we are not compensated fairly.  We work a lot of hours which make our work/life balance almost non existent.  The hardest part of the position is the long hours and unequal pay.
bad,unsafe everything is based on quantity and not quality the warehouse is just a unsafe warehouse to work at not equal opportunities lack of leadership.
bad,"I liked the job, but the hours were just not there to live on. It would have been more liveable if were getting paid for the mileage being used on my own vehicle."
bad,The Senior Leadership Team is made up of people who mostly care about their own jobs and do very little for the hourly workers who try and run the production floor every day/nite. The HR is someone who likes you to only listen and not be heard.
bad,"This is probably the most miss managed facility out of the Kellogg’s fleet.  The plant manager and HR team are trying to change the culture, but there are some Managers there that really need to leave in order for this place to be successful.  If you don’t mind working every weekend then this is the place for you.  If you love your family this isn’t the place for you.  This is the old Keebler plant that Kellogg’s bought, they make Pop Tarts and cookies."
bad,Operations manager treats the employees with a disrespectful attitude. Good work was never appreciated in this facility so I knew this job wasn’t for me.
bad,"I don't have anything to say. go to the stores unload your product, place on shelf, check out of codes. that's it"
bad,Plan on working endless hours without knowing where the company is headed
bad,Do not work for this company if you want to have a job for more than 6 months. Territory managers only care about hitting their sales goals no matter how much work they cause you or how much trouble they get you in with the stores you work. Not bad pay wise but can't work more than 28 hours a week and don't get reimbursed for gas mileage.
bad,"walk in and check the pallet on tuesday morning, then work all possible remaining merchandise from back stock room to the shelves, take the new merchandise from the pallet and stock it on the shelves and displays. neatly organize what did not make it on the shelves in the back stock room."
bad,"This is not a good job. The manager misrepresented what my hourly pay would be after job offer, does not pay for time or mileage to drive my own vehicle to work sites, there is no work schedule until about 12 hours before work is to be done, does not pay extra for working holidays and there is no job training. Work sites at Walmart, Gerbes and Hi-Vee seldom cooperate with jobs to be done. Very little time is allowed to do the work right."
bad,Not a people friendly company. Compensation is worst in industry. Management is done with intimadation. If you can work as a robot this is a great company but it is clear why thier spokes people are cartoons.
bad,when i was there it was a horrible place we didn't have any days off and had to work overtime every week. i had worked 23 1/2 days straight with no day off then again 17 days straight with no days off i had to hurry up and leave that place and i told myself that i would never go back and i didn't
bad,We are the only Kellogg plant in America that isn't Union. So we get paid less and the work load is much heavier than any other Kellogg plant in America. You will be criticized for working hard and having the best results versus employers who are lazy. Where is the logic in that right? And don't forget its segregated. Noticed this on my first day on the job. Not a healthy place to work in 2019.
bad,Broken Union.  Work 16hrs a day for weeks bouncing shift to shift then told they're laying off!  No vacation time to start.  Not nearly as good of a company as I thought it would be.  The competition is better to work for.
bad,"Kellogg’s etait une entreprise dynamique et fun mais qui a perdu malheureusement ses atouts."
bad,Aprendi a coordinar tareas referentes al cargo dirigir las tareas que sean necesarias en seguridad
bad,"Empresa con muchas areas de portunidad, adquieres mucho aprendizaje"
bad,"I'd walk in a little early and review isles to get an idea of what needs to be taken from back stock, go sign in and check with receiving to see  if any orders came in and hopefully already have my eyes set on an L cart or U boat to load and unload pallets if urgent otherwise i'd work back stock first then deal with pallets of new shipment. I learned you may be required to take on other's job duties including your own boss and to bite my tongue when store management is rude and to do what i must to satisfy the companies I served as well as my own by following the rules as much as possible in a safe and timely fashion. Majority of the people above me in rank were less qualified for the work assigned and as much as I enjoyed the extra work and experience, i found it overall irresponsible of them to put all the work on myself and not only not own up to their mistakes but I was never acknowledged for handling my work and theirs as well as I did nor paid for the extra time etc. I loved helping customers and leaving with well organized isles as well as back stock. Hardest part was never feeling enough, recognized for the hard work and dealing with rude management and unprofessional co-workers."
bad,"Very poor management, pay for 40 hours and expect to work 80 hours per week. Very stressful place to work but I still liked my job and all my customers enjoyed working with me."
bad,My typical day would start at 4-5 am depending on whe. The deliveries would arrive.   You work hard and all day.   My lunch break was between stores.   I trained merchandisers.  I fixed complaints.  You dealt with deliveries and drivers and anything that went wrong.    Everything was your fault and no direction from upper management until you screwed up.  Went through several rounds of layoffs.   The model has changed now.
bad,"First and foremost, I love this company, the brands and the people that work there.  Alternatively, the culture has changed due to  many factors and most of which start from upper management. Major decisions to cut costs over the last 5 years has been the reason for declines in employee satisfactions and overall sales growth.  I used to love working for this company and was so proud to be an employee of Kellogg's.  The grocery industry has changed and Kellogg's in not being proactive to drive sales through the change."
bad,"I was fulltime merchandiser, I was constantly cleaning up messes of the KSR. Sales team is not held accountable for their lack of work. Poorly managed sales team. Then when told the whole division was closing down it got worse from sales team. For a company that has been around for 100 years they still do not have their act together."
bad,"You are giving a set of stores and deliveries to work. You must be able to walk , go up ladders, crawl, move up to 50 pound, bend alot. work alone in each store and fallow through."
bad,"This employer has no desire to allow anyone to succeed. There is no work/life balance when you work 7 days a week, and rarely get a holiday off. To work here you have to put this place above your health, sanity, and family. Im glad I got to go"
bad,I worked a month with this company part time. I never got close to 28 hrs like the job said. I never knew my schedule till the night before. And with me having kids that became a challenge. And they don't pay for your gas. I was spending about the same in gas that I made each day!
bad,"Good pay ,good benefits ,not a people oriented business , rotating shift work can be difficult, promotions are hard to get. You can be fired for any reason."
bad,If you want to make money but don’t care about family life this is the job for you. You will probably work 12 hours a day once you become qualified on equipment. Management doesn’t really care about employees mental state and the culture is pretty toxic since people spend so much time working.
bad,Put on PPE. Meet with shift leader get assigned area to work. Wait in line to clock in. Go to the assigned area get any details about the machine from the previous shift. Inspect product for damages. keep material flowing through the machined. move materials and finished product to and from the warehouse until shift change.
bad,"Unstable, company lay off to build company global.  They are hiring again and they fired a bunch of great folks.  Work life balance is not there.  Hey hey have you Walmart as an account but they never comply"
bad,"Es una empresa de amigos nadamás"
bad,"You work 7 days a week and they love to tell you you are working over just before your shift is over. Way too many people being the boss and not enough being workers. You get threatened on a daily basis of being ""walked out"""
bad,Not good place to work at.i don't like working there no future for temps..there nothing else to say I said it all out to not managed right and they treat you bad.
bad,Fast moving. Drive personal vehicle to grocery store stock shelves. Go to next store. This job no longer exists. Kellogg's closed this part of the company and saved millions of dollars for the company. They did treat the employees well helped the employees with new jobs or recommendations.
bad,"From day to day I would call on Big box retailers in a designed area. When stores were called on I would present ideas on how to best suit our products to meet their needs. The culture at Kellogg was very stressful considering the rumors of losing our jobs swirled every day. The company was constantly reducing its workforce. I love selling because I like people. I enjoy the thrill of the sale and providing for my family. "
bad,"With transition comes hard feelings.  As a displaced employee with the new warehouse model, I feel that the company is placing false emphasis on profit margin and dismissing top performers.  The decision to bring in a third party to tell you how to do business has been the demise of many companies in the past, and it concerns me that this may happen here."
bad,"The company is heavy share holder and profit driven.  The culture and employee focused company the founder had created is gone.  Your treated as a number, with minimum employee development with limited advancement opportunities."
bad,"I spent 50 hours or more each week stocking freight and 15 or more driving. That's all before trying to sell extra displays, building displays, or even trying to meet with management. Couple that with your boss, the regional boss, and the corporate office always sending in off season items to all of your stores without your consent. The majority of the time they wouldn't even tell you what was coming in advance. You had part time merchandisers but never had enough hours to give them."
bad,"Very low moral, upper management has been promoted through the ranks because of their seniority and not because of talent or experience. Just because someone has been with the company for 20yrs does not make them plant management material, Kellogg's needs to get people from the outside to manage these plants and break up the clicks. Upper management wants to put in their 9-5 and run out the door, then come in the next day and criticize everyone's action yet are never hold themselves accountable for their own mistakes which are always swept under the rug. Still managing with techniques from the 1970's and1980's , I don't think any of them have been to any seminars on how to manage or act in a professional manner."
bad,poor management will have you out on job site with no help and store managers not helpful to your cause once on a route for more than 15 hours with no help
bad,"The ""global"" job as promised has not materialized, it would be ok if I was interested in an east of the Missippi plant support position.  Stock, as promised during negotiations, was changed shortly upon arrival to only a handful of people.  "
bad,"This place is pretty terrible. The union is a joke, maint is below avergage (the have had contractors for over 15 yrs doing maint work orders because the maint crew sucks), supervisors curse you out. LOTS OF 16hr SHIFTS!!!! They dont really care for you at all. No advancement what so ever. VERY RACIALLY DIVIDED!!!!!! Good news if youre black, all the union stewards are black and only work for black people. Luckily its a right to work state here in KS so I dropped the union. Good luck if you come here, I am quitting in a few months!!"
bad,"Had a lot of work to keep everyone busy."
bad,"Kellogg was a wonderful company to work for up until the point they merged the DSD and Warehouse teams. After the reorganization communication was horrible, the DSD part of Kellogg was a get the sale at any cost division, ethics be damned."
bad,"It was a great company for awhile, but as the ecomony started taking a turn for the worse the companies expectations sky rocketed giving out budgets that were unattainable. As time went on it was more and more difficult and management put more pressure on the TMs to get to the number. They dont care aboout the employee its all a number game. Each year they kept taking more and more away from us and eventually my position was eliminated."
bad,A typical work day at Kellogg's is stressful. There's no room for advancement and no work/life balance. This company is being ran in the ground by the lack of good management. The hardest part of the job is being there for long hours and not feeling appreciated. Kellogg's would be better if the people would work together and realize we can all learn something from each other.
bad,A typical day at work starts with team meeting and Daily Directional Setting. The Teams direction changes during the day based on business needs. Changes occur on a regular basis. Breaks and lunches are based on the people working in your area
bad,"Weekends are mandatory I was part time and worked every weekend even if I didnt want too.manager and sales rep only cared about numbers they needed way to much freight to handle by your self ,some stores like wal mart got 3 or 4 pallets,too much of a work load ,sales numbers are the only thing that matters at kellogg's.,if you do not mind working your butt off then you might like it ."
bad,"Be prepared to earn 42% less than the person next to you doing the same job. Transitionals are hired with the ""opportunity to become regular employees."" Once you are in you find out this is a mirage, the previous contract ensured that you will likely never come close. Best you can get is a 2% yearly increase. Plus you get no dental insurance, no vacation until 1 full year, no 401k match until a full year. All this while being forced to work up to 16 hours. The company sought to divide the union into the haves and have nots, they have undoubtedly succeeded."
bad,Kellogg over compensates their inability to provide meaningful work by giving you work from home days and summer hours so you become complacent. The politics is unbearable and if you’re looking for career advancement be sure to become close friends with your superiors. Good place to get a big name on your resume and then leave.
bad,Relatively easy job.  Kind of boring.  They will tell you there is room for advancement.  There is not. They have been downsizing due to lack of sales in the industry.  Breakfast cereal and snacks are dying. High turnover rate.
bad,"Used to a great company - made you feel like family.  This is no longer the situation.  All perks have been eliminated and this is now just an average place to work."
bad,"Hardworking people ready to work. Slowed down by maintenence issues ."
bad,"Working in refrigeration and production maintenance  there is no time off forced drafting. Union doesn't protect the workers in maintenance. They do look after the production workers to some extent. It is a weak union that is in bed with management. They bend to suit management needs. Not bitter on the way they operate pay is great and being forced to work even under stressful circumstances will build your 401k and bank account. The union contract is going to end in four months and there other plant has been working with out a contract for two plus years. They are using co-packers and Kellogg is helping them build better equipment in sending them better irons, etc. Great for them they let us know production costs here are high. There are what the company wants to call K values, their are none in the Atlanta Eggo plant, they may have them in Blue Anchor. There have been four plant managers since I have been here, along with many upper management changes in this plant. It used to be a great place to work but corporate has changed on going to a zero based budget. This may be fine for a modern plant but one with 40 plus year old equipment it is hard to function when you have no spare parts, and long lead times on getting parts. I will be leaving soon as are other mechanics. Just waiting for confirmation on my future employer. I know they are better due to the fact that there mechanics have an average of 20 plus years with employer. If you need a quick spot to feed your family jump in the frying pan, but when you start don't expect to see them until you finally quit from Kellogg"
bad,I used to work for Kelloggs distribution company but they are a very unfair company. They chose to help their own race before anyone else. They don't give you all your wkin hrs even though you worked 40 or more.
bad,"Kellogg's in order to stay profitable needed to make changes constantly. They did it for company, but affected it's employees."
bad,Long hours with many different stops and conversations/sales pitches. Mostly dealing with Wal-Mart's. will have to figure out what makes everyone tick to make day to day sales. Need to adapt quickly.
bad,"Great pay and benefits package, but terrible work/life balance.  Also, every aspect of the company is so poorly managed that it is incredible they've been able to make money.  Very frustrating place to work."
bad,"Not enough hours to live on."
bad,"Started out as a good job but quickly turned, management was awful, they did not care about work/life balance, pay was so low, its union so they take extra money out of your already low paychecks."
bad,"You will make money. You will work your life away. Forget about seeing your family, this place LOVES 8 hour turnarounds. Everyone starts as a temp. Its not enough to show up and do your job. They dangle full-time like a carrot on a stick to see how high you will jump."
bad,the work culture is not friendly.  Too many changes and not enough sensitivity to those changes.  the company lacks diversity in the work place.  Very little training for role and after tenure.  This company needs an overhaul
bad,"This place went from a career, to average, to just a job.  It pays good and has good benefits for the area, which is why I stay.  Continuous change, as they tried to become Clearfield, then PPG, now are trying all the latest factory ""crazes"".  "
bad,"learned a lot about food processing and packaging processes. diverse work force make it a great work environment. benefits are terrible, and compensation is below average."
bad,"I must start by saying Kellogg's is a safe clean place to work. If you want to work 84 hours a week on an 8 hr schedule that will rotate from coming in 4 hours early or 4 hours over seven days a week, with minimal notice. Most of this time will be spent waiting for one level of incompetence or another: i.e. failures in equipment, failures in quality, failures in people. When they are able to produce product, the work is bearable."
bad,Learned a great deal about managing large-scale promotional event management projects
bad,"Start at 5-6am, go to Walmart's, Kroger's, etc and write orders for the stores, work orders for the stores, take care of all the credits or returns. Had to manage my team to make sure all 14 stores were properly taken care of. Sold in theme displays to store managers and build the displays. I have learned so much from this company, like managing my time, managing my team, my labor hours, my budget, how to think outside the box and make a quick and fast decision sometimes. My co-workers were the best people to work with, none of us were afraid to ask each other for help. We leaned on each other and if one of us wasn't going to make budget, the rest of us would sell extra just to help them out. I loved talking and selling to my customers, it was a great feeling walking out, knowing you just sold a display to a store that was telling al other vendors NO. Loved working with the public, The hardest part is their is ZERO work life balance, Wednesday were the easiest day I had, but still on Wednesday I only worked 11-12 hours. Monday was a 14 hour day, Tuesday was a 16 or more, Thursday was a 15 or more hour day and Friday was a 14 plus hour day. Then if I had a call in on Saturday or Sunday (which was all the time) I had to go out and both days were at least 10-13 hours a day. This was the worse part of the job."
bad,Operate and pack supplies as they produce on the assembly line
bad,There was good people and it was nice working one shift but there was some people that wasn't good to work with but i was nice to spend time with my kids
bad,"Toxic environment "
bad,"I struggled with fitting into the culture at this plant.   Management style was command and control, however it is a very good company going through digital changes."
bad,"lots of long days, almost weekly changes in direction from the leadership team. lots of good people there unfortunately the company is not headed in a good direction."
bad,"You will earn more money than you ever have. Your family will enjoy spending it for you. You work 7 days a week. Most of them 13 hour days for managers who micromanage the heck out of you. The equipment is old and not well maintained, but that doesn’t matter,"
bad,Nice place to work. Advancement is possible if you work hard and really pursue it. Safety culture is outstanding and is benchmark compared to other places I have worked.
bad,"Long Hours, Unrealistic expectations, Severe Nepotism, Management unskilled, lack of training for new positions. Revolving door of managers and supervisors."
bad,"On the road daily completing my assigned sales duties . Instore visits checking planogram integrity, suggest other items for display., Due to cutbacks again will be done working for Kelloggs. Was hoping to retire from here."
bad,Okay place to work - so much reorg and no advancement within the company unless you are willing to relocate to MI without assistance and lower pay/ben
bad,"If you're willing to sell your soul for good money then this is your place. The money was great, expectually for the type of work that needed to be done, but the facts are this. The toxic environment will provide you with incompetent supervisors, gossiping co-workers, and a union who only looks out for the ""good ole boys"". Don't waste your time believing you'll become full time any soon. There agenda is to push out the full timers to bring in workers at a lower wage. So good luck to anyone who wants to work for the devils kitchen."
bad,"I have spent 5 years in this company, and have given all that I can. I received a layoff as a thanks. Along with several other thousands of kellogg employees. Over the years sales have slumped and the budgets have gotten higher and harder to achieve. In return all blame goes to the employees. They have now transitioned away from having a sales team. We were never appreciated. I am gone and am never looking back."
bad,I worked a lot of hours and did not feel fairly compensated for the amount of time that I had worked there  Benefits were good.
bad,"management needs to be turned around, a lot of backstabbing amongst supervisors to aim towards promotions that will never occur. battle creek plant is a stand still work environment with no room for growth"
bad,"lot of over time hardly no time off. good group of co-worker to work with. not alot of issuse wiht them. ,Lot of walking a checking to ensuse that everone is safe ad that a good quailt produt is being makd.. ensure that producton is meet"
bad,Breaking down pallets of product and placing to shelf. Hard work and steady work. hardly have time for a lunch break unless the delivery truck runs late.
bad,This job is hard to move up in ranks due to slow growth in the snack division of Kellogg's. Managers give you stores to service the next day the night before the day. It is hard to plan anything ahead and the hours week per week varies. This job is good for people who need a second job or something to tie them over till they get a job with a career involved.
bad,"Stay away.  No set schedule no way to advance.  "
bad,able to communicate well others. managed 4 merchandisers daily. wrote orders in 21 accounts weekly. met volume goals.
bad,constant changes created instability. Flexibility was great and training 
bad,"Durante mi corta estancia en la empresa se me dio un excelente trato y condiciones laborles, y un paquete relativamente bueno."
bad,Não oferece oportunidade para seus funcionários crescerem e os salários são muito baixos.
bad,"VERY Long hours,VERY demanding of ""numbers"", great coworkers, Managers were looking out for number one, work life balance was not even a reality, 70 plus hours a week"
bad,necsito trabajo y ocupo dinero y superame a hacer punal imss por mi misma tiempo completo sin faltar trabajar y superame en el trabajo
bad,"Kelloggs doesnt pay very well.  The work environment is awful.  Temperatures are extreme.  The work expectations are impossible.  Kelloggs doesnt hire enough people to get the work done and Kelloggs doesnt pay well enough to attract the type of employee required to get the work done. Swing shift is horrible.  "
bad,"This used to be a good place to work; the last union contract did not go well. Top pay is now $16  per hour, regardless of position or experience. It is difficult to keep managers/supervisors for various reasons"
bad,a lot of negative co-workers.  most jobs were simple and easy to learn if people were willing to train you properly.  If not full-time union worker you did not have job security no matter how long you worked there.
bad,The future of the company is unsure. Employees are stressed and frustrated. There is a Union but the way the contract is written it doesn't benefit the new employees.
bad,"I like the job, it's just need to make an couple changes. For instance we have to work everyday with no days off and we get very short breaks. We don't have any benefits , they won't give us an pay raise and they very unorganized. They sometimes very  be unfair to some co-workers and treat them different."
bad,Poor management terrible communication was told after a certain amount of ppl hired we will get our upgraded to full pay that haven’t happened yet . Just
bad,"They closed the DSD area and let Sales team go.  Very poor management. Shame on upper mgr for letting this happen. Store shelfs look horrible, empty and messed up.  GOOD LUCK"
bad,"not a happy place to work. no work/life balance like they ""say"" they strive for. Company is not thriving. Constantly downsizing"
bad,El transporte es lo unico que no me gusto y fue la causa de mi despido
bad,"not recommended. Its a lot of labor. The pay is very low compared to the work done. Poor training and some stores are too far away,they are bad with reimbursement on millage"
bad,"typically start before most retail stores are open, stock orders, address any individual store's needs/concerns and anything you can't take care of yourself you report to the sales lead. A very basic merchandising job. You cover your sales territory if the lead is on vacation including scheduling, ordering, etc. You are held responsible for sales as well although you have very little control over this unless you are covering the sales route. You can be 'let go' simply on the word of a customer who isn't a fan of you but they grant you a very nice severance package."
bad,ok place had certain days to work...was ok until trucks ended up off schedule...
bad,"This was a 28 day plus work schedule. Lots of overtime, most days exceeded 10 hours and many exceeded 14 hours."
bad,"The machine just might act up through out the day so we will have to sweep for a hour or so. I haven't learned too much, I can pack faster then I could when I first start working. management not organized like they should and could be. My co-workers are ok, The hardest part is not getting promoted because we work for d-1 manage service."
bad,"Performs maintenance and repair on various pieces of heavy wheel and track vehicles including but not limited to heavy-duty truck and semi-tractors, material drive military type vehicles, excavators, skidders, high, pressure pumps ,"
bad,Shift manager is in my opinion is discriminatory and if you are not there chatty buddy you are labelled incompetent.  Very good salary in the company but bad shift manager
bad,"It' s a job overload. There's to many other task that go along with your job. Trying to do other things, gets you behind while trying to perform your regular job..!"
bad,I worked for Procter and Gamble for 14 years before Kellogg bought us out. I worked for them for 5 years. I have never witnessed the morale or culture of a place go downhill so fast. If you want a job that has decent pay go here. Just don't plan on making a career out of it.
bad,I would go to the stock room and sign in then go to my pallets of product and put the items on the shelf. I would straighten the items on the shelf in an orderly fashion.
bad,Take your skills to a more stable company. Management is lost. No support from Home office to help grow the business and support the sales team. Company has restructured and laid off people every year since I have worked for them. This seems to be the culture of the company.
bad,Company had a great reputation and has great products but very poor upper management. CEO resigned but they must clean rest of the house. Too much focus on a Facebook like site called “Yammer” instead of selling product. Good benefits but pay not competitive with other companies.
bad,"Worked alone and did not enjoy this job.  Provided administrative support for two vice presidents and one senior director. Set up meetings, luncheons, and travel arrangements. Prepared PowerPoint presentations.  Created charts, graphs, and spreadsheets using Excel.  Performed other miscellaneous duties as required."
bad,"When challenged to enact desired business changes in a strong union environment, the changes are occasionally met with resistance.  There is a lot of red tape and rules in day-to-day dealings with employees as well."
bad,Good pay work a lot of hours. Work rotating shift. Spend many hours away from your family. Company is always out to get someone for breaking Safety protocol or falsifying documents
bad,The company has been constantly reinventing itself during the past years.  The categories are not growing and it introduces a tremendous pressure to the organization.  Great people with limited resources making the environment a complex one.  Paid and benefits are good and overall the company has great products and legacy.
bad,"I learned a lot about dealing with rude, angry, and impatient people."
bad,"Management is terrible.  They want robots working for them instead of real people."
bad,the hardest part of the job was staying awake it was not interesting management was great
bad,"NA"
bad,As a employee at Kellogg’s there was no unity and teamwork with my supervisor it was always finger pointing by my supervisor to his workers to cover his mistake instead of teamwork
bad,"Though the pay is great the scheduling isn't as good, of course working there making money is easy. however the downside, of not knowing when you are off, they can even change the schedule once it is out,"
bad,"No tips go in at your own risk lol , this place is like a slave ship , the blame you for everything, it's never the company fault so please don't get hurt and don't fall because they will try to fire you I couldn't stand this place it was horrible"
bad,"They have no problem keeping you over for another 8 hrs of work and the communication is not good, and the supervision only cares about production and if your line is down wants to know when it will come back up"
bad,"Eliminated my position nationally with no notice and by video conference. Thought we were attending a planning meeting, and left with out a job. I was recruited away from a great job with the promise of great opportunity, then the rug was pulled from under me."
bad,"The location I was at, closed. They didnt follow corp policy and ran their own show.if the local plant mgr didnt like you, all they had to do was call a peer at corporate and slow your checks down while you are on disability,  trying to squeeze you."
bad,"Good pay and benefits for the Central PA Area.  Most employees are enjoyable to work with and make work time fly by.  Management turnover is high.  If not full time, they will force employees to work overtime and exceptions are not given for time off."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company because it was fast paced and very challenging. I learned a lot while there although I felt the management could have been a lot better. i really enjoyed the people I worked with they were very nice and willing to help train me. I learned so much about the dos and don'ts of packing food products.
bad,"Very good benefits, but ends up being a very labor intensive job, running from store to store putting out back stock inventory. Be prepared to work long hours and days including weekends."
bad,Awesome people to work with. Positive environment. Don't get hired through Manpower Group because they will over work you and give you minimum wage.
bad,es bueno  la cultura de Kellogg's en el lugar de trabajo
bad,"Territory manager in BC run by upper management in Ontario and Quebec who are totally out of touch with how things work here."
bad,"they got rid of all DSD locations nationwide,it was good until they let all employees go.Not very happy when you give a company your hard work and they say sorry we are going to let you go."
bad,When I first started it was a very good company. After awhile it became clear that they were down sizing and a future was less and less.As they kept making more and more cuts to down size.
bad,"When I first started with Kellogg's, it was a great company to work for. However the last 3 years have been extremely tough and myself and thousand's of others have lost our jobs"
bad,"Benefits are okay, Mileage reimbursement is a joke and you are only scheduled to do a few stores a day so it is difficult to get hours."
bad,This was a good job. I could have grown with this company and I learned a lot but it became very unsafe on our site. My co-workers learned a lot. The hardest part of the job was the heat. I enjoyed the work I was doing on site. We got sent home a lot due to unsafe work.
bad,"Work life balance was impossible. I loved my position and loved my accounts and employees, but never could get a balance to have a family life. the turn over was not bad due to benefits and pay, but work load was humanly impossible,"
bad,Poor training which leads to confusion on displaying and merchandising. no communication if you need answers
bad,"I was originally assigned a territory close to home, 17 stores. Then they needed help for a ""couple weeks"" in a town 2 hours away. I agreed to help until they found another person to cover the territory. Nine months later I was still leaving Sunday night and coming back Friday night. There was not much of a rush to fill the territory and I had enough of living in a hotel every week."
bad,"It could be a cool place if everyone was treated fairly. Management only worry about your call in units then someone being on their phone on the production floor or sleeping on the job!..They catch u on those write ups to sign, Don’t sign them, avoid them at all cost!, because those will be their ammo to terminate u when u run out of units!..and the union will not help u  on anything, wasted my time paying my dues! Some people that run the Machines I feel should be paid more then those easy jobs! Period!"
bad,I was extremely displeased with the leadership at the plant i worked at. My coworkers and subordinates were great but the leadership was toxic and I would highly recommend not working for the leadership I was subjected to. The HR manager was great but OVER WORKED!! Extremely lean.
bad,Find supervisor and find out where you will be working. a little unorganized but very easy work. nothing hard about the job long hours and benefits are terrible.
bad,"Unfortunately our Eggo Waffle plant is laying 75% of work force.   Poor management decisions and a stalemate with the union have caused a bunch of layoffs and the demise of 4 of the 6 lines making waffles."
bad,Order selecting on double pallet jack getting timed on how fast the order is picked and wrapped also have a daily production to meet by the end of your shift
bad,Kellogg used to be a company concerned about its employees but sadly this is no longer the case. My job was outsourced a long with many others. There is option for advancement but you will be lucky if they don't do a reorganization for your department.
bad,"I was just hired in November of 2016, on February 9, 2017 we were informed of a mandatory conference call where all employees were notified that our jobs are discontinued as of August 1, 2017. The pay for the KM position is good, but management goes from one extreme to another, I am often times scheduled to work on my days off, and then the area manager calls and tells me that I am spending too much time at each stop and have too many hours, but my immediate supervisor (KSD) leaves me a list of duties on ""Stay In Front"" that is so detailed that I have no choice but to work extra time at each store, when I have not been as detailed my KSD yells at me and states that I HAVE to be more thorough and then the area manager calls me back and tells me to spend more time at each stop, you can never satisfy the management staff.  I have received text messages at 3:00 a.m., and am constantly having to take tests on my days off!"
bad,On specific days I was expected to go to certain grocery stores and accept orders and stock the shelves with any remaining back stock and then put out any new product that came in. I occasionally assisted in building or tearing down displays.
bad,"Kellogg is living off past accomplishments.  The company's growth strategy is non-existent, and it's Senior executive leadership is, at best, sub standard, and it's probably accurate to say is reactive and short sighted.  They have no plans to develop people; put people in VP positions who are borderline incompetent, and basically reward astute political players vs people who can produce sustainable improvement."
bad,Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Ability to interact with individuals at all levels of the organization. PC skills including the use of MS Word and Excel.
bad,I worked for Kellogg Company for 5 years+.  It was a very demanding job on my time and it was very physical.  There was no work life balance with this job.  Every day was a new day.
bad,over looked 27 employees for apperence and production. kept count on production and reports
bad,"Scheduled three days sent home two, for three weeks straight. This does not pay bills when sent home after 20 minutes."
bad,"If you have a family this isn't the place to be, they work swing shifts so you have to work first, second and third shift. Also, the higher ranking managers are horrible. Employees that make less do all the work while they stand around watching. It's stressful but good pay."
bad,A typical day at work is starting around 230am pre trip the truck then fuel at hit the road to make my deliveries. I've learned patients dealing with Wal-Mart receivers and became a better situational driver dealing with different types of weather. Never really had good management they would talk about your personal business to other employees. Didn't like the culture to many back stabbers. Hardest part of the job was wondering if your truck was fixed for the next day if something was wrong ( light bulb out) the most enjoyable part was clocking out and going home
bad,"Stock shelfs with product. Go through inventory, Mostly work by myself. Talk to mangers about getting more space in the store to get out more product."
good,Let's just say it has it's up's and downs like every other job. Proud to be able to be a part of this company. Great responsability comes with working for this job.
good,The management team is very careless and have horrible communication skills. Over work employees by working mandatory 12 hours due to lack of staffing.
good,A typical day at work consist of waiting a half hour to get assignment I have basically learned nothing because I have about 6 open packets management doesn't have a clue on how to manage the culture of the company is make these crackers at all cost don't worry about you family the hardest part of the job is that you can never get a steady shift.
good,Don’t apply if you have or want a life they work you everyday 12 hours a day. The only thing they care about is cookie production. Your life don’t matter there.
good,Steady paced work environment. Keeping a clean and safe work environment throughout your work day. I learned that you ave to look out for the safety of you and others when there is high safety hazards. The best part of the work day is interacting with your coworkers to make the day go by.
good,"I was excited about the opportunity to work at Kellogg, a company that is forward thinking logical but doesn’t care about operation supervisors. Couldn’t even make suggestions to management about OEE/ processes to make the lines run better. Your hands are tied with every write up. Employees that would call out supervisors family members that passed away over the intercom system due to being angry about a write up. Stay away from the Pikeville plant!!! Still no reason to terminate my employment no write ups in over a year no verbal Communication. Reckonized multiple times for start ups and no oversite from management and no reason to be terminated."
good,"This work place has no type of advancement, no matter how hard you work, on time you are, or what critical problem you solve you are stuck in one position of the company."
good,The company does not support diversity and multicultural beliefs. Good for entry level R&D but career advancement is limited if you are not a white male or female.
good,Company Is dieing a slow death due to poor upper management. Faithful hard working employees  with 25+ years let go. 4000+ employees let go in August.
good,"When i first started, it was a great job with a great work-life balance."
good,Management is young and inexperienced they force overtime relentlessly often leaving employees extremely exhausted and the work home life balance is nonexistent
good,Stay away from this company! They constantly reorganize and let people go. Recently they eliminated there entire sales and distribution organization across the entire USA.
good,The money is good but there is no work life balance you work any shift it changes week to week.No training program.No chance for promotions.The managers have unrealistic goals.
good,The job had the potential to be a good one but was hampered by the changing industry and what appeared to be knee-jerk corporate responses to those changes.
good,"Good pay for the work, dealing with poor management and even worse employees; Hard to actually fire any employees even with the gross neglect and refusal to work."
good,"I started this position and worked 25-30 hours per week, which helped to make ends meet. After a few months, they cut my hours drastically and now my position is being eliminated."
good,This job was fair but it's hard to make an advancement within the company. I feel they shoyld also pay more. I worked on the assembly line. I helped package and manufactor goods.
good,"I've been with the Kellogg Company for over 12 years and have witnessed a lot of changes, mostly good changes. However, over the last 2-3 years Kellogg's is really struggling to keep up with the ever changing Consumer Packaged Goods industry.  We've went from a trend leader, which led to our success, to a trend following, which has negatively impacted our business.  It seems we're the last CPG company to embrace technology and the digital age.  Our sales reps,  received smart phones 2 years ago and tablets this year.  Prior to this, they were using flip phones and paper control books.  This company is always last to the party and our declining sales is a reflection of this.  We operate in a ""Now"" society, Kellogg's is not currently set up to operate in this fasted paced environment.  So, what's holding us back?  Investment!  Kellogg's is not willing to make the investment needed to compete in the aggressive market place we all complete in.  This is not only from a technology standpoint, but to personal, distribution, trade spend. ect...   Our biggest miss comes from investing in our people.  W.K. Kellogg's vision was to ""Invest in my People....""  This company has strayed from investing and building a winning team and culture, it's easier to dismiss or promote under performing employees than to coach and grow employees.  With this strategy, we've lost a lot of good employees and have promoted others who did not deserve it.  These promotions have led to a weak Senior Leadership team, which is struggling to be solution oriented.  Their solution, is ""Fire and Hire"".  This does not"
good,"Not a dependable job for a Casual Worker unless you want to work every weekend and you never know week to week hour many hours you are going to get one week you may get 60 another week 48 and then another week 0 and the only way to get hired full time in to work nights and then you have no idea how long you will have to work nights before you can get days, unless you know someone or kind to someone high up, very good co-workers"
good,"Los valores de la empresa son contradictorios. Se dicen cosas, pero se ejecutan otras de manera obvia."
good,"Long days, with a lot of meetings. I have learned a lot working at Kelloggs. A lot of good people. My manager is good, and provided me an opportunity to grow. Support from him has been great!"
good,"I was there 10 months."
good,"Pre and post trip equipment. Delivering Kelloggs products to grocery stores in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana .Working with receiving department at stores"
good,Lots of travel and overnights to cover open routes and vacations. Some managers were not very qualified to manage themselves let alone others. The others I worked with tolerated the manager's shortcomings and performed their jobs expertly. Being away from home every week for 7 months was the hardest part of the job.
good,"Job has good pay.  Has good benefits but, they used to be better.  Management is generally clueless on how to run their lines or how to manage.  Communication is horrible!  A VP straight out lied to everyone in our building to influence the employees to vote the way he wanted.  Zero worklife balance.  All work.  No life.  People you work with are nice.  The work isn't too difficult but all the other things mentioned previously make it a soul-sucking job."
good,"I was never really given a job title, they had me work mostly in the warehouse (that's why I just considered myself a warehouse worker) there I would write part numbers down mostly all day that my fingers would hurt, then I helped clean and get rid of stuff, I was never really explained what to do, usually I would just clean, then when I finished I would have to look for management to see what else they wanted me to help with."
good,The work schedule is 7 days a week and some days are 12 hours. The start up pay is fair but the opportunity for advancement is minimal. I have learned a lot about how to manufacture food.
good,"They should have benefits for employees who have worked there for a while and vacation days also be able to take a longer break because it's hot in the factory, could have more fans or something to cool people off cause we sweat a lot while we work, take better care of employees, check people bags, better security, more people who are gonna work"
good,if i got a call to go to Walmart and merchandise that was fine but the last supervisor i had was not any good and that why i decide to leave plus they phased out the job and decide to go full time back at Oreillys most of the work was easy
good,"I worked 12 hour shifts,the work was tedious and not satisfying,the pay was great but the company always pushing for higher preformances with giving you the resourses to improve."
good,the hours were long and also if it hots in the inside they only have 1 fan for u and they do give you water also the managers were ok to work with enjoyed when i was there
good,"There are two to three different parts of Kellogg's, I was hired through a temp agency called D1. D1 is the worst place you can go. Its best to go through Kelly Services."
good,"company in flux now . no stability. lots of talent leaving . Everyone waiting for the other shoe to drop.not stable, not stable, company in flux not stable"
good,"management not very good with following through and poor communication between sales, management and merchandiser. Very frustrating to call corporate office with benefit or payroll questions, on hold for long periods of time and not everyone you talk to has the same answer."
good,"For the most part the job is simple. They have medical benefits but that's all. No PTO, terrible Union, work 7 days a week, sometimes 12 hour days, upper management is horrible. Employees barely get any recognition for the hard work they do."
good,The company tends to change how we go to business every other year.  Kellogg had no experience running DSD and it showed with each change they made.  The upper management always seemed out of touch with what was actually going on in the stores.
good,"Not happy with turn around rate, always send staff home early or tell them their not needed once arrived. It's good to work for them if you are hired straight in."
good,I was able to learn a lot while working for Kellogg's.  This career path allowed me to work on time management along with how to manage different customer bases over a larger territory.
good,"- disorganzied with staffing (often short staffed) "
good,They always drafting for overtime. One minute it's based of seniority next it's based on how many overtime hours you do during the week. Management sucks they don't properly make sure new hires get the proper training.  You work so many hours they leave you by your self. The hours don't mean you actually know the job
good,"Overall, the job isn't that bad.  It's the lack of management support throughout the day that wears you down. Even most co-workers can't be relied upon  to finish a simple task. It has become a very negative atmosphere to work in."
good,Too much seperation between workers and not enough support. If you have a family this is not the place to be. College students and single people this would be a good choice.
good,"the work is not hard, its just hard to watch  people not do their jobs or even come to work half the time. I like what I do and hop I can work there for at least another 7 years . Right now I'm laid off for two weeks"
good,"Kellogg co had great benefits but thats where it stop,you work long hours and nobody cared.You were on call 24hrs a day and always worried about getting yelled out from your management team."
good,KBR underbid a contract that requires a minimum of 70 people to conduct 24 hour/7 days a week operation of military and civilian aircraft loading/off-loading of cargo and passengers.  All other managers were fired by station manager that has not experience in the job to allow KBR to hire less qualified personnel at a lower pay to say money on contract.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, no work life balance for some. Advancment opportunities are available. Very diverse work culture"
good,12.5 hour scheduled days with mandatory overtime. They could schedule you for 26 16hours days straight and you have to show up. Management only works 12 hour days 3 days a week and none of them come from production. They have never done the job they force others to do. Clueless and aloof is how I would describe the attitude of management to employee concerns.  Most coworkers were really nice and great to work with.
good,stock shelves rotate product. known how to do job. management is ok. no coworkers and the travelling is the hardest part of job. the best part is taking care of customer.
good,"A typical day of work will consist of multiple store vists (2-7) merchandising Kellogg products. With this job I learned about product volume, sales prediction, location volume, managing inventory and display planning. Management and co-workers are personality dependant so give or take, you may have a laid back team or you could have an untight team. The hardest part of the job would be the long hours. You can easily work 55+ hours a week depending on sales events, vacation coverage and forced out products. The most enjoyable part of the job is self management aspect, you have no direct supervisor."
good,love my job just not getting enough hours learned a lot of different things in the last four years and Im very thankful for everything. learned more about Autonomous Maintenance and it can only help me further down the road
good,On a daily basis I work with the floor mechanics to trouble shoot issues that arise with the equipment on the floor.  I then work with our vendors to get in the necessary parts needed to fix the machinery.  While this is going on I an in contact with the upper management of the plant to keep them informed of the current status of the line and the time frame needed to complete any repairs and or rebuilds.
good,Ok place to work. Fast paced in maintenance dept. Maintence management should not be management. Shutting down within six months. I think it was maintence that could not plant running .
good,When sales got soft the outsourcing started.  Didn't care about loyalty.  If you didn't work long hours and drop any family commitment that got in the way you were not accepted or respected.  It used to be a great place to work.  Sad what they turned into.
good,"fast paced job"
good,Self paced high volume stocking. Travel from retail location to retail location that carried high volume Kellogg's products. While there transport truck delivery loads from back of the house to appropriate retail location in company store.
good,"A typical day at work included entering orders, checking progress on orders and printing reports. What I did not enjoy was the way I was treated by the permanent management at the office where I worked.  I was assigned by a temp agency and did my work.  Both my supervisor and I were let go."
good,"Hit your numbers - no excuses!"
good,"someday this will be a good company to be at....right now, it is not.  no work life balance, do more with less FOR less, be able and willing to work 24/7."
good,Good busy work on your own.Working in several locations each day. Some what flexible time schedule.  Not a lot of communication often last minute changes.Job was eliminated and was not notified by Kelloggs but another vendor. Did not feel they were straight forward or honest.
good,I don't have very much to say here after starting my job and up rooting my family to move to Wisconsin I was told a month after I started that they were going to reshape the company and I was going to be losing my job.
good,Would never go back they didn't even know half the people that worked they not a very good place to work at they don't care about the workers we didn't get anything for hitting our numbers each day
good,Management does not follow company core values of respect and integrity. Supervisors are not equipped to do their job. They create a hostile workplace.
good,Typical day of work is 6-8 stores a day. Limited on time of work. Enjoyable when working alone. Hardest part is having a life out of work. You bring work home. Working under a so called hourly budget during the week is not well planned out.
good,"Liked the position.  Very hard on the body physically.  No chance of moving up for a woman in this company.  Definitely a ""good Ole boys"" club. Pay was good for a part time job. Flexible with no one looking over your shoulder watching you. You must be self starter and need little direction as communication from upper management was awful. Obvious you were just a number to them."
good,Kelloggs was probably a great company 30 years ago.  Unfortunately they still operate the same way.  It is like going into a time capsule to work there.  I wouldn't recommend.
good,"go in and mix doughs for crackers and vanilla wafers"
good,Was a great place to work. People were some what lazy but we had fun working together to get the job done. The bakery was a real learning experience for mehad a great time while it lasted.
good,"Greatest part of this job are the benefits and decent pay, but co workers make it difficult. You got to have tough skin. Its a union base company that goes by seniority. Management is very unprofessional, unethical and unorganized. Management and/or supervisors manipulate the contract to whereas it favors the company.They do not exercise good communication skills. No room for advancement because they do not hire from within. Ok company to work for."
good,An overall decent workplace if you can find hours to come by. Unfortunately you only get hours if you're a full timer or if people continuously buy merchandise.
good,kelloggs is a good job  if you are looking for a second job or need some extra cash. they do not give you enough hours to support yourself on. it does have it advantaged to work for them. but whats not so good about this company is that you use your own car and gas. they do not pay for mileage.
good,"My family and I have a combined 100yr history with the Kelloggs Memphis plant, and after 13yrs personally, I find myself out on a lockout by the corporation and not able to support my family at no fault of my own."
good,I really liked my job there.  I enjoyed the day to day challenges that a fast paced production environment had to offer.
good,Well known CPG company with a long history. Adequate field training with exposure in the Grocery business.
good,I was shift leader so I was responsible to assign all routes and trucks to 10 other employees daily. I was also responsible for picking the daily needs of the company and taking care of all problems. The hardest part of my job was the consistent promise of advancement when it was never their intention.
good,"Loved working here, though it consisted of long hours and not so much of celebrating of success.  People were great.  Hardest part of job was the juggling of conflicting priorities"
good,"If you're looking for a job that pays the bills and nothing more, kellogg's in Clearfield, Utah may be for you. When applying for promotions, don't bother unless you have seniority as they do not go by who is the best fit, they go by who has been there the longest.No real motivation to excel."
good,"Typical day at work is about 11 to 13 hours(Salary)Selling product for incremental displays,stocking shelves, trying to make budget. If anything I have learned is the most important thing is taking care of the customer.Myself and nine other managers work extremely hard every day, five,six, and sometimes, seven days a week.The hardest part of the job is trying to keep all accounts happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you did your best and your customers know the same."
good,"No one ever retires so there's no chance of getting a 1st shift position; no upward mobility. Several co-workers are lazy, leaving all the work for others, but they are never held accountable."
good,"Union Environment, challenging at times however overall the union was supportive in company initiatives and minimal inteference in allowing the company to conduct business."
good,"an amazing company to work for the union can be there to help you.  all a popularity if you work night shift there is no security the supervisors literally do whatever they want to do. If you're not a part of the high school environment you were looked at as an outcast. If you have a very high work ethic you are hated or discriminated against. in terms of making you literally feel unappreciatedevery single day offering no official training or help for you to succeed. constantly being yelled at at work constantly being accused of doing your job right and being the scapegoat, and being targeted because of who you are and your personality. on a month sure employ"
good,"Everybody nice and well manner and the company is very good and well taught , been there almost a year then found another job, but Kellogg’s a good place to work"
good,"HR always listen and help to sort your professional and personal issues. Supervisor is really nice . I like job flexibility. But there is no personal growth in this job. Most of the time workload is heavy like other warehouses. Pay rate is low, according to job demands. It should be higher."
good,"Pros--good benefits and competitive pay. "
good,Didn’t mind making the money at first. Then you start learning more areas of the job and they keep you for 12 hours every day. They change shifts on you week by week. All the higher ups look down on you. Incompetent supervisors. And the head man in charge doesn’t care whatsoever about you
good,"This was an awesome company prior to 2008, that's when management changed and the company culture turned into a poorly managed corporate type culture.  I'm referring to the Kellogg IT in Oakbrook...not Kellogg HQ in Battle Creek, MI."
good,"Everything is easy, money is good I loved it there but dislike being laid off ALL THE TIME! I’d say if you like to have freedom and vacation all the time from work apply here, if your a person that likes to work at least your 40 hours every week DO NOT APPLY because trust me you will be laid off all the time!!!"
good,"Very fast paced, unorganized, over worked and a company that is currently being sold. Upper management is very bad and give unrealistic expectations and don’t treat everyone equally. Hopefully once the company is sold they will bring in new senior leadership."
good,There were 4 different lines and you did the job required at whatever line you were put on. When one of the lines went down at some point you would pack off of the line and put the product back on the line when that part of the line was up and running.
good,Good company. I really worked for a marketing company that sometime sold product. 
good,Great work for independent person. Lots of physical work and energy is a must. Meet various people at all the different store. Lots of travel but use of own vehicle is a real drawback.
good,Driving from customer to customer understanding the needs of the business and what upcoming promotions will drive the business.  I gained a lot of management experience as well as organizational skills that helped me exceed expectations on every level.
good,"Salary decent, new employees receive few benefits as compared to older workers."
good,Most enjoyable part was working with customers and my peers.I was able to develop some great business relations with my customers that I am sure will continue.
good,Their brand is solid and will be around for decades to come. They are on a mission to globalize. They are very fiscally conservative which has its positives and negatives.
good,"HECTIC!!!! Always wanted more, more, more, and more. It was never enough. Company always auto shipped product like no other and counted it against you when it was refused."
good,"The Bad: Corporate mandates different ""time suck"" reports and meetings done hourly, making it very hard to run a line efficiently. If you are promoted from within, the pay is lower than if you come in from the outside. No pension. Mediocre health benefits for the premiums we pay. We used to be a family oriented company, the current Aussie CEO and his regime have dismantled that culture. We are now profit/investor driven."
good,"Kelloggs snacks North America is going away from the DSD sales business and all sales associates and most employees will be let go."
good,Upper Management lazy and inexperienced. Company does not have inventory on hand to do repairs nor do  they take time to fix it properly. They waste money on outside vendors.
good,"This was my first position as a retail supplier. While relationship building is always critical, Kellogg's had many self created emergencies, requiring mandatory conference calls and reports. I would count on a minimum of a 55 hour week if you had to drive 500 miles in a week."
good,"Loading and Uploading Kellogg packaged materials, as well as packing and practicing OSHA sanitation daily throughout premises. The great thing about this job was being able to obtain overtime hours."
good,Does not offer a great quality of life and balance of work and personal. Working seven days a week isn't practical year in and year out. Mandatory overtime consistently isn't always ideal. No holidays or time to raise your children. Job for young driven millennials.
good,"While working at Kellogg's I learned numerous jobs, applied myself to meet the needs of the company. We had a lot of overtime due to being short staffed, so the money was good if you were willing to work. On the downside, we had a lot of unorganized management, which led to confusion among employees."
good,"Great atmosphere because of the people that work there, but the culture isn't what it use to be. Still a great place to work."
good,"you have to write papers and folders to advance it's not about your work abillity, and this is comming form someone who graduated college with a 3.52 GPA"
good,"I love my job, but after many years of working many 80 hour weeks it can become stressful.  An average day is 8 hours, although depending on overtime, they can tell you that they need you to either come in early or stay over 4 hours.  Regardless of what events or appointments that you have. you cannot say no.  Its a great job.  Sometimes it just takes a little out of you."
good,"Selling/merchandising Kelloggs products to majors in a set territory. Ability to work with integrity to complete store to store work. Flexibility and the ability to get along and communicate with all levels of store personnel very important to success. Metrics, teamwork and safety just as important."
good,"Management is very intimidated by any employee that has more education than they have. You become a threat the better you are at your job and if you give the other managers suggestions they become unfriendly. The hardest part was trying to bridge the departments together because in reality, we are all part of the same team."
good,"Nice company, great co-workers in the field. poor management for schedule and notification of hours for work each week, unable to plan week."
good,high levels of stress and no thanks from management. told you are being compensated so do your job or you will be replaced. benefits are above average.
good,was once a great place to work until we as salesmen were no longer able to control ordered. our job became covering for those higher up sneaking in product to stores.
good,This company is poorly ran but the incentives and bonuses were out of this world. Not a whole lot of job security since you are always at the mercy of the stores you manage. You get a company car and good pay but lose all hope with a personal life.
good,"Swing shifts... why???  A comparable place to work, but why swing shifts...?  And the politics of course."
good,Kellogg's is a great company with a rich history and great brands.  Due to a number of factors the company is currently going through some restructuring and consolidation.
good,I was a seasonal at kellogg. That took up your whole summer. Long hard days of manual labor. But it was worth it! The pay was unbelievable! Not bad for college kids starting off.
good,"One of those places people used to work at for 25-30 years because of the culture, pay, and security. This place was stellar when I started a few years ago, but the culture has been killed and management sees employees as a liability rather than an asset."
good,"It was part time, there was a lot of traveling, and no compensation for gas. They didn't have a schedule for me, they would call me every night at around 9:00-10:30 P.M the night before work, and I would have to be up at 6:00 A.M..."
good,The average work day often exceeds 14 hours. There is a strong need for developing management with team building skills. Management expectations are often unclear.
good,A lot of fire fighting and bandaids. No tailored pm program.
good,Managed a team of 15 full time and 15 part time employees. Key responsibilities were to disseminate information to and motivate Team to execute against corporate programs. Read and interpreted daily reports and worked in the field 2-3 days of the week. Coached team on overcoming objectives in difficult sales situations. Never a dull moment.
good,the food here is great i buy it myself out the grocery store.he job ok i love working in the logistics area but this is only temporary need something stable
good,"Great place to learn and develop."
good,"Typical work day starts at 6:30 at my first store. Usually work a delivery and backstock and then onto my next store to do the same thing. This is repeated upto 5 or 6 times a day depending on how busy of a day I have. I work alone for the most part only hearing from management or co-workers via phone or email messages. The hardest part of the job is being dependent on delivery trucks to get to the stores on time, if they don't then the day can get very long having to wait. The best part of the job is that there are no set schedules. When I finish with my work for the day I can leave and go hme to my family."
good,"Everything about this job was routine, I never really saw my manager only a few times a month,I didn't work with anyone,the hardest part of this job was not really having responsibility,I read most of the time."
good,"networking is encouraged... "
good,"workplace culture is diverse"
good,"The pay is great, but the hours and rotating shifts is deadly. The workers are messy and some areas are hard on your body. Stressful environment and jobs that are hard on your body."
good,"It pays well, has good benefits, expect to have no life outside of work. The hours that you are expected to work are very intrusive to life outside of work."
good,"Tiene prestaciones muy buenas y cultura extraordinaria, es ideal para desarrollar competencias y aprendizaje, ya que cuenta con tareas multidisciplinarias. Sin embargo, no existe equilibrio con la vida privada y cada vez es más común el hostigamiento laboral por parte de las jefaturas y no se llevan a cabo los lineamientos de la cultura empresarial; además, hay muy poca organización y comunicación entre departamentos."
good,"When you don't grow, you continually grasp at straws and reorganize every 6 months, which doesn't give any time to see if the prior restructure even works."
good,No advancement opportunities and low pay. It was a very repetitive and boring job. Every shift was terribly long and coming in to work was depressing and itcwas a depressing atmosphere. Would not recommended.
good,"Even with a bid in job title does not mean you'll be working that job. Your job assignment can be bumped by others with more seniority at anytime. Repetative and constant production process. Even though you hired to work, your not fully hired in with full benefits."
good,The people you work with are the best part of the role.  Kellogg is a very 'relationship' focused company.  You must get along well with everyone. Work life balance can be quite challenging.
good,"The pay is OK. A lot of overtime hours. I feel instead of working a lot of overtime hours. To have extra money. We should be paid more. The politics are always tricky. But over all, not a bad place to work."
good,Overall I enjoyed my career with Kellogg company. They cut are careers short when they laid off entire work force coast to coast. I met a lot of good people and built many bridges with my time spent with Kellogg company.
good,The management at the Cary plant were always a step behind and couldn't seem to get ahead of major detrimental issues. Employees would bring forward current issues that would eventually create either a tough environment to work in or a issue that would be extremely detrimental to the employees perceived competency. That leadership climate made it difficult for self-motivated individuals.
good,Job security is not a priority. One year ago the company laid off > 6000 employees nationally. Today the company is making more cut backs and more employees will be laid off.
good,Management was overbearing and results at all cost. Management was make budget at all costs - regardless of what the customer needed or wanted. Not a good situation
good,"Long work day, stressful conditions, Work life balance non-existent. Unrealistic expectations put on merchandisers. Sales goals unrealistic for market."
good,Lots of time will be spent away from your family to do a good job.  You may or may not be recognized for the job you do.  Team members often become friends.
good,"Depending upon the BU you work in, the hours can be very long. If you get under the right manager, they will help you with growing your skills and help you advance, however there are minimum opportunities for advancement unless you play along with the politics."
good,A typical day starts early. The management set very high sales goals. They had great incentives for meeting sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are never stuck in a office all day.
good,Kellogg's Snacks is no longer a job offered. The company went a different direction and decided to direct ship to grocery chains. It was a fast paced job with minimal supervision.
good,"Fast paced competitive atmosphere. "
good,Like another reviewer said the company needs stability. I worked there for 5 years and one day was told my position (along with the entire finance team at my plant) had been eliminated. A year later I see my job position posted for hire with a different title. When I was hired a CPA was preferred and now it's a high school diploma or GED. They've also made cuts left and right only to rehire under a different title and half the pay. I don't think it's ethical of a company to treat loyal hard working employees the way I've seen this company do. You think you have job security until the company needs to save a dime.
good,"I got to work alone and was responsible for my own success. The hardest part of the job was the stress the constant lifting had on my body. I feel management could have been better, I never knew my schedule until 7pm the night before I was supposed to work."
good,Its a job and you'll be able to pay bills. Lots of overtime  kinda hard to make plans during the week cause you sometimes wont know when your getting off.
good,"Been working for this company for 15 years. The pay is been wonderful the benefits of vacations very liberal. Unfortunately in my opinion due to some horrible management decisions, the delivery side of the company has failed its objectives. The result of this is 4000 people losing their job"
good,"Excellent management, and recognition was given regularly for a job well done. It was very fast paced and an ability to successfully multitask and work under pressure was imperative. Everyone worked together as a team, and I enjoyed the variety of people I had interactions with every day. The most difficult part of the job was when a situation that was out of my control caused me to not be able to fulfill a request or specific need of a customer. However, most of the time I was able to provide an acceptable alternative. There were no benefits for working as a merchandiser especially partime. Hours weren't that great as well most of the time."
good,The company has good benefits and the job can have some good days but demand for store delivery to make it on time can be stressful the best part no one bothers you when your on the road down side is start times and management not organized !
good,You stock shelves with merchandise. Great if you're going to school and need a part time job. You work in the store with all the other store associates that work there.
good,"too many hours and not enough help "
good,"Mostly self supervised, more aware of work procedures than supervisors.  Able to diagnose and correct problems that may sometimes occur. Worked  sometimes 12-16 hours as it was necessary for relief to appear for work before leaving job. The pay was good as were the benefits, however when the company decided to close the plant no consideration was given to employees  who were within 6 months of retiring in re bridging service. Management--with the exception of a few--were more concerned about themselves rather than the quality of product produced.  Management showed little concern for the well being  of the employees in the work place."
good,"Hours are varied and difficult and not suited for everybody  "
good,"Your daily routine would be to travel to your accounts,  on selected days you would stock your product on the shelves and or build displays. When you were done you would back stock the difference.  Make sure all product was signed and priced correctly and  communicate with the manager on a regular basis.  You also maintained your work space and kept it neat and in order. "
good,you will learn how to use the system in the warehouse and slowly start taking over with your knowledge using your leadership skills. working with your coworkers everyday to get the job done the best part about working here is you do your work without someone over your shoulder telling you what to do. At the end of the day they review your work and check what errors you made or how you can improve your work for the next day.
good,"As a contractor at Kellogg. It was a greaat skill bulding, good inenvironment to work. Working at Kelloggs as a contractor, there was was job security, or benefits."
good,As I worked my way up the ladder the money was not any better and it really tears the will to improve down over the long haul. With that said there is room for advancement until they shut down over 75% of its stores.  I can't imagine how hard it is to move up the ladder now.
good,"Work life balance poor, pay is excellent. Job advancement based on ""who you know"" not on merit or hard work. benefits OK. Again long hour with very little support or gratitude"
good,"the union sucks and isn't worth the money being paid ,office personal not a great value, quality personal not up to standards ,safety personal is a joke at the eggo  plant supervisor have no say they just do and have more things being placed on them that no on  else wants to do"
good,"Understaffed, lack of proper communication, but the resolve to make it work for the client....Keeps me wanting to come back time after time..."
good,"This is not a place to work if you want to improve the skills you have or obtain new skills. It can be a very frustrating place to work if you take pride in your work and have a desire to make improvements.  The company continues to reduce the number of employees which has and will continue to increase the burden on each employee through more work days and more hours.  They company also believes that the employees are overpaid and their benefits are excessive. Don't expect to come here and see an increase in your compensation, if fact, expect a decrease and you won't be disappointed."
good,"There is 6 different work schedules,I learned PPE,SOP,GMP.HACCP. Management was okay, worked good with coworkers"
good,Great place to learn what you can and move on. You can gain a lot of valuable skills and experiences for you continued career other places.
good,"Uma excelente empresa de se trabalhar, muito família, trabalho em equipe, e obtive bons aprendizados para meu crescimento profissional."
good,Starting early mornings to provide services to numerous stores. I learned how to communicate and build relationships with management. The most rewarding part of this job is the satisfaction you get after leaving a store looking better than how it was when you got there.
good,The company was transitioning leaders across the company.  Lots of opportunities to bring in new ideas.
good,High level of stress and the moral was very sad. The management is very inexperience.
good,A lot of freedom in position but you are essentially on call 24/7
good,"When I started, the job was not bad at all. Good people to work for, company car, gas card, company phone, good benefits. I did have to work in several places but the company car took care of that."
good,"I enjoyed the actual job, but the fluxuation between 15 hrs a week to 40 hrs a week and having to drive my own vehicle without payment for gas was too much. Driving 300 miles a day for the amount i was making wasn't worth the job."
good,My co-workers we all work together as one to get the job done as quickly as possible.
good,A solid Company to work for. great potential for advancement
good,"The schedule could be 4 hour or 16 hours with no notice on over time. I was called on many Tues. not to work at all. The overtime was great, we were paid overtime over 8 hours per day. The company volume is very up and down, we found out on Friday night if we had to work Saturday. The schedule made it impossible to plan anything except for on Sunday's. I was very excited to work for such a lareg well estabilished company and would have continued to do so but their volume slowed down making them not need me."
good,"work was 7am til whenever. Management was not so good, few times telling my how I should deal with my personal life.  People I worked with were ok, just didn't seem to care what time we got the job done.  hardest part of the job was the hours.  We worked 15-17hrs a day cause we didn't have the room or manpower to to the amount of work.   Not much enjoyment when you only get 3-4 hours of sleep a night."
good,I like the job that I do but there are areas of production I just do not enjoy doing at all.
good,Included in the work with is alot of traveling and and miles on your own personal car.The pay is low considering the high expectation of making budets and getting large work loads done. The best thing is you get to work independently and not get stuck behind a desk all day.
good,"Did a lot of traveling. Learned a lot about windows and doors. Management was fine, and so were co workers. Some of the jobs were pretty big for one person. Meeting new people."
good,Kellogg's is a stable company to work for. After learning the unique processes; learning the culture was the hardest part of the job. Management direction swings from week to week; but is definitely driven from a corporate level. Keep up with the changes is the most challenging aspect of the job.
good,"You have to complete orders in a timely fashion"
good,My experience with Kellogg’s was good. It was a warehouse position and taught me all the basics for warehousing. This job was a great entry level position.
good,"Great pay, very fair with the pay rate, great environment. The employees are very helpful and patient. Very strict on hand washing, proper ppe equipment"
good,"Se me contrató bajo términos específicos que resultaron ser expectativas más altas."
good,Sorry but this is the truth. Started out great job then managers no longer cared and team leaders think they run you and can control you and walk all over you and that doesn’t fit well with me.
good,Good People. Business is trying to reinvent itself to address structural changes in the market. A typical day is busy and challenging. There have been several rounds of restructuring and job losses that have impacted moral.
good,Company still does some good but not quite sure what the end goal is for the transitions taking place.  Opportunities for advancement keep shrinking with every round of job cuts.  Everybody is too busy putting out fires or fixing issues to take advantage of all the work life balance benefits like summer hours and time off.  Always constantly working.  No opportunities to make time to shadow or work with for employee growth.
good,A great place to work if you enjoy earning money. Problem is you will never see your family. From March to December you will work 7 days per week. If you don't mind working daily you will love it.
good,"If you love to work, then this is a great place for it. Overtime is a requirement. Pay is very good. Hardest part is making plans for personal life. Schedule is not very flexible."
good,"I learnt how to truly be a team player, when i first joined there i was always working alone. "
good,"No opportunity to advance. Most jobs posted, the hiring manager already has a candidate for the position. Too many changes. No clear information about bonus structure. Held accountable for metrics still based on previous job duties."
good,"Worked in the plant for 8 years. My yearly evaluation was always high until my final year with the company. With no changes in my work ethic or personal performance, my evaluation was set at near failure. This was not backed by any solid deliverable data. It was my demise as I was trying to advance in the company. "
good,"Though I really have nothing bad to say about the company itself, my experience with Kellogg Snacks could have been different if my immediate supervisors didn't continuously change. Like many food merchandising positions you will have to share your stores with other representatives who may or may not do a better job than you, often resulting in store management complaining to you if a job hadn't been done right by someone else. The expectations of keeping your stores happy fall onto your shoulders regardless of PT/FT status. As for the work, you could be working anywhere from 1-2 stores in a single day or as many as 5-6 as requested, during holidays multiple trips to the same stores."
good,"I worked for Kelloggs for over 12 years and I enjoyed working there and learned quickly and adapted to change, was a team player, and enjoyed new challenges with the company."
good,"always taking every year keeps getting worse and worse, job pays great . long hours and lots of time off work, insurance, dental ,vision 401 k match to certain percent!!!"
good,"Pre trip inspect truck and trailer at 3am."
good,"A very independent job, you have to be self motivated. Communication between Kellogg and retail partners can use improvement. Job requires a thick skinned individual with great communication skills. Sometimes Kellogg objectives were impossible to meet at store level."
good,"usually start by seven am, had assigned stores to go to "
good,Too much drama between the union and the management staff. The training conducted by union representatives included how to milk the clock and lie to your supervisor. Also we were shown the best places to hide when not busy.
good,Kellogg has great pay and benefits.  The culture has changed a lot in a negative way.  No enthusiasm for growth potential and the employee moral is lackluster most days.  Change is not swift and communicated well.
good,Kellogg's is shutting down all the DSD operations and will no longer be in the distribution game.  The Distribution Centers are closing as of August 31st.
good,"Some days can be long. If you have a good merchandising team, the job will be a lot easier. If not, you will have to merchandise a lot of products and fix other peoples messes."
good,"Kellogg has a great heritage and great brands. The legacy culture drove a motivating and collaborative work environment that drove business results. That said, recent cosy cutting and Sr. Management from outside have eroded the culture and driven a Kraft-like highly political and backbiting environment."
good,You work a rotating twelve hour shift. Shifts are from 7am to 7 pm. I learned a lot about trouble shooting and problem solving at this job. There is a good work place culture and they value teamwork highly. I found the most enjoyable part of the job to be the trouble shooting and problem solving required for starting up a new operating line.
good,"Down sized, they eliminated merchandisers."
good,"Struggling to make European structure work and now reducing costs to improve quarterly results"
good,"Don't really like the scheduling process. I still haven't received one ""data usage"" check.. and everytime I ask about it, I just get told "" they're working on a date so that the always come out on the same day."" Just run around after run around"
good,"Ideal for someone looking for lots of hours and hard work, with good compensation for it.  Poor workplace for the family/free time oriented, because hours are completely unpredictable and it is impossible to make and keep plans.  Is poorly organized/has poor communication.  You feel left out on your own, but plus side to that is no annoying coworkers - you really only communicate with the scheduler and the sales rep. Advancement opportunities are available only if you are willing to travel and/or relocate."
good,"Really impressed with Kellogg when I started but sales, morale and competence level have been dropping for years. Decreasing cereal sales and market  pressure have led to a series of increasingly desperate actions to cut costs.  They no longer want to hire the best people only the cheapest.  This has led to considerable staff cuts replacing them with overseas outsourcing and providing dirt parachutes for impacted employees."
good,"Worked there three and a half years mostly as a part time merchandiser then went full time I lasted three months as a full time employee they think they own you. They will tell you what you want to hear then do what they want."
good,le falta mucha organicacion y no habia trabajo en equipo y no trabajamos directos para la compañia  era una distribuidora.
good,Enjoy working alone and traveling to different locations. The flexibility allowed me to be able to go to school to continue my education. Management and supervisors are very supportive.
good,A typical day at Kellogg's starts early and is fast paced and can last up to 10-12 hours.  I have learned how to put together sales plans and make sales presentations.  Management oppurtunities are there for those with the right skill set and those willing to put in the time needed.  While you work individually your are part of a close knit team who are only a phone call away if you have questions.  The hardest part of the job would dealing with customer complaints and trying to work with different teams within Kellogg's.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of reaching the sometimes lofty sales goals set by the company.
good,"A typical day at Kellogg's is fast paced and energetic. I learned how to palletize. some management was very helpful and understanding. My former co-workers were the best. the hardest part of the job was having a family to support and getting sent home soon as your arrive to work due to lines and machines not working. Another hard part of the job was switching to 12hr shifts still trying to maintain a family life and keep your body in good health because of the long hours of standing. The most enjoyable part of going to work at Kellogg's was seeing my co-workers everyday, working and meeting our quality goals. It gave a sense of accomplishment."
good,"Accountability is a priority"
good,"Eight to 12 hour work day, Six to Seven day a week. Requires heavy lifting and a great deal of focus. Always kept up to date through OSHA and Food Safety training. Must have good housekeeping skills, knowledge of food contamination practices, record keeping and Good Manufacturing Practices. Positive people to work with and a ""Can Do"" culture. Consistency and attention to detail is a must."
good,I began my day at 7 pm and ended it at 7 am. Thee hours were long. Sometimes you did not get a day off for two weeks. They did take volunteers before mandatory drafting. Management was always changing but the plant manager was exceptional. My close co- workers were very helpful and worked as a team. The hardest part of this job was the work schedule. You did not have a lot of home time.
good,no quality of work life                                                                                                                     .                                                                                                                  .                                                                                                            .                                                                                                             .                                                                                                         .Many Temp workers.  production operators keep changing.
good,Kellogg is a good company to work for. This believes company in promoting from with-in.
good,12 hour rotating shifts. Knowlege in HACCP and GMP's is a must.
good,"Es una empresa que ve mucho por la vida familiar, en sus beneficios adiciones al sueldo."
good,Everything depends on your route manager they are the ones who can make your life easy or hard.
good,My  daily job required me to inventory product when it was delivered to the store.  Put all products on the shelves and rotated all product.  And speak with managers of every store to be sure all displays were set up where they wanted them and to see if they needed any product or wanted to send any product back to the Kellogg's co.
good,Continuous and constant cutbacks and changes have made working for this company very difficult. You are at a disadvantage with competition with labor and pricing making their expectations unachievable. High expectations by management and customers make any relaxation time almost impossible. Disorganized management is always changing and shifting priorities. They are reactionary and do not proactively plan their business. Kellogg Company expects you to work miracles with very little support. Their culture of management is very dictatorial with very little opportunity to have meaningful two way conversation to improve company performance or deal with issues.
good,"Research short paid checks to valid deductions. Work with Sale Team, Business Planning Team and Customers to keep the books current and correct. Send out repay letters for invalid deductions. Apply the valid deductions after validating against promotion date, rate. and product. "
good,I was clear on what my job consisted of and it was routine. Nice environment.
good,No day is the same.  Sales challenges and need to be flexible in each situation.  Deal with various levels of organization and handle selling at every level.
good,"I had to deal with some of the most narrow minded people understanding was zero,"
good,Kellogg has great benefits but still trying to find its way concerning their sanitation program.
good,"A typical day started with a start of shift safety meeting. Supervisors would then give you your job assignments. You then go out on the floor to get your pass on from the previous operator, and begin your job duties. I enjoyed working at Kellogg's, it gave me an opportunity to excel through hard work and become a valued operator.  I enjoyed the challenge of taking a packing line that wasn't running the shift before and fixing the problems in order to meet the requirements."
good,Good environment to work at. Always have enough hours and don't have to worry about not getting a full 40. Clean environment and would recommend to any one who needs a job.
good,The culture and people are positive.  The work days can be long and the expectations can often change due to innovation or re-structuring.  Overall it was a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my 10 years at Kellogg.  I had some very good senior management, and some very NOT good.  Too many changes in management structure.  I learned new IT skills when I sought out new positions.  Very good work-at-home policy."
good,I enjoyed working there.  Plant managers and employees are easy to get along with.  The company has a family oriented work environment and plan yearly picnics so that everyone get to know one another on a personal level.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy amigable, con mucho sentido de colaboración, no solo en la oficina local, sino con el resto de la corporación."
good,"From family, caring to ""watching your back"" culture shift.  Larger span of control, as layers have been removed with recent reorganizations.  Midwest location offers many benefits in lower cost of living and good work/life balance."
good,"Overall Good Place to work.Great Employees- Sr. Management changes frequently, therefore it is next to impossible to execute against any plans that have been created. "
good,"I worked at Kellogg for many years.  During that time, the business environment changed, putting a lot more pressure on the finance department."
good,"Its a great heritage company, great pay and increases annually. The work is great and meaningful. However, the ""who you know"" culture is very strong and its unfortunate. There have been multiple layoffs and restructurings in the last few years leaving us to question whether or not the company will be around another 100 years."
good,"Lots of backstabbing to get ahead. High school attitude environment. "
good,I am a former employee and don't have anything bad to say about the business and the way it conducts. If I could take my position back around this time I would.
good,"Very similar to other big CPG food companies. Was great 5yrs ago, but after ZBB culture has really eroded driving by multiple rounds of restructuring and downsizing. Kellogg's has great ambition, but is not willing to play to win, rather operates in a reactive nature and lags the competition."
good,The work was fine and not too hard. It was fast moving and definitely kept you busy. I was there for 9 months and never worked a full week on the same shift. Worked plenty of double shifts and work schedule changed almost daily so you had no ability to make doctor/dentist appointments.
good,"I love working for this Company, excellent benefits and compensation. Does require long hours, long days, can be stressful I dedicated myself 200% everyday to help ensure I succeeded for this Company."
good,I only worked there as a temporary employee over the summer.  Came in on the tail end of department being transferred over seas.  They were also moving that department to another city which made   most of the affected employees have to make a decision.
good,I ended up leaving Kellogg because they had me working 96 hours a week and it got to be to much. I asked for time off 4 months a head of time and it still was not approved
good,"Very independent work that allows for being able to get projects and the job done on your own.  Some sales goals were not achievable, however, and therefore significantly lowered take-home pay."
good,Get ready to do college paperwork to advance in pay .  Highly stressful work place. The swing shifts you never get use to. As far as getting help from the senior employees you can forget about that especially on the north end I never worked on the south so I can't speak for them.
good,Moving from line to line not get trained long enough to get qualified at a position. People are nice some are not all lot of profanity on the work floor.
good,Would not suggest employment at this time. The company had major changes in 4 of the last 5 years. Over 3000 people lost their jobs in 2017 and another 100 plus this year. Not loyal to long time employees
good,"good benefits and flexible hours, but unfortunately not enough job security. Laid off after working for the company for 15 years. Was offered okay package."
good,Place was very stressful long hours through out the hours of night to mornings. Can't sit down constantly standing in one spot cant move around.  Very loud environment as well
good,Good company to work for. If you have a hard work ethic you have potential to make a great income. Leadership is not always as available as they should be.
good,"Managed several employees which were great to work with and for."
good,"i do not recommend the vender role for everybody it is a very demanding role. alot of driving, early hours and lots of lifting. it was a very physically stressfull job."
good,"Everyday starts of with a new challenge for improving the overall performance of the production plant. "
good,"Overall I think it is a decent place to work, but the pay should've been much better for the amount of work that was required. The people I worked with, and for were really nice."
good,"A company struggling like many in the CPG industry. Kellogg's continual reorgaization and struggle for prifit, makes a difficult culture and stability."
good,Good employers. I enjoyed 27 years of employment. Company car and good benefits. Excellent products to sell. I was based in a great place to live. Developed great working relationships with my customers.
good,"Colleagues are the best part of working at Kellogg, however the company is continually losing the its once most valuable asset: a culture of having a ""soul""."
good,"New people beware, the employees with more time will treat you like your less than human, alot of racism, not very diverse. N o advance notice of another 8 hours forced overtime! Old timers are lazy ,rude and take advantage of the breaks"
good,"You would have to work long days, dealing with numerous customers(Store Management). You chose when to start your day, but the later you start, the later you finished. The pay wasn't too bad, but if you had a weak territory, making bonuses sometimes was tough. The scheduling of merchandisers was also a weak point. The merchandising side looked out for themselves and left the sales representatives to pick up after lazy merchandisers."
good,Working at Kellogg was an enjoyable experience. A very fast paced work environment making sure all products were properly packaged and sealed for distribution.
good,"good job while it lasted.  product went into all warehouses and they laid off all the reps.  treated us well at severance with payments, car, and cell phone.  fast paced and went to six to ten stores a day."
good,"Learned the importance of ime management"
good,"Kellogg was a very good job for most of my employment, but I, along with many other workers, were left without a job when it was decided to close the portion of the company to which we belonged. If it had not been for that, I would highly recommend the company."
good,"I'm not reviewing  this company, I worked for a staffing agency in packing and didn't work directly within the kelloggs people. I enjoyed my job but didn't know any actual Kellogg people"
good,Fast paced stocking and maintaining of the stores you are in charge of. Have to be able to adapt to change each week is something new. Have to be creative sometimes as well.
good,"packing and receiving product, making sure the quality of the the product in not damage and to insure the the packing in properly done, warehouse packing directly to the trucks"
good,"Decent place to start your career out of college. However, when demand is low Kellogg is quick to reduce headcount to save dollars. Kellogg does very little to show that they value their people, however they pay very well. The hardest part of the job is the shifting priorities. Downtime is less important than scrap and waste. The most enjoyable part is the relaxed environment, jeans and t-shirts to work, and the little bit of freedom to make decisions based on risk/reward."
good,i didn't care for it. it wasn't fun and i didn't enjoy going to work. plus they have already fired all inventory stockers. i would not do this job again.
good,Good place to work diverse and fun.  Good life/work balance. great benefits.  I did not like Battle Creek but there are other locations around to world.....
good,"If you like to drive, and stay busy all day becoming a sales rep. or merchandiser for this company is the way to go. They are a good company but they, like most other companies, focus almost completely on increasing sales and making more money."
good,The expectations outweigh the resources.  That in itself makes each day a challenge.  Kellogg's executive management has a very real disconnect from lower management and workers.
good,easy to get the hang of everything but they move so fast . i get my full 8 hours and they never forgot to pay me. i didnt get to advance or move up in the job there because it was through a temp agency
good,"Its an ok place to work. The HR team and other employees are great. Management needs some more training, and also needs to learn how to communicate changes and expectations with employees better."
good,Good pay with good benefits awesome culture and learned a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different personalities and being able to help each one.
good,"Company great but closing my division June 1, 2017,  They are switching to a full warehouse system, eliminating manager, reps and driver.  I would have loved to see career grow here."
good,"El ambiente de esta empresa es muy dinámico, donde te enseñan muchos temas respecto de la adecuada alimentación que debemos tener"
good,"Good place to work with great pay and benefits, however the culture there is the worst. this is typically what you get when working as an union employee."
good,Bad decisions and moves by upper Management is causing the plant to be closed in February 2017. HR was not good. Went through a lot of Plant Managers
good,"Outstanding experience and career history in customer service."
good,"Its usually cool, but some stores are horrible, you may run into workers that doesn't like vendors some they take there attitude out on you. You will learn how to rotate, stock and maintain the product. Your managers give horrible instructions that are never clear. When you try to contact them they never answer. The hardest part of the job is when your trying to complete the job but you need to speak with your manager but they don't answer, so you can finish up."
good,Everyday is different and trying to get a manager in my area to call you back our email sometimes is crazy but the sales reps normally pick up on the first ring which is nice for info needed.
good,go to each store and fill shelves fix your products in each ailse set displays and make sure to sign in and talk to grocey manger and the reciver every store is different
good,"Extremely passionate and committed to role of Retail Sales Mgr.  Responsible for managing territory that generated $3 million in sales"
good,"I worked college summer help for vacationing regular help for two summers before the program was axed in 1994.  I really cannot comment on any thing else, since it has been 20+ years since I worked there."
good,"You are your own boss every day, after you know your schedule.  It takes time and logical thinking as well as building strength and an easy relationship with each store management team.  You are expected to unload pallets, fill shelves and all displays throughout each store in as little time possible."
good,"Good benefits, but company lost on How to do thing, Dont promote within, and company cars where terrible, Kelloggs should get out of snacks if they dont know how to run them"
good,"I learned a lot about myself in this position and definitely learned to manage stress. You are expected to do a lot with the few variable labor hours (merchandising support). However, there is a new model that will be effective April 2016 that will completely separate merchandising and sales which will relieve the sales rep quite a bit...from my understanding. New technology will also relieve some of the issues with this position- making the ordering more acurate and reduce time spent in each store. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all the scheduled stores worked each day. As previously mentioned, variable labor hours are low which requires the sales rep to do a lot of merchandising. This results in less time selling to the store personnel. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with multiple people and not be confined to an office. You are always on the go, which I like. Makes the day fly by- sometimes when you don't want it to."
good,"a hard working day, co-workers are ok, the most enjoyable part of the job is handballing and then going home when you finished"
good,I loaded and unloaded materials on a daily. I assisted my fellow co-workers with their tasks. I kept a clean free environment.
good,"The pay is good but you work a lot of hours. My co-workers are easy to get along with and enjoyable to work with."
good,I enjoy the sales Reps but some of the other parts of the company are not very  in tune to what is going on and are very bad a returning emails unless it pertains to them.

good,Great company to work for to have opertunity of advancement. Kelloggs has a good working enviorment Saftey and Food safety is a proritiy.
good,Fun work place where I usually work alone in most of the stores. Even though i work alone the management team is helpful if i ever have any questions.
good,"Supporting multiple cookie processing lines, from distribution og raw products pneumatically, then mixing, baking, packaging then conveying to shipping. Trouble shooting and repairing a wide variety of problems."
good,"I interned at Kellogg's for 7 months during my senior year of college. Although I was there for more than half a year, I'm fairly positive I could have completed all of my projects within a month."
good,"Hard working people who have great camaraderie. They are trying to be sensitive to the work/home life time, but sometimes get that wrong as many people work long hours.  There is much favoritism among leadership."
good,"*  Experience will be different based on location worked"
good,"Working with Kellogg, I've learned how rewarding a diverse workplace can be. I work with a variety of people but we are all alike in that we all have common goals for the company. I enjoy the different interactions I have each day with both colleagues and the various accounts I work for."
good,Assembly line work handling food product and mixing ingredients of vegetarian food. Learned how to feed off each others work. Management made sure the product was safe and clean. Very helpful co-workers as in making sure you did not fail. Standing for long hours in one spot was basically the hardest part of the job. Needing hours and was given to when in need.
good,"a typical day at work is waiting for protein bars to come down the line so you could hand pack them your standing on your feet the whole time."

good,"Review based on a a stint that was more than eight years ago."
good,"I started at 12.50 and get a 30 cent raise every year. Go to stores, put product on shelves, put back stock away neatly and off to the next store. ZERO mileage paid which makes this job not great, just ok. My bosses are pretty nice. Im part time and average 20 hours a week."
good,"•	Manage CPM (OffShore Team in Spain) for PIM Data Maintance."
good,"I organized and maintained a weekly project schedule working as a territory manager selling to big box and grocery stores.

good,Great Company but not very good pay with having to use your own vehicle and gas

good,"My day starts at 6-6:30am Monday through Friday and typically ends around 5pm, sometimes 6pm. It is a very physically demanding job that requires a lot more than I expected. On some days I will have to write four orders for my stores and do two deliveries. Days like this leave me exhausted.  I mainly interact with grocery managers all day and I'll communicate with my actually coworkers as needed. Management is usually available when called upon and is very helpful. I enjoy meeting and talking with new people on a daily basis."
good,"Nice place to work, great benefits, but like all jobs, the stress can get to you if you don't stay on top of it."
good,It was a easy job stay busy which I like. I learned alot of differents things down to running machines to basic things .
good,A day at work involved receiving and shipping materials through out the theatre in Iraq to all sites within Iraq. I learned to work under very stressful conditions. The management was a revolving door as it was contract work but was very structures. I enjoyed working with my coworkers they kept things interesting and did and excellent job. The hardest part was being overseas as with the work there was all ways the logistical part that was very difficult because a lot of items would come in damaged and incorrect. The most enjoyable part was when what we needed came in and we were able to support our troops.
good,I have very few machines to monitor and no responsibilities while production is running

good,The company saw I was a hard worker after just starting.They noticed I did not have a high school diploma.They worked with me to give me the time and opportunity to get my GED.It was a blessing! I also had some illness in the family they were willing to work with me.A good paying job was just a bonus.
good,This company takes the time to teach you the right way.
good,"kelloggs was a great place to work when it was keebler because they cared about there employees, not just a number like kelloggs"
good,Working 12 hour shifts sometimes warehouse environment night shift
good,was placed by temp service. was looking fowareed to going. back did like company. location was good for me. the job was easy. freindly envoirnent to work in.
good,"I've learned to be a sales person, but not because I had the necessary training from my manager. I enjoy my co-workers, although I almost never work with any of them. The hardest part of my job is trying to please the company I work for while still taking care of the customers I service. I enjoy being out on my own during the day to just get my job done and go home."
good,"I have gained a lot of expeience with customer service, administrative, leadership, team work and learning the in's and out's of the company."
good,There was some down time when I worked in the K tron room. If you feel the need to stay busy all the time that job might you might find boring.

good,"Great company, but management is poor and people only seem to look out for their friends. Getting in was not a problem but moving up is definitely a problem because people only seem to lookout for themselves. Hard work does not translate into promotion at this location."
good,great company to work for sad that here were job cuts. hope i get called back to work. hardest part of the job was being away from my family. loved the atmosphere.
good,Overall a decent company to work for. I feel like I had advancement opportunities if you're willing to relocate. Firmly-grounded company. Would go back there if conditions were right.
good,Kellogg's was a fine place to work.  The location I was at was a union facility and there was some tension between hourly and management employees.  Some of the management team made that worse.  The company did not spend a lot of time developing their people and there was not a lot of room for advancement from within.
good,"Great company to work for but it depends who you are working with meaning who is your manager.  Not all managers are leaders.."
good,The plant closed down. It was a good company to work for. They had good benefits and a clean environment to work in. All associates got along well with each other. Every year at christmas they would host a company party
good,Constant Management Turnover makes it difficult for new managers to establish continuity or establish ongoing processes upon which to improve.  Managerial positions very stressful.  Very nice facility in which to work.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, capacitaciones constantes,"
good,Doesn't really matter.  They closed up shop and left town.  It was a great job until they up and left.  Would have been nice to have a little more than a month warning though.
good,Was a good company until they shut us DOWN! Poor upper management.  They are just trying to save a buck at thousands of employees expense.  Not a cool move Kelloggs.
good,"Your review is based solely on your performance compared to your unreasonable budget regardless of what anyone with the company says. Basically, if you don't hit your budget, you're not doing your job."
good,"working at Kellogg was a challenge because you never no where you going to work at that day,learn to be prepare to work in any department.management was to relax  the workplace was okay.the hardest part of the job was adjusted to department temperature one might be 85 degree and one might be 50 degree.i love the pay."
good,great place to work if you don't have responsibities benefits are great and the pay is wonderful worked 7 days a week you get forced to work every weekend
good,I was a sales merchandiser but the company decided to eliminate the sales reps and merchandisers and deliver through store warehouses as opposed to our own trucks.
good,"Immediate manager and coworkers are fantastic but upper management were bullies."
good,"In the 8 years that I have worked for Kelloggs, they have had 6 major restructures which resulted in major layoffs company wide  "
good,Over a good place to work. Very fast paced and stressful environment but compensation is good. Job stability is an issue.  Pay and job assignments change constantly.
good,At first it was a great job. Fun people to work with hours were ok. Then changes started to happen and things went down hill. So much down hill that the division I worked in no longer there.
good,Usually slow to react company. Learned a lot about selling and navigating corporate culture. Management was constantly changing and moving the target. Hardest part of the job was managing to complete weekly displays with specified merchandisers. Most enjoyable part was the flexible schedule.
good,"This was a very good job for about two years, the company then decided to stop its DSD operation causing me to loss a very good career that I had begun."
good,"drive loaded truck with 10-12 deliveries a day to stores and deliver product,  check vehicle go out of town once a week to either montana or st.george.hours are from 3 am to when finished.used electronic log system for deliveries and hours worked"
good,Working at Kellogg I have learned creative ways to increase sales and develop strong customer relationships. I enjoy this career because of the flexibility it provides.
good,A typical day was very demanding with the number of projects that needed to be completed.  Overtime was very common and working lunches are even more common. It was a very friendly atmosphere and team support is very strong.
good,"Move from store to store daily"
good,When I first started thought it was a good place to work but once you set your foot in the company and work and see how it is for yourself you will change your mind some lines work 7 days a week 12hr shifts and there point system is ridiculous that's the problem here in Kellogg's they lose a lot of employees due to the point system and some people have bad attitudes don't wanna work together and work against you and some supervisors instead of fixing g the machines they just keep running it with all the production on the floor stressful some days
good,The team was very passionate about the business and achieving the goal set forth for them. I is unfortunate that the dsd portion of the business is closing.
good,"In my point of view i think the workers could be more productive with more breaks specially for the older people working on the assembly line, allowance to drink water when needed as long as it doesn't slow down yours or others workers production. also management could be a little more down to earth letting people work and communicating as adults when a problem comes up rather than making them feel like slaves.but over all the checks looked good so i enjoyed my time there"
good,Kellogg's is  a good company to work for you if you can be a self starter and figure things out by yourself. Pay is good. Culture is nice and you are able to balance work and family.
good,"They want more from ya but don't wanna pay ya for it"
good,"Was able to advance rather quickly, went from operator to Team Lead in just over a year.  Diverse work force, most relatively respectful, helpful, and nice.  Would recommend as a good place to start in Manufacturing."
good,"money is good, hours are long, get paid very well for over time. Senior management is lacking in leadership skills.  Have a lot of turn around on employees and salary staff.  Have been short on supervisors for at least 2 years."
good,If you are mechanically inclined this may be the job for you. You may not get breaks if you are working in the cracker department. You don't get off at your designated time unless the next person to come on the shift is there to relive you.
good,Trabajar con equipos de otros países y llevar proyectos a nivel regional y nacional es una parte muy enriquecedora de la vida laboral. Interactuas con equipos de otras áreas y siempre se aprende de cada proyecto. Lo que me gusto fue que en mi rol pude aprender procesos de otras áreas y hacer crecer mi conocmiento en mi área.
good,"You'll be leaving your house around 530 am, get to your 1st stop about 600 am, work the store---fill shelves and displays with backstock, Walmart's are your #1 priority, Publix #2.  You review your orders with store management and place your order on your handheld--Publix's orders go through their computer system.  ROTATE product, check out of codes, write up credits.  Your co-workers are too busy to help you, unless you have an Austin Francais (like I did).  Hardest part is IF you have a MICROmanager, like I unfortunately did, if you don't--smooth sailing, just make your numbers.  Most enjoyable part, the friendships that you make with store personnel and your weekly checks are pretty nice.  "
good,Overall a good place to work with good benefits. Great work life balance. It has been a good place to start my career and learn about the supply chain.
good,"I currently work on Recognition Programs within Kellogg's to recognize Employees for years of service, K Values & any other recognition piece.  I work on policies & procedures (i.e.  vacation, tuition remimbursement, bring your child to work day, flex scheduleing).  I have learned a lot in my time at Kellogg's and have developed many good relationships.  I have a good relationship with my co-workers as well.  The hardest part of the job is deadlines, but I never let that get me down because I thrive to hit goals and deadlines and work well under pressure.  I enjoy working with people the most."
good,"es una gran compañía, super dinámica y que siempre esta en la búsqueda de satisfacer a su mayor target  de clientes que son los niños."
good,"If you don't mind working 7 days a week, sometimes 12 hours a day without a break in sight, then this is the place for you!  Minus the endless hours and never seeing your family, the pay is great as are the benefits."
good,Rotating product and setting up displays while communicating with store management to get product placement.
good,"production plant where everyone takes their job serious"
good,"work hard on big brands, great agency partners, very little diversity leadership, but the people are friendly"
good,"Do not take this job, if offered on a part time basis. You can be guarnteed intervas little as 6 hours a week. You can be working steady hours and if a full time employee needs hours to reach their minimum hours they will take your hours from you. They leave out this detail at interviewing and hiring. Ive been part time and work whenever they call me for almost 3 years still no fulltime employment in site. Good company if you are hired fulltime, if you are hired partime you will need another job definitely...."
good,"my typical day at work was an early start every day and getting stuck in and keeping my head with my work. i learnt alot from this job like cleaning methods i didnt know before, all my co-workers were brilliant. the hardest part of my job was the early mornings. the most enjoyable part of my job was all round work and getting along with my co-workers"

good,"While the benefits are top quality, there is no time to enjoy down time with your family, as overtime is mandatory. You will work an average of 80 hours a week. I stayed tired and stressed out."
good,The most difficult part of my job is being able to manage/coordinate a number of tasks and people at once. Can be a very busy and stressful environment if you are not organized and prepared everyday. There are a lot of good people to work around and everyone generally cares about accomplishing the daily goals safely.
good,"A very unusual company to work for in respect of the importance of training and development of staff.  They are way behind a lot of companies who put training at the forefront of their business and understand the importance. The hardest part of my job was understanding their organisational design.  It was very outdated and had no structure, which meant it was difficult to find anyone that was new.  The work place culture was great as it was a very agile way of working.  This meant you could pick and choose days to be in the office and when to work from home.  It was the people within my team that made the job enjoyable.  "
good,Kellogg has great work life programs and is working on their overall diversity.  The company does not always fair well with communication across departments.
good,"The company was a good place to work. You were able to achieve your objectives in your own way. Allowed a lot of time  for me to develop customer relationships. Good pay with Health, 401K, and company car.,"
good,they are an ok company to work for... great pay. management is terrible. the hours are great especially if you have children. the ability to move up is limited
good,"Large territory requires extensive drive time (no overnights) which makes it difficult to have energy for family time at home"
good,"A company of amazing people.  It's this, that's kept me at my job for the past 5 years.  "
good,"I think it's a good place for growth of opportunity,they have a union but I don't think they really fight for the workers,a some underhanded favoritism go's to certin people especially if you're a nice looking female,and the place is 80 percent women,so it's a lot of hate in the air between the males,not all but enought,and I loss my good paying job there and the union say they couldn't help,after all the years I worked there,I was going threw some hard times and two jobs so I pointed out,dealing with death in the family and overloading the two jobs,but some people have done far more worst things,and got thier job back,so that's that favoritism at it finest"
good,"While fast paced, there is a lot to learn in a low stress environment.  Co-workers are helpful and managment defines expectations well."
good,"Kelloggs Brand has a great line of nutritional products but the work/life balance they preach is all just words. Most enjoyable part of the day was going to bed. The rest of the day was dealing with problems, filling out forms and developing multiple plans to deal with the inevitable problems that management creates for the following day."
good,"Working as a merchandiser for Kellogg's has it's ups and downs. As a merch for this company you do have a lot of freedom during the typical work day;but be prepared to do a lot of lifting. The worst part about the job is the scheduling. They schedule on a daily basis, not weekly! You will probably see your co-workers/manager once or twice every 6 months. The job is tiring but not too difficult, but there isn't much social interaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is driving between stores, or listening to your ipod while working a load/backstock."
good,"•	Work with executive and senior leaders to create and maintain an operating plan to achieve the strategic vision for an Application Lifecycle Management tool portfolio that defines the people, processes, tools, and technology."
good,"Responsible for selling and merchandising products to a specifically assigned store account base. Building special displays to increase sales volume."
good,"keeping machines running, quality checks, and minor trouble shooting if needed."
good,"There are, as like most companies, pros and cons.  Most people are pleasant to work with.  Some managers are not the best at managing.  Some people should not be working there.  Some people should have left long ago looking for better jobs as they are over qualified for what they are doing."
good,"Going over sales representatives notes for what is expected of me for that week.  Ordering of product for all stores, working with merchandiser's, working with store managers regarding future sales, floor displays, orders, etc., working loads to sales floor, solving problems, writing credits and anything else that is needed by store manager's."
good,"The first thing I do in the morning is to make sure I check the phone for any call-out to be recorded. Within the next half an hour I have a pass on meeting, which information is passed on from the previous shift. I then call the quardshack to make if I have any temporary employees coming in. If so, I asked if they all have came in, I then wait for them to come in the building to insure, that they know where they are going. "
good,"Great people and pleasure of a good days work. Gathering ppe, get assignment, documents needed and start work. Expect anything and be prepared and ready to work. Great people, everyone lends a helping to each other. The heat in summer and cold in winter was trying. Solving difficult problems are very satisfying."
good,"Merchandised product, to stay busy, management not very helpful,good people to work with,nothing,felling good about job I did for the territory managers."
good,"Nice company, but Management is never truthful and up front, fast past environment. Pay is being decreased with all new employees. Lot of the employees  don't stick together on issues and the local union there is a JOKE. REAL CUT THROAT PEOPLE"
good,"My typical day at Kellogg's is good. The reason being is because I've been there for 14 years, and developed a bond with my fellow co workers. Therefore being at work sometimes is like working "
good,"Kellogg has a high turn over rate, poor managment and long hours. There is a very ""new"" manager group there with little ability to work as a team, Each shift is allowed to talk down about other shifts and alot of policy and practices ara changed to fit some peoples needs and then changed to prevent others from certain things."
good,"Drive from store to store, meeting with receiver, unloading cases of product to U boats and then out to the sales floor, delivering product to shelves. I sometimes work with other co-workers and they all are good hard workers and take their job seriously. Every day is a learning process, learning to do my job better and faster. Loads can be one pallet of 35-75 cases or up to 4-5 pallets. Moving at a industrious speed of back bending and arm loading manouvers for a continous 3-4 hours can be physically demanding, but you do not stay with this job long, unless you are physiclly up to it."
good,I love my job but things have changed. If you want alot of work like 6 12 hour days (with overtime pay) a full time job here will give you that. The main drawback is you will not know your schedule much in advance.
good,"Pues es una empresa con altos estándares de trabajo, tiene un agradable ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Praymary secondaryRitalar visit Paramore handling  Sampling activities F/F checking weekly Custamar camplent ."
good,"The amount of work to be completed was beyond crazy. They consolidated jobs to keep costs down due to other divisions issues and trying to balance costs for shareholders. I understand why however, it made a lot of people miserable"
good,"A typical day is to sign in with  store manager.  Receive U boat to unload product and rotate on shelves. Finish one store. Drive to another. Repeat."
good,"Du positif ( salaire, culture) et du négatif ( management, opportunités de carrière)"
good,"Kellogg is going through major restructuring. My time here has been good, but it may be coming to an end. Looking for advancement, but that may not be in the horizon."
good,"The Company made the transition out of the Direct Store Delivery, it what they thought what was best for them financially. The people were fun and liked to challenge each other to succeed in the field."
good,"Kellogg's is a great company to work.  The product is high quality and the company has a solid history of good business decisions.  The changes they made this year were tough - they decided to exit DSD and changed the way they will be going to business.  Many jobs were lost this year. "
good,great company to work for. good benefits and perks. there was chance for advancement before the corporate office decided to close the Clearfield plant.
good,it was good while it lasted but it was time for them to shut the doors on us. driving for them the manager was alright the pay was good the receivers was nice and it was good to work with them at the time while the door was open
good,Overall pleased with company. Provided good support of front line management and offered a very competitive pay and benefit program.  Met a lot of good people at Kellogg Snacks
good,"Union plant so everything is based on seniority, jobs, overtime, shifts. Also several slow months out of the year so there could be several layoffs. Very unhappy people due to changes in their contract."
good,The warehouse had all the power.  Pushed to sell product and the warehouse would cancel your order. Missed many bonuses because of the warehouse and they would not load or delivery displays.
good,"- Um dia de trabalho sempre com reuniões, apresentações e desafios de atividades"
good,Good company to work for.  Products are good.  Work environment is healthy.  Learning possibilities.  Great team atmosphere. Management is very informative.
good,"good job work great pay but working long hours, 1-2 off days a month if lucky usually 7 days a week so really don't have time or a life"
good,Work back stock and fill shelves. That communicating is important. The hardest part of my job is just getting back stock together before leaving. I love that it that it is a good and easy job.
good,"Working in the grocery business always has its surprises.  A typical day involves coming up with a new plan on the fly because of the ever changing issues that arise.  Whether a truck breaks down, a delivery isn't accepted, or a truck is just running late, you have to be ready to change plans quickly and productively.  Management is decent but would be better if they didn't have such a workload.  The company needs to hire more reliable and productive employees. Working in retail means you must work weekends which is a drawback.  A positive for the job is since you must go to multiple custumer's per day to write an order, sell a display, write up inventory, merchandise product to shelf and displays, you are in and out of your car all day and don't have a boss over your shoulder.  There is a lot of freedom that comes with this job."
good,"High volume, keeping very busy taught me how to set tasks in order. Enjoyed working with all my co-workers. Completing multi-tasks was very rewarding"
good,salir atarabajar reportar venta aprendi aser un vendedor la gerencia era como todo y mis colegas los ai d todos buena ondas y no buena onda y aprendes muchas cosas aser buen vendedor y aprender a trabajar sobre precion
good,"I think that the Kellogg Company was a good place to work. They offer great benefits and the work is very exciting. If anyone wants to work here, you will learn so much and you will meet very friendly people here who are able to help you out if you need anything."
good,The Kellogg’s company was a great experience and I enjoyed working for them.The overtime was the best because of the pay. The job was at different stores and cities. I’ve learned a lot about the job.
good,Good place to work..would go back to work there. Need better shop Stewart's. Made great money. Did really have a job/family balance. Great benefits for family.
good,back in the day it was a good place to work. dont know what kind of positions they are offering now. sales are a must managing 20+ grocery stores with 200+ skews to each one great benefits and 401k.
good,"Lots of change leading to instability within the organization. Great pay and benefits, constant restructure with no sense of job security within the organization."
good,"A typical day at work is working 10-12 hours stocking, writing orders, sales calls, doing whatever the buyer wants, traveling from store to store, selling incrementals"
good,"Lot of conference calls."
good,"very good place to work, room for advancement, and health benefits for family was greatly appreciated."
good,"It's a laid-back job but if you don't like working in the cold this job not for you. You have to walk 7 minutes before you even get inside the job. If you don't come early on weekends you want have a spot then they send you home , basically messing up your money. This job is very easy but also boring ."
good,"I worked as a machine operator and Assistant Lead."
good,"I have 40 locations to be available for on a day to day basis. I continous monitor there inventory and help correct mis keys, punches or help investigate discrepancies through our SAP system. I perform audits, I fly or drive to the site on Monday and return on a Thursday. The most enjoyable part about job is the casual environment and the great atmosphere here. The hardest part of my job is letting the location know they are put on full inventories until we are comfortable with corrections. It costs the site time and money."
good,"Kelloggs is major corporations that has many products"
good,"Start at first account work back stock product, talk to management order sales items and empty shelves. Go to my next stop and repeat process until i reach my last stop."
good,working as a merchandiser was rewarding but Kelloggs did not offer enough hours for stability. I was sad to leave. The people were nice. The hardest part was waiting to be called each day for work.
good,There was not enough time to get a job done in a day. To many hoops to jump through.  With more time in the day we could get more done.  Not to bad but can use improvements.
good,"Long hours , forced overtime moments notice .union poor results on complaints, employees benefits during contract negotiations. Management not always on same page shift to shift."
good,Alot of money to be made. If the right people in place this is a very strong business. I would go back to work to there in heartbeat. Alot of traveling but very much worth all of it.
good,"The work is extremely easy. Assembly lines, uniforms and a lot of restrictions. I learned to work under pressure and to push myself to work long hours that i wasn't used to. The hardest part about this jobs is not being a peoples person. The work required you to work alone and to much socializing can easily be misunderstood as horseplay. The best part about the job is weekly pay and available overtime."
good,No life but pays well and the energy is great I some day will love to be a employee for the company. The supervisors there are some cool people the importants of safety was a must
good,your night's work will be depending on what station they put you. you could be in an area where things move really fast and get really hot..or you could be in an area where things are really cold and slow.
good,The job itself pays nice. The culture is horrible and the people are atrocious.Everyone is about self and nobody believes in being nice. There is a lot of problems that exist in this place and the people made a decent job horrible. Hate the seniority part of it too.
good,"Worked as an on-call basis as an administrative assistant.  Liked the people I worked with, the free products.  The culture was relatively casual. Sometimes hard because of breaches in communication among staff."
good,Good company with good pay and benefits. No job security and minimum chance for growth due to internal restructuring. Good job work/life balance. Workplace culture ok.
good,"Kelloggs is diverse company to work for. The people treat each other like family for the most part. If you love to work and are not big on family or personal time, this is the place to be!! However, management is not so great!! It has been know that employee have to go above/over personnel to get answers to simple questions. Otherwise, you could be left unanswered for weeks. Lack of communication amongst management and between employees is overwhelming. Instead of having meetings, some information is done through the ""grapevine"". The benefits are fairly good. And the health care is reasonably priced. The hardest part of the job in my opinion at this time is getting up every morning & not knowing if you will be sent home that day because HR doesn't communicate as they should."
good,"Kellogg is a very lean IT depsrtment that has allowed me to learn quite a bit. I have learned about VM Ware, Blackberry and Exchange in a clustered environment. Management is very fluid and flakey at times and does not always have clear goals. My co workers are great to work with and very knowledgable. The hardest part of the job is the paranonia about security and working with the constant suspions from management. The mpost enjoyable part of the job is working with users and solving their problems"
good,I learned that there are more things to consider about a job than just the amount of money you will make. Why would you want to make a lot of money and not be able to spend it or have to use your money to  pay doctor's bills because you're working yourself into bad health.
good,"Worked there for 5 years as a Manager.  Worked both ends of the calendar and clock due to organizational and corporate mandates.  Averaged 70 hours a week most weeks and on call nights and weekends.  Endured extremes of overbearing leadership to not engaged leadership.  Had three days initial training for the job and then it was best guess.  Each organization was run by the corporate office.  Employees were engaged, supervisors were not, managers talked the talk but could not always walk it.  Support from other leaders and mangers wasn't exemplary.  Held three management roles: Health and Safety, Business Security, Food Defense."
good,Busy days working 365 days a year with few days off but the compensation made it worthwhile. It was a strong union environment but worked well with frontline leadership.
good,"It seem when you got to an account, in store management changed the game plan. Back stock ,which we had to go through, most of the time was a nightmare."
good,its okay but for younger people not middle aged or older people. constant standing on concrete floors and the heat is umbearable. they finally added more ac into the room but it isn't sufficient
good,"Working for Kelloggs was great however, as a part-time merchandiser you don't have any benefits. Your work week vary's from week to week or day to day for that matter. The company's RSM's order way too much product and expect you to make sure it all goes up with no back stock. This is either they don't know how to order or the company expects way too much of them. Over all if your looking to gain experience in the merchandiser go for it if not look else where."
good,I enjoyed my time at Kellogg. My team were all pro-active and willing to provide detailed customer service. Do what ever it takes to accomplish project task.
good,"Working at Kellogg’s was a great learning experience. Although while I was working there, the hours were rough, the pay was well. I would recommend it for short term work."
good,At this particular facility there's absolutely no work life balance. You generally work everyday.  Some of memebers of management are very cocky. And more parcial to whom they like.  And it's very little room for advancement.
good,"Need top management to keep right Talent motivated and really recognize performance and not promote by friendship.   Middle management is a hard work and lack of systems require extra effort to stay on top of tactical work, leaving no time to focus on strategic thinking"
good,"It is challenging but a great place to work.  I start early and leave late, but there are many rewards associated with the job.   I love the folks I work with.   It is a union environment which create its own challenges at times."
good,Being a PT Merchandiser for Kellogg's i would head to whatever store needs to be serviced that and restock all products that were sold threw/light on the shelf. I learned how to work fast but not sloppy. I also learned how to mange my time effectively. My boss was very helpful and taught my the right way. I would have to build end caps ands display hutches. the hardest part o my job was leaving a store when there was still work needed to be done but couldn't stay there too long; 2hr max. I loved being able to make the shelf look neat.
good,"I worked in the Pringles manufacturing division.  I served as Team Leader, salter, concord shingler, flaps, KD and wraps for box production and on bottoms.   I worked the week-ends for 2.5 years and floated throughout the plant on a daily."
good,Typical day at work consist of going to various stores that sell our product and stock merchandise on shelf. I learned that people are very visual. I work independently. The hardest part is walking down a isle and not fixing products on shelf. Enjoy people
good,Company is downsizing that’s why I am job hunting job had great benefits and pay but was challenging at times corporate wanted to limit Battle Creek plant. And that made it difficult sometimes. Did best we could to make things work
good,"The company is changing every day, as with most companies.  However, over the past decade the company has gone through 4 restructures.  Career Advancement is difficult due to highly political and cut-throat environment."
good,Good overall. Not honest feedback from managers and if your not part of the click then you won’t fit in. Feel not like part of the team and even when you ask for feedback it’s not honest.
good,It was a part time job. Loading & unloading merchandise onto the shelves and sales floor. Merchandising sale items in strategic places for the best sale opportunities.
good,"Great People, they changed the model and I had a change to take early retirement.  Kellogg are in a position to win in the market place  going with warehouse sales."
good,"Kellogg's is a wonderful company to work for, the only issue I have is accountability. Sometimes there is none and the enforcement process has become null and void."
good,"The work place culture is very fast pace, always something going on. The quickest fast pace job I have ever experienced in my career, I definitely recommend this fortune 500 company."
good,"The people at this location are absolutely wonderful people.  Very passionate, dedicated, and hard working.  I truly enjoy working with every individual."
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunities to learn. Business strategy  is not the right one to grow and win in the marketplace."
good,"The trainer that was assigned to me was losing her job in 2017. This was due to cuts in the Snacks part of Kelloggs. She, in no way, was a trainer. She didn't answer questions, she wasn't engaging, I heard nothing but destructive criticism from her. I gained more knowledge from the receivers and other merchandisers"
good,I have spent nearly 30 years with this company. It's has been a tremendous experience. Changing business climate is causing companies within the grocery industry to downsize.
good,It is an overall good place to work. Augusta plant is a wonderful place though. The current plant manager cares for the people and the products we produce.
good,"A Typical day at work was spontaneous. I never knew if something would break down or added to our station. the demand for employees was always fluctuating, it was almost day and night. i learned that as an employee you either love the culture our you waist time being content."
good,"Fairly simple and straightforward job. Mainly cleaning, sweeping, pressure washing, etc the machines and equipment."
good,"This is a part time position.  Salary could be better.   Hours could be more consistent "
good,"It is a good job if you like variety, you get to stock, face and order product at different stores everyday. It is a great place to learn sales."
good,"When I arrived at work the first thing to do is to sanitize your self. Then in would need to acquire my hair net and beard net. Then we go out to the floor to read the board to see what event's taking place that day. In min or so we are called to are work station to begin checking the products. the co-workers are the key in making a good product. We were all able to work together to have a great put out of products. The job overall was easy but fast paced working all day 9-12 hours 7 days a week. I enjoy the party's we get when a one million man hours of injury free work. With the management being there when you need them, Makes it a great place to work. I was able to become more understanding about working as a team."
good,A well managed manufacturing site in need of capital projects to improve throughput. Workforce is very diverse and well trained. 
good,I love this company because the work is not very hard and easy to learn.I had a lot of fun and many learning experiences working here
good,The Kellogg brand is simply iconic and its great to be a part of the family of brands associated with this company. They have many employee benefits and programs that help attract great talented people.
good,los compañeros son amables y los superiores inmediatos procuran al personal
good,It was ok. I really wanted to get hired through the company. Got a lot of referrals from other employees who actually worked for kellogg company. But they never hired.
good,I started delivering products to stores and stocking shelves.  Then product was delivered and I stocked shelves.  Then they laid off all the delivery drivers and stockers and I spoke to management about our products.  Then I got laid off..
good,"Everyone at Kellogg's helps you to succeed on your job because we not only see ourselves as a team but also works as a team with the understanding of one common goal, success!"
good,aprendi hacer ordenada y creativa para mis ventas.
good,"On average I would visit 3-5 stores per day, while driving an average of about 150-200 miles per day. As an Kellogg's Sales Rep. I would start the day by reviewing sales data and making a sales plan before heading out of the house. When we would arrive to the store we would do a store walk in order to observe sales opportunities to discuss with store personnel. We would go over the opportunities as well as the current sales actual as well as projected with the store. Upon completion of the store visit we would make notes to have for reference."
good,"A typical day consists of approving material, approving packaging, assigning work for sanitation workers, filling out risk analysis, going over food safety paperwork and assigning holds."
good,"Kelloggs is a great place to work if you just want a job to make money and you don't care about being appreciated.  Management didn't seem to be in touch with the ""associates""."
good,"I really enjoy being a part of the whole process in the bakery. It’s like Charlie and the chocolate factory. Giant mixers mix 2,000lbs of dough then it is transported into an elevator. The elevator dumps the dough into a machine that thins and rolls the dough out before sending through a machine that cuts the crackers out and sends them into ovens that are as long as a football field. Once the product comes out of the ovens it goes through a series of cool down conveyor belts which allow the product to cool before going into a series of packaging machines before going onto another conveyor system running the product to shipping it is really wonderful to be a part of the heritage there as well"
good,"The company will work you hard. Depending on you manager, the work/life balance can be good to so-so. The company does offer great benefits, but you will be required to work very hard and most likely work over 40 hours per week if you are in a salaried (non-overtime) position. Job security is mediocre as the company has been restructuring at least once per year. With each restructure, more jobs are eliminated. Also due to these job eliminations, many employees are required to do more work and work longer hours to keep the business moving forward."
good,Review and follow the production schedule and adjust fro changes . Staff production lines. I did enjoy the connection among departments to better deliver and efficiently to the customers with Scheduling department
good,It's a nice work environment . The pay is very helpful and they offer incentives to show there employees their appreciation every year through different events hosted by the company.
good,I liked the job has some great associate to work around. It was at a medium paste environment where the cookies was well secured and safe to sale to the distributor.
good,"Fast paced, packing cookies into boxes, quality control to make sure cookies are complete and packaged correctly. "
good,Possibility of closing in 2-3 years it’s no guarantee but sometimes looks like it might close by production level. Management is the only downfall about Kellogg’s in my opinion
good,"Great benefits, decent pay, management micro-manages, long days, good products. Enjoyed network of coworkers. Fast and furious work, production is important."
good,"Not a good location, KCKS is full of gangs and drugs and the area around the bakery is depressing.  Lots of well intended people who work harder than they should have to."
good,"Uma empresa com uma forte cultura, onde todos os funcionários estão engajados para atingir os resultados. Existe uma dependência muito grande da Gerencia Regional (LATAM), no que se refere a tomada de decisões."
good,The management were always helpful and friendly. Long hours during a work day but anything over 40 was time and a half. Typical work day is always fast paced and working on making sure items are being packaged correctly and thoroughly.
good,Great company status and great people to work for.  I maintained a great rapport with Managers and associates within my division.  The product offered was excellent.
good,"A lot of driving, must hit budgets, deal with many different personalities  in stores.  My job was deleted.   Have to cold sell to people in stores.  Not enough merchandisers"
good,"Most of my experience was positive but did go through 12 transitions in the 24+ years I worked at Kelloggs."
good,i like the job kept me busy fast paced it got a little cold but for the most part everything was good the only reason i left was because i found a job making more money
good,Es una empresa responsable con sus proyectos lleva acabo promociones enfocadas a los clientes
good,I ran a case packer mechine and learn to make poptarts and nuitiangrain bars I also had to box all the packages up and get everything rdy to be shipped to local grocery stores
good,"Fast paced, budget oreinted, and great management team. They were a steady company to work for for many years. Wonderful benefits with low cost plans."
good,"For a young guy, its a nice place to work, since its an opportunity to understand how a business operates. "
good,Working for Kellogg's was very good.  They decided to eliminate the Direct Store Delivery and laid off about 4000+ employees.  I went to the locations to merchandise the delivery.
good,"Learnt new tools and got experience on GRC and other tools "
good,"Hard to believe that when you go to HR with an actual issue, they don't resolve it like they should. That is the biggest issue with it. Otherwise they pay well and they have good benefits."
good,Kellogg's was a great place to  work and learn how to achieve goals as a team player. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility of my schedule.
good,"The company, products and people are great."
good,This job required me to be up and moving by 4:30 a.m. three days out of the week. I was in charge of merchandising products and working backstock for two stores.
good,"best working environment"
good,"Provided daily work review to staff and Kellogg Supervisor."
good,My experience there was a memorable one. It taught me that jobs of its stature would need self discipline that I had not experienced from any job I had before. It took some time for me to get used to the 6 p.m to 6 a.m shift.
good,"Multi-tasking is a way of life with managing direct reports, customers and internal managers.  Involved in all aspects of foodservice sales from bids and contracts to trade negotiations and forecasting product distribution cycles."
good,Joined Kellogg's Snack Division in 2015 and they offered a premium relocation package and good compensation.  It has been a pleasure to work with them these past two years.  I am only leaving due to company wide layoffs in regards to the dismantling of the Direct Store Delivery network.
good,"Pay, benefits and management were great. Good equipment. I'd be working there for years to come if not for the lay offs. I'll miss it."
good,"Kellogg Corporation making changes to downsize."
good,Nice atmosphere. Nice people. Good place to start marketing in cereal brands we all consumer and love. Clear positioning. Room to grow even bigger.
good,"Good place to work, hours suck, management ok to get along with, hardest part of the job was the hours, lack of AC in the summer, and the stench of food in water."
good,You do the same thing over and over there's good working hours and good people just a lot of things that are mine list type of work
good,"Great people to work with everyone is highly skilled in what they do."
good,I have learn how to operate machinery and troubleshoot as well as how to keep track of inventory and how to find and fix discrepancies if any with inventory. I have also started learning the planning and ordering of materials and how much to order for production runs.
good,the internship program at kellogg is as productive and useful as one wants it to be. you get out what you put in. you recieve exposure to different departments within the company.
good,i have work on all three production lines /also in shipping and receiving/ and hand packing area some days were harder because of lack of team work
good,"During a typical day at work, you can find a way to improve to improve a process.  Kellogg will empower you to look for these type of opportunities.  This company has helped me learn how to engage people in different ways to build a great work environment."
good,"Great benefits, pay is good also, full time some long days. Fast pace environment. Need business insurance for personal car"
good,As a Kelloggs employee. I have enjoyed my coworkers and making/ smelling all of the different variety of cookies. A typical day at  Kelloggs can be hectic if things aren't running correctly. One thing I appreciate about the Supervisor's is that they will jump in and help get the job done. One of the most enjoyable things to me is having a job to go to.
good,This job was good but I was extremely bored.  I felt that I could be utilized a little better.  This feeling prompted me to quit and start my own business.
good,Very good company my daily duties included faxing and filing and updating database with scheduling My co-worker was my boss very nice lady hardest part of the job was the filing it was intense most enjoyable part of the job was the people interacting with them was fun
good,See other Kellogg review. Very good compensation and rewarding company to work for. One negative is they are a little slow to adapt to changes in the market.
good,Great place to work. Great pay. Big company. Good benefits...... Enjoy working in teamwork. Recommended this job to others
good,"Easy work. 12 hour swing shifts (3 days on 4 days off and vice versa) so thats a 36 hour work week followed by a 48 hour work week. Management doesnt know whats going on, they just make up rules as they go. No sick days, I repeat, NO SICK DAYS. Decent benefit package. Good 401k plan. 40% match I believe. No chance for advancement. Because of the union production workers have overall control, not management."
good,Great job to have. If you love to meet new people and get to talk with other vendors. Fun environment to be in. lot of repetitive work. some short days some long. the ability to get in a store and out of one before it gets crowded is the best part
good,It's very challenging there is a lot you have to know before you are allowed a pay increase. You have to know every part of your machine you are running. If something breaks down you have to fix it along with the person you are working with.
good,Work collectively as a team to ensure a high quality product is delivered safely and a timely fashion to our customers. Hard working co-workers.
good,"if you like working for a company that does nothing but place blame on everything but themselves for everything than this is the place for you , not me !"

good,Kellogg is a great place to work.  Worklife balance and a great culture.  The Cereal industry is struggling and Kellogg has recognized the need for change to continue to move forward.  As with any change you will meet resistance and challenges and have some bumps in the culture.

good,"Kelloggs  in KCK is a great place to work if you like working a lot of overtime. But you had better set aside some of that money incase you have to be off for medical reason ,because short term disabitliy doesn't pay enough to live off (250.00 a week) And you had better set aside some of that over time because there retirement is only going to pay for your medical insurance after retirement. For Kelloggs to be a billion dollar company they want match your 401k with any amount that you put into there company...WHEN THEY HAVE GOTTEN ALL THEY CAN GET FROM YOU ITS OVER.."

I have experienced several leadership changes during my tenure and seen the company grow form my early years. The company has built a very strong and diverse portfolio of products, which is something to take pride in. The small team structure in which I worked was a good way to be very productive and efficient. One of the challenging parts of my role was continuing to meet sales targets, especially in the midst of an ever changing environment and industry. Working with customers and helping to meet their needs is a rewarding as well enjoyable part of the job."

good,Un día típico en Kellogg es llevar acabo tus tareas trabajando en equipo. Además de compartir mis inquietudes con mis compañeros y algunos de ellos ya amigos.
good,"Typical day at work includes being micro-managed about minor ""needs"" that aren't really needs, but more of traditions that the organization refuses to let go of. I enjoy my co-workers quite a bit, but don't understand why many have continued to work long hours when it doesn't directly drive the business forward. I believe we can be more effective through working smarter instead of working harder. The hardest part of my role is the workload expectations. My team and I were very understaffed compared to the expectations that we currently have."
good,A good place to work.
good,• Responsible for servicing and selling Kellogg’s Snacks products to Store management and ensure standards are met

good,I enjoyed my time at kelloggs getting to know different people and they're cultures the different types of crackers and snacks they made the dinners the provide occasionally it was nice the time i spent there
good,"the company is really good,  I think the biggest issue is the agreements they make with major grocery chains that are completely impossible to get done because the stores don't care what is auto shipped or mandated."
good,I was a contractor at Kellogg so I'm not sure on many aspects related to those who were hired full time.  From a contractor point of view it seemed to have an excellent culture.  Once a month folk were allow to fill 2 large grocery bags to the hilt with Kellogg products from the in-house store...FREE.
good,"kelloggs is a good company to work for,you can make a pretty good living andhealth insurance is great,the hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page as far as working and coming to work"

good,"Worked here for six months and that was enough for me. Job was really stressful and fast-paced. They never had enough people working on the line, so there were lots of setbacks. Coworkers were always stressed and unhappy. Only worked three-four days a week. Overall, terrible place to work. I'm sad that people lost their jobs when  the plant shut down, but I'm not sad the plant did shut down. Nobody really took their jobs seriously. More people standing around talking than doing their jobs. Got sent home early a few times."
good,such a demanding fast paced environment. management and coworkers were amazing to work with. the work expectation volume was overwhelming at times. job training was superb
good,fun place to work. fast paced day. enjoy the challenges of taking on the day. Pay is competitive in area which is great being in silicon valley. crew is great to work with.

good,kellogs is an ecellent place to work. I found the supervisors to be capable and well trained. the employees were helpful and team oriented. The pay and benefits packages are great
good,When you know what your job is and do it they leave you alone.  I was going for 40 years but they shut down the DSD system and 4000 of us are out on the street.  It happens.
good,A typical day was going out into the stores to and ordering for the product for the stores and meetings with management. To challenge myself each day.
good,"Years of consolidation and cost savings are delivering good stock value but shrinking category makes revenues challenging.  As a result, job stress is climbing while folks work hard to deliver topline growth.  People are great to work with and genuinely care about each other.  Management values hard work and good ideas.  Excellent benefits and salaries."
good,Kellogg has been a great place to work the last few years. However with the closure of their DSD network this year they are cutting a very large amount of jobs. Although they are treating us with respect and giving ample time to find another position and severance packages its is still a difficult situation. I wish big corporations were less greedy and understood boosting morale does boost productivity.
good,"Your experience as an employee can differ widely depending on department and manager. Customer Logistic Services has a great culture, IT would score poorly when it comes to culture."
good,"Tuve la suerte de trabajar en esta gran empresa, con excelentes beneficios y una de las mejores oportunidades para aprender y practicar lo aprendido. "

Very diverse group of people willing to work together. The hardest part of the job is the turn over rate with the hourly work force. The most enjoyable part is meeting the customers request in a efficient and timely manner."
good,"Kellogg's is a great company to work for.  They strive to be a conscious business partner in the community. The people are nice to work with, but the business was in turmoil when I worked there.  My third boss and I didn't get along at all, so it was challenging to work for her."
good,"Fortune 500 company that has a hard time creating a vision and sticking to it. Great innovators and fantastic employees but very top heavy which means a lot of decisions are being made that may not be in the best interest of long term growth. "

good,not bad company to work for just wrong  individuals  leading team at times very quick  to point fingers  instead of solving  the problem and strength overall relationships with customers  and terrible  at scheduling of replacement when paid time off always last minute approval.  however co workers make the job very enjoyable they keep call in not matter how stressful it may get

good,Working at Kellogg was a great company to work for.  Management needs training on race relationship and how to work fairly with employees of a different race.
good,It is a great place to work I learned a lot of different things in the manufacturing industry. Unfortunately there is a downsizing in this industry and have to move on. The hardest part of my job was being forced over for a double shift. The most enjoyable part is working with great people.
good,All jobs with my title were eliminated across the company.  I was able to apply for and was awarded a new position for more money than what I was making which was somewhat confusing because the goal of the job eliminations was to save money and multiple jobs were created paying people more than what they were paying the paying that were let go.
good,Productive and fun place to work. Teamwork was great and employee was willing to work together. Great place to learn new skill and about new innovation.  Had opportunities to work on project with the Corporate R&D Group.
good,Everyone is willing to answer questions and/or provide assistance if requested. Training is provided for each job. Management is flexible and willing to get answers to questions.

The most enjoyable part of the job were the interactive training sessions."
good,"I really don't have a lot of bad things to say about Kelloggs, the pay was awsome, the management sucks, I worked there for a year and still didn't get hired permanent plus got layed off, how you like those apples."
good,10 to 12 hour work days but you  had weekends off.Management was not trust worthy and you could not depend upon them for help nor to handle issues.you have to be pretty independent to work here.It has been great and stable work for me through out the years.
good,Kellogg's has been a wonderful company to work for and they have allowed me to learn and advance. The current business environment and go to market strategies have led Kellogg's to make a decision to eliminate the division of their company where I currently work.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kellogg's. They have employees with tremendous passion for the business. There are many employees with vast experience and tenure.
good,Good company to work for but it has already phased out to warehouse distribution.  Company layoffs were inevitable....................................
good,Great people to work with! Job functions divided into silos so collaboration with others is key to being successful.  Good benefits.  Summer hours give you opportunity to have half day Fridays.
good,Started with Kellogg's with zero experience in Distribution. now I have 6 1/5 years with the company and I'm very grateful. Unfortunately the company has made the decision to close all of it's US based distribution centers and ship directly to customers' warehouse instead of using the Direct Service Distribution (DSD).

good,"fun place, love it there but plant closed. wish i was still there.people were friendly , like a sporting team working together,make as much money as you wanted"
good,"Kellogg's has a high energy work force. In addition, it is a well-organized sales operation. My day consists of negotiating incremental sales with key decision makers in order to grow Kellogg's revenue. I've learned powerful negotiating skills, as well as sustaining strong client relationships. Management provides an excellent line of communication that enables clear company directives. My colleagues and I work closely together to share best practices that further enhance sales goals. Team work is a central part of the Kellogg culture. The most challenging part of my job is to find more stimulating opportunities that will further enhance my sales expertise. "
good,"The hardest part of the job was travelling by car in different cities. Sometimes the tools that the company gave me for the work, were inadequate and this create a lot of stress in the team. However I learned how retailers work and to give priority at the business goals."
good,This is a good job for anyone who can work on their own and remain motivated. The only two reasons I am searching elsewhere is because I want out of the grocery industry and the commute to my territory has become rather taxing.
good,Very involved management team and very supportive from the top to the bottom at all times. Daily communication regardless of my location for updates by upper management. A great team to work with.
good,"travel around South Philadelphia and stock grocery store shelves. no direct supervision, just plans directly from manager and store managers."

good,Unloading pallets and stocking stores was very hard work which I enjoy.
good,I was on an assignment but i enjoyed the time i was there. Drama free environment.
good,"Great internship, but didn't prepare me for the job-at-hand. Mass lay-offs are common and there is a poor team feeling. The work-life balance can vary by role, and the business is less exciting than first thought."
good,"Really liked the job but because it is union and diversity is evadevt in work place I was forced to work 12 hour/7 days week for months at a  time because some ppl who had same qulifications and less senority couldn't do a dependable job for supervisor and it always made for bad production on line, and I was missing alot of family time"
good,"work work work"

good,"Worked 12 hrs 7 days a week, extreame enviromental conditions"
good,"Working at Kellogg Huber was a great experience. I learned a great deal about the legal system. I worked alongside attorneys to file federal court documents, arrange travel for client meetings across the globe, and ensured all documentation was kept in order for large cases. The work environment is nothing short of positive. The individuals I worked with were great, and there was always someone willing to help out. The most difficult part of the job were the hours. Many large cases required late nights and early mornings with little to no sleep."
good,My typical day at Kellogg's involved me checking product off the production line and analogizing the ingredients to be sure all elements are in order. I was also required to host two meetings with all key shift individuals to insure all standards were in place.
good,Kellogg provides great carrer advancement for hard working dedicated employess.
good,"Loved working in the Battle Creek Plant until downsizing forced me to either leave with package severance or transfer to different location. I chose to continue my career and transferred to Lancaster, Pa. Battle Creek had been wonderful, Lancaster work force were not nice people. Forced overtime, malice from some co workers. Working multiple shifts in one week. Down right nasty co workers, mostly the women who were (downtown) girls with an uptown job. A lot of hazing type activity."
good,The Kellogg company is always working on reducing their environmental footprint and developing foods that matter to their customers and are good for you.
good,I loved working for Kellogg's and was interviewed for a new position/promotion and 48 hours later I was told I was 1 of 4000 across the nation losing my job because they were eliminating the Direct Sales Division. I have tried multiple time applying with them again with no success.
good,Sales job allowed the ability to adjust schedule as needed.  Multiple restructures left field employees wondering when they would be eliminated.  Management out of touch with reality of selling to some chains.
good,I Really liked my job as an electrical instrumentation technician. Pay was good for the area. Would still be there if I hadn't lost my transportation.
good,Overall I had an enjoyable time with Kellogg's. The pay was reasonable for what I did. I had a great team as well as a good team Manager who was always available when needed.
good,"Fast paced job so time always went by pretty fast. over half the other workers were easy to get along with so that made time working there on occasions ""fun"" and kept your mind off of the clock the whole time and management was overall understanding with about everything."
good,"Good place to work and you gain a lot of knowledge in food safety and quality from your experience of auditing,visiting co manufacturing and warehouse sites . Experience in all areas of the food manufacturing process ."
good,"Great to work with people, but they need to keep plants opened and not shut them down. I enjoyed the different crackers they made and the change over time was quick and efficient."
good,"Good company to work for until they eliminated all merchandisers"
good,I really don't do reviews so hopefully I make a good impression. So Kellogg is a good company to work for. One is because their product is a necessity. Always have a job.
good,Great pay and benefits. Excellent training of various types of machinery. Most of the people are very friendly and helpful and really want others to succeed at their jobs.
good,"I was a seasonal who was responsible for assisting in the processing, packing, and sanitation department of the plan. I would work with the supervisors to make sure all tasks were being filled so production would not slow down."
good,"Some parts of the company are great and some not so great. the pay and benefits are really good, but the headache that comes with the job is sometimes not worth it"
good,Good place to work .  Gained a lot of experience in a lot of different areas from QA to operations to HR.  The ability to move in the organized was always there.  Just got a better offer and left.
good,Learned how to see how the products were actually made  how the company did a lot of things as far as learning more job titles big on different ones according to ur senority
good,"Sold in displays to grocery stores to increase sales by 20% per year. "
good,"Undergoing a lot of financial restructuring and position changes. New CEO and new president within the last 6 months. Makes the future a little questionable, but they appear to be poised for success in the future."
good,"A good place to work until all the layoffs. Kellogg layed off over 8,000 employees nation wide in August. They also shut down 22 distribution centers. They did away with their direct sales  team , and started selling straight to the warehouse."
good,"Kellogg's was a pleasure to work for, until they got rid of my position and I lost my job.  I always had fun at the stores and the managers all loved me"
good,Kelloggs prides itself on career progressionand CPD. It is a large company so you get good benefits. I found the role wasnt suited for my quaities and it was entry level at the time.
good,"Good jobs, good benefits, there is a ton of company downsizing in every state, in every position, from manufacturing all the way to sales and corporate positions."
good,Good place to work.  Poor decision making at the top.  The company gave up on growth.  The middle management on down were very good people with good values and beliefs.
good,Nice place to work and great brands.  Lots of opportunities if you're willing to relocate.  Flexibility to work from home which creates a great work life balance.  There were many perks when I worked there almost 10 years ago.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of driving to a predetermined store and either restocking the store with existing product or processing new product just delivered.The hardest part of the job was sometimes you were at the mercy of the truck drivers being late, causing you to run late.I loved being my own boss and working at my own quick pace."
good,"As bad as the review sounds, there are people in the company that listen to others. I was provided with lots of opportunities to grow and learn the business."

good,It was great place to work if you were a student or also had family obligations. the schedule was very flexible and also did not have to work weekends
good,Daily challenges are never the same. Every day is different and unique and that is one of the challenges I enjoy the most about my job. Staffing issues and employee flexibility are very important in our union facility. Our jobs are seniority based and management must make moves based on seniority and job skills. Due to a high volume of call ins placing the employee in the best position to succeed  is critical to our daily success.

good,"Great place to work, both fun and challenging.  Only challenge is all career progression goes through Battle Creek which is not the ideal city in which to live"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, trabajo en equipo multifuncional, diversidad, horario flexible"
good,"The first 2.5 years was under Keebler Company. All was great. I had excellent management and leadership personnel. The last 2 years was with Kellogg after they purchased Keebler. Everything had become just a number, As a top performer myself I was still heavily leaned on to keep producing higher and higher sales numbers to help carry those that weren't producing. Local management had changed and the friendly work environment changed with it."
good,"Kellogg is a great place to work.  People are always willing to help out their co-workers and it is a very nice environment.  I learned a lot during my years at Kellogg.  I now have a good understanding of the trade, sales and planning process.

good,"Every day at work is different. I have so many things to take care of that I rarely find my job repetitive. I can define a media plan, manage a consumer promotion, look at the volumes forecast on the same day. "
good,"Kellogg supports increasing use of technology in all areas, has a great corporate culture, and many opportunities to travel internationally.  Management is incredibly supportive of training opportunities and leadership development. In the corporate office, there are the typical corporate politics and concern over continuous structure changes.  The fluctuation of layoffs and re-hires is the hardest part of employment at Kellogg.  However, the advancement potential and solid wage earnings for the area are a definite bonus.  The people at Kellogg are really great and all work well toward the common goals."

This job really taught me how to be organized while working efficiently. Getting to know people is something i really enjoy doing, so anytime i was granted the opportunity to talk to someone new i went for. That would have to be the best part about the job because it allowed me to do that."
good,"I was working in the country of Iraq during the war for almost eight (8) years.It is impossible to put into words the life changing experences I have enjoyed. As hard as it is to put into words any of the questions to the right. I would be more then happy to discuss any, thank you."
good,"If you have the right support from the right people, you can go far, but there have been a lot of changes in direction, philosophy and management that has lowered the stability of upward mobility in recent years."

They do offer good benefits, 401k, PTO time and all that."
good,"Fast-paced work environment daily.  Safety awareness and quality control is a must.  Workplace culture was great learning and relating or communicating with fellow employees and learning about their culture and way of life.  The hardest part of the job was the plant closure.

good,Its a good place to work get all the experience to work in a team with different work strategy. Got alot of new things to learn and work in different situations
good,"Kellogg's is a good company to work for.  However, they have suffered many downsizings in the past as the demand for their products have decreased.  Don't expect to retire after 30 years here.  Enjoy you time at Kellogg's and save, save, save for a rainy day."
good,"Worked at Kellog for 14 years, flexible schedules with every other weekend off. Allows you to choose between day or overnight shifts. Long hours required."
good,"Kellogg has a lot of meetings throughout each day that tend to take you away from performing your actual job, because you are always preparing for the next meeting."
good,The benefits are second to none. The working environment is very clean. Only draw back is the work schedule but you are aware of that before you hire in.

good,"Was laid off, but the time I spent there wasn't that bad. Largely depends on the staff at the stores you work. Management was really cool and for the most part you work on your own with no supervision."
good,"It was a very competitive work pace. Stayed very busy visiting all accounts, meeting with store managers, selling in displays and reviewing sales."
good,I had the opportunity to enjoy working for Kellogg for 25 years. I am very grateful about my time there. Over the last years the company has been under a lot of pressure due to changing consumer habits and higher expectations on profitability. This has required aggressive cost reduction programs that have resulted in layoffs that while necessary to keep the business running affected employee morale. One of the most valuable assets if the culture and the fact the the Kellogg values are actually present on the day to day of the organization.
good,"Enjoyed my time with Kellogg. The people were great the work was motivating, and management was fair. Overall, the only complaint i would have is the unwillingness to hire between business units."
good,It's fast paced a lot of the times. Benefits and pay is great. Overtime Is available if you want it. Management can be sucky at times but everyone has a boss to answer to. Over all I love this job!

good,"Great company with a family like environment and culture. Great opportunity to gain knowledge and experience across cross-functional projects. As an ABM you get BM responsibility i.e. own your P&L, budgets, media relationships, creative direction, brand trajectory/planning, etc."
good,Great company to work be apart of-- hours are flexible and personal life balance is strongly encouraged. Great benefits and thorough on boarding and training process. There is just a lack of opportunity and cross functional training/shadowing to advance your career. No clear career map.
good,Fast paced environment. Solving challenges daily. Meeting and working with your team and customers. Empowerment for myself and team.  Watching your team grow. Competitive  but friendly atmosphere. Celebrating success.
good,"I was only part time at Kellogg, most full time employees were very great to work with, even as a part time employee, the pay was out standing. Left the company cause it is very hard to get full time"
good,"Kellogg is a great company. "
good,loved the way we acquired bonuses on a quarterly bases. I like the way Kellogg treated its employees and HR immediately solved employees concerns. Great discounts provided through company as well
good,"They have given me a great life and a great job over the years, however we have restructured 6 different times in my time here. This year they deleted my entire side of the company. Thousands lost their jobs. I feel they are a great company to work for, however they need to stabilize."
good,if you are willing to learn new things within kellogg...it was always someone there to lead you....kelloggs needed more experience in communicating with the merchandisers...

good,"Working for Kellogg Company, has been a great experience. Based around family core values, the employee goes in everyday to give their best effort do the job effectively, and safely."
good,"Overall I have enjoyed my time with Kellogg. I get my schedules on a timely basis, and I am allowed a proper amount of time to complete my tasks. There is a level of stress involved, and work is not steady from week to week."
good,"Work is typically a meeting in the beginning and then job assignments. Usually, its a certain area that only certain teams can do, like the cylos on the roof. But i usually did the ovens or the the waste feed shed, which is a tough job for three people on average."
good,"People in Kellogg is passionate & committed to their work and delivering results above the expectation. "
good,"I enjoy working for Kellogg in every facet except management doesn't help you advance within the company very well. A system is in place to help, but not followed very well."
good,"A Typical day at work for me as a Quality Inspector. Tour the plant for Safety as well as documenting products manufactured for that day. During that time I almost always learn how people work and how important it is to work safe no matter what is being manufactured."
good,"This was a part time job.  I was essentially stocking shelves of Kellogg products.  The job was mechanical, I worked with relatively caring and friendly people.  In summary I was placing stocking grocery shelves.  It paid a reasonable salary, but by the nature of the job it was not satisfying or fulfilling."
good,"Por esos años eran mis comienzos laborales, así que fue mucha la experiencia adquirida. Mi área fue Administración de  Ventas y el trabajo era muy variado."
good,"Great pay, good benefits and the work is relatively easy.  Wish I was still there.  Very safety conscious.  Management does have your best interests in mind."
good,Come to work ready to work. I did my job and helped other employees when I was able. The hardest part of the job was working 7 days a week and many of them were 12 hour shifts. I worked as a teammate in every sense of the word.
good,Everyone was willing to help each other. Communication was difficult with upper management when working nights. Changes were slow to implement. Upper management was willing to talk to you.
good,Large company with great benefits. Guaranteed 40 hours with plenty of overtime available. There are always opportunities to grow and work in various departments.
good,This is a great company with a creditable history. requires alot of driving though. Strong communication skills and contact with store management is a must.
good,"Good, solid company with many opportunities to grow and experience new directions.  Wonderful employees.  Great community presence."
good,Great people to work with. My co-workers and managers are well trained and believe in a teamwork atmosphere. After being here 19 years the Charlotte plant is shutting down as part of an consolidation effort world wide. During the shutdown Kelloggs made a lot of resources available for us to seek employment either with another Kelloggs or a company within the area. They really did a lot to help workers that stayed till the end get thru the transition.
good,"I answered trouble calls on a production line that I was assigned to.  Troubleshooting, make adjustments, repair or replaced parts.  rebuilt parts in spare time."
good,"Great company."
good,Day starts with overview of previous shift and updates from supervisors for current day operations. I work directly with 2 other operators who always have my back. They are easy to work with and knowledgeable of my machines as well as there own. We can count on each other for help as well as depend on each to cover entire when need be.
good,Driving store to store putting kelloggs product on to the shelf.
good,"My typical day at Kellogg Company consisted of calling on several accounts, selling in extra product, and maintaining full shelves for consumer satisfaction.  I learned a great deal while here about sales and customer service.  I was actually nationally hand selected to attend an advanced sales training class in Battle Creek, MI.  My managers overall were good people. There was a great deal of office politics to participate in, which can be fun at times, but tiring.  The hardest part of my job was trying to satisfy my biggest client, Wal-Mart, day after day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making sales and the compensation I received."
good,"   The physical portion of this job is an added bonus."
good,Great place to work the employees as well as management are friendly and helpful and willing to go the extra mile to resolve company issues.
good,"Meet Budget expectations, liason between Kelloggs and Accounts,"
good,"Wish they were hiring full time, so I would still be there, I was able to adapt to the assembly of different machines and productat this company."
good,Good until laid off. Different management and many people to talk too.
good,"For this being my first factory job, it was doable. It was assembly line work in which we stood by convater belts loading and unloading packages. It was minimal effort for a higher than average job. This was one of my most enjoyable jobs mainly because past experiences led me to believe managers are more in favor of the work getting done rather than the safety of their associates."
good,"I worked for Kellogg's as a TSR, left the company and now came back as a part-time merchandiser."
good,this is a cool place to work . No problems working with the environment.
good,"I log the time when I arrive at a store, leave a store, how many cases I serviced at the store and the time it takes to get to the next store. Upon arriving I check all displays that Kelloggs has. If any need filling, I check the date the display is up until. If it is still displayed for a decent amount of time, I make note of how many cases of what will fit on the display. I then do the same for the holes in the aisle."
good,The day at work was a constant barrage of requests and questions for until I had been there 8 hours. Then it calmed down and I could work on ongoing projects.
good,I was laid off and chose to pursue my own business instead of reapply for a different position. I truly enjoyed working for Kellogg’s and the people I met along the way!
good,Getting up everyday and talking to Grocery managers and Store managers about our programs and displays made this a fun job. Being a commission based sales rep or having a bonus structure in place (later years) was a great motivator in pushing towards every sales quota.
good,Good constantly busy working with products to rotate and stock products on shelves and build displays it’s lot of work meet people tooo very stressful job
good,"Large company, small teams. Be willing to work hard to build relationships and sell products into stores. Learn the stores, their sales on kelloggs products and the management that you will be working with. Lots of local travel and some further travel for meeting."
good,"Product development, product improvement, technical project management and cost reduction. Process experience such as: Cereals, extruded products, dairy beverages, baked bars, cold forming bars. "
good,Buena cultura laboral de la empresa. Actividades interesantes para crecimiento del personal
good,Kellogg was a blessing for me and my family.  Kellogg wasn't prefect and neither is any other plant .  Every job and life trial needs teamwork across the board.
good,I loved the flexible schedule and the ability to work at my own pace. It was a very stressful job at times but it was worth it. I loved my team my boss and my job
good,"Kellogg was a good place to work. The culture has changed over the last several years but overall, my colleagues were great people to work with. I built many lasting relationships"
good,"It was a good job to work as a primary or side job, you got to make your own hours and it started with a nice hourly wage with increases every year you remained with the company. However, they no longer have merchandisers as they have the stores stock all of their products now."
good,"Focused on creating and delivering on customer and consumer needs with products that are healthy and taste good."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company and was fairly compensated.  It is a very structured environment and promotions are the same way.  Tenure is very important- so coming in from the outside, it may take time to advance depending on the group you are in."
good,"A typical day is going in and getting to your start up area,  each area you are trained in.  Management is not bad.  The associates and managers are nice to work with.  The hardest part of the job for me was the heat"
good,"Lots of Available over time but when the lines go down there is now work at all. Also they do swing shift. one week day, one week afternoon shift , and one week night shift, and when you come back you work 7 days straight."
good,"Awesome place to work.  I was caught up in a 7% cut in the global workforce, otherwise I would still be working for them.  Terrific company and great leadership."
good,"My typical day at work would be filled with new challenges everyday, I have learnt a lot  varying from labor disputes, legal compliance, company law and other areas of expertise like HR and IT. The management of the Company is amazing in that you work directly with your supervisor and this gives one an opportunity to learn and adopt great work ethics. The work culture in the Company is wonderful, due to the fact that the Company is an International Company the office is full of multinationals and gives one the opportunity to interact and learn various things about different people."
good,"I've had a great experience working for Kellogg. There is a focus on personal development and job mobility that I hadn't seen before. Pay is above average, at least in my area."
good,I loved working at Kellogg’s very good pay only thing is you work 7 days a week and it’s union so it was hard for me too switch shift so I had to leave due to me having a newborn
good,"Responsável pelo estoque de produtos, realizava frequente balanço de estoque, conferia diariamente as metas de produção, carregamento de veículos de fornecedores."
good,"Great Benefits"
good,"Empresa con un alto grado de ética y valores, con buen ambiente de trabajo."

good,"a very nice place to work,keep product rotated, people were great to work with management was great, waiting for the receiver to take in the delivery,"
good,"Kellogg Company permitió un crecimiento sostenido en mi carrera profesional, aprendí técnicas de liderazgo y trabajo en equipo, todo enmarcado en valores éticos y de coresponsabilidad. el trabajo estaba orientado hacia la operación comercial (ventas-finanzas) con relación indirecta a HR, logistica y producción."
good,the people there were awesome and management let you relax a little as long as your work got done on time management had a true open door policy always tried to promote from within
good,Wake up and plan your day. Print your daily sales plan by store. head out to your first stop. walk the perimeter and look for display opportunities. walk the isle and check shelf conditions. find product in the backstock to fill any holes on the shelf. approach manager about uocoming adds and display opportunities.
good,"The work flow of the day was very fast paced and it went by very quickly. The amount of knowledge u learn from there is very unique compare to some other companies. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have access to the snacks that we work with. As for the hard part of the job was the long hours of the day, it would vary from day to day, but ranged from 10-14 hrs of work a day."
good,"as a Retail Merchandiser, I love the work flexibility that is offered and the prioritization of work/life balance. I was impressed with the respect that director-level and upper management has given me and their appreciation it was a great place to work!"
good,"Managers are supportive and engaging at all levels of the organization. Variety of work consisting of both ad-hoc and scheduled processes.  Opportunity to travel and work with other team members around the world. Collaborate and participate in various projects including process improvements and re-implementation of existing systems.  Training provided on current and new company systems and processes as they are rolled out. "
good,i really enjoyed working for this company. they paid well and the work wasnt horrible. its a good place to work. unfortunately they went to DSD and close my job down.
good,Tive grande oportunidade é aprimorou muito meu conhecimento no ramo alimentício
good,"Nice company, but the brands were a little tired.  They merged with Keebler shortly after I left to help out.  Tough business.  Very conservative.  Enjoyed my time there."

good,"Was a good company to work for.  Pay was good and management was willing to listen and cared about the people.  The benefits were good an I enjoyed working for the company,"
good,Lots of opportunities for advancement and a culture which supported employee development.  Very professional in how it conducts business.  Boss was a mentor and not just a boss.
good,A typical day would start at varying times and not end until the work was done.  Often this was 12+ hours. Typically Monday thru Friday work with limited saturdays required.  Company is very safety focused and provides continuous training to support that effort.  They truly care about you and wanting to get every employee home safely each day.  Excellent developmental training opportunities and advancement.  The hardest part of the job is time management and if not done well could cause you to work more hours.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.
good,I was very alone at this job. My day was as long or as short as I wanted it to be. If I wanted to do my job and effort it I could work for 12 hours if not then i could go home.
good,This job was very laid back and family oriented. The work life balance was the best. The pay was ok but genuine concern and everyone treated equal made up for it
good,"Wonderful personal there. Everyone I meet was very respectful but due to lack luster financial's in 2016, was released. No chance of of being hired their."
good,"The production is quick pace.  You learn plenty of skills, fast, ability to multi test, strong problem solving skill. Ability to work with others and in team group. You get communication skills, oral and written skills. Have to be able to work overtime as needed. Working at kellogg's it's okay. I liked that I had a okay job, with good pay and benefits."
good,"As the merchandiser you had to install an application to your phone to receive your schedule. This included the stores, location, how long it would take you at each location and all the tasks at hand. This app was not that user friendly and was not a stable app. You would also use another app to record and log your time. This app was not user friendly either. The task at hand such as, building displays, building end-caps,stocking the product and communicating with store management was straight forward and easy."
good,"like the way they operate. its a fast pace job and its very hot. the most enjoyable part about the job was, it dont take long to get in the job because its a temp to hire"

good,I merchandised products to different stores in the area. I worked at fasted pace to ensure the customer shelves were filled. Also maintained great customer service

good,Went to assigned stores to pack out deliveries and/or work any dead stock. Had different stores on the days I worked. The territory had fourteen sores.
good,"Kelloggs Snacks was a great place to work. They made a decision to change their business model and do away with their DSD model.

good,Fast paced work environment. Extensive on the job training. Challenging. . Excellent source of sales data and equipment to ensure success in the field.

good,Enjoyed working with all the people.  Working with management to help them solve problems within the plant.

good,"kelloggs bakery,,is really a great place to work   .only one thing they believe in safety,,.number one .an they believe in working togather win togather.the hardest part of the job is ..not eating too many good cookies.but the most enjoyable part is .you get to eat all you want but you only have to eat them inside the breakroom."

good,I learned about the OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency) and how to apply it throughout the plant.  I interviewed other employees for their knowledge of their area to effectively analyze the OEE.  This was challenging and stretched me to improve my communication skills.
good,"Kelloggs was an overall great company to work for. Great benefits, comfortable work environment, friendly people, and a very clean factory. You can trust your food coming from Kellogg's."

Participation in many charities and organizations was a strongly instilled part of the Kellogg Family. We as a plant called our co-workers family because that's how the majority of everyone feels. Sure miss my job and Kellogg family. Kellogg as a company would have employee appreciation day which made you feel that they cared about you as individuals. Sometimes the supervisors would cook and serve steaks to all the employee's which was really nice. It was not unusual for them to do little things, such as give t-shirts  or small gifts.My experience working for Kellogg's was very rewarding in many aspects.

The hardest part of the job for me maybe the long hours but it's well worth the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping and training people."

Each day you go to different stores, write different orders, communicate to different managers, sell different displays depending on what is on sale, a lot of things go into how to plan an effective and efficient day out in the field with the Kellogg's company.

They force the good employees out. Company is changing @ the Memphis Plant.

good,Very physical job... nice people and really good pay for part-time
good,Great company but management doesnt understand the business or know what their doing.
good,Kelloggs is a very nice company to work for. I am part time and am in search of a full time job.
good,I enjoy working for the company I was in Afghanistan little over threeyears. Vey good pay. My boss was the best boss I worked for .
good,"While working for Kellogg's, I was able to learn new job skills in an industrial work enviroment. Jobs ranged from working on the packing floor to the processing floor. For example, I worked a cereal box packing line, ran a fork-lift, and filled larged totes of cooked cereal to be shipped to other off-site locations. The five summer seasons that I worked there consisted of 16 weeks working 7 days a week. The shifts each week could range from 7 to 3 to 3 to 11 or 11 to 7. Kellogg's could make an employee work an extra 4 hours before or after."
good,I have enjoyed working for this company I just require a position somewhere there is chance for growth.
good,"El trabajar en Kellogg  company es bueno, pero es muy dificil que te promuevan y aunque  la persona  sea buena y conozca el área y actividades, no te consideran."
good,Great place to work! Have recommended many to work here. Moved from The finance team to the Order to delivery team. You learn quite a bit of how the business operates at these two levels.
good,"Was a great place to work until they decided to close there snack distribution down on Feb 8 2017. Putting thousands of people out of work. That's sales, merchandisers, management, warehouse, and drivers."
good,"The company is lead by the Kvalues, which dictate employee interactions with internal stakeholders and third party providers."
good,Kellogg is a great company to work for.  They are strong and solid in employment.  Supervisors carry much of the management workload.  Union environment makes relationships and communications somewhat difficult.
good,"A typical day at work can be full of excitement from start to finish! Not always good excitement. Extremely busy because of breakdowns, call-offs, accidents, phone calls, inquires, emails, etc..."
good,"i like my boss, lots of freedom, laid back, good part time job"
good,"Managed a Broker sales team(Acosta) for the 12 western states.Developed sales and budget and trade strategies.Largest and most profitable region in Kellogg Co."
good,"saying good bye at the end. I loved my co-workers, ex-pacts, soilders, and other contract employees."
good,"Be firm and be willing to walk away from jobs that will not honor or give regard to your abilities to perform your job titles, when requested to do differently. I liked the job alot, it’s that the company needed me to do different duties than what I was there for. If asked me to come back, I would only as a forklift operator. 😎"
good,"Great company, they have a strong belief in work like balance. Friday’s were half days, no emails sent out after 5pm and no email on weekends. Salary was on the low end"
good,Great place to work but 0 work/life balance. Great benefits and pay. For this area many never see this pay. However you have to balance what's more important
good,"The company closed down over a decade ago. The company did treat employees fair. unfortunately, the job closed down due to outsourcing during and everyone lost their jobs. The job did provide great benefits and perks for employees. The job provided several different shifts for those who need to work different hours."
good,It ok but it should pay staff management more money per hour and then when everything down it first come first serve so it most like u want work if there nothing available
good,"Typical day at work would be inspecting crackers or chips making sure they were ready for packaging.  I learned to work patiently and quickly to catch products from a moving conveyor.  Management made sure the job was done accurately and that the environment was always safe and clean to perform my job.  Workplace culture was always positive which helped with production and helped workers have a good attitude toward each other.  The hardest part of the job was walking a half a mile to get the the building where i worked everyday and standing in one spot to do a given job, once I got use to standing, it was bearable.  The most enjoyable thing about the job was the job was the easiest job I have ever had and the co-workers were team players. I would recommend the job to others, but also prepare them for the long walk ahead to get the their designated work area."
good,I enjoy working for Kellogg's. The pay and benefits are good. The work/life balance is not bad. I don't agree with the way they promote individuals...
good,"Each day is productive with new challenges. Each day brings a new challenge. I have learned how to handle many huge issues all at once. Management really has taught me to hold myself and my employees to high standards from Safety, Food Safety, Quality, Operations, Maintenance and Cleaning. Work place culture is very diverse and makes developing my employees even more enjoyable. Hardest part of the day is keeping everyone on the right task. Most enjoyable part of my job is developing my employees and watching them succeed."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo,ofrecen seguro médico,prestaciones,no único malo es que no dan vacaciones pues el trabajo es solo por temporadas, no ofrecen trabajo fijo."
good,"I liked meeting people within the company and people that I came into contact with in stores including store employees,management and customers that I met over the years."
good,learned a lot from co-workers and management. Great people to work for. Hard work pays off most of the time. Love the life as a retail Sales Rep. Learned a lot towards the last couple of yrs. love having a company car.
good,"I enjoyed being a Merchandiser.  I would travel from one location to another creating/removing product displays, stock shelves, maintain stock room section for our products.  Usually worked alone, on large changes supervisor would assist or another merchandiser."
good,great for change if you like moving around at a company but lots of forced overtime and low morale all supervisors use the same I should write you up tactic  for any infraction no matter how large or small
good,"13 hr shift "
good,Started early as my drive was long to the first stop of the day.  I enjoy the people to people contact with the store personal as well as the customers.
good,This position i hold is a casual position.Excellent for a second job. could not fairly rate security of job or benefits.
good,"La cultura de la compañía es inclusiva completamente, el ambiente de trabajo y las condiciones son muy agradables, se preocupan por los empleados y las condiciones en las que laboran."
good,I have a very supported team and the work/life balance is a major plus
good,"Originally it was Worthington Foods, which was a local food manufacturer. Kellogg acquired the company and eventually the local facility was closed."
good,"Union company and that has its ups and downs. Hard to get in, most times must know someone to get an interview. Currently on 7 day work week, with one weekend off a month. Overall good place to work and make decent money"
good,I think we should get paid more .. An i think people tht work there should pay more attention to their employees like they threat the hard worker like a lazy worker.. Should be the other way ..
good,"A great place to work good benefits great atmosphere to work in. The culture at Kellogg’s is a very diverse that’s one thing that a plus , different walks of life with different views on things. I really enjoy working for such a very innovative company that’s always evolving."
good,Enjoy making unhappy management in the stores happy....Selling in extra incremental displays...Working and traveling by myself was very relaxing and soothing
good,"It is a demanding job where you are forced at times to work 16 hours a day at the end of your 8 hour day. Great for people who want to work, don't have young families, and like union companies. I worked part-time so it wasn't as demanding of a job. You could work and get hours if they needed you, but was only required to work one Friday or Saturday a month 12 or 16 hour shifts to clean and the work was very physical. Not all full-time associates were present just managers and part-time workers. Things may have changed, but that is how it was when I worked there."
good,Tras un año trabajando en Kellogg tengo muy claro que es un lugar en el que me gustaría quedarme. El ambiente de trabajo es muy familiar y cercano pero se trata de un equipo muy competente en el que todo el mundo trabaja al máximo y de manera muy flexible Creo que es un gran sitio en el que aprender.
good,Working at Kellogg has been a great experience for me. I have learned multiple human resource skills and had the opportunity to enhance those skills in relaxed professional environment.
good,"This company was great to work for, it is a smaller place to most of the establishments owned by Kellogg',s but the people here knowing their time here is limited are still giving it 100% plus and still producing a quality product.  Major Kuddos to them.  Thanks for letting me be a part of the Team.  Left here for a better assignment was a temp employee."
good,"My time with the Kellogg company has been great. Its given me the opportunity to hone in on my customer service skills and to give 110% to my customer base. The Kellogg company has shown me what it is to provide quality product in a way that is pleasing to the eye of the consumer, and also to build relationships with companies that provide a clean, fast, and friendly atmosphere to consumers and its employees."
good,I wished The company would have kept all of merchandiser's and workers but unfortunately  they must do whats best for them.
good,"A typical day doesn't exist. Things change all the time. That is one of the things I love about working here. I've had some fantastic mentors and have been given the opportunity to create numerous multiple types of documents (receipe formulations, training documents, tracking spreadsheets). My co-workers are fantastic and the job really is even more fun because of them. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes the schedule causes you to work different shifts."
good,Great Company to work for very supportive to management and employee personal growth and development. My job was very challenging and demanding. I was very forunate to have great co workers which made my job enjoyable.  I also had a great staff of employees that dedicated themselves everyday.

good,"The CEO is brand new. Excited to see what changes will be made. Change has already began and moving quickly. Business is slow, but ideas are being presented and considered."
good,Una empresa mui comprometída a valorar el desempeño de los empleados!
good,12 hours wasn't a joke. I loved my job making cereal I could go home and tell my kids how I packed those cereal that they are eating and they loved it
good,Overall this company was great...as always though when changes come about the security and dedication to the teams that have provided success was not there.  I would work there again only after they work through the current Project K phase.
good,Working at Kellogg Company was a pleasant experience for me. My managers and co-workers know the meaning of teamwork and punctuality. Everyday we learned something new about one another as well as or jobs. The job really wasn't hard at all you just have to be pretty strong. The most enjoyable part for me was seeing everyone working hard and enjoying their job as well as getting the job done efficiently.
good,"I learn from every job that I have had, from working with Kellogg, I try to make the shelf look neat. I liked the fact that my hours were flexible esp. during the winter hours"
good,"Kellogg's was an amazing place to work.  There was always a lesson to learn, a mystery to figure out and a smile around the corner.  Management worked together to achieve great successes daily."
good,"Basic clerical work.  Setting up work to be put together for the drivers.  Actually going over the driver's paperwork when they return from their routes.  Filing, scanning, faxing, copying throughout the day.  Creating and maintaining excel programs.  Contacting stores, drivers or sales either by phone or email in order to either present information to them or to get it in order to do what is necessary to get the product into the stores.  The hardest part of the day was dealing with either sales or store receivers when they had unrealistic expectations for deliveries."

good,"Kellogg is a good company but my current facility has much opportunity. Due to budget cuts, many value added programs are no longer available to employees."
good,"Depending on the shift but typically work was steady unless your on the line. A lot of inventory to put away and work to do."
good,"Even  though the doors are closing, I cant think of a thing bad to say about this company. Employed only a year and some months"
good,Es una buena empresa  en la cual obtuve muchos logros y me ayudo a darme a conocer mas  sobre mi trabajo.
good,"Held many positions, had many supervisors, a typical day I can not explain because it depends of which department I was in."

good,Was there long to get to know people but from the time I was there there was alot of team work even with higher management. The managers sometimes stepped up to help.

good,"good job to start off if you're getting out of school or just want some extra money. But its hard to deal with people lack of work ethic. "
good,"Muy buen ambiente y comprensión"
good,Kellogg's is a very faced passed and cutthroat place to work. Safety is the most important aspect of working in this plant. Leadership has an open door policy and make it possible for others to com to their office with inquires or complaints.
good,"kellogg,s was an awesome job with great coworkers.  I worked as a forklift operator, moving product  throughout the warehouse.  loading, and unloading product."
good,"Kellogg is a great company to work for as an associate. I stocked shelves and set up displays for different stores that carried Kellogg products. While it is a job where you can work at your pace you are expected to stock a certain amount of stores. You are compensated for the gas between stores by the mileage. The only hard part for me was working alone all day, other than that i had no problems with the company or job."
good,Great place to work and I didn't want it to end.The management team was always helpful and attentive to the employees needs.My coworkers were great to work with and everyone seemed to care about doing a good job.

good,"At Kellogg's you learn to work alone and on a team through communication. You learn to problem solve, build displays communicate with customers with out managers. the hardest part about the job was learning each individual store and the way they do things. The Management was always there to provide guidance and there to answer and question. the most enjoyable part about the job to me was when I walked out of a store after servicing them, I felt they were completed and looking perfect to Kellogg's standards and the store's standards. Making the Customer happy was my #1 priority within the Kellogg's policies."
good,I have a great supervisor. A normal work day is usually calm but it can get a little busy. I enjoy working with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is waiting on time
good,the plant I worked at was the Battle Creek Michigan plant in which has closed on manufacturing any of the Kellogg products.  I haven't been at any other plant so I have no input
good,"Suuported sales, inventory management and transportation processes  working to limit product shortages and/or out-of-stock items. Updated all product listings in the system accelerating purchase order processing."

good,Fun and very clean place to work and the pay is good every week. The staff is very nice alone with the people I work with. The hardest part of my job is staying awake because I'm not doing very much movement.
good,"An enjoyable job working with a large team.  High demand and often not enough hours to complete the job.  The overall management of the company was top heavy.  The team members were the best part of the job and it was hard to leave the team.  Certain areas were treated differently, some better and some not so great depending on who was managing the area and responsible for the teams.  However, when a crisis occurred many of the teams I worked on treated each other with a high level of professionalism and respect and were quick to come to help when it was necessary."
good,company moved to Thailand for more money was a great job   happy places to work safe wish it still there I learn plenty there
good,The employees are friendly and helpful.  I was able to gain training on a variety of production machines and systems.  The work is fast paced. Clean and safety conscious work environment.  Able to maintain good communication and teamwork with co-workers in order to complete all duties.
good,Kellogg is an excellent company to work for.  The people and culture are phenomenal and the opportunity to move between roles is highly encouraged.  It is a great place for those with a hunger to learn.
good,"A typical day at Kelloggs would be signing in at the security office. The security officer will than make sure who you are and give you an ID badge. You walk to the entrance and  scan your badge. You than go to the locker room and put on your PPE. Your PPE is your safety glasses, your vest, hairnet, and earplugs."
good,"diverse employer, advancement & career growth, poor lower level management, excellent executive teams, above average sales force"
good,"Kellogg is a fun and busy place to work. There is a variety of jobs, with movement and advancement between departments encouraged. The K-Values culture makes for a better atmosphere, where people are respected and valued for the work they do. You really feel like your contributing to something great. In many departments, the hours are flexible, making work/life balance easier. We're also encouraged to live a healthy lifestyle, and have onsite gyms, after hours sports teams, and other activities to keep us engaged. My experience has been Grreeeaaat !"
good,"Working here really challenges my time management. I go to different grocery stores doing back stock and loads from trucks withing an approximate time. My manager is very laid back when it comes to his employees, so he understands all the circumstances that comes within trying to work on the sales floor during business hours. So it do take some pressure off of me, but I still work hard to hit the approximate time that he wants me to finish. "
good,"Its really a fun place to work.We have good benefits,the people are friendly and they reward us for good services.I also like the cultural fair we have every year for our 50 different nationalities that works there.The pay is also good."
good,"Here at Kellogg, everything is very fast paced and can change at a moments notice. There's so much to learn and the information is pretty easy to obtain as long as you pay attention and keep up. I have learned so much about so many different things. Everyday I learn something new. My co-workers are very up-beat and positive. Always greeting each other with a warm smile and a hello. "
good,Good hours and off on weekend. It is fairly stress free and the work is lightweight.
good,I built and maintained snack displays in grocery and big box stores.
good,"great place to work with great people, hated when they relocated"
good,Unloaded large amounts of school equipment into schools and installed everything. The boss was awesome and took excellent care of us. Enjoyed getting to travel.
good,Kelly Services placed me in positions that were suitable for me.
good,company is reducing service to stores and merchandising hours
good,Strong work etics and core values are paramount with Kellogg's. An employer whom I am proud to have the opportunity to work for. I love this company.
good,Kellogg's is a great family friendly company that lives the heritage of the founder W. K. Kellogg.  The entire organization takes care of each other and works to make our planet a better place to live.
good,"Unfortunately, this position no longer exists, but when I was a merchandiser, I had a lot of freedom in my daily life. You had a general list of stores you would visit, a time frame of when to go to those stores, what you needed to do, and that was it. You would track your mileage on an app, clock in when you arrived, and check into each store for timing/mileage. I was never treated unfairly, but we were overworked sometimes. Expectations were a little outrageous, but I needed the money so I never minded working thirteen hour days. You would typically stay at one store for two to four hours, but occasionally you would need to set up a display, rotate all of the product, and put an order away, and you'd end up staying in that one store for close to six hours. Then you would still have to go to four or five other stores. It got exhausting very quickly, but you were paid very well, had PTO, medical/dental/vision insurance, and still got paid enough weekly for it to be well worth it."
good,Kellogg is a great organization to work for. Their 401k has been far superior to any retirement investment I've been in at previous employers. The teamwork has been above par to what I've experienced in the past.  Wyoming plants have not received any new work in five years leaving the sustainability in question.
good,"Work was great, hated to have to move away.  It was always busy with plenty of opportunity to work overtime if I wanted.  My boss was very strict, but always had our backs if we followed protocol."
good,"I always felt Kellogg's put employees first and provided ample opportunities for them to grow and learn with in the organization. Had an excellent work culture with mature colleagues. "
good,I would love to work for Kellogg's again because they pay more money in copack I worked as a palletized and machine operator I work there for five years I was under paid Thats why I left
good,"Addressing emails received, instructing junior staff and consultants in both programming (ABAP) and configuration.  Leading projects.  Being a team member on projects.  A diverse environment."
good,work life balance great pay! everything was great until they changed their business model and eliminated positions. management was great. time was flexible to accommodate family needs.
good,Kelloggs was a great place to work I travel a lot.Kellogg paid for my food every day the mangers was great to work with .Kellogg provided a company car for the me the gas was free .
good,During my internship in this company I loved the great people and all the coaching they provided by letting me work in such a big company and experience the work life.
good,"I enjoyed the job ,I likes my boss, but I was laid off due to the grocery strike .They laid off the employees that were fairly new! I had a sales rout I went from store to store doing the ordering and puting products up to the shelves,also customer service."
good,Located in Battle Creek for many years until my Finance Department role was restructured and outsourced to a third party.  Unable to relocate to Grand Rapids.
good,"Easy going job, work at your own pace. Not too much of a workload. The best part of the job is you can start when you feel is suitable, the earlier the better."
good,"El laborar directamente en el Mercado te permite conocer la situación actual del mismo, interactuar directamente con ellos para de esta forma poder ofrecer a las distribuidoras los productos del catálogo idóneos para la sociedad."
good,it was a good company but they laid everyone off.  They were very good with letting us know what was happening and how long it would take and gave us time to prepare to find new jobs.
good,"My job as a merchandiser at Kellogg involved stocking and rotating shelves.  I think the upper management is pressured to push sales as with any company.  I believe that some of the sales goals were unattainable.  It made the merchandiser job more difficult due to the amount of backstock.  The things I liked the best were the freedom and flexibility.  I didn't punch a clock so I was never late.  My boss trusted me to be where I needed to be when I needed to be there.  As I got older, it got a little harder to do the physical aspects of the job but it kept me in good shape."
good,"great place  to work "
good,"Ordering for 15 stores and them merchandising "
good,"I really enjoyed my short lived employment with Kellogg. The atmosphere was great and the management was very good at what they do. I wish I was keeping my role as the company changes and laid off most of their sales staff, but I move on now to a brighter future elsewhere. I would gladly return to Kellogg someday if they required my services."
good,"this was a great company to work for. it was a great learning experience, and i meet a lot of great people. great hours, and i loved the fact that they trusted me enough to not have people hoovering checking my every move."
good,its a great company but sorry to say that they have decide to get rid of the dsd department within the company. the company has had this department for many years and its sad to see people lose there jobs.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kellogg's.  The upper management was very approachable and seemed to care about what you had to say.  They work very hard to accommodate life events and promote a good work-life balance. "
good,Good place to work. Benefits in general were great. Clean and safe place. No complaints. Machine operator. Warehouse. Fork lift pads and forks. Jockey truck moving trailers. Cooking corn and frosted flakes.  Corn dryer operator. Member of safety comittee. First Aid Brigade. Trainer of rolling stock before retirement.
good,Working at Kellogg is a wonderful experience.  They provide the tools necessary to be productive and successful in your role.  The only thing that could be re-worked is the constant change in direction moving forward.  It does seem frequently that we re-structure which does make working there a tad uneasy.
good,Kellogg's has been a great place to work and I have definitely improved as a dales representative in the year and a half that I have worked for the company .
good,"I am going to stores and talk with the management about our product and resolve any problems."
good,Go into work about 15 minutes early to get breakfast that is made right there for you. then spend my day doing my job. 1 hour lunch break so i could go home and see my kids and eat lunch with them. everyone is friendly.
good,I enjoyed my time with this company based on the fact that I felt that corporate actually cared about each employee individually. I started as a temporary employee and was given the opportunity to elevate my status. The diversity of the workforce was the best part for me because I was new to the area and it gave me the experience of getting to know the community

good,"* The day starts at 6:00 am checking email."
good,"Long Hours,Installation,machine maintenance. Monitored the production line for problems such as pile ups. Attached labels and lot numbers. Cleaned oiled and made repairs to Machinery"
good,"Top-notch work environment and leadership the majority of my time at the company.  Challenging, difficult work brought the best out in most employees ... and keep the adrenalin flowing!  Competing for multimillion dollar Defense contracts was  thrill and made teamwork, communication and trust tantamount.  The work/family balance was not ideal due to the type of work being done and the required deadlines and effort of work. This was NOT a 40-hour work week, home with mom/dad and the kids every weekend.  My typical day during times we were writing proposals was 70-80 hours a week, with more than a few Saturdays and Sundays thrown in for good measure. Hard work ... long hours ... but rewarding!"

good,"I loved what I did, it like working out without having to got to a gym.  I stocked shelves of local grocery stores with products, unloaded truck items to place on store shelves or into the back stock and occasionally took product orders for the supervisor.  I worked at my own pace and there was no time limit.  I worked with myself, not that I don't like working with people, but I was a part time merchandiser and filled in where the supervisor couldn't do.  The hardest part of the job was trying to organized the back stock in date order and keeping it that way.  My supervisor was wonderful, usually communicated by phone."
good,"I start my day by going to a store unloading a truck that has product on it and taking it to the shelves to fill the out of stock item. Then I go and complete working my back stock. After that I move on to the next store. I feel that the communication between management and employees is getting better. The hardest part of my job is trying to convince my 1st in line superior that I do know what I am talking about and that I could help him more if he would allow me to. I really like my job with this company and I feel that it is a good company , however I see that some of the responsibilities of my 1st in line contact needs to be delegated a little more, and that this individual needs to let his part time employees know a little more about what is going on so that when we go into a store and are asked questions we can answer them accurately, in addition to that we can also let department managers and store managers know what is going on , what is completely out and why we are using a replacement for a certain type of product"

good,Working at kelloggs was a good experience. Everyone there was so friendly they treat everyone like family. Once you get there they put you on a machine that's shooting out ice cream cones constantly.

A lot of work for one person but it can be done with practice.
