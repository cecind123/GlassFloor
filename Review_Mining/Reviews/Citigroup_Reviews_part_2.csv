In our role as a leader the most important thing is the daily touch point with them or the coaching session. I have learned that being a team leader does not only require you being good with the process itself but also having a good people skills. The most enjoyable part of being a team leader is when you see your team leaders moving up.

good,Good reimbursement for work delivered. Opportunities for the most part.

good,"Citi is a great place for work life balance in most areas. You get to work with some great people on a global scale. "
good,"The managers and co-workers are laid back and easy going.  The culture is great compared to other companies especially in this line of work, you run the risk of becoming very bitter.  Citi makes it bearable, I do think it's a fair company to work for."
good,"Citi has a high quota to hit and the environment is stressful as it is very fast. We are more like part of a big machine running the MNC, Citibank. However compensation through salary is highly attractive."
good,"As an expecting and now new parent, I was affording the necessary flexibility to work from home outside of the paid paternity leave that is provided. Additionally, my management team created an inclusive and team oriented environment where all opinions were valued and nobody was to feel minimized."
good,"I would say Citi is a great place for you if you liked a fast paced working environment, In my current role I take about 80 calls a day sometimes more depending on the day. I take calls from clients about there accounts. I have had 2 managers at Citibank and I have loved both of them they will do anything to help you out. I would say the hardest part about my job is not always knowing what all the policy and procedures are and when you have a angry impatient clients that's when it gets tuff."
good,"Citi gave me the opportunity to share what I learned in previous positions and show that I was a team player.  Once I showed my ability to do the job I was applying for, Citi gave me an opportunity to compete with outside talent for the position.  The family culture is real and not just words on paper."
good,Citi Corp is a wonderful place to work with.. the leave policy and all there IJP feasibility are mind blowing.. though the mentioned work hours are 9 hours we would be require to work close to 10-11 work at some times..
good,Citi Fintech is an exciting part of the Global Consumer Bank as it continues to try to transform an old bank into a digital financial service provider.  The culture is great (think Google at a bank) and management is supportive.
good,Typical 8-5 at a bank with many days of overtime. Great management however training could be improved heavily. The work is very interesting and the coworkers are great to be around.
good,Citi has developed a great workplace culture. People generally look to collaborate and work together for the good of the company. Overall it is a good company to work for.
good,Working at Citi was an overall great experience and I had many friends there. I enjoyed the communication with outside contacts and building relationships with them.
good,"For the most part of my time at Citi, I've learned a lot about accounting type work and processing items. The hardest part of my job is not having a lot of communication with different people."
good,I really have nothing bad to say. I love my job! I have nothing else to say.  Seriously the jobs a great job I can't say any more about it. Unless you're they are and you enjoy it and feel good about your job.
good,Fast Paced.  Manager worked with you and really knew her stuff.  Diverse work environment.  Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.  Workflow was excellent.
good,"The company has great management and multiple opportunities to advance. However they are very reluctant in working with school schedules. The C in Citi stands for change, the company is constantly changing."
good,"Its a very great company but depends on the management. Envinoment was great, cafeteria is expensive. Co-workers was good too."
good,"fun place to work  great opportunity  to advance in your career  friendly place .. great health care benefits  401 k  health  care   vision "
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a challenging position that provided a personal reward. The work/life balance policy is excellent and the benefits package and paid time off are great as well.
good,Citibank was a great first job to start with and I greatly appreciate it. Citibank has endless jobs opportunities within itaelf. If you felt like you didn't do well with one thing there was always something else to try. Management works with you the best they can to make your work experience the best it can be
good,"I worked five 8 hour shifts, Monday through Friday with one rotational Saturday. It was probably the easiest job I have ever had. You sit there taking calls, and if slow they offered VTO. There wasn't anything hard about this job, but really busy days would wear you out. The atmosphere was great. Most managers were on point with their teams."
good,"My typical day at work involves handling Employee queries, conference and video calls, attending an industry meeting. I have learned to be highly organized over the last 8 years whilst here and have had to opportunity to interact with Employees across 100 countries. The workplace culture is great and all Employees are respected. Ethics and professionalism is very key and vital here. The hardest part of my job is limited growth opportunity and cap on compensation and the most enjoyable part of my job is the ability to attract, motivate and retain talent. I am passionate about Talent Management."
good,My only complaints is the amount of pay which is about $13.34 per hr. Benefits are amazing  comfotable work environment. I prefer a more active face to face job since sitting 40 hours a week in the same cubicle is mundane.
good,"I really enjoy citi however after putting alot of work in I have progressed very little and my salary doesn't reflect the effort I put in.I respect the management style and working conditions, however low pay has lead to high staff turnover."
good,"Citi offers great benefits and look for ways to make the atmosphere for the employees enjoyable, for example; adding ping pong table and a gym You have to have patience and great customer service skills when assisting the cardmembers. The hardest part of the job is listening to the cardmembers disrespect you verbally."
good,Its a good place to work if it is permanent position. The job is challenging but fruitful. The typical day's work is fast paced early in the morning but a little relaxed as the day goes by. The workplace culture is very endearing and fun to be and work.
good,"I was in collection department in this bank."
good,"I worked for Citi in several capacities over 25 years, met a lot of great people and learned a lot along the way.  Decent pay, good benefits and 401k.  Most of my career the work was fast paced and challenging.  Built a lot of positive customer relationships as well as relationships with co-workers and all my managers.  While the workplace culture could sometimes be cut-throat between peers, it was a good experience builder.  The hardest part of the job was just the last few years of not knowing when your job was coming to and end due to company restructuring.  Knew it was coming, but it didn't make it any easier when it ended.  Will miss my co-workers.  Citi provided ample vacation time, sick days, holidays.  The only drawback was the lack of being able to move up within the company easily in the division of the company I was in."
good,"Very fast paced, great benefits. lots of shifts to choose from. "
good,"I was a secretary in Citibank for approx 10 years. My duties were typing letters, reports and memos. On a daily basis I would answer the telephone, filing and admin."
good,Citicorp help grow as an individual and as a people's manager.  Excellent quality of work and challenging opportunities provided is a major plus point
good,"If you are looking for a job where you get to wear many hats and never be bored, this is the place for you.  The schedule can be challenging at times for young families but the pay scale and opportunity for advancement could be worth it."
good,"Fast paced"
good,Citi has found the balance between work and life and is striving to perfect it even more. I have honed myself to be a well versed participant in society under Citi's watch and I have never been more proud of my accomplishments that Citi has opened up for me.
good,"Citi platform is very familiar for work and excellent management to grow with the organization."
good,"As a Business Analyst at Citi, my job is very relaxing as I am 100% telecommuting. My direct manager is great as he is understanding and allows for complete home life balance. The compensation package for this role is also very generous."
good,Great place to work good benefits .steady pay but will take time to advance with company. Long training and long days on phone and in front of the computer
good,"I joined as a fresh graduate, I got a lot of experience here and learnt a lot from my colleagues. Great environment, good people. I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"We as a closer have a stress day almost every day ( I do Like that) because make my day go fast , almost every day we have to stay overtime to close a loan with Issue."
good,"Traffic was hideous going over the Buckman to get there every morning and it was a collections role handling inbound and outbound calls. Citi would call clients who had just billed with a perfect payment history prior up to four times a day. This led to mostly clients who were extremely upset, some unaware that they carried a Citi Card ( Citi Services Sears, The Home Depot, Best Buy, and more), who would say extremely nasty things. Managers constantly would change I went through 6 or 7 managers working there for a 1 year 7 months.  The benefits are great health, dental, and vision wise I just felt like that's what holds most people to the job.Working one day out of the weekend was required. Another bank was paying $3 higher for a similar role.Breaks were 15 mins you get 2 and a 30 min lunch if you're working a full shift but they have to be taken off the floor so moving to where your going shaves off time and the Cafeteria has great food but it takes at least 10 minutes to get it so shave that out too.  As far as advancement there are people who are super-dedicated to the job and they seem to be the ones who are looked at, and these people go above and beyond doing things managers do and when you talk to them they seems extremely overwhelmed so it's like unless you're willing to stress yourself out to move up then it's going to them and you can't transfer out until after 6 months to a Year and You can't go up or transfer if you are on a performance improvement plan. Overall great job if you have patience and can stand sitting for long periods of time but it's not for everyone"
good,Citi is a 200 year old organisation and a good place to work and its also a excellent place to showcase your potential and get recognized for the same.
good,"Working at Citibank was very rewarding until the economy slipped in 2008 and layoffs began.  At that point, the work and relationships started to change.  People were very protective of what they knew and protected their jobs.  This did eventually subside and it became of wonderful place to work once again."
good,"very friendly environment, coworkers help each other and the job itself is not very complicated. The only downside is repetition and if you work long hours."
good,"Great, clean campus- good work environment. Managers are great, do not micromanage.. There's always activities to get the employees involved. Work/Life balance is highly prioritized by management."
good,"In my 7 year stint in Citibank I have come across cynosures / visionaries in the senior management in the organization  who would take over challenges and other boulders with their heads held high and has always provided a platform  for continuous  learning. The best part about being in the bank was the option to reach out to anyone across the hierarchy without any hindrance , the management would welcome ideas and respond to queries irrespective of your grade or position in the organization."
good,"He estado muy agusto trabajando , cuidan mucho a los empleados."
good,Minha experiência no Citi foi de 2 anos e para mim foi muito bom conhecer como funciona um banco e egressa no mercado de trabalho pela primeira vez.

good,"Citibank gives you a lot of room to grow within the company. I work in small business and I take incoming calls 30-50 in a day to assist clients with all of their banking needs from balances, account analysis, trouble shooting remote check deposit errors, online help, cash management products, etc. The company is diverse and the hardest part of the job is not being able to assist clients with their banking needs due to system access issues."
good,I learned the importance of team spirit and making sure the work was completed in a timely fashion from my staff and we built an environment of unity.
good,"Honestly a great workplace. Compenben package alone is highly competitive, perhaps one of the best around today. Daily challenges mostly lay in the volume, but teammates and management are supportive, and work can be flexible."
good,"Strong sense of customer service "
good,The hardest part of the job is the steep learning curve as well as the amount of learning that needs to be done to complete daily tasks. This can also be the best part of the job as you are never bored and staring at the clock each day waiting for it to strike 5.
good,"good work culture, professionalism & dynamic product offering.The company is a behemoth in financial services & adapts to the varied client base & designs the product offering."
good,"Performed teller specific duties such as cashiers checks, safety deposit boxes, account check-ups, credit product sales, phone inquiries and personal banker referrals.  Management seemed to rotate frequently but for the most part I enjoyed the job.  A fast paced environment with a lot to learn and frequent handling of currency is enjoyable."
good,obviously this company is well known and in business a long time.  they do run like a well oiled machine.  pay is not great but they gave me a long career with plenty of change.

good,"It was a very fun place to work, good management and really liked co workers."

good,"Good learning exposure with End to end knowledge especially in Asia-Pacific team"
good,"Trabalho tranquilo"
good,Trata-se de uma instituição de grande porte enfrentando grandes dificuldades de adaptação no atendimento a empresas clientes. Os critérios utilizados acabavam por dificultar o início e a manutenção de negócios identificados e negociados entre as partes. As decisões eram tomadas com muita morosidade e atrasos o que dificultava todo relacionamento.
good,"Good place for work and friendly environment."

My pay was fair for my position.  Enjoyed working with the customers.  The hardest part of the job was selling credit cards and loans."
good,The company offers above average benefits especially in terms of vacation time and sick time. In addition the amount of training for your position is also well above what you would expect from most employers.
good,"A great place to work."
good,"It's hard to fit in, when coming from other large financial institutions; but Citi's typology testing and Risk Controls are dead on.  My direct Manager was excellent.  I wish I could say that all was perfect, but I will just say that there were quite a few politics to overcome."

Citi is an excellent place to develop and learn new skills across multiple financial products. Citi also offers the opportunity to work in multiple locations around the world.

good,Very good benefits but depending on location of the branch is very different environment. Very fast pace and not very enjoyable.
good,"The typical day of work was normal, I learned a lot in the area I work like (terminology, systems, application, more)."
good,"The hardest part about working in collections is basically being abused for a living, and only making $13 an hour while doing so. Management is only concerned with compliance, not the well being of their employees, but the Client First Agents look out for each other, so it makes the job a little easier."
good,The people I worked with we good and helpful   when  there would be and  issue. The education was continues and helpful to maintain high job performance.
good,"A typical day at work at my most recent job, I expected to be presented with goals for the day and work really push to meet those goals. I learned to work as a team with co-workers so we can all meet our daily goals. My co-workers present made work atmosphere much better due to their friendliness and helpfulness. Sometimes, the hardest parts of the job was talking with customers who seemed to not have their problems resolved the first or second time when discussed. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping clients with problems and finding better solutions."

good,The hardest part of the job is just making sure you don't have too much unaccounted  Time the best part of the job is that you're helping people all day and the coworkers are very friendly even though some may be nosy and also it's hard to run into someone that is negative everybody I know there are very positive people as well as uplifting
good,Working for Citi was the most difficult job I've ever had.  This was a call center and I worked for the credit card division.  My job for the last 8 years I worked there was to deal with irate people who were upset with the first representative they spoke to.  This was money we were discussing so customers were very upset; loud voices and profanity were daily occurrences.  Citi provided conflict management classes which helped quite a bit.  Citi also gave us the empowerment to lower interest rates and waive fees and finance charges but there was a fine line between satisfying the customer and impacting the bank.
good,"Citi is a good employer, specially if you are starting your career path and you are looking for a place with lot of opportunities and interesting roles. It's a company were you can gain diverse experience and knowledge. My hard work and efforts were always noticed and awarded.

I am successful if the team is successful, and its a phenomenal feeling when as a TEAM we come together competitively and provide wonderful sales, service, and operations!"
good,"The tagline ""Citi that never sleeps"" may be quite realistic as the culture involves multi-racial counterparts.. Asia, US, EMEA... we are always busy... needing to be productive."
good,"Great workplace and a platform to learn about Canadian Financial marketplace. Job hours could be challenging, overall a productive place to learn and grow."
good,"Working with Citibank is awesome , but time has come to move for another opportunity.      "
good,"Demanded meeting new potentials everyday and trying to source banking products which included credit cards, personal loans, "
good,"Citi has been  a tremendous company to work for. Has offered me the opportunity to advance, learn and experience worldwide opportunities. "
good,"Citi has a great benefits package, strong focus on employee well-being, flexible work arrangements available (I was able to work from home in a higher level analysis job).  big company with good potential for advancement and experience in different functions. but also so big that it's hard to get things done quickly and there are too many people involved in everything.  There is a strong focus on the customer across the company."
good,At the time of employment it was very hard to sell a product I did not believe in. They expected us to sell refinance mortgages at a time when the market was very bad.
good,"Respeto por las personas y por el trabajo."
good,"Enjoy the work environment and the people I work with. I expanded my project management skill, research, and analytical thinking. This job has given me the opportunity to develop leading skills by allowing me to manage teams and facilitate new hire trainees."

good,"Excelente en desarrollo de procesos, control, gestión documentaria, etc., buen ambiente laboral compatible con la vida familiar, estudios, hijos."
good,"As a systems analyst I was expected to be able to work without supervision. My boss was in another state.  As a team and/or individually we decided what chronic issue to peruse.  Each team member possessed a common skill set, but we all brought a unique skill set to the team.  As I identified and worked through chronic issue, I mentored technicians needing assistance or escalations.  I used SharePoint as a medium to document processes for resolving specific issues as well.  This database could be use by all technicians as a reference.  The hardest part of my job was correcting user roaming profiles, that were set up incorrectly by the automated system.  Up to 100 agents could be hired in one day, and I wanted they accounts to work by the time they started training.  As I worked through these I teamed up with the Security group and the group responsible for the automation to find a solution.  The most enjoyable part of my job was correcting and end users issues, or resolving a chronic one that affect  10 to 1000 people at a time."
good,"Hired as an agent of change, the company has afforded me volumes of opportunities to be an instrument in the delivery of innovation and improvement programs within the shared service organization I belong."
good,good work culture. good benifits and compensations. The working hours were long though. Promotions wer not easy to get.Hard work but good work .Safe working environment

good,Would recommend this company to anyone looking for a friendly stable work environment. Great health benefits and opportunity for advancement.

good,I enjoyed working for the company. Good company benefits. Room to advance. Stayed busy. Annual trainings to assure you keep updated on the latest laws / procedures. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in your job function depending on demands of the company. the most enjoyable part was helping other stay in there homes.
good,A good place to work with lots of online and HR training. Fun to work with other nations and very supportive management. A good support from Teammates.
good,"A typical day at work, answering phone calls, customer's concern regarding their loans. What I learned was, the terms and conditions regarding their loans, repayment plan etc. Management is good, because they reached out with their employees, conduct team buildings. My co-workers are like my second family, we value each other. The hardest part of the job is when the customer refuse to accept the resolution and they only want to hear what they to want to hear. And the most enjoyable part of the job is when you resolve the customers concern and identify their hidden needs."
good,"Very strict on compliance, a lot of changes, very supportive, provide development to reach high goal, Some managers do not know how to coach."

good,"Una gran escuela es materia de prevención de AML, buen ambiente laboral y organizativo."
good,"Every day was very busy, that made the day go by fast. Management was very understanding, with Work/Life Balance. My co workers where great."
good,Citibank was a wonderful place to work with a good amount of exposure in various fields at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was its challenging nature of work which lead to stretch beyond an employee's limits and working out of the comfort zone resulting in getting a robust base.
good,It was pleasure working with Citibank NA. It was highly professional environment with loads of controls and compliances. A good brand image makes me pride.
good,"начало дня доработка пакетов документов обзвон"
good,On a typical work day I would audit over 1000 deposited checks. I was looking to make sure that it was deposited for the correct amount and that it actually posted correctly. I would also answer calls from branch managers to help them solve problems with customers accounts. I learned a lot about accounting working at Citi Bank. The hardest part about working there was verifying some deposits that were not scanned correctly. Having to go further and research those items could take a full day. I enjoyed this job because it gave me a great deal of work experience.
good,"- good environment with friendly people"

good,"Citi is a very large company and a great company to work for, as far as benefits are concerned.  At my branch I was earning a great salary and throughout my employment the struggling economy created a lot of stress for me while trying to reach my goals.  The company did not change their expectations of the employees to reflect the current financial situations of people in our state and throughout the nation.  This made my position very high-stress, and although it was manageable it was not the most desirable working environment."

good,A typical day at work can be very fast paced or slow depending on the call flow. I learned how to handle difficult situations for customers fast and effectively. Enjoyed working with others on my team. The hardest part of the job is when you are not able to help everyone for example they may need an extenstion on their due date due unexpected circumstances and they do not qualify. The most enjoyable part is when you can make someone's day.

Training and development of my staff was the highlights of this role."

good,"Working for Dealing Room support services"
good,"If you’re hard working and needing good pay, flexibility and benefits this is a good place, but keep your head down. The company is currently changing they are removing certain departments and laying off whole divisions and sending these jobs overseas to Manila and Mumbai.The pay is good but the high turn over rate is real. Don’t try and make friends, don’t trust anyone in management. Be weary of people on your team. Everyday there is backstabbing, lying and drama at this location. Just do your job and stay low but being straightforward even that won’t guarantee you no drama from management as with any job."
good,"An excellent professional environment, with highly intellectual people."
good,"Very conducive environment to work at. Nice colleagues and boss. "
good,I loved my job at Citi.  The people were great.  When I got laid off the severance was a great help.  Citi made sure to take care of employees.  Benefits were grea

good,I love the opportunities they have to get bonuses. The fact that they are always looking for ways to make it easier for their employees to come to work from the car pool to the games to the on site child care facilities. It was a wonderful place to work. They are always on top to make it a better place to work especially with the suggestion box and the career mentor program they have.
good,"The pay rate is not reflecting the duties and the intensity of the job."
good,"Citi is a very good place to work, management is great. High pressure environment in collections expected to meet strict guidelines to pass calls and compliance"
good,"No time for decent detail review, will have it private."
good,"Great opportunities."
good,Citi always emphasises on latest technologies and it's implementation. Gives you a free hand at problem solving. Work place has a low profile in Mississauga.
good,"-Busy day while having fun."

good,Love my job there tooo....Great Benefits - Nothing to complain about....Love it there as well....Great CEO;s  Great Co Workers - Good Flexible Hours -  Great
good,"Citi, overall, is a great company to work for and looks great on ANY resume as they have a global imprint. One question you must ask yourself in deciding to work for Citi is would you rather have a larger salary or benefits package? Citi offers a great and expansive benefits package. From healthcare, to 401k and an employee discount portal for retailers, you could do a lot worse in the benefits department. However, if you're more interested in having a larger take home paycheck, well that can be difficult to obtain at Citi when compared to similar positions at competing banks. The saying amongst employees is the only way to make money at Citi is to leave and come back. Annual raises are usually pennies, based on their evaluation system, and even if you're promoted the pay increase places you near the bottom of the payscale regardless of experience and education. It is not uncommon for outside candidates to receive a starting salary that exceeds current employee's salary."
good,I loved working at Citi Bank they had GREAT benefits & a fun working environment. I loved the people I worked with as well as my schedule! Unfortunately I was laid off along with he rest of the Mail Room department. But I have made coworkers that I now call friends for life.
good,"Management is good, work life balance is excellent, strong focus on new technologies and trainings & development. Good place to start career in investment banking domain."
good,not a bad job just really boring but good for the pay. managers like monica on fraud can get annoying but it is what it is. if you want to move up you could with pushing for it i guess.
good,"Workplace culture is always a fun and enjoyable environment, hardest part of the job are the customers. Management is cut throat and needs better training."
good,"When I started working for Citi, I was a normal employee. "
good,Citi is a good place to work and you are encouraged to explore new positions within and outside nigeria When I was there the pay was quite poor but i heard they have improved this.

good,"Very relaxed, sometimes fast-paced. They are good with updating procedures and having weekly meetings with their team. But it is very hard to move up within the company."
good,Citi is a great company to work for. They take many steps to make sure the employees are satisfied. Plenty of room from growth however the industry is always changing:
good,"Some unit managers were better than others, The best unit manager pushed me to succeed suggested me for special programs based on my performance.  I was given independence and was a valuable resource to other agents. Citi offered incentives based on a number of factors including quality, the incentives were tiered, I started doing inbound collections handling all stages of delinquency. Was selected to handle retail cards that was offered by Citi. Was given the tools need to  determine the best outcome for clients. Had options to offer payment programs when needed, was able to negotiate late fees, finance charges, and match payment options. However, this later changed and was not able to negotiate, felt like our hands were tied in collections when attempting to help clients. A new department was created that setup payment programs when needed, however all the questions and information was expected to be obtained by the contacting agent, but was forced to transfer call to the payment programs department. Then upon transfer to that department credit was given to the agent who actually setup the arrangement. Pre-Lit department was more researching and was very hard to make contact with clients. Was chosen to be a work at home agent. I was held to a higher standard than other agents, and really pushed to excel by several of my managers. However, the last manager did not want to allow me to participate in special programs that I was specifically requested for."
good,I love Citibank a lot. The company is fair and has been very good to me. We tend to have a tight knit working environment and it isn't strange for my manger to pay for lunches or let me come in late or go home early if I request.
good,"Citi is a great place to work.  The benefits are wonderful; vision, dental, and health.  The management that I dealt with provided/recommended resources that made me/would make me a better representative.  Citi has employee luncheons; they encourage employees to recognize other employees for their work as well as management recognizing employees.  Citi allows representatives to flex their time, which creates a good work/life balance."
good,"I was one of the highest producers in the department of HRIS completing 500+ files a month.  Unfortunately, my mom came down with cancer and I had to tend to her in a different city so I had to resign.  I tried getting back into the department, I know they are hiring but temporary which is fine for me because I'd just like to get back in with Citi.  But I have not heard anything."

good,"A typical day was 100% on the phone trying to collect on delinquent accounts.  I learned a lot through our 6 week training on empathy and   trying to connect with the customer to obtain payment. I feel like management was spread a little thin, but they were all very helpful and pleasant. The hardest part of the job is trying to collect from people going through a hard time in their life, loss of loved ones, medical issues, or unemployment. The most enjoyable part were the friends I made."
good,"The company is amazing to work for, the people in the center are great, fun, and love to help each other. It's a very inclusive environment. Management is very helpful, engaging, and easy to approach in all departments."

good,"I have nothing to say but good things in general about the company. As the company goals changed, I don't think my objectives changed with the company so I didn't adjust too well with the company. I learned a lot about what I needed to do to manage my financial goals for the future. I was able to achieve freedom from debt and enjoyed all the great benefits the company offered. My last few years I worked remotely. The company was more stressful then than actually being on site. Pay rate was great and I miss it, but some of the job requirements compromised my beliefs about how you treat older customers...."
good,Productive and fun workplace. They hire too many young people straight out of high school which creates drama. Opportunity to advance within the company
good,"Enjoyed working among co-workers who were not only willing to help in situations that became complicated or not covered by policy, but also willing to take time from their busy workload to educate a co-worker with understanding the how and the why to resolve a problem or situation."
good,"I've worked for many call centers and for the inbound CSRs, it is pretty laid back. I dealt with the Costco transition, and most customers were understanding and nice. Some can be rude, but you get that anywhere. As for management, they're always offering some sort of incentive to appease the employees and I feel like most of them genuinely care."
good,Great place to work.  I worked as a financial analyst and interacted with the marketing department.  They would tell me the way they were operating and I managed how they had to manage it financially

good,Citi is a good place to work.  The culture is diverse.  Citi has come a long way when it comes to putting their employees first instead of the bottom dollar.  The employee's voices are being heard and changes are being made.  Overall it's a good place to work with great benefits and wonderful people.

good,"Overall very good organisation to work with. Good working environment. I have learnt good credit assessment skills, presentations skills. Working with Citi is smooth."
good,"The hardest part of the job was seeing people lose their homes over changing their lifestyle to afford the home. Losing your job does affect your ability to pay. But cutting down on luxuries can help you still afford your home. A lot of our clients felt that the luxuries such as a new fully loaded vehicle was a necessity, not their homes, utilities, food, etc. Trying to change this culture and that their mortgage should take priority in most cases was like hitting a brick wall."
good,Everyday is a learning experience.  Have learned and appreciated the BPO industry especially it is led by competitive management - outlining clear goals and processes.
good,"A place where you'd love to be. Being part of this company help me grow, on the path that I chose to excel. The team would guide you and shake you through."

I enjoyed helping people find solutions to their credit card problems. I have worked for banks and insurance companies w collections. I enjoy a fast pace environment and believe I will be a asset to any company. I am a hard working emplyee and very dedicated to my job.
good,"I worked there for 5 years. Good retirement benefits, good salary, "
good,"Citi provide COLLABORATIVE work place,"
good,Would recommend Citi as long as it is not customer service. Department has a very high turnover rate and does not seem to be able to keep people. Unrealistic goals.

Management at my current branch is great and they support me with any questions or concerns I may have. My co-workers are hard working and supportive of each other. I have no issues working with any of them. The hardest part of my current job would be dealing with the large volume of transactions on a daily basis which regularly exceed 120+ daily. The most enjoyable part of my current occupation would be helping customers solve any sort of issues they may have and going to extra mile to make sure they are satisfied."

good,Collaborated with head of the department to understand customer needs and gather their feedback to better serve them. The colleage were willing to share their experience with you and it's the first time that I learned that data analyze is critical to the business. The hardest part of the job is that you should learn as fast as you can..
good,"This is a Focused and Productive workplace. Full of diversity and different cultures. The main focus of the company is the client from beginning to end of day. Making sure all their needs are met, Accounts are being taking care as necessary as well as educating them on other products and services.

I've learned patients, Effective communicating skills, How to change a negative conversation into one the client will enjoy, attention to detail, and timeliness is everything. The best thing about the job are all the people you meet and relationships you can build. Networking. The hardest part about the job is keeping the focus to talk on the phone for nine hours a day. Teamwork and a great manager plays a big part in day to day duties."
good,"Since I've been with Citibank, I have had a great experience. The worst part is that they hired me from a temp agency instead of directly hiring. They indicated they are on a hiring freeze. "

good,Excellent benefits. Not for everyone. Couldn't transfer when I moved and not enough room for advancement. overtime is strictly volunteer
good,"You will spend the vast majority of a typical shift on a phone, answering calls and assisting clients with credit realated inquiries. Its tough to understand all of the specifics at first. The policies are ever changing, the systems are complex and not well understood by a mojority of your coworkers. There is a silver lining, you are given the information you need if you ask for it. You have allot of support, and coaching. Over time you will understand your position and what it is you can and cannot do without aid. That is when it starts to get really boring. Its a good job, nothing more."
good,"I come in sign and review first portfolio, messages from attorneys and customer. Throughout the day I check to see If money has been received for a short sale transaction. While doing this I am logged in taking inbound calls for recovery accounts that have charged off and liens are being released. This is on a regular day without any issues, but its exciting and high learning environment. Each account I work is different and has its own journey. The task at hand is to ensure that we stay compliant and no laws broken while doing this. I have learned how to liquidate properties, clear titles, understand legal matters, processing lien releases, working with management on special projects that require immediate attention daily, learning how to work with co workers, management, and attorneys. The management at my job can be different. They al have the same mentality and that's to get the job done and meet the deadlines that need t be met. My manager may not always know the answer, but she will find out and follows up very well. In this department this is necessary, because of so many escalations within the company. The hardest part of my job is keeping it all together. You must be able to multi task even on a bad day. This job requires a lot and being organized, having time management, prioritizing, and taking advantage of idle time is a must. The best part of my job is the team that I work with on a daily basis. When you have good team that can get things done; your job just got easier. The team understand that when things are not done properly it will be another negotiator responsibility"

good,"Citi call centers are nice facilities. Clean and kept up."
good,"Everyone works in teams on various projects, so it's a great way to meet new people and form lasting relationships. The company really does a great job in rewarding it's employees with activities every month that build that manager-worker bond."

good,Citi fostered a learning environment so that each employee (if they chose) could achieve the skills required for advancement.
good,"A typical day included, taking loan applications, verifying the information in them, approving and processing them, then collecting the payments.  I managed an office of 3 so there were extra things to be done such as training and setting goals.  2 of the employees were at least 25 years older then me so I had to figure out how to manage them without making the age factor a problem.  That was probably the hardest part of this office but it worked out."
good,Good company and great location. I decided to leave and form my own company.
good,My typical day at work was always different based upon the client.  We stayed busy through-out the day with various task and conferences with out clients.  I learned each person has to be managed to their particular personality and to be fair across the board. The most difficult part of the job would be the constant laws that change with each state and how it covers the individual and making sure to be in compliance and regulation.
good,"Management of staff, training and development,"

The management was good in that way and letting us known the latest news regarding the company. My co-workers  we all focused on the task we had to do that day that made the production standards go smoothly and made the production rates and dead lines on a timely manner.

good,"Working as a Relationship Manager with Citi was a very exciting, educational and an extremely challenging task. One of my most favorable moments was gaining the opportunity to meet with the management team and the support staff after weeks of phone interviews and conferences. The team was very knowledgeable as they developed a strong concept for building relationships and promoting mortgage products. Citi's system allowed me to strengthen my ability of growing and nurturing personal relationships. The plan was to reach out to Real Estate agents, to gain the opportunity to sit face to face with their buyer clients with the idea of presenting them with Citi mortgage products. The challenge to this concept was, a relationship managers role was to capture documents, build the relationship but never run credit and never qualify the client. The file was emailed to a loan officer in Missouri. This could be a strong concept in most places as there are internet mortgage sites, but Carmel was not the area considering loan officers, who are friends of most the agents, are sometimes available to sit face to face, after hours and weekends. Citi had to make several adjustments including having loan officers available after hours to compensate for the 3 hour time difference between Missouri and California. Although, the Relationship Manager role has ended the time I spent building relationships with agents and their clients, meeting the management and support staff for Citi, was an enjoyable experience and I wouldn't change it for the world."

With all of the financial instability, it was difficult to plan effectively for the future. My co-workers were a great group of people who not only had an interest in seeing the company succeed, but in seeing each other succeed as well. There was a continual transfer of knowledge going on and each person could grow as they chose to and learn new skills all the time. The hardest part of the job was the economic downturn, which wound up causing the company to downsize in a significant way. It affected their ability to stay on top in the marketplace.

They were all very professional in the conduct of their jobs and they all helped to improve things to the extent possible for everyone around them."

My only real complaint about working for Citi is the fact I have to drive 45 minutes to get to the office.  However, I now have the option to work from home.  As a result, I work four ten hour days, three of which I work from home.  That leaves me with one day I have to drive into the office and one day off during the week.  To top it off, my one day off a week rotates week to week.  For example, if I am off on Monday one week, I will be off Tuesday the next week.  This results in a four day weekend every five weeks.

But through out every day you would learn something different from ways and short cut to process customers request or even just speaking with the customers.

You come to work, you say ""Thank you for calling Citi customer service, how can I help you today"" more than 100-150 times a day, then leave. The hardest part is if you have social anxiety to the point of panic attacks and crying. I thought I was fine, until I got to the floor.

good,Great job if you can gandke back to back angry customersn Citi is supportive and very rewarding place to work. It is great pay in custoner service and up
good,When I first started it was overwhelming because you receive so much information.  But after 3 months I've pretty much gotten the hang of much of it.  The hardest part of my job are the people you encounter over the phone who don't understand the fraud process while verifying them.   The best part are the people I work with.   My supv is hilarious and is actually the one who hired me.  I also receive shift differential and weekend differential as well.  I hate 10 hour days but love the 3 days off.

Nothing crazy and everything was relaxing. This was during the recession when Citibank failed and was bought out by the government. So a lot of cubicles were empty during the time.

I was pregnant when I first got hired on and I got to go on a 13 week paid maternity leave. The hardest part about the job for me was sitting down and looking at a computer screen all day. Some people are okay with that, and I think Citi is their best option."

Being that our collection process was over the phone, sometimes it was a struggle to collect. Due to our customers phones getting disconnected, or sending our calls to voicemail, etc.   I really had to get to know our customers in order to reach not only my personal goal but as well as our stores goals.  Our management team really wanted us to succeed, so there were always there to help and guide us through every situation we needed assistance with.  I enjoyed always having someone to assist me with any questions or concerns.  It not only helped me but I was able to help our customers to a further extent. "

good,"Citi Bank has been a great place for me to begin my career in business and sales after receiving my bachelors degree. A typical workday includes staying on the phone, assisting clients with their accounts, and making sales to them to enhance their options with their credit cards. I have learned how to relate with people, resolve the reasons for their inquiries and calls, and listen to their stories to offer a perfect sale for their specific needs.

Often people just needed assistance which, as far as company policy allowed, I was happy to do. Some were not going to happy with anything. My team leader and her supervisor were great in encouraging and handling problems situations. They were supportive.

good,Very important training in my first job
good,"Currently finished my first week of training and what I will say is the training is HORRIBLE. The trainer is never really in the room, but roaming the halls and/or meeting with his girlfriend who works in HR while his “assistant” teaches us basically.

good,"My typical work day began at 4:00 am. I got me and my daughter dressed, and dropped her off at the onsite daycare. I was hired and trained for a customer service position that transitioned into a sales/service position about half way through the training. The call center floor was very familiar, fun, and comfortable. The co-workers were encouraging and helpful. The management staff was tense, unapproachable, under educated for the position, and constantly changing. There were times when it was non-existent because so many changes were happening in the banking industry at the time. The hardest part of the job was being made to sell products during the recession, after the banks raised interest rates and closed hundreds of thousands of credit card accounts. By far, the most enjoyable part was helping customers and brightening their day despite what was happening  with their account."

There is diversity, and the business organization that I worked in valued employee development (a big plus); we set standards that other businesses within the site followed. You make your own career. The wages tend to be lower than expected. However, what may be lacking in pay, can be made up in on the job training. I left the company on a high note, with more knowledge and experience than when I first started. That pays for itself. Working hard pays off. The best part is knowing that I made a positive difference during my tenure."

good,"I enjoyed the workday! At 30 calls/hour audodial, there was never a dull moment. We had to learn new campaigns a couple of times a week and I was fine with that. Call center managers are a high strung group, though. Be sure to drink your chamomile before you come through the door. Also, ear plugs. They yell, too."
good,"Typical day is supporting Managing Directors with calendar, travel Expenses requests for Mobile Wireless Services, Computers & Accessories, Messaging Services, Remote Access, Telephony Services and Access and Entitlements."

good,Company was sold and no longer in business. at the time it was a great place to work
good,"As part of being in the financial services industry, sales has become an integral part of every job position. I truly enjoy sales. I found that structuring my day and blocking off time to do what I needed to do was key to success. My typical day at work was 2 hours of cold calling each morning starting at 9:30. I then had at least three scheduled client meetings. The cold calling was always a challenge, but I loved to approach it as a consultative experience for the prospect. My introduction of myself was always that I'd like to introduce THEM to potential centers of influence and other business owners. As a result, I was able to fully book my schedule with client meetings each week. Meeting with clients face to face was always the best part of my day. I loved being enthusiastic and learning about their business. Business owners have a true passion for what they do and their energy is always contagious. I look forward to another postion where I can demonstrate what I learned and to coach others to success OR in a position where I can continue to be an individual contributor."
good,I worked from home and was solely responsible the entire northeastern US. I developed leads on my own and received a few from Citi. I learned how to work independently and manage a territory. Management was fine but left me on my own. I had no co-workers. The hardest part of the job was losing it when the division closed.The most enjoyable part was working independently with customers I knew and an industry with which I was familiar. .

good,Learnt great customer service skills
good,"I love that my frame of reference for Citibank is excellence above all. Since I started at the first Flagship branch for Citibank, there was a higher level of expectations that needed to be meet. There is immense visibility (good or bad) which truly motivates me. With the skills I have learned there, I am ready to get back to the management field. I took these 2 years to learn a brand new industry and I am ready to lead again."
good,"I trained new collectors, I would handle outstanding accounts and would take over calls for collectors that wasn't able to speak to the client and get a at least a payment on the account or accounts that they have held with Citi. Very Fast going and never knew what you would deal with each day."
good,I have been with the company for seven years. It is a pleasure coming to work every day. I work with a team that cares about each other. Management is always looking out for us with updating us on current information and also wants us to utilize our skills and abilities to the fullest. The most enjoyable part of the day is to help my bosses to alleviate work load on them.
good,"a typical day at work consists of collecting payment on outstanding accounts and setting up payment arrangements if available. Management was very nice, understanding, and great teachers. The co-workers were like family, always made the job fun. The hardest past of the job was the distance at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers to keep accounts from negatively affecting customers credut"
good,"The job of an HR comes with its own share of challenges. A normal day would start with sending employee joining or exit data to the national level co-ordinator. It would be followed by meetings or interviews. If a candidate gets selected then preparation of new recruit package, decision/negotiation on salary, sending the offer letter for signature. If there were any resignation letters then conducting resignee interviews. Preparation of a regular database of potential candidates for opened positions. Meeting with recruitment companies to make them aware of the openings and company expectations from the clients. There would also be emplyee grievances and queries that had to be handled. I just loved every moment of HR work."
good,I learned some many things far as check cashing and money managaging and security.Most of us got along and tried to help each other with something the other didnt know.The hardest part was getting customers to understand the process of check cashing.The most part i like was helping people to get what they needed and meeting new faces.
good,Day of work is good come in clock into your work station everyday when you have to work. Learned a lot from my colleagues that worked for Citi a long time. My coworkers were always willing to lend a hand when you need help especially with the system.
good,"The recruiter were always there if I had any questions and kept me up to date on any changes to our contracts. Majority of their jobs where temp to hire positions. The pay was very competitive and they contracted with large companies that have great work environments. Sometimes lunch was free, we had theme days, and company events where contractors were included. They offered pretty good insurance for a single person and you didn't advance too often."
good,-Great enviornment
good,"Management taught me just about everything I know about the finance business. Most of the branches I worked at were like little families. While there were a lot of hours involved to get the job done, we were paid well for them. I enjoyed the work except for doing ""outside collections"". It takes a long time to get promoted, especially to get your own branch because turnover was low."
good,The management really cares about there clients and the people working for them. They work well with you during hard times and training was well though t through.

good,"Very good job, pays well and management cares about it's employees. Would work for them again."
good,"I work for Citi in Hagerstown, MD. I give that site five stars all the way. The compensation/ benefits, diversity, advancement, management, and work/ life balance all were excellent. However, I recently started working for the call center in Mcleansville, North Carolina and there was a big difference in management and many HR issues. I got very little feedback and coaching from my manager. Also, there was not much training. The site in Hagerstown, MD always keep their employees informed about new changes and sales products. I had the best manager when I work for Citi in Maryland. I have respect for Citi as a company. I know once Citi notices how bad the management (customer service managers and some unit managers) is in North Carolina there will be changes."
good,Citigroup Citibank is an excellent organization where you have the capability to grow and demonstrate your skills and knowledge. You will get the opportunity to explore and apply to other departments. The good part about this organization is that they are not only located here in the United State but across the glove.

good,I enjoyed working for CitiFinancial. Excellent work life balance.  Excellent benefits. Managers cared about their employees. Was recognized by my years of experience.
good,Citi is a very diverse company and it was a nice breathe of fresh air when I saw the many faces of Citi. It's a great company to start with but certain departments don't offer you the chance to advance.
good,"Citi was overall a great place to work except for the constant fear of downsizing.  This is typical in this line of business.   Once our area of business was sold there was no notice of layoff.  A whole department was   layed off during a normal daily conference call effective immediately after  18 years of service.  Although it was no longer ""Citi"" it sent a huge message.  If your getting sold off...you better find another position, quick."
good,"Working at Citi, you will be professionally supported as well as personally with a very high focus on work/life balance. The only trouble is there is a lot of hiring freezes."

good,"The site I worked at was the biggest and the best. You didn’t need to leave the building for anything. There was a cafe, doctor , gym, child care, in and outside eating area , nature trail & transportation if you didn’t have a car."
good,"Very collaborative culture where people helps you learn and grow. Citi is huge, internal mobility is easy and you would not require an MBA id you want to break into a very different role."
good,"This was a very good company. Friendly coworkers and really nice managers. Did fun activities and games while at work. This was by far one of the best jobs I ever had. Even though it took me 35 minutes to get there, I loved it!"
good,I used to love to work at Citi. Too bad that the Chicagoland area does not have that many positions outside of retail banking. This bank is underrated.
good,"It was a very different job from any other I ever had. However, it was overnight job and it was getting really tough on my family and myself."
good,Working for Citi was an absolute joy! One of the best jobs I've had.  I would still be there if I wasn't laid off. I would go back in  a heart beat.   My manager was the best!
good,"I would still be at CITI if wasn't for 2007 and 08. The best job I had. Unbeatable for work life, great managers, and colleagues. Wish I was still there. I would have retired from there."

Managers could be overloaded with work but were always available to help, no matter what. Information was clear to obtain and everyone was on the same page regarding policy. The organization was ran like a well oiled machine."
good,"During my career at CITI I was offered the opportunity to learn and grow. It is an extremely  fast paced environment. You are expected to work and make quick decisions with little supervision. It is very stressful. Not a place for someone who is looking for a calm, relaxing environment. However, you can expand your knowledge and make a lot of money if that is your goal."
good,Very nice place to work and plenty of ability to grow within the company. Very family /life flexible. I enjoyed meeting various people more than anything else.
good,I have experience in an array of responsibilities due to the fact that I have been an employee for Citi for many years.  I have been working under contract for the past year and it is just not the same since the Consultant Agency does not offer a good benefit package making the salary not competitive to Citi's offerings.
good,"Loved my job and assisting clients. Sometimes the quotas were unrealistic.  Enjoyed working sub-prime, collections sometimes were difficult.  However, I also enjoyed solving short term problems with long term solutions."

good,"Citi is very customer satisfaction focus and all employee actions should be for customer satisfaction while following the procedures and rules of the franchise. "
good,Promoted to crt team from customer service. Was told for months that our jobs were secure. One day they laid it all on us and told us we only had 2 working weeks left of employment and only had 17 positions open for transfer. They left 103 ppl go. They left contract sites up and running who had no clue how to run the business and let long time workers of 20+ years go over a bunch of temp hires. Citi was an awesome place to work for up until that point. Shame on them
good,"Awesome company to work for, highly recommend Citi.  The culture is simply amazing, my co-workers felt more like family.  Great advancement opportunities, I personally helped promote 33 employees in my last 3 years working there."
good,"I had great bosses I always had a open door policy and never felt like I was out there by my self I had great support from management"
good,"It gave flexibility to balance work life. But technologies were very old, so nothing much to learn. Great learning from management. Over all great company to work."
good,I enjoyed my time at Citi and would love to continue but a lot of politics in that group.anyways i enjoyed my time and experience there cos its a big place.
good,Great place to work as long as you are willing to handle the demands of your respective position.  The only Con i have is that I wish upper management was more transparent.
good,"Great training, bonus and advancement opportunities, great culture, supportive environment.  Hardest part is high call volume but they give you ALL the tools and support to help you do the job."
good,"It was a repeated process, but everyday was a different challenge which kept it interesting. Learning to work as a team player and sometimes being team leader, helped me to better observe others opinions in a respectful matter. The management team was great, understanding and flexible when needed. It wasn't hard to work here at all. I enjoyed going to work everyday from 5:00 am to 1:30 pm,  knowing that I was needed and never having to be micromanage."
good,I enjoyed working at Citi and would recommend Citi to others.  What I enjoyed most was the flexible work schedule and also the diverse culture and opportunities to advance.
good,My time at Cit was pretty intense as I was thrown in to work with skills I hadn't quite developed yet. Overall I gained an in depth view of financial services technology and really aligned with company culture.
good,"Time goes fast due every day is  busy and a lot of conference calls,"
good,"Citi bank has a great salary, many benefits, and discounts which make it a great place to work. Considering that while working at Citibank I only had a high school diploma and made just as much as family members with a Higher education it’s guaranteed good place to better livelihood."

good,"I enjoyed working at Citi.  The only ""beef"" I'd say would be the lack of job stability, but they definitely drive home the culture, and have a lot of benefits.  Job instability aside, it was a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Citi Group.  This is a great place to work.  Corporate was very engaged with all sites.  I also worked in a secure area and felt safe.
good,"As an intern, I was obviously not used to or have any exposure to this field of work prior to this experience. However, the team members were very understanding and supporting in order for me to get the most out of my limited time there."
good,"Foi uma das melhores experiencias em termos de aprendizado. É difícil encontrar uma empresa que realmente se preocupa com o bem estar do funcionário como o Citibank, sem falar no ambiente que é super agradável."
good,I liked the management and benefits some overtime was available drive was good a good place for advancement but the center was to small and the pay was highest in the company
good,"Working for Citi was fast paced at times and slow paced  some days, moving up in the company was about performance and not what you know, depending on the VP that you work under"
good,productive and team work environment. great work culture and there's room for growth and advancement. management is ready to work with its employees..

good,"Been a great work place and learnt a lot on banking solutions and perimeter security of infrastructure, A global place with diverse technologies to be a part of."
good,I really enjoyed working for Citi as a company. However when I felt I was being harassed by my manager I feel the managers years of tenure (23) had a major role in how things were handled. Even though other complaints were filed on the same manager. Which then cause him to target me in ways that ultimately  ended my career there.
good,"Awsome Environment for work for new engineers."
good,"The company is a stable financial company that provided 34 years of security for my family. "
good,"Citi is a great place to work, the opportunity to advance is abundant, You are in control of your success there. I have seen people who have been there for a little over a year go into management roles. Really all you have to do is show up to work and do your job. Only thing is that I would like to see more minorities in executive positions, other than that its a great place to work. Work life balance is great, they have a gym and the food at the cafe is great especially the breakfast rice they have sometimes."
good,Citi's culture embraces meritocracy. Employees can take advantage of full benefits and paid time off from day 1. The company is outstanding in comparison to most other banks in the area.
good,"This has been the best place to work. I enjoyed the culture, work environment and the opportunities for advancement. The benefits and 401K are great. There are many discounts."
good,I have loved the last 9 years working for Citi. I have learned a great deal from management and peers.  It is a great place to work. I will miss Citi.
good,Citi is a great place to work. The company gives you a lot of opportunities to learn from new challenges. 
good,"Citibank has so many advancement opportunities but, the pay for advancement is not so good, but that might be for all jobs. Otherwise it all depends on where you work at in what branch and, the people you work with 70/100 Citibank employees are very helpful. I love my position but, need more when it comes to salary"

good,"Citi is a nice place to work with great minds from all the fields and all over the world."

good,Customer Service job serving Singapore clients. It's a team of almost 20 representatives under one team.leader. sometimes work stress allt because of tough customers and escalation problems.
good,"I gave Citi 29 years of my life and career. I did not feel my job was secure for the last 3 years, thus I was laid off in 2018. I did work remote for the last 5.5 years which was a blessing. I did work for numerous manager's in those 5 years +. All were fair and knowledgeable to work for and were easy to work for and knew that they did not have to micro-manage me due to my experience. I hope to somehow continue my working career with Citi in another job position and hopefully be able to work remotely."

good,Great place to start your career. You learn everything about the banking business and they give you an opportunity to move within the company. They hold activities to engage management and staff.
good,"Work/life balance improved over past years.  Remote work was encouraged and supported.  Management was skilled and fair to the employees.  I do feel I was adequately compensated and the administration of benefits, including separation, was fair.  The management supported empowerment but improvement is needed in that area.  I developed many skills especially on Oracle based financial systems and PC skills.  There was extensive training offered both on workplace environment and technical skills.  I most appreciated the spirit of teamwork and that there were no ""silos""."
good,Citi represents an enormous opportunity to those interested in Finance to branch out in various areas of the business. You are surrounded by people who are willing to offer support and direction at various stages of your career.

good,"One thing that always stood out - if there was business on the table, then Citi will move all it takes to meet client's needs as long as there is not regulatory issue. Something I liked and have tried to imbibe in my freelance career also."
good,A typical day consists of about 25 phone calls and about 12 refinanced homes out of the 25 app. Daily meeting for eat time to discuss what the goals were for the day
good,"It's actually been like 5 years before since I got this job. It's ok because it's an internship. It's competitive, but still, has the opportunity. so sad I left there for a master degree."

good,Worked there for 24 years.  Made very close friends (family).  Saw ups and downs for company.  Finally major cut-backs.  Would still be there if the company did not have the cut-backs.
good,"Citibank has a very inclusive culture. Although work-life balance wasn't easily attained having to work midshift (3PM-12AM) because we service clients from UK on Philippine time. Management showed support but career advancement was not very apparent. It provided growth in terms of skills and process mastery. Was also able to meet different people across all regions (APAC, EMEA and NAM)"
good,Citi is VERY conscientious of employee needs.  Allowing employee sharing their voice recommendations for improvements.  Listen to ideas.  Only concern for me is the pay scale.  Benefits are wonderful with Citi and start immediately the day you are hired.

Trabalhava com várias práticas administrativas, em que nós tínhamos de exercer várias funções, como telemarketing, suporte, atendimento e vendas. A gerência foi uma grande motivadora. Os colegas do trabalho me ensinaram muito, pois já tinham todos anos de experiência a mais que eu. A parte mais difícil era vender, atender e fazer telemarketing em um curto espaço de tempo. A parte mais agradável era alcançar as metas mensais e receber bonificações salariais do banco."

good,"I worked for Citi as a fraud analyst.  The work was challenging but you never felt overwhealmed.  There is a very relaxed cuture overall and the management there is top notch--save one or two individuals.  My only complaint was my work schedule--Sun-Thu 12:30pm - 9:00pm--got in the way of seeing my family.  During the school year I would drop my kids off as school and then I wouldn't seem them again until the next morning because they were usualy asleep by the time I got home.  Aside from this, though, it was a great job."
good,"When I started at Citi It was my first corporate/full time job, I was nervous but they anticipate new agents not having a lot of experience. With proper training and many vices to use for help and support I quickly got on my feet and felt comfortable. Although my particular position was very stressful due to the clientel that I dealt with; I love my job. I love that between the managers and co-workers  we are competitive but supportive. My particular team was very task driven but we had such a great manager that we felt like family. Citi is very focused on hiring people from all walks of life;one thing I admire most is that they hire many people whom are apart of the LGTBQ community. Although I am not a member of the community, I have relatives and close friends that are, so I'm a huge supporter. I really enjoyed the free trinkets that we got when Citi had a new promotion. For instance, when Citi joined forces with Costco we got catered lunch for the entire first week. I learned many things about myself, I learned that I can achieve anything I put my mind to,  learned how to think outside the box when it comes to solving customer's problems, and how to give constructive criticism to better your team."

A typical day would be dealing with trades that reject in our system and then calling the mutual fund companies to price protect the trades in order for the trades to be processed and not reject for  a second time, as this could create a gain or a loss for the company on that particular trade, more than likely it would be a loss, and that is the way our days started."

Working from home is one of the things I will miss because not all companies allow remote access."

I perform at a higher level on a consistent basis and that sets the tone for my teams to take full advantage of being apart of a winning team and be accountable for their role. My coworkers respect me and are very intelligent. We operate in synergies on multiple projects with yields our success.

One I was getting paid for being a processor and (yes some of the work was processing) but most of it was analytical and fixing other peoples mistakes. With that being said I was doing all the research for an account and telling someone how to do there job that was making roughly twice as much as me. The second reason and the main reason why I left was I applied for a job that I was almost over qualified for and I was denied because they did not want to move my grade level up that high so quickly. I was told I had to find another job with a mid grade level and then maybe after a year  there might be another opening in that department. They lost a hard working dedicated person because of politics. "

Meu gestor era um consultor, o qual embora estava na empresa todos os dias, mas muitas vezes envolvido com assuntos junto a gerencia a qual se reunia cada dia com um setor, mas acredito que gostava muito do meu trabalho. Os colegas de trabalho, embora todos com muito tempo de casa , quando cheguei em 2005 se assustaram um pouco, pois a empresa costumada contratar indicados e , eu não conhecia ninguém,vim através de dinâmicas de grupo e sequencias de entrevistas. informar aos gerentes que pela avaliação que eu havia feito e conferido com meu gestor, ele não podia solicitar mais um funcionário para área dele, isso dava o que falar.

There is a great sense of comradary - which helps a day go by faster! The most difficult part of my job happens when I am unable to do much for a client.

Overall Citi is a great bank to work for."
good,"When I first started in the bank I was in the Sorting Department, and that was basically sorting through the 'AA' and 'AB' mail which was credit card statements. I was then promoted to Card Services, which ment I embossed credit cards which was a high security area, then I was promoted Global Cash and that intelled processing account for Progressive insurance and other similar companies, Data Entry. I really learned alot because of the differents department that I had worked in with CitiBank. I had no idea that it took a very special machine to emboss credit cards,and I learned how to create credit card on that machine and use the AS400 computer system which was insink with the embossing unit. The hardests part of the job was when a credit card went missing, that would throw off the balance of the credit cards (because they came in a box of 500 credit cards) and no one was permitted to leave untill the credit card was found. The card was almost always found in the embossing unit stuck and damaged, so if 2 credit cards were suposed to have been made only one was made,and inserted into the credit card holder envelopes, and if the information was embossed on the wrong credit card logos. I really like my job I learned alot and everyday I would challenge myself to emboss more credit cards than what I did the previous day."

good,Nice indoor environment and that was a change. The equipment was all new and the software was state of the art. It is stressful and fast paced.
good,"I enjoyed Citi as a whole. There was a training manager there that was unfair in the treatment to some. He displayed inappropriate behavior and verbage to scorn and break down the confidence level in some of my co-workers, I didn't find that professional at all. Then there is the other stuff that comes with working in a very diverse call center setting. But if you can put the people aside City as a company is great to work for when you do your part. Citi the company is great for business."
good,I had a great experience working for Citibank.  I had wonderful managers who were not only managers but wonderful friends.  I always had a great relationship with all of them.

good,"It was a great place to work. People was amazing and very friendly. Low salaries though."
good,"I've worked at Citi for two decades. The company offers many great benefits.  Anywhere you go, you are the backbone to your career and must pursue your own personal development. Citi offers many avenues for growth but you must be willing to initiate the work .  I enjoyed my co-workers and getting to know others through a variety of initiatives- example:  Meals on Wheels. I highly recommend Citi"
good,"I worked for Citibank for over 6 years and it was one of my best experiences. No large corporation is perfect, but this company really works hard to make its employees feel valued and appreciated and that really made my employment there enjoyable. Paid day off each year to volunteer in the community, really great medical, dental, and vision benefits.. the best I've been offered by any other employer. They regularly catered lunch when they needed extra support on the floor.. and so much more. I left was because I had to relocate and there unfortunately wasn't a position to transfer to there.. otherwise I would likely still be there today."

good,"excellent workplace culture  along with lots of learning opportunities ."
good,"5 working days so I have time with family and friends to hang out."
good,"As a manager, a lot falls into your lap however Citi does provide most of the tools to be successful.  You must take advantage of these tools and become familiar with how to use them.  Citi actively promotes from within. My advice would be try to get in and then move up from there.  They are highly competitive with salary for the most part.  Bankers tend to make less than what is expected, however, their compensation plan is one of the best for the role.  It is possible to make significantly more money if you put the time and effort into it.  As for Branch Managers, pay is based on the portfolio of the branch and compensation was the same way.  The bigger the branch, the more pay and more compensation.  You have complete control to actively bring in more money to your branch that could ultimately effect your salary and comp.  For the most part as a branch manager, your manager is hand off, expecting you to run your business, but there is a clear expectation of results.  However, as with all businesses, there are some in management that like to run your branch for you. Overall, I felt completely supported by my division director and national director who took time to get to know you.  Hardest part of the job was doing more with less.  That is a common theme across all corporate America now.  Started with 7 tellers and ended up 2.  It was about teaching customers how not to come into the branch for mundane activities.  That was challenging."
good,"I learned so much while working at Citi Mortgage Inc. and I will value my time with the company for the rest of my life."
good,"Treinamentos excelentes, gestão de alta qualidade, ambiente otimo"

good,The training is very well done you will know what to do when you get to the floor. The management always gave out rewards for a great call ECT. The cafeteria had food cooked food in a daily bases.

In 2016 I was brought on to the Service Delivery team and up to a whole new level of Data Center experience. Installing and decommissioning servers and network devices and all of the cabling associated with said devices, troubleshooting connectivity/network issues as well. The learning opportunities were plentiful and frequent. I feel as though I literally learned something new every day. The hardest part of the job, trying to figure out problems that no one had ever seen before. The best part of the job, being able to bring resolution to the issues that came to us daily."
good,I worked for Citi for 2 years and it was a good place to be at. Everyone is extremely friendly and nice. The environment is very professional and I loved it that.

good,I woke up every morning excited to go to work!  I loved everyone I worked with and would go back in an instant if I was close enough.  Highly recommend working for this fantastic company!
good,"When I started at Citi I had no experience working in a call center. I remember the first couple months always fearing being terminated for reading disclosures incorrectly. However, I was wrong about those first couple months, management worked with me any time that I had issues or had a bad quality. They were supportive of my change in departments and they continue to be supportive of my advancement through the company. Citi really does follow their mission statement, the only downfall I've had would be management. There have been some managers that do not set the example, they instead set the example of what not to do and punish employees for acting similarly."
good,Citi promoted team building and we did a fun team building activity every Friday afternoon. We had a Fun Activity Committee who came up with ideas and games and put them in place.
good,"Great management excellent benefits, vacation time. Challenging role with growth and stretch assignments. I would still be with them if they hadn’t exited the business."

good,"Empresa dinâmica, com um alto índice de diversidade, treinamentos e benefícios para qualidade de vida."
good,"Many people probably consider Citi to be just a credit card provider, or bank, but to me they are much more.  They are a big contributor to local and national charities, and enable so many volunteer opportunities for employees.  They are also a digital company, in that they are heavily invested in servicing clients through mobile and online banking, constantly striving to add and improve capabilities.  They also support youth development through programs across all levels of education.  The list goes on, but for me, they are an organization that has lifted me up professionally and personally over the years I've worked there."
good,"Overall, Citi is a great company. The benefits are awesome. The salary amounts should be increased due to the cost of living increases. I have learned a lot during my time with the company. Management in my department is phenomenal."

good,"This department comprises - market-oriented - development, pricing, promotion and distribution of services or ideas and all other activities that offer customers added value; these systematically lead to a higher turnover or other desired response, a good reputation of the organization and a sustainable relationship with the customers, whereby all stakeholders achieve their objective. I was mainly concerned with how Citibank communicated with the market to promote the sale of its services. Of course, few services sell themselves and it is important to draw attention to potential buyers on these services and the benefits that these offer."
good,"This company has been the most important in my professional life, gave me countless opportunities personal and professional growth."

good,The branch that I worked in was in a small rural town. We did more business than most of the larger towns in the area. This made for some very personal relationships with our customers. I believe that is why we were so successful.

good,Great company who cares for its  employees and provides support through day to day  operations. The culture is lively and the employees work in a team based environment which helps to deliver key results.

Had the best managers I have ever had, and unfortunately one of the worst..."

Many times it was hectic when there were mass mailings that had to go to every agent that we did business with."
good,"I have been here for 17 years and have seen the ups and downs. Management is key to making your experience successful and fulfilling. Job security can be challenging and with recent buyout, they are not offering severance packages which is a huge disappointment and lack of professionalism and responsibility on the company's part."

Good departmental interaction in teaching each other the proper way to do things, but the company culture needs improving.  Overall nice comradery."
good,"Citi was a new experience, like a breath of fresh air. We were one of the first new buildings in the Kingsley Park in Fort Mill.

Upon closing they paid companies to come in and provide us with professional resumes, training for interviews, job fairs, severance package and many more things.  The job was fast paced but very laid back.  Management treated everyone as an equal.  If they would have never relocated I would still be with the company.  Their health benefits were great.

My role in sales disciplined me on my habits and cut throat standard for working hard. The management team defined what a leader should be and inspired me to work for my goals and to better myself. They walked the walk and talked the talked and never acted like a ""boss"". Workplace culture was also the best as it was always energetic and dynamic and positive.

Salary wise, it was a little slow on the increase but it did come if your worked for it (together with the promotion/career advancement)."

The experience I got dealing with Citibank management, its customers, HR etc, was the best ever in my 14 years of career. They are innovative, quickly responsive to market needs, have some of the largest companies as their clients, excellent policies for employees and the best of all have excellent rewards programs in a periodic manner. Unfortunately, due to the global recession hits with its epic centers in USA, in 2009 Citigroup sold its captive BPO services in India to TCS, which according to most of us was the worst deal for all of its employees. Transforming your work environment & culture from a global top 20 company to an Indian MNC which is not even in the top 500 companies, is like changing your passenger seat from a chauffeur driven limousine to the back of an well decorate battery driven auto rickshaw!

Citi management is very patient and willing to work with you so you can do your job right.  They provide you with the tools to be successful.  A typical day I would take any where from 60 to 100 calls a day.  It was very fast paced, but you have to take your time with each client to make sure you are giving them your best. They realized it was a stressful job, so the management would give us bonuses.  We would have contests to see who could collect the most or who could get more phone pays.  The hardest part of the job was making sure I did my very best on every call.  The most enjoyable part of my job I would say was all my friends I made there, management and co-workers alike.

My position entailed supervising a staff of 20 clerks working with diverse sets of skills.

Designing effective training strategies provided staff development which ensured each clerk could perform at the highest level. This created motivated and skilled individuals that challenged each other's performance by constantly refining the current process to identify opportunities for improvement. Relying on skilled individuals bring the necessity for their ability and time. Managing schedules and assignments for 20 clerks was no simple task. It required not only knowledge of the operation, but also an understanding of the needs and abilities of each clerk. I take it to be of great value to personally engage and understand each clerk individually. I extend this thought by also encouraging clerks to build rapport with each other and myself.
