rating,review
bad,"Terrible place. Safety sucks,Union is for their family only. And they will ride the few workers to death and let the rest sleep. Go to Arcelor. US should shut down soon the way they operate"
bad,"Too much stress..overworked and underpaid!!!"
bad,I worked 6am-6pm 7 days a week. Everyone breathed in coal dust because masks weren't accessible. Morale was always low because people were overworked.
bad,poor management. high turn over of employees. management has no skills and is not trained to work with employees or how to deal with encouraging employees to do their best.
bad,This company is the worst company anyone could work for. The management is out to get anyone they can with discipline. Get no sick days and have to work outside. Dont plan to have any family time or outside life. Us STEAL isnt what it used to be.
bad,Terrible place to work. Other than the corporate training which was first class the on site training was not good. Multiple safety concerns. Work life balance was non existing. High turn over for management level employees.
bad,"Very outdated culture and manufacturing processes. It does requires a tremendous amount of hours. You are on call every day and night, but they do provide a company phone that you are to maintain at all times. An extremely hazardous place to work. Noxious gases, molten metal, bursting pipes, serious injuries, fatalities, cancerous chemicals and dilapidated structures. However, it is a crash course in manufacturing and exposure to heavy industrial systems unlike anywhere else. Free coffee."
bad,Management rules by intimidation. We where always under staffed. You where never given enough supplies or tools to work with and wasted countless amount of time stealing things from each department because area management would get bonuses for not spending money. It is a very dirty work place with dangerous work at times. They talk safety until they need sometime done fast. I was exposed to asbestos for three day as my supervisor lied to me saying it wasn't asbestos. I asked why weren't any signs up warning us of the danger and my area manager told me you guys never read those things anyway. We would have to change shifts at least two times a week sometimes three different shifts in one week. You would be lucky to get one weekend off a month. No matter what it wasn't done fast enough. You where never told good job are anything like that. It is a very hostile intimidating environment.
bad,company just shut down without any notice laid everyone off and the union didn't do anything to help us I worked all on all types of equipment anything that was broken down I worked a lot of hours and gave 100% to this company as did a lot of good people.
bad,"Management is a joke , the union is trash , the corporation is greedy and inhumane , avoid at all costs. "
bad,"Disgusting management,no loyalty no respect no career especially for women,absolutely old minded people think they know better than everyone,don’t work here if you don’t want to be miserable."
bad,"Management are bullies."
bad,"Unfogiving corperate big business mentality. work as hard, and as long as we want you to. (if the next shift shift doesn't show up we'll force you to work THEIR shift) worked coke ovens."
bad,"Company as a whole has a terrible quality system in place. Upper management ignores quality problems and solutions for them. Company is going down hill. Only bright spot is future connections but wit quality system the way it is, it wont be long before customer issues arise. So if you want management to pump you up and praise you everyday for doing a good job and want to get laid off, this is the place to go work."
bad,"If you despise yourself, then, subject yourself to USS. The atmosphere within this company is like death, and you literally watch your career die while you work at USS."
bad,Place had no room for growth. Work sucked there. They play favorites. Management was horrendous. There might as well had been a turnstile outside the front door.
bad,The Company it self is a safety orientated company but their training lacks in efficiency and is based off of rather not your the managers friend or not and not on moving everyone at the same pace managers lack communication skills
bad,this is one of the worst jobs I ever had. The manager I had never trained me and never checked on the coworker who was supposed to be training me. If I had questions she said she was too busy and then if I did something wrong she would yell at me in front of the whole office. When I told my boss she said that my coworker is who she is and wasn't going to change so I either had to deal with being constantly embarrassed and harassed or I should quit. What kind of manager says that? So I quit and have never looked back! Don't work here!
bad,"Management has no clue what it's doing yet they expect you to live your life for USS as every manger there thinks that one day they will be the CEO. You will lose your personal life and not only that but the steel industry in general is a dead industry in this country, do your self a big favor and find another job or only use this as a stepping stone in your career just make it a short stay here."
bad,"I would have given negative stars if I could have.  The union runs every aspect of this company.  The managers only advance if they kiss the union's rear end.  Upper management states they have your back, but they can't be trusted.  The bond you make with other front line managers are the only ones you can trust.  I hope you are not married because you will be married to US Steel and your job.  If you work in the mills be prepared for 16 to 18 hour days 6 days a week."
bad,"If you want to work in a place that degrades you, demands your time no matter what you are doing, calls you in on vacation time, and yells at you this is the place to work. They only promote the people that have no experience in management and not the ones that have degrees go find another place to interview they are behind the times"
bad,It was a job at the time i had money coming would I do it again no
bad,"long hot hours, lots of lazy people who don't want to work. Tons off bosses who don't care about the lazy people and only worry about the new people ."
bad,"you have to have knee pads to succeed and know how to use them  "
bad,"Talent is gone as well as the knowledge. US Steel is gone lean by holding on to dead weight and trimming the talent. Secret budgets and hiding cost. KPIs are smoke and mirrors that are “Adjusted” to reflect as needed. Overlapping work between different groups caused by lack of clear direction from the top down. The same projects and or initiative Failures done over and over do to poor managed event, project and delay tracking  data. This is the text book case of complete failure implementing Change Management. I could go in to more detail, but will conclude my review with this:"
bad,"Depending on the weather, it's usually really hot or cold. They provide uniforms. That's a plus. The floors are really greasy and slippery. Management only cares about getting their numbers for production. Not so much on accuracy. The contract pay always go lower and lower after a lay off. Got laid off twice. Will never work there again. It's ridiculous."
bad,"Typical day at work was what you made it. Management had no idea what was really required to do the job. High turnover rates means projects that are needed to stay/become competitive are overlooked in order to maximize quarterly profits. "
bad,"USS is a slow sinking ship.  A combination of poor management decisions, and a greedy Steelworkers Union will be the death of a once great company.  No advancement opportunities."
bad,Lack of management  intervention and very fast paced enviromen.  Although under union watch they did nothing to help empoyees with wage and better benefit packages.
bad,"Good place to work if you only want money. Have a back up job due to the frequent work stoppages. If you need somewhere to work for your resume you should try other places, many employers don't look fondly on US Steel employees unless you have a trade."
bad,"this is an ok place to work, you will get dirty. pay depends on your department, it is not all what it is cracked up to be. good job to get your foot in the door. Management does not know the dangers of the job tasks there for it makes it unsafe."
bad,"Horrible company to work for , rednecks all over the place , dont work here if u are an emigrant xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
bad,"If you enjoy being lied to daily and working at a job where the number one goal is to try and find something to fire you for than come work here.  They advertise advancement but then lie to your face and behind your back, they don't want you to get ahead.  They preach safety first as long as it doesn't interfere with production.  I have never seen a company try harder to lose money and not show a profit. Try to find any other place to work first."
bad,"This is where tradesmen and women come to lose all self respect! I've worked for USLess steel for the last 6 Years! You will be disrespected, and suffer some of the work working conditions you can imagine, and heaven forbid if you cut you finger! Do not work here."
bad,"This is one of the worst places to work. Management doesn't have a clue what they are doing, and has succeed to create a terrible work environment. Stay clear of this toxic environment."
bad,The pay is the only decent thing about this job. Equipment is old and unsafe. Management is incompetent of doing their job. Work ethic does not exist.
bad,I would not recommend anyone work there in the medical facility. The physician over the clinic is rude and does not foster a good work relationship. The manager was located in Texas and was not understanding at all
bad,"Management is a joke.  You have unprofessional managers working against each other.   The shift rotation eliminates that life balance one needs."
bad,The company is truly one of the worst managed companies in America .  We are currently struggling to make money at a time of unprecedented economic growth. The tariffs have helped every American steel company greatly except Us Steel. Business as usual losing money and low production.
bad,"US Steel hires people under the premise that they want to acquire skilled people to help build a better company. once you start you are treated like you know nothing, and anything learned outside of US Steel is worthless knowledge. This would all be fine, if you didnt quickly realize all your managers are idiots!"
bad,"Don't work here.  Management will beat you down and then kick you out.  Constantly reinventing the wheel, very high turn-over because the company does not know what the heck they are doing.  If you like working for bullies, then this is the place."
bad,"Company brought in new management that felt that older employees were no value to them.  Very stressful environment."
bad,"The company believes in understaffing the plants and over-working the employees they do have. Swing shift is the most common shift, which provides one weekend off per month to spend with your loved ones. The company will take this weekend away from you as they see fit. Safety is a priority as long as it doesnt interfere with production. Management will ask amd even expect you to work unsafely. We have had mulitple deaths and injuries occur with frightening frequency. Training is poor. Management is inept at best. But you will make money whether you want to or not."
bad,Can't say anything nice. The hardest part of the job is the company. What I learned is management has no business in the business. The typical workday is stress until quitting time.
bad,Not sure where the company is going low morale unstable environment company does not provide proper tools to do the job expected
bad,Don't work here as this place is run by arrogant and incompetent yanks. They think you must be high if you trip or hurt yourself. They use American style bullying and threats to get you to work unsafely if production is affected but preach safety first. U.S. Steel is basically running Lake Erie Works into the ground to eliminate competition.
bad,"People at my plant are quitting at an alarming rate. It is like the titanic sinking. The CEO and Vice President of HR came to the plant and someone asked about US Steels retention problem, they said ""US Steel doesn't have a retention problem, everybody wants to work for the winning team."" Not sure if they realize that we aren't winning anything, the stock market is not like golf. The lowest number doesn't win. The plant manager also said everyone is a plug and when a plug stops working you simply replace it. Good luck replacing half of the managers when they leave."
bad,No chance for advancement. Management is a joke. Disgruntled co-workers. The list goes on and on....
bad,"They hire you and place you where needed, regardless of experience. If you open your mouth about anything they want to fire you even about safety issues. Every safety meeting I attended started off with ""Do you have anything?"" As if I had been there and know what took place since I left the previous day. And one last thing.... if you have a family, you will never see them. So don't work here unless you have to..."
bad,Very good money and benefits but there is no separation between work and personal life.  Your first priority in life is expected to be US Steel; regardless of personal or religious practices.  The phone never stops ringing and you are expected to answer texts and emails at night and on vacation.
bad,A no future company that truly does not care about there employees. The money sounds good but by the time you consider the lay off time and the manner they mess with your position/job title /rate of pay. it is really a poor company to work for.
bad,"This company rejoices in destroying lives.  It has a great 1950s business plan, and I've never worked where every department tries to sabotage every other department.  The business culture is toxic.  On the plus side, if you need a job that truly makes you appreciate drinking alcohol, this is it!"
bad,"Dangerous place to work, 6 people died there in the 16 years I was there. Management is bad, confrontational and likes to fire first, ask questions later. Environment is unhealthy."
bad,The management suck.  Poor management. Very prejudice.  Most enjoyable part of the job is when it was time to leave that dump.  The hardest part was dealing with the management that has no clue on how to manage
bad,"The company acts like safety is their number one priority until it impacts their production. Then the most important thing is getting the job done. The company will not address safety issues brought to their attention until someone is hurt or killed. This company poorly plans for the cold weather, causing the workers to try and maintain equipment in the cold when the job could have been avoided by planning better for the inevitable."
bad,"Worked excessive number of hours; 7 days a week.  Pay and benefits were good but your feet never touch the floor the entire time you were there, which could be anywhere from 8-16 hours a shift or more.  Politics and preferential treatment given to some, while others get the heavy yoke.  Dangerous place to work!  Preach safety, safety, safety, but production comes first and not interested in spending the money to fix known dangerous equipment, company just wanted to make money and profits for their shareholders.  Upper management is far removed from the reality of day to day operations.  Protected if you know the right people; not protection and expendable otherwise."
bad,"Long hours, high expectations, minimal reward for performance, pay is good enough to make it hard to leave or find a comparable job in the same geographical location."
bad,Very poor hours. Very poor treatment. Unhealthy shop environment. Will be required to work most holidays and weekends. Unstable as its  prone to trade polices and downturns in the economy.
bad,"Expect to be thrown under the bus by other managers and union guys, you might as well be single cause you won't see your family, The discipline system is a joke with working suspension"
bad,If you want no job security and always scared to be laid off then this place isnt for you.   The pay was good and the benefits ok but definetly not worth all the stuff you have to put up with
bad,"Have all new electrical supervisors. That don't know anything except how to push work orders. They like to bird dog you as well. Ask the same questions over and over again. If one Electrician with seniority tells supervision the job is unsafe they will try someone with less time need to watch your shelf at this plant. Has become production driven safety not. They have been updating equipment from 1930s to 2000s technology overtime is a not plentiful hit or miss. Company does not honor contract, are local famous saying is (they can do that). Absolutely no support. I do not recommend this job to anyone beware. Most recent indecent I was unpaid for a week 40 hrs of pay company didn't even say sorry or the supervisor who did it had to fight for my money wth finally received a cash of advanced 10 days later for 60% had to wait on rest of my money to next payday which was also not correct still waiting for rest. I have not been the only one on this issue. Please beware."
bad,"Management is not concerned with safety, they simply ignore issues and act as if they never were told anything. They constantly make poor business choices and the employees pay for it. Shift managers are constantly trying to keep everything running and upper management spends time looking at cost saving and patting themselves on the back at meetings. They have no long term plan, and everything is either broken or ready to break."
bad,"Good opportunity to try new things, but no raise in pay or any certifications. There really is not much to say about this company because it was the same thing everyday"
bad,"This was, hands down, one the worst places I've ever worked.  Sure, the benefits and pay were good, but at all times it seemed as if management, at all levels, was trying to punish you for working for them."
bad,"A typical day at work was just plain do your job.I've learned many safety practices.Management was sub-par.Most of my co-workers were backstabbers.The hardest part of the job was watching the favoritism.The most enjoyable part was the pay,and coming home safely."
bad,I am a former employee from the plant in nanticoke ontario. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They preach safety but if it interferes with production it goes right out the window and god forbid if you hurt yourself because you will be to blame regardless of the circumstances. The environment is terrible and the amount of toxins you inhale daily is not worth the money. They supply you with little or no tools to do your job. They rip you off every pay and force you to fight for what's yours. Management has little idea what they are doing. The union does not represent there employees. All in all I'd say unless your starving in the street I would run as far away from this place as you can.
bad,If you like to live at work and do nothing with your family your entire career as well as get back stabbed and worry about everything you say or do then this is the place for you.
bad,good money good place to work except for some management personal
bad,"The pay/benefits is great if you're willing to work 16hrs shifts all the time. The company is terrible, wasteful, environmentally irresponsible, poorly managed and operated and they treat the employees like disposable minions. Managers are inept and only there to find ways to fire the union employees. Dangerous environments, accidents are common. Volatile industry, lay-off rumors are continuous and plant idles and closures are common. These job are all dirty and dangerous, the union represents you well but, the company is constantly fighting to reduce your pay or benefit and their goal is to fire you eventually."
bad,This place is a place of complete nightmares. If you a family forget it. Your wife will be spending your money and banging your neighbor. Your kids won't know you and your dog will bite you!
bad,750 non union emplyees were cut the day of the announcement no matter how good anyone was doing. I really thought my job was safe after saving the conpany over 600k in one year and then being in charge of a million dollar system that only I knew the ins and outs of. My number came up and they had to elt me go. They tried to hire me back the next week for another position but it was a swing shift and and I was in the process of interviewing for better positions than that.
bad,"I've never seen such a level of cut throat in my entire life, I was hired at East Chicago Tin, was laid off after 3 years, transferred to Gary Works, and OMG, the atmosphere is absolutely unfair like you would not believe!! The 6 of us that was transferred is treated worst than 2nd class citizens, locked in to afternoons and midnights, performing jobs that the other 38 guys would never do. The people that we thought were friends in this department were the first to cut our throats. And the union refuses to do any thing about  we are going through. I've never been so unhappy in my entire life!!"
bad,The pay and benefits are great but the people that work there think that they are obligated to get a position that they are not qualified for and also the union there is terrible 4 thumbs down.
bad,Forced overtime. No days off. No sick days. Minimal vaction. If u work at us steel all u will ever do is work. The management is poor and they often require workers to perform unsafe tasks in unreasonable time constraints.
bad,"To many layoffs to ever be productive again.  Management is not in touch with employees.  Company does not realize that you need to keep the employees that have been there for over 20 years, they know how to make steel."
bad,"I have learned that there is absolutely no work/life balance at USS because you live to work instead of work to live.  I work three out of every four weekends, and have sacrificed so many things in my personal life.  I work virtually every holiday, and rarely see my family or friends.  I am well educated with an associates and bachelors, and I know that many of skills are under utilized because USS is a mind-numbing place to work.  If you're very limited on education (e.g. only high school), then USS may be the place for you, but if you have a higher level of education, skill, and talent then please steer clear.  "
bad,"A typical day at work for me was sitting in a massive single probe forklift writing down coil numbers and placing them on trucks for delivery. They were 12 hr days and my typical drive to work was an hour and fifteen minutes. I learned that when working for a large company, no one cares for the employees well-being. Pressure is placed on middle management(white hats) to sign people off on pieces of machinery far before they are ready and capable. That's only the beginning of it. My co-workers were fine except for the fact that you could see the unhappiness of being there on their faces and you didn't really have to much contact with your co-workers. I also got the opportunity to work amongst the salary workers for approximately 3 months to help accounts payable and receiving stay current. While I was in the offices, on a daily basis I would hear at least one different person, sometimes multiple people, speak badly about working there, how they are treated, how much work they have to bring home with them just to stay somewhat on top of things. they are not on top of things. They have thousands of dollars of machinery just sitting out on the ground rusting, not in use. They attack the union employees on everything. You are in constant fear of losing your job. You are made to feel like it is a jail while taking part in the new hire orientation. I learned a huge lesson and that is that you can't always go to where the money is and expect to be happy expecially when an extra 2 and a half hours is added on to your 12 hr shift because of the drive home. No life, No happiness, No time"
bad,"Very unorganized, good hard workers get terminated that should still be working there."
bad,"They frequently work you for weeks straight with no time off. Typically 12 hr shifts and every month you are forced to change between days/nights. They also like to wait until the end of your shift to tell you that you have to stay over another two hours for training or meetings. Management claims that they want it the workplace to “feel like family”, but they make no effort to accommodate their employees."
bad,"very unhealthy environment"
bad,Worked there years and been thru several layoffs. If you like getting talked to like a dog then this job is for you. We use to work 7 12s but now since the change of management they to 3 shifts. If your relief doesn't come then now your working 16 hours. Benefits are great though
bad,Used to be a good company. now everyone is a number unless you are in with the select group that make up their own rules. New executives milking the company for all they can and using up and throwing out the good employees.
bad,Its dangerous do to the fact they are hiring anyone now. Younger people do not want to work swing shift so they hire anyone with any experience. They can't retain skilled trade people because they pay better elsewhere. The equipment is not maintained so its not safe. Some of the managers discipline is handed out to who they do not like instead of who deserves it. If you were raised with a good work ethic you will do all the work while your coworkers play games on their phones and laugh at you.
bad,Had our area working with a minimal crew and not enough people to properly do the job according to their own safety standards. Company preaches safe work procedures and conditions until you get into the mill and safety goes out the door to keep the mill running. Upper management runs a skeleton crew to keep costs down and increase their year end bonus. Working conditions mean little.
bad,I felt confused with how the managers was handleing buisness and could be one of the reason's why our lay-off was so huge. if the managers would be so much as to teach us the proper way of working on the job instead of always trying to find a mistake in your employee than maybe the employer would have a good and lasting impression on the employees and also that would build comaraderie within your employees
bad,"With the Steel industry being in the shape it is US Steel should be taking more precautionary measures in its business. Bringing on a few hundered employees when they business is struggling just to release them a few months after they started was a wasted investment in time and money for the company, Management did not have a clear idea on how to operate their departments and this caused issues on a daily basis."
bad,"One of the worst jobs I ever had,they forced us to work 16hrs with little or no notice regularly,management harassed employees they didn't like & fired them or gave them time off for no viable reason,and on top of all that extremely dangerous,dirty place,worst bathrooms I've ever seen,seemed to me the company promoted an atmosphere of fear(getting fired) very bad union/management relationship,wouldn't recommend any of my friends or family to seek employment there"
bad,"U.S. Steel offers great benefits and, for those in the Management Associate program, competitive pay.  However, the company's management is highly ineffective, and U.S. Steel fosters a 'blame your subordinates' policy.  In my experience, U.S. Steel management is not supportive, and employees do not receive adequate training.  Additionally, for those that work within the Business Service Center located in Pittsburgh's Southside location:  do not expect any sort of job advancement.  A reason exists for why most new employees leave within three years: U.S. Steel offers little to no chance of promotion from within the company.  Finally:  U.S. Steel encourages an unfriendly and often misogynistic environment, and treats employees like expendable automatons.  Then again, can one really expect anything less from a company founded by corrupt individuals J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie?"
bad,"U.S. Steel has many more downfalls than perks.  The company is very ""old school"" and is resistant to change.  If you have an engineering degree, do not expect that to mean anything to upper management.  Most engineers are forced to be shift managers (rotating shifts) where they work with other managers who have business degrees or no degree at all.  If you are an Engineer, steer clear of this company!"
bad,"if you have no life and all you are after is a dollar bill this is the place to work, myself would not recommend for some one with a family they care about."
bad,Difficult workplace with overwhelming issues that were present each and every work day.  Never had a sense of commitment from upper management.  Always had job security issues.
bad,"Company has some good qualities, but favors younger employees and male workers.  Does not provide fair opportunities to all employees.  No loyalty to long term employees."
bad,"1.set up CNC threading mills and checked each thread with different gauges to be in tolerence"
bad,Pay and benefits are good. Management thinks that by threatening and intimidating employees then the employees will work harder. Management also causes tension between employees by favoritism. Also management is always right with no consideration of employees.
bad,"Forced overtime, poor communication between management and employees, skilled tradesman quitting everyday. Swing shift, safety is only important on paper."
bad,the management style is fear driven. the work and people are great and a lot of fun. don't get hurt or be near someone who is(within view) cause you are going for a urine test!
bad,"Dying company with no plans, ideas, spend little or no money on R&D, treats employees like commodity, in pats five years has changed CEO 3 times. You are expect to make choices but when you do every choice is questioned."
bad,Don't work here as this place is run by arrogant and incompetent yanks. They think you must be high if you trip or hurt yourself. They use American style bullying and threats to get you to work unsafely if production is affected but preach safety first. U.S. Steel is basically running Lake Erie Works into the ground to eliminate competition.
bad,"It is a good place to work and I enjoyed the work, but I don't enjoy getting locked out every contract "
bad,"US Steel was a hard place  to work, the company likes the younger workers that haven't been there very long. It's a mans world that doesn't like a woman that can out work them."
bad,"Dont work here! Youre just a number to the higher ups in corporate."
bad,"Leadership has minimal understanding and/or empathy of the stress and task load on individual employees.  Conference calls / emails will fill-up your 10 hour day, including weekend."
bad,your typical backwoods company that gets bought out by a large company but maintains same backwards business approaches that caused that company to be bought out to begin with.
bad,"A typical day would be to review the required shipments and insure that they arrived and if b=not contact freight supplier to discuss why and when they would be made. I reported daily to upper management on the supply chain developments. This position was a stand alone position no coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the lack of information flow coming out of Head office in Pittsburgh, I would work in the dark for the most part."
bad,this is the worst department at the entire plant.  not only the working conditions which could have been manageable but the management made it a job that the average employee dreaded going to on a day to day basis.  just poor from top to bottom!
bad,they preached safety but it was really just a joke.  in the end they didn't care at all about their employees!!! Not only did they rarely follow up on any safety concerns you were punished if u got injured and blamed by the company even if it was an unavoidable accident
bad,"I direct a 42 man union work force consisting of electricians, HVAC, and machinists.  Responsible for daily facilities maintenance and plan repairs"
bad,"As an entry level Chemical Engineer, this is not your place. There are few actual technical roles here and you'll more than likely be commissioned as a shift manager working on rotating shifts. Specific to the Iron Producing division, they go through managers rather quickly and there is high turnover. If you do make it through your several years as a shift manager, the typical path is to be promoted to an Operating Coordinator, or an Area Manager. Again, both managers. There is literally nothing technical here to learn and if that's what you're interested in, DO NOT work here. Aside from it being an awful work environment (think 140 F in the summer, -30 F in the winter, dusty and miserable), most of the other managers are promoted from the union and have no formal education. They won't teach you anything unless you're lucky enough to get a good boss (yes, a boss from the union with no technical information to teach you) because they're worried about you replacing them (go figure). Essentially, if you are an fresh college graduate in engineering, you will be the most knowledgeable person working on the furnace. Befriend the tech group guys and the control room operators (only on #14, the south furnace control room ops are also union!) because they will be the only people worth talking to. I'm sad to say it, but this is the most unprofessional place I've ever worked."
bad,Very dirty place. They do not respect seniority. Management will lie to your face. They sending all of their skilled workers to the labor gang and cut in their pay.
bad,"Depends on location, however, in short, USS was not a good place to work. No autonomy was given or very little. Recommendations were virtually never followed. They eliminate people prior to vesting as a practice, so don't count on leaving with company contributions. Unsafe; Non Responsive; Poorly Managed; And, hire engineering staff to do project management and supervision. No real engineering gets done. Depends on place, but plant condition is poor. Equipment is run to death, and planning is abysmal."
bad,"Good place to work if you Mexican , other than that I would look else where.management only promotes other Mexicans. Never get a day off. Low pay. No real skills learned."
bad,When you think of maintenance you think get the job and get it done quickly and efficiently.  However this is not the case at US Steel.  On an average day of work my co-workers would sit around smoking and drinking coffee for the majority of the day.  Work orders would only be completed if the job was easy.  We would get assigned a task and the area in question would either be covered in flash or obstructed by other equipment or environmental factors.  If you needed a part or piece of equipment you would spend half the day searching for it to maybe find it.  After being employed for a while with them i still have yet to get any vacation time.  The Cons outweigh the Pros to this company
bad,"Most days you put out fires from problems arising within the facility.  When you'd get time to work on a project, time was very limited.  I produced and maintained the PA DEP accreditation for 5 years.  Most of the other managers were communicative with my position because the lab manager job had you facilitate amongst all the other managers in the plant and with company managers at the other plants and headquarters.  The job was 50+ hours per week with weekend duty and necessity of returning to work at times.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with people backstabbing you.  This would be revealed later by my manager but, at times, not straightforwardly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to all the parts of the plant and meeting employees.  The hardest part was dealing with all the administrative duties and paperwork.  History revealed most of the previous lab managers/supervisors spent less than a year in the position, moving on to elsewhere, as it had originally been a 4 person job combined into 1.  I had found myself remodeling an unused building to establish a second office to complete work."
bad,"It's a decent job but if you are seeking employment with consistent financial advancement opportunities, I wouldn't suggest this job. Prepare yourself to work 12 hour shifts"
bad,"Little surprised this place is still in business.  "
bad,Will ask more of you daily and will not award you accordingly for excelling. Upper management has no plan of action for employee retention. The facility is operating on a  skeleton staff that constantly requires frontline management to be called out all hours of the night while the people who make the operation plans sleep comfortably at night and take off on the weekends with no accountability for their work.
bad,Very little opportunity for advancement or preferential jobs. Money company could be saving is wasted do to poor management. Employees with advanced skills are making same money with very little skills
bad,This company will take advantage of you in any way they can they will take away all perks as a way of cost savings along with raises and bonuses that you earn.
bad,"As historically typical with US Steel, little or no concern is given by management to the family lives of the employees. Advancement opportunities are scarce and nepotism appears to be a dominant.  Management is overly concerned with profit versus employee."
bad,"This company is still under the assumption that people know who they are and want to work here. That is not the case. There are tons of companies headquartered in Pittsburgh that offer better pay and better culture. "
bad,Tough environment.  Work day is tough. Co-workers are great. Employee moral is noticeably low. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with.  Management is not the best.
bad,If you like to work OT this is the place for you. If your a family person your in the wrong line of work. Weak union at least on the local level. Bad decisions by management cause loss of production and worker lay offs. Moral sucks and the infrastructure of the place is collapsing causing more problems then what it’s worth.
bad,Some of the mills are so outdated that they are falling apart.  Money isn't spent to fix things. They are slowly falling behind the other companies.  Most managers are trained to belittle union workers which creates a toxic environment.
bad,"Always a problem or something to do, never can catch up even working 12 to 14hr days every day.  Learned you cannot trust anyone that works there. Very stressful as not a lot of departments work together very well."
bad,"They expect people to excel in an environment when shifts and schedules change daily. Nobody knows what to expect from management, but they expect us to perform."
bad,I was hired as a contractor (this was my 3rd contract role/department).  I liked working there and felt that my efforts were helping the greater good.
bad,"Contract position. Worked with current employees and retirees in all aspects of benefits. Medical, 401K, dental, life insurance, retirement packages, etc."
bad,"Arrogant management, unrealistic union.  Bad combination for survival.  Good starter job for college graduate, but better opportunities and culture can be found elsewhere."
bad,"They work you hard. If you are in the click you will enjoy your time there. If not be prepared to ""suck up"" just to get by. "
bad,"Overtime is forced on employees, no work life balance, management treats employees poorly, and tries to belittle them. Management keeps a paper trail on everyone and anything that happens during operations."
bad,"The workplace culture is terrible. Hourly employees are understaffed, overworked, and fed up with management; many have left for greener pastures, and almost no replacements have been made. Management up and down the chain receive impossible demands from above, and know no other style of management than punching down. This is a place where everybody is miserable to be at work."
bad,"Good pay if overtime is available.  Working conditions and things you are exposed to are a deal breaker for many.  Most employees work rotating shifts, holidays, weekends.  Very little work life balance.  No upward mobility whatsoever.  Management displays favoritism, especially with overtime, and especially when an employee is a relative.  Many workers are related.  Not the kind of place one wants to work at if one has any ambition or education.  The workers with the most skills and education are leaving at a rapid pace."
bad,A very conservative management full of  biased & opinionated managers.  The management has policies and procedures which hold you back from your full potential.
bad,This company is in a state of flux right now and is very unstable.  The current CEO is determined to cut costs anywhere he can and this usually means compromises in safety and workforce reductions.
bad,"Non union job in wet out is low pay. Long hours, money is not good. no loyalty from owners. Opportunity to move up is very limited, very nepotistic company, lots of family work there.."
bad,"Long hours, sub-par pay, terrible work culture.  Expected to work holidays without compensation.  Expected to be on call 24/7.  Management only cares about production and will work employees to the bone.  Work here if you don't care about having a life."
bad,"Company doesn't care about employees, company sucks what more can i say!!!!"
bad,This place is bad bad bad. they arent eco friendly even though they try to be. Its all just a front. they fire you for no reason and then make stuff up about it. they lie cheat and belittle there employees. I worked there for a year and got fired for nothing.
bad,"Company doesn't care about employees only the profits.  Local management is pleasant, but corporate isn't"
bad,"Worked there for 15 years and upper management was terrible! Treated employees with no respect, with no room for advancement. Most of the jobs required rotating shiftwork, which takes years off your life. If you value spending time with your family and having a life, this is NOT the place for you to work."
bad,"Work/Life balance is pretty bad. Compensation is good, but you live in the plant for the pay. Most managers are not open to change, it's always the same old answer of, this is how it's always been done."
bad,"This company is known for buying mills and then running them into the ground. They do not maintain or improve these facilities, or at least where I'm emoloyed."
bad,Stop teaching your new hires to hate the union guys. Stop forcing employees in dangerous situations.  This company puts contractor in a dangerous situation all the time.
bad,They stress safety but its a joke four people have died since i started in 2011. They will demand more even after you worked three 16 hour days in a row. Swing shift is so bad on your body and sometimes when your supposed to be off on your four day weekend. They will cancel it. Work every holiday if your scheduled no set lunch or breaks. You will work seven straight days 12 hours but you wont be paid that way. Your days off during the week break up your hours.
bad,"management has limited experience,off days change weekly,parts and tools for jobs are hard to get,discipline is to easily handed out,   understanding what is expected of me."
bad,Hard work gets you nowhere-Nepotism does. When the cyclical workforce reduction comes (unless in union) they layoff based on older age & highest paid.
bad,"Extremely understaffed. Very poor maintenance program. Run until failure model, but without parts or manpower to repair failure."
bad,Cutbacks to make money for stockholders and no compensation to employees downsizing work force and trying to make people do all jobs whether they are trained or not becoming a unsafe environment in my opinion. It's only time until someone gets hurt.
bad,"This company has command and control management style, highly micro managed and stuck in their ways."
bad,Management is poor previous management new what they were doing.
bad,Three words to describe my experience YOUR ALWAYS WRONG.But my family was provided for my time there.
bad,"US Steel was a reasonably good place to work at, but often required working in harsh environments exposed to the weather and other hazards. The management team really puts an effort into keeping a good working atmosphere, but the nature of the job is very challenging to keep morale up all the time. I learned a lot about process engineering, and enjoyed developing the process models. The hardest part of the work was spending Christmas eve exposed to the weather right next to the Great Lakes."
bad,"You make fair wage but you have to work 60-70 hours a week to get a decent check. You probably won't like getting paid every two weeks. This company really don't care about profits or what make sense, the only S word they know is steel."
bad,Many years of service is heavily valued over motivation and potential. Difficult to approach upper management with new ideas. Very little follow through words to actions.
bad,"Mandatory overtime with call offs, poor working conditions. If someone calls off, must work their shift if next in line. Equipment not well kept. No pay raises for 5 years. Lack of support."
bad,"no family life and cut throat "
bad,Stressful place to work. Work 60 hours plus per week and on phone or computer from home when not at facility. No work life balance. Upper management not in tune with what's going on on floor.
bad,Good place to work while you find something better. Good pay but horrible place to work. Hostile work environment. Hardest part of the job is willing yourself to actually go.
bad,"Current knowledge of how much USS has closed or sold to try to stay in business.  Froze pensions for the non-union workers but continues to bend over for the union workers.   Sad, really."
bad,"If you are single and don't want to see anyone ever and just want money. This is the place for you. It can be good, but you have to understand that you will live here."
bad,worked with a lot of great skilled people. learned a lot about being a good supervisor and working in a union environment.
bad,"Great coworkers"
bad,"The work at US Steel was not hard. Learning the machine took a little time. I worked on the Lathe machines, after about 7months moved to their Premium Coupling( the more expensive parts). 3 months into that I became an Inspector in the Premium Department. Once the orders were filled with Premium Coupling I was moved to Quality Department and became a Quality Inspector. I learned gages, measurement plus how to work with the supervisors  and my co-works.The hardest part of the job is  never knowing what shift you would work the next week. The most enjoyable was working with all kinds of people."
bad,"US Steel is sadly declining, and with that, many employees are either laid off or awaiting their impending doom. The morale is depressing and everyone is just waiting for the inevitable."
bad,"I enjoyed the physical and fast past of my duties as a railroad laborer."
bad,"the pay was good, as well as benefits. a lot of long hours, forced overtime, and weekends and holidays. management was not very professional."
bad,"great pay, we'll see what this next contract brings."
bad,Most the management is fresh out of school. They don't know anything about the industry. All they talk about is safety when really it's all about production. No care for the worker. You will always be the one at fault not the company. Just a dirty unhappy place  Do yourself a favor. And stay away.
bad,Like the jobs that were assigned and the pay was great. Unfortunately it is another american company that is looking to buy and close the competition.
bad,"Poor management , advancement opportunities based on nepotism and friendship basis not work performance,"
bad,"A good company with a ‘good ol’ boy mentally and not much work life balance for moms - single or otherwise. If I was NOT a mom - it would have been an amazing job, culture, and company!!"
bad,"Silo style company.  Each department focused on there goals only.  Did not see often Corp goal focus.  "
bad,It is not the same working environment as it was before due to recent management changes. All the good reviews for this company was at least 3 or 4 years ago.
bad,The pay is pretty decent. The culture is terrible. Employees are not happy. Management does not care. Very negative environment. Some areas have a lot of mandatory/forced overtime. No lunches or breaks. No sick days. I got written up for calling off one time in two years.
bad,"THAT is the culture and environment there.  From the low-class swear sessions of a morning managers meeting to the lack of vision from middle management and above past the end of their noses, you need to watch your back.  Blame comes to those who don't fight back.  And if you don't lock-step with the management inexperienced with the world outside of mining you'll be fired.  Good thing I was 8 days from resigning for a new job. Negativity with the union is encouraged so it is no mystery why those relations are stressed with management.  I would not recommend this to someone coming in from industry outside of MN mining with plans to make improvements to safety, production, and the bottom line unless you come in from the top to clean up the mess."
bad,"The only thing that ever changes with US Steel is the share price. Remember to buy low and sell high. I work in a union job. The management  blindly follows the completely unreliable tattle tails. When faced with evidence that the disciple against an employee is false the management and human resources will trump up even less reliable and flimsier discipline as to cover up their incompetence. The managers are spread too thin and moved around too much as to provide adequate management of the facilities. As for improvements to the facilities and the work, little is ever done to make improvements to jobs."
bad,"I learned a lot about an aspect of steel production that I was not privy to in my previous position, but it apparently was not enough to live up to my superior's desires. You cannot learn in four months every aspect of a job that someone who has been there nearly fifty years knows."
bad,24 hours 7days a week swing shifts very dangerous work. The supervisors pick there special workers to give them better jobs. Very dirty eatting area for when you did get a break
bad,"Way too many hrs - average 70-80 / week. Constantly running short handed , personal retire company don't replace them just expect you to work over to fill the void.Never a day off unless vacation day or call off. A few co-workers are ok most are stuck up someone's back side."
bad,"Pays well but not a secure company.  Long hours and much is demanded.  I was rewarded well for my performance, though.  I do not feel comfortable about writing any more about the company."
bad,"Challenging environment."
bad,A typical day at work is very unassuming. A good day can turn into a bad day within a matter of seconds. Late night calls are very very annoying to myself and family Members
bad,"I absolutely love my job and all of my co-workers.  I work at Zug Island which is known to be the dirtiest square mile in the world.  The work atmosphere is terrible right now.  The management in US Steel has been cut drastically along with a lot of them have found other employment.  I currently only have one supervisor in my department when there was five at one time.  I work swing shift, weekends and holidays.  I work in the boiler house in the utilities department where I maintain all of the gasses and water to maintain the boilers to produce steam for the turbos in which provide wind for the blast furnaces.  The department before this one I worked as a crane operator and a heavy equipment operator.  I honestly have to say that was my favorite department.  The reason why I switched is because I wanted to learn more things to make myself more marketable in case something happened to the steel industry."
bad,"Bad management,, only brings about bad or poor quility and production. You could tell how the work habits and attitudes of the workers changed do to bad managers,"
bad,Very good pay and benefits. Management is extremely poor.  Quality is not a top priority.   Very up and done manufacturing processes.
bad,Supervisors watch not help. More talk instead of example such as training to move up.Safety is the best quality they have.No care for the employees other than their production level being met.
bad,"PROS:"
bad,United States Steel is a good company to work for with good advancement for people who want to put in the time.
bad,Fast pace no breaks during a work day. 12 hour shifts six days a week.
bad,Co-workers were the best thing about working at U.S.steel.
bad,"Not very progressive, very high turnover because of this. Lack of flexibility, lack of clear defined policies. The people that remain with the company are either new graduates who need a starting point or people with 8-10 years of service minimum."
bad,Us Steel pays very well and has excellnt benefits. One of the cons are you work a different shift every week and if your relief calls off you will have to work four or eight hours of that shift.
bad,"There's no team work in this place an no future advancement within the company an the favouritism in this place is unreal....., very week union,  an poor management decisions with there product and storage that causes poor quality in merchandise which caused several companies to drop product. No appreciation or acknowledgement for your good work"
bad,"Great Company name to have on your resume, but stressful times in the boom and bust cycles that typify the steel industry.  C-Suite have far more confidence in external consultants than its own staff."
bad,The job was easy and very repetitive. Coworkers were for the most part good people and everyone tried to get along. Management didn't really have a clue what they were doing and would never be on your side.
bad,"management could have been better.great with employee safety."
bad,The management was a beast always looking to fire someone. Even set you up so you had to stay on alert 24/7. Make sure you know the policy to the fullest
bad,"Reserved opinions, personal experiences vary per department. Cannot comment on any type of review because differences between company and union may not be relevant or represented correctly."
bad,"The first few years were great.  After year 3 the culture dramatically changed and USS became a nightmare.  "
bad,"Learned a lot and does not get dull.  A 100+ year old company with a mix of union employees and management trying to survive in a tough low margin market with all of the associated cultural baggage.  For managers, a good place to get experience but for the past 6 years or so, not a place for a career, especially in IT."
bad,"long hours, push production over safety even though safety is #1.  Area managers beat down the shift managers.  Represented employees are good folks for the most part.  Upper management is a good ol boy club."
bad,Steel industry is on decline and job cuts happen often.  Every contract more benefits get cut. Contract hiring continues to increase. It is a union shop with very old school union ways.
bad,"The manufacturing systems at US steel have suffered for a long time by miss management.  New products are years late, and quality is poor.  They have no financial controls to prevent the abuses of over production and inefficiency.  Back stabbing is common with management and HR.  Good workers who open their mouth are soon served with a document that their great performance is now bad."
bad,"Good people to work with lots of people getting laid off"
bad,"Good pay and benefits, horrible/unstable culture.  Little to no job security and ever changing environment.  Hard to see the overall picture and strategy."
bad,"This company has a lot to offer for those who are ambitious, However, your job is always at risk no matter how skilled and motivated you are. The work itself is great but the management/leadership suffers."
bad,"Very cut-throat environment, managers are treated poorly resulting in high turnover.  Good training provided, but much is loss in the workplace."
bad,"No. This is a private matter. Worked shift work for 33 years as a production supervisor, supervising 30+ employees in a high pressure environment, heavy equipment, HOT, 12 hour shifts."
bad,The job i had was good. Was always bad news going around and there is absalutly no job security. Always felt that you might be working your last shift each day you came in to work
bad,"Typical day is to prepare the pay sheet for the present day's bills, investments, credits and debits from bank statements. Figure out how much to transfer to cover bills. Transfer funds. Enter investments. pay bills, enter all days' events in Black Book ledger to balance to zero, deliver and order records storage requests for boxes and HR files daily. Reconcile Records Storage monthly invoices"
bad,"Very easy job, they will hold your hand throughout your training."
bad,"Tough Job    Hard to balance life and work"
bad,I'm happy in my work and take pride and ownership of it. We have some great supervisors that let you take the reins and get behind you and encourage. I'm in the belief of the team concept.
bad,"If you are talented, they will expect much more than everyone else.   Be ready for 24/7 call-ins and all nighters.  Talent means nothing for pay scale.     Only years of unproven experience.     Where ever you start with salary will lock you into your pay curve."
bad,Not enough work to go around. Work was lacking due to the economy. No orders. Supervisor had favorites so I did not have enough work to keep me busy. I like to stay busy while I am on the clock.
bad,"only steel company to lose money in 2016. Corporate management cares nothing for it's workers. Keeps workers hanging, and never gives them any advanced notice on what may happen with there job."
bad,"dirty ,hot, no family life, poor management  in departments. Employees do however work together as a team making sure safety is number 1. we look after each other."
bad,lots of mandatory overtime. advancement is based on seniority.  pay is great and so are benifits
bad,"great thing about company was compensation and benefits, but that was overshadowed by fact that you constantly worked with no regards to your outside life.  some management was fine while others didn't help you out when it was needed"
bad,"Show up half hour early check how machines are running with previous shift, change tools or settings to meet specs,keep the material moving.I learned train loading, how to operate end milling machines,cut off machines and plant safety. The management i thougt could be more professional. My co-workers were great, very helpful and depndable guys.The hardest thing was dealing with rotating supervisors who each had their own policies.The most enjoyable day was high production with minimal breakdown or interferrence from white hats with nothing better to do."
bad,Easy job but inconsistency & lack of family values makes it a stressful and unsafe environment.
bad,"Good pay, great benifits, long hours. Shift work for most new employees and no real advancement. Union shop, so hard to move to higher paying job. Some bosses will hold you in your current position from months to years"
bad,"Take work orders and complete job as directed. Ensure safe work environment,  work well with co workers . Multiple jobs completed in a day. Complete paperwork at end of shift with job details."
bad,"Management has not a clue what is going on at any job nor for the next day, as well as some of the people will try to snake you so best not to become anything more than co-workers not even work buddies because even that is to friendly to snakes. Watch and write down how many hours worked along with job worked for the pay rate, because mgmt tends to forget a whole lot"
bad,"If you like money then this is the gig you want, you will make it.   The working conditions are extreme in most cases.  Work associates are not as motivating as I would like.    Management was ok and overall if you like to work hard it is a good job."
bad,"Great place to work from day to day, but when contracts are being negotiated, this company plays DIRTY!.    They refuse to pay their employees the holiday pay they are entitled to (in contravention of Ontario labour laws).      They refuse to negotiate, and say ""This is our offer, take it or leave it"".  They also went out of their way to try to stop locked-out employees from getting Unemployment Insurance."
bad,"you can make all the money you want ok pay without ot but if you are willing to live there you can make 100k plus. steel industries volatile and us at the end of the day is a business and their stock holders come first, they'll shut a mill down in a heartbeat with no promise to bring it back up. if you do work for them make sure you take advantage of all the schooling you can and get into a trade or craft as fast as possible. the name carries a lot of weight when you get laid off."
bad,"Paid well but expected to work 15 hours a day as an accountant. Terrible work environment as the louder you yell and more people feared you, the more valued you were."
bad,"repair doors with new seals repair ovens via ceramic welding"
bad,"Slow production can lead to being sent home sometime good and bad, but with a good manager and co-workers make the day a good day."
bad,"Maintained an accurate count of product and insured product met standard levels. "
bad,"A typical day was responding to inquiries for pipe, its availability, and price.  This was done on a global basis with most of the international business conducted by email and the U. S. based requests done by phone. Most of this was supporting long term customers."
good,they are putting everyone 0n the street. worked day and night they show no appreciation. never know what your schedule is going to be. didn't give us proper material and tools to due the job.
good,"This could be a really good place to work but management just makes it bad. Rotating shifts make it tough on family life. Co workers are friendly and will help you out. Vacation and time off is a joke for a company this size, your first 2 years you only get 5 paid days off. There are no paid sick days and you have to jump through hoops if you need a day off or call in. there are 5 levels of pay for hourly employees starting at $15 per hour for level 1 employees to $28 for level 5. Recently overtime has been cut."
good,Decent company . Great pay for the amount of work but extremely long periods of doing nothing . Have to clean to keep busy just to prevent from causing trouble
good,you need to be in with the politics of the company.  only the urgent items are worked on or when high upper management pushes things get done and not always the items needed.
good,"Money is good, but there is no balance with work and life.  To them it is all work and nothing else matters. Management is severely lacking the ability to motivate it's employees."
good,very demanding job that abuses the lower management. They are constantly reducing cost and people and expect same work to be done. promote those that are the least useful
good,Management always alienated their employees. Always felt like it was us against them. Upper management never really had a clue on what my job full entailed or did they care to understand.
good,"There is no comment regarding this question.  I have been out of US Steel for more than 3 years, so my opinion of this company, relative to how the company is in year 2020, is not relevant."
good,"No work life balance, pay is good but get ready to live your life at the plant. Management is controlled by corporate big wigs and shift managers must tow the company line even when they know their is problems but they can’t speak up because the corporate boot is on their necks. You will miss family events and you will be expected to kiss the corporate ring if you want anything in return. There are better jobs out there nowadays but if you like being a corporate grunt that is paid well and expected to live at the plant then by all means apply for a job here."
good,"the benefits are great, but USS does not care about its employees. Management cut employees daily who were great workers just to save a few dollars and put everyone’s safety in jeopardy."
good,"Management is terrible, hours suck, no sick days, more time at work than with your family. Work holidays and weekends. Forced overtime Corporate greed high stress environment"
good,A typical day at work meant spending 12=14 hours on my feet doing repetitive tasks with a break every 4 hours. The workplace culture wasn't very good unless you are Hispanic and/or a family member of one of the supervisors.
good,"I was a contractor working directly for Pomeroy IT solutions, it was a very rigid IT Support job. Nothing really special about it.I answered phone calls and reset passwords. After the contract was up, I was left on the sidelines."
good,Was a safe place to work don't know after all the management lay offs and down sizing of the knowledge staff. The benefits are very good. the unions take good care of their members
good,"I enjoyed working here for many years. I worked in several different departments at this company. I gained a vast amount of experience and knowledge of steel production, transportation and sales. My typical day usually consisted of delivering parts throughout the plant, organizing the store room inventory. Accounts receivable was another very important part of my job. I got along very well with my co-workers and enjoyed most of my work days. The most enjoyable part of my day was all of the connections that I made with many different people everyday."
good,Was a good place that I achieved my apprenticeship through but safety was not a #1 priority with being a production based process. Worked a lot of 7-12 shifts and was forced over to 16 hrs. on a lot of days we were on 12's.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working there were the co-workers. Although, a little disgruntled, we were a work family and strove to get things accomplished in an ever changing environment."
good,Worked around heat
good,"Being a maintenace manager you are pretty much the bottom of the food chain. You do everything that you are told, otherwise you are unemployed. Union workers will always be backed by the union so upper managment always blames you for everything that goes wrong. Everytime you are able to get ahead they will throw more and more responsibiltiy. Wouldn't recommend as a career choice."
good,"It’s a dangerous environment, your working around heavy machinery and hot iron. Depending on your department, you may have to work a swing shift. Dirt place to work but can make good money and provide well for your family"
good,"Cost cutting, plant closings and layoffs are more of a job culture these days.  If you are looking for someplace to retire from, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
good,"US Steel is a very challenging and frustrating environment.  You can work endless hours and come up with the most innovative solutions to simply be met with resistance and opposition for no legitimate reason.  One day the management wants to change the world, then the next day they only care about making their month-end numbers.  This company is affected by poor operational planning and is the most cyclical industry you could ever experience.  The words ""job security"" are non existent.  I would only recommend working here if you have no other choices."
good,"This is a good place to work. They teach you everything you need to know about everything you do. You will make more money than you want to here, but you will make a ton of money."
good,"This job was very stressful, management pushes workers to much. Long hours every day. Workers are supposed to work 8 hours a day, but a normal day was 12 hours or more. If you have down time and you're a new employee you have to watch your back at all times, management and other coworkers make it seem like if you breath the wrong way you will be fired. Pay is good, but it could be better, the company cut out annual raises so a person working for 5 years is making the same amount as a person who has been there for 6 months. Health care is better than most, the union provides the health insurance so you dont pay directly out of pocket. Management is over all very poor, they have managers that don't know what is going on and do not understand any of the machinery so they push for maintenance to fix the machines in unachievable amounts of time. There are not enough maintenance workers which puts more stress on current employees. The culture is over all awful, most people would quit if they had a better job offer or were not a few years from retirement."
good,"The company does pay very well. However, from a company aspect in todays World, they are very behind the times. They run a working environment much like the 1950's."
good,"US Steel has great benefits, financially at least. At the top the executives are trying to make changes to the culture and management. However, the middle management level (plant mngr and below) are resistant to change and often things like the Carnegie Way are seriously mismanaged. There is a lot of micro-management from this group on daily activities. Advancement comes with the in-crowd. If you are a ""legacy"" and your dad or grandfather or uncle worked there you have an edge. If you are not a multi-generation steel worker and don't have time or low enough self-esteem to buddy up with management then you have no chance and will likely be blocked from positions you apply for. The tuition reimbursement program is a waste, the contributions are too small to be worth the 2yr commitment."
good,It was a great group of people but the work conditions were rough. I left when they went back to a swing shift. If they would have stayed straight shift I would still be there.
good,"Was a great place to work when I started but it went down hill after about 5 years.  Then with the constant change, it was not such a great place to work."
good,"the position im in currently has both its pros and cons to it, such as i have steaady shifts and steady days off, but i also have more of a responisibility then some of my other co-workers with little to no benefit monetary wise."
good,No set schedule. Sometimes working sixteen hours a day (mandatory). Employer cares very little about family time and ethics. Sometimes employees work months at a time with no days off.
good,No job security always getting laid off. Some managers are good but the higher ups do not know what they are doing. If they had more experience in the field they manage I think it would be a better place to work.
good,Do not work in the Casters!!  You will make really good but the management makes it not worth it.  They treat you like you have no outside life!  They will find everyway possible to write you up.
good,"Started off great. Good pay/OT, but continuous improvement initiatives and cost reduction outsourcing made for a very unstable and depressing environment."
good,"must be ready for change at any second, able to adapt quick, learned how to operate other heavy equipment and over head cranes"
good,Upper management micro-manages all of their managers and areas. They make it hard for you to get your job done while they expect you to be married to the company without compensation or appreciation. Half of the workforce is allowed to be lazy while the other half has to do twice the work. I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers. The rest are spiteful and vindictive.
good,"It’s closing so that is not good , the work"
good,This job is not a desired job but it pays well. The work life balance is non existent and the management here is very poor. Upon entry they do not care what you have done at your previous work positions and do not match you to a job based on your skills.
good,Very stressful production job always worried about getting laid off never know if your going to work 32 hours a week or 72 . Theres a contract that determines all of the company's language.
good,Pay was great. Benefits were great. Job was on the chopping block a lot. Managers talk to you like a dog. Wasn't able to move around the mill even if awarded a bid. Many guys with 30+ years seniority and not leaving anytime soon. Left because swing shift is hard on a family.
good,"Have a plan when you begin to work for this company’s make some money and investments because management sucks , no work life balance and you will not see your family"
good,The job is very rewarding but the people will make you change your career. Its like high school if the in crowd don't like you your job will be hard extremely hard and the people are so weird 1 day your in next day your out.
good,"Doing the same thing every day, schedule changes often, and upper management is rude and disrespectful! Most employees are helpful then there's the ones that are entitled and don't help because of their ""seniority"""
good,"Safety meeting. Go over any situations that may have came up day prior.        "
good,If you’re not educated at all this is a good way to make money for a decent living. You’re free time will be cut down dramatically. Most people develop diabetes do to extensive shirt work and long hours.
good,"The benefits and compensation were better than any other company that I worked for.  However, there are many issues with corporate culture, IT, hiring processes, annual reviews, promotion opportunities, outdated policies, and politics, that result in high turnover, especially at the Manager level and higher."
good,In order to advance you must have the proper friends. Upper management has allowed maintenance numbers to drop so low that it is impossible to be proactive with any maintenance.
good,"It was an ok place to work because of the money, but it was a dangerous place to work. They talk about safety in the meetings . If you get into the right area you'll make some good money. A typical day would be a safety meeting, followed by questions. Then you go to work. Management in the area I worked was just not on the mark. The hardest part of the job was not getting the help. workplace culture was ok, and it was pretty diverse. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay. You can move up at US Steel if you can hang around."
good,"I think that it is a very stable and safe environment, the core values there are very sound practices, The Carnegie Way, and safety are always foremost."
good,Work extremely long hours with very little down time management do not care about safety long as the product goes out the door. Threat of being fired if you make a mistake or have a accident.
good,The company is going though a lot of difficult change. Employees are constantly concerned about being laid off. The work environment is very negative and you are beat down until you want to leave. The only thing that kept me working so long were the great benefits.
good,Management policies make doing your job difficult most days. Co-workers were great. The environment is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. It is also very dirty.
good,"Company is currently suffering, but still has potential to return to greatness.  Gives illusion of security but displacement is swift and unapologetic.  Tends to discriminate based on age."
good,"Complete transformation happening at this Company - may be too little too late.  Still holding onto the ""old school culture"" where it is Production over Profit.  Just really starting to adopt the principles of lean six sigma and applying those to identify/eliminate waste and variation.  New Executive Leadership has the right mindset and is taking action on things that probably should have been done years ago.  "
good,Great benefits and pay.  Almost impoosible to live a normal life when working for this company.  Forced to work 16 hrs on a regular basis
good,"a typical day is a 12hr work day, 7am - 7pm, or 7pm - 7am. 30 min lunch in between. i learned that protecting yourself and others in hazardous work areas and everyday activities, is very important. an individual,no matter what the circumstances can never afford to lose his/her life or limb. management, no comment. the hardest part of the job, is working the longer hours and adjusting to the shift change in less than a 24hr period. the most enjoyable part is having the benefits and insurance for yourself and your family at reasonably low cost. including dental and vision. and not having to worry about living from check to check, or how you're going to pay expensive medical bills"
good,"US Steel took over National Steel when they went bankrupt. The Working conditions were tense at best. Time helped the situation, but US Steel wanted National Steel management out and they succeeded in doing so. I liked my job and tried very hard to learn everything the USS management wanted. They were very keen on the idea of hiring fresh out of college people, calling them Managment Associates for a year. This would have worked better if they actually put them out in the field to learn the steel business instead of inexperienced supervisors. I found US Steel a very hard place to work after 2003."
good,"a typical day at work is a boring day, and very tiring. I basically sit there for 12 to about 8 hours. Ive learned to be patient, meet new people, how to secure an area. The management isn't that well because the respect for the local employees isnt there. My co-workers have different personalities so most dont get along with each other and some do. I deal with disrespect, hygiene issues, laziness etc. The hardest part of the job is to sit there for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving at the end of the shift."
good,The union workforce is very skilled and focused on getting the job done.  Most of them made my job easier.  The management left a lot to be desired.  The decision making was poor and there was little opportunity for career advancement or expansion.
good,No advancement opportunities within the organization. No progression or development in place. You do not know what is needed to get to the next level and they don't provide a path.
good,Sometimes they only think about productivity (money)instead of preventative maintenance  the maintenance gang as a whole will show support and will offer their help in times of need
good,Us steel is a company about the #. And that's all you are. It doesnt have to make sense if the #s are right and they'll make them right on there own terms if they have too
good,Little to no work/life balance. A ton of OT. Great place to learn from. Very rugged place to work. Although will help people with a high risk background to get back on their feet.
good,They are far off from any type of work life balance in terms offering those benefits. Look elsewhere for any flexibility in this area that other companies are embracaing
good,"A great place to work, salary and benefits are awesome. USS lacks stability and the culture there does not value diversity. As an African American Manager I was often discriminated upon and couldn’t wait to resign."
good,"Company ""reorganization"" as they called it."
good,It was a good place to work and have a career. Lots of opportunities to learn different types of jobs. You can go to school while working at the same time. They also have job postings for other jobs at the plant. I decided to retire early and start my own business but certain things didn’t go my way.
good,High level of employees looking for outside opportunities.  People do not feel respected or listened to.  Little respect for management.  Use of outside contract company in India reducing the internal employee work loads and reducing headcount.
good,"I have never worked for a company where people have so much free time on there hands, able to be on your phone all day.  I guess why we were laid off."
good,good salary and benefits. set schedule is nice.  management that cared about its workers could go a long way for productivity. strengthening safety measures is a nice step
good,"The money was decent if you work a lot , most of the crew were good to work with, half of the management were good to work for, work environment was very dirty and very hot or cold, there was interesting equipment to work on and a lot of trouble shooting experience, no job advancement opportunity union environment."
good,"Steel plants can be great. But they can also be really bad. With the right boss, even bad times can go decent. With a bad boss, any bad times and you will find yourself out on the street. They like to claim that they will help you with tuition assistance and schooling, but it is mostly false claims."
good,"As with any shiftwork position, the hours were terrible. But that is one reason why you get paid so well. Being laid off was the best thing that ever happened to me. They suck you in with the high pay and benefits to the point that you fear walking away from such a good paying job. Leaving you with the decision of whats more important, family or money to provide for the family. I don't regret working at the mill, but I do regret missing a lot of important events in my children's lives."
good,"Very interesting processes to experience. However, due to the nature of international trade, it is unlikely to hold a position here for an extended period of time."
good,Rampant with cronyism ... who you know is more important than what you know ... resulting more responsibility at same pay rate ..limited updates on existing equipment ...and procedures
good,"I used to like working here, but now I dread coming to work. Some workers try to get overtime without actually working. Some workers do not get overtime that deserve it."
good,"The hours are long, the work is difficult, the feeling of a job well done is often tinged by the fact that you still have a million other things to do.  Change is very slow and money is always tight.  The culture is stuck in a mind set that won't allow for future progress and growth."
good,"Was once a proud, productive cornerstone in Alabama steel manufacturing but poor upper management strategic planning has decimated the facility."
good,"A typical day would consist of inconsistency and lack of communication.  I enjoy my position, but the hours could be long and you could work 6/7 days per week due to under staffing.  The co-workers are great to get along with and very helpful."
good,A challenging position providing technical service to major OEMs for flat rolled steel.  Company undergoing internal reorganization.
good,"USS great lakes works"
good,"Good money, everything else not so much.Your just a number no new thinking allowed ,boses use fear tactics.Antiquated ways of running a company."
good,A good place to work. But due to decline in steel industry production has declined over the years. And this makes for an unstable work environment.
good,"My work rest on my shoulders, if it's not right it's on me  I like that, I set my own hours ,my work is done no short cuts. I learned how to be a oil field tech. a lot of broken promise,. but the bills got paid. .The hardest part of my work was being the middle man depending on some one else, but the client was always satisfied"
good,Making rounds looking and listening for things out of the ordinary. Making sure of a clean and safe work area. I learned a lot about preventive maintenance. My management team worked well with me. They listened and interacted with my ideas. My co workers all worked as a team. The hardest part was really nothing. I had a great team and the was always there no matter the temp or time. I enjoyed going to my job every day and I miss it now!
good,"Fix and or repair anything in the plant that breaks down. repair hydraulics and mechanical problems, Enjoy the challenge of getting lines running quickly and solving the problems. Also enjoy leading workers to get the job done quickly."
good,"Upper management seems to not care about the people who do the day to day work.  Older work force is stuck in the ""this is not how we did it in the good old days"" mentality.  I really enjoyed the challenges that I had when I first started, but soon was overloaded."
good,You never know if the place is going to shut done. Everything relies on the economy and gas prices. Management is a joke. 90% of Shift foremans are straight out of college and think they know everything. The Union is a joke.
good,Good pay. Management needs work. Not the best place to work if you have a family. Rotating shifts are hard on your health.
good,That its a place full of hard working peoples but its employess are always worried of losing there job due to lay off. They don't update much of anything unless its a must.
good,Great job related training.  Safety minded company.  Excellent benefits.  Good crew to work with.  communication could of been better .  Lack of parts and tools made it difficult to perform task at times
good,"Start off your day by checking to be sure you have everything to complete your shift. Ive learned a lot about  the process of finished pipe needed to be sent to customers. Management has a failure to communicate approach, it could be improved. My co-workers are great, we strive to achieve the same goal. The hardest part of my job is running bad pipe and your incentive is low due to lack of quality. I enjoy going to work everyday and being around the people I work with."
good,"Challenging, your plate will be full. Additional learned skills will be on the job from more skilled contractors but you must pay close attention. Management turnover rate is EXCESSIVE and nothing is being done to maintain intermediate floor level leadership, therefore junior supervisors find higher paying jobs with less hours elsewhere."
good,good place to work lots to due . not enough support to get it all done
good,no family time over worked not enough pay horrible management los of favoritism
good,i learned alot about the steel industry. it gave me a chance to enhance my skills.
good,"Typical day was keeping busy to meet quotas, I learned more daily about entire operation of mill.Management was suspect to change from shift to shift as far as decison making.My co-workers were very good for the most part.The hardest part of the job was dealing with ineperienced supervisors making bad decisions and putting blame on workers.The most enjoyable thing was when everything was running well and everyone was not being pressured to meet tonnage."
good,"Locate coils and line them up in proper order to be processed. Take steel coils off of production line. Learned to drive various types of mobile equipment and to work at a safe, quick and time saving pace."
good,Generally I believe the employees want to work hard and have a secured place to work.
good,"Their employee services department is not called Human Resources, to be called that they have to be human and provide a service to the people. All the they look to do is terminate people, and work by intimidation. They are not a very participatative style of management. Everyone is not treated the same,"
good,"Need better communication with employees, Enjoyable part of the job is good pay, with Long Hours. I have learned more about the Steel Industry and the importance of a Good Maintenance Program"
good,"Top-down culture, decision making at higher levels than at mature companies (with limited input from below).  Still, they are steadily modernizing the plant and work culture."
good,"A strict business oriented position for a facility under extensive regulatory scrutiny was US Steel. The site was under an audit finding where changes to work protocol was mandated to correct compliance issues."
good,"Employment doesn't require too many skills to qualify, but comes with little to no job security outside of the union working for you. Knowing a skilled trade helps secure a position, but maintenance is often poorly supplied. There is a mismanagement of resources that often punishes employees. The facility is often understaffed, so that when there is an uptick in demand, there is an overabundance of overtime. Outside of that, it has great benefits, and pays well."
good,Very stressful environment lacked good communications with management. Underpayed with high volume criteria. Short on litigations with employees. No support for managers.
good,There are other companies that offer better training. Management could use more experience in maintenance and operations. The equipment and buildings need overall improvement.
good,"A great history, but now it's ran by a bunch of greedy managers that care little about equipment reliability. Strong union base that deserves better from a bunch of management clowns."
good,"provide information and answer question from E-mails sent the day before, and throughout the day. answer phones, answer and fill walk-in order. Enter and send for approval orders for supplies, services, and adjustments to open orders. I can provide more information upon interview questions."
good,"It was almost always something different everyday. I went to every part of the pant as a Electrician. repairing and installing new systems. The hours of work did change a lot, but not to bad. Attitudes of a lot of the workers there was not very good. hard to get parts and fix things as needed to be to do it right."
good,the job was very hot the do provide uniforms and shoes iot was  a swing shift but not much time off Didnt like being looked if the person behind you didnt show up you had to work another 8 hours
good,Advancement in company and benefits for retirement are almost non-existent. Equipment is outdated and in poor condition. Maintenance is at bare bones to repair most of it.
good,"Rough culture that breeds negativity. Pay is OK. Time off is good once youve earned it ( It took me 8 years to get 3 weeks off ) Insurance is good under Union plan, but not so much under Management plan"
good,"It's a steel mill.  Pretty much what you think.  The pay is decent if you work all the overtime.  Benefits are good, but work is very dangerous and dirty.  Company will have daily safety meetings and then ask you to violate those rules as soon as production is slowed in any way."
good,"United States steel is a company whos roots run deep. Its Facilities have a mix of new and experienced managers and worforce. work life balance is poor. There is room for advancement within the company, but there is a lot of competition due to the high turnover rate. most of the new college graduate managers get three years experience and move on to other companies. If you dont mind swing shift and long hours, and great compensation then uss is a place for you."
good,If you don't mind working in a factory type atmosphere then  you could enjoy working here. There is lots to do and learn. There can be some workplace hazards to look out for so know your safety.
good,Promotional opportunities are available due to size of organization. Office culture is conservative. Organization change is fluid and job security may not be as stable as with a smaller organization.
good,"Good money but long hours & management sucked. Many of my bosses were hired right out of college and they had no clue how to run that place ! It's closed now but under Camp-Hill we sure were profitable, just saying"
good,Always learned something new everyday. Shift work can be difficult at times. Summer can be very hot with the extreme temperatures. New installations were challenging and very rewarding.
good,"Job Security is non-existent currently even for managers who are also underpaid. Maintenance jobs are under attack and the union has failed in their basic job. Why they are cutting maintenance jobs in a steel mill seems counterproductive considering the equipment is under hard use. "
good,"The chemistry lab at US Steel has an impressive pay scale and benefits package.  The laboratory facilities are rather run down, and much of the equipment used is decades old and prone to problems as a result.  Corporate culture is poisoned by a union shop, resulting in an us versus them mentality.  Many times it has been nearly impossible to get basic requirements for the job."
good,"when the plant has orders, we are busy. no job security. 90% of managers didn't have mill experience. currently on lay off."
good,"Hard work for good wages.  The environment isnt very pleasant, its very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.  Safety is #1 with every employee but in the end it is a steel mill and you always have to be aware."
good,"US Steel is okay to work in, people are nice but they keep laying off people due to their poor sales. It;s a good place to work if yo like sticking to one company and can keep your job"
good,HOT!!!  Learn much about pipe making process.  At times job is stressfree and laidback.  Most times very stressful and terrible communication among management
good,"Zero work life balance on the operations production side.  Pay is great.  Expect to work 48-55hr/ week if management.  Union workers are highly motivated.  Advancement exists, however restructuring is decreasing the likely hood of advancements."
good,My 14 years there has been a great adventure. I'm looking to advance my career and grow with another company.
good,"some days were busy some days were slow, I learned how to do the job to the best of my knowledge. Co-workers were enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was the paperwork."
good,Company is downsizing. My career started quite well here but the steel manufacturing business is not doing well right now.
good,Not much to say. Mangement tries to push but the employees are backed by the union. So it's not too bad.
good,"Overall a stable company to work for, however be prepared to work very long hours and often. Holidays, weekends and 10+ days in a row are typical."
good,This company in general is a good company to work for. Good pay and benefits. 
good,"U.S. Steel has good pay for the job, but the schedule is terrible. Management could do a better job for their employess. The benefits are great."
good,It was a convenient place to work and the hours were great! The company offered great family outings to parks.
good,I would work as either a laborer on the Blast furnace or as a train operator in any type of weather conditions. I was also chosen to become a member of the Safety Team. This gave me the opportunity to rewrite and prepare the new safe job procedures for the new blast furnace. The hardest part of the job was the shift work and overtime. The most enjoyable part was that I was chosen to go the Pittsburgh and learn about new equipment so that I would be able to write the new safety procedures for the furnace.
good,Don't Trust Anyone! Back stab and leave you for dead in a heart beat.
good,"Typical steel industry job with standards, rules, and numbers. Numbers and production over employees."
good,"The steel industry as a whole works a swing schedule of some sort. Although the pay is good it does not allow one to have a balance of work and family. It is an environment where it doesn't matter how long you have worked, there is always something to be learned. Working in this environment has allowed me to manage with understanding."
good,"Technically challenging place to work. High level of talented coworkers. Industry stability an issue. Work life balance not a priority, 60-70 plus a week normal."
good,"The title says it all. management is also very poor. they don't train very will and just assume that you will ""pick-up"" how to do the job. However, if you mess up write ups are handed out like candy."
good,Due to the nature of company confidentiality I am unable to comment much. This is a great job with amazing benefits. I will say that upper management leadership and communication could use some work.
good,"Sometimes felt like a time warp to the 1920's.  Management by intimidation was the norm, with lots of yelling and cursing.  Pay and benefits were above average, but contentious atmosphere was tough to stomach."
good,"The pay isn't bad, most of the people are decent enough, but don't expect any time off. 7 days a week and 12+ hours a day\night. It's a job, but that's about it."
good,"A very nice team but biggest downfall is there is no room to grow. Very hard industry to be in and they do not have all products to sell. Everyone is very nice to work with, but no long term career here."
good,Great job. Way too much downtime. Poor management with regards to equipment and personnel. A lot of buddy buddy stuff going on. no kind of preventative maintenance.
good,Working at U. S. Steel was a challenge. Although the money is good it doesn't cater to family life.  The long hours and possibility of being froze over to work a double is not appealing.  The money and benefits are good but the hours are long .
good,"Except for conflicting and medieval management policies, it is a challenging place to work. It is, for the most part, a noisy, dirty and hot environment but the pay and benefits are very good for a union setting. Safety is a big concern because of the dangerous nature of hot steel. There are programs in place to train people to the electrical and mechanical maintenance fields which are grade 4 pay positions. Also there is some reimbursement for outside tuition."
good,"The work schedules are horrible. You are required to work swing shifts, changing every week. You are usually required to work all holidays and week ends. Management and employees do not work well together. The money is great if you can adjust to the environment. The work can be dangerous too."
good,Challenges each day and overall experiences. Frequent interaction with operations and facility personnel. Need more interaction with upper management and definitive roles.
good,"Working here was like watching my grandpa watch the TV on mute, it just seemed like there was a lot of things wrong, old and outdated with everything. Safety was not very well maintained as two people died in the plant in Zugg island during my tenure as an intern.  "
good,"Ok place if you don`t want any kind of life outside from there .very fast pace ,some coworkers are ok and some are just lazy."
good,Very low moral. Long term employees are not valued. They are taken for granted. If you are in the cut everything will flow nicely. If you are not in the click then you will be an outcast.
good,Job was enjoyable and challenging. People were fun to work with. Poor insight from management to hire new people then layoff huge amount of people 6 months later.
good,"I start the day before: anything pending at the end of the day takes priority first thing in the morning, after daily am tasks and meeting with my supervisor. Then I follow through with the tasks needed to be done that day, as well as anything else that comes up. By the end of the day, I make up a to-do list for tomorrow, clean up my desk, and set out the pending things next to my list to tackle them first thing in the morning."
good,"I liked my time and training at U. S. Steel. I was laid off after 6 months. If you love overtime, this is the place to work. It is a hot hard job with excellent  benefits. It is a difficult place to get on with. You can be forced over on a double with almost no notice. Everyone I worked with was knowledgable and helpful for the most part. It is swing shift. It is hard to get adjusted to this and almost impossible to make any plans."
good,typical day usually consists of at least 8 hours with some overtime. I'm always learning different things when it comes to trouble shooting electrical components on different types of hvac equipment. I'm not going to comment on the management at this plant. the people I work closely with are very knowledgeable and professional very good to work with. the hardest part of this job would be the environment that we work in we make steel here. the most enjoyable part is getting things accomplished and repaired as needed in the most safest way possible.
good,"Very proffesional run company, however very old ways of doing business will probably make it impossible to stay in business in the next decade."
good,"Working at a Steel Mill is different everyday. You never know what is going to happen, what problem you got to deal with. One always has to be on the look-out for safety and to oversee that employees are doing what they are suppose to be. Things can seem to have a domino effect at times, where one thing happens, then another and so forth. It's important to manage home life and work life because if you don't, you'll end up working all the time with no life. The pay is decent and the benefits are nice. Some departments are better than others."
good,"Provides my family with a good lifestyle,  provides me the opportunity to experience a wide range of equipment."
good,Crews work together for production. Company is very reputable and provide great salaries and benefits for their employees.
good,"Long hours, often called in to work on off day, asked to do work outside of job description. Poor communication between employees and management. If your not a favorite you will not advance. Great benefits."
good,"Start the job with safety meeting, then see how the furnaces are running then whatever needed to be done for the day. I've learned how to deal with different personalities and how to get the best out of the work force.Work well with upper management and also with coworkers. The hardest part of the job is long hours everyday and being away from family.  The enjoyable part of the job is when you see what you have accomplished an the day."
good,"A typical day at work is security, receiving coils and shipping of coils, and customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with other employees and customer."
good,"I have been a qualified strand operator for 20 years. I have held a permanent position as a strand operator for about 9 years. I work 12 hour shifts, My day consists of working around and monitoring the strand pendant and the mould area supervising ladle changes and other events as well as directing other members of the workforce when required. The hardest part of the job is trying to run a fine line between pacing the shop to what is happening with and in the mould at the strand. Dealing with argon management and mould level control is key to making a good product and continuity of the process ."
good,"start the day checking in to see what had to be done for the day "
good,"With this employer I was required to work 12 hour rotating shifts. During a typical shift I would read the logs from the previous shift and do the various equipment inspections for the shift taking readings from high pressure steam turbines and other systems including HVAC, water, compressed air, oxygen, nitrogen and fuel. Additionally, we would work in teams for gas testing for confined space, safety lockouts for repairs. The role of a utilities tech is to ensure the flow of various energy systems to keep steel production going and find solutions to problems when systems break down and to lockout energy systems so that maintenance can be performed."
good,When your relief doesnt show up you are are stuck doing their shift right after your own 8 hour shift which happens very often. Management has no clue how to actually manage.
good,sitting in front of computer terminal most of the day
good,They was good company to work for. The only reason I left was the hours got cut. Then the layoffs started. Other than that was a great company to work for
good,A good providing work place.  Is very big on safety. It is a company that every department works together to make it run more efficiently. The managers care about the well being of their employees.
good,"The steel industry is changing, so your job is in question and seeing the firings, layoffs,  not very comforting,   however they don't play favorites,  if you don't pull your weight   no matter what level you are,  YOURE out"
good,Constant derision between management and union makes the working environment very hostile. Plan for a long walk to get to your work place. Very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer.
good,The hourly pay is good but being union work everything over 8 hours is overtime pay. That being said you will make most of your money in overtime. the work/life balance is nonexistent  you will basically live at the mill.
good,Working for any large corporation you are just a number. There is no job security. Corporations are selfish and greedy. I liked the people I worked with just didnt like who I worked for.
good,Good place to work and learn skilled trades. I did my apprenticeship there and was well trained by experienced professionals. Pay is very competitive and insurance is company paid.
good,They're more interested in headline news than what's best for the company and its employees. Need to turn this poor performance around ASAP so your talent can blossom.
good,Ran a different machines. Pushed the coke dumped the coke filled up the ovens to produce the coke   Worked a ton of hours more than most always doubled out
good,"Very demanding work environment, but rewarding in the end.  I very much enjoyed mentoring and coaching young managers.  I felt like that was the most satisfying aspect of my job."
good,"Great place to make money, not so hot treatment by Canadian steel industry standards. "
good,But they outsourced the department to India. i left before the change and layoffs. We did collections and posted cash for a portfolio of accounts. I enjoyed working with the customers to clean up accounts.
good,"You have the opportunity to meet some very good people and make some very good money.  Management and co workers.  However, because most of the positions are based on having a relief, you will miss allot of holidays, birthdays,etc."
good,"a diverse environment with a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement. a variety of technical equipment and process equipment, always something to do."
good,"US Steel was a good company to work for, the people there were good and the benefits were good as well. I worked there for two years and have no complaints"
good,"great co-workers for the most part. but management treats the employees terrible. like you should be honored to work for the  "
good,Not alot of advancement opportunities.  It feels like a popularity contest when it comes to promotions.  Union plan was a joke.  A revolving door at the HR position.
good,"Leadership had strengths and weaknesses, overall direction of company is concerning at the moment, opportunities to grow were present at times but also a lot of preferential treatment going on"
good,"As a quality engineer, I had multiple production units to oversee the daily and weekly quality of.  Hours began began just before sunrise and continued to sunset (on average).  the quality engineer was expected to engage in continuous improvement and process engineering tasks.  "
good,"I loved the customer Service and Work order aspect of the position. However, the manager that I was last assigned had no prior knowledge of what we did before I trained her. And after she became my manager she had to ask how and when to do things, which was her responsibility as my manager. she did not treat us fairly and was very rude on a daily basis. just hard to continue working there. I was laid off probably due to her helping make that decision."
good,"Productive fun place to work. The daily work day consisted of either dealing with extreme heat or extreme cold. The foreman was sometimes a little much, But for the most part the job was not bad. Other than dealing with the working conditions I would recommend this job to others who would be interested and could handle the working conditions."
good,"Good place to work if you dont mind long days or long nights. Good coworkers in most departments, most of the supervisors are there for you if you need to talk to them about a problem your having"
good,This does not seem appropriate to me.  I have no idea why you are asking or how this will be used.  I do not understand the importance of this in my job search.
good,This was the worse job I ever had forced overtime even after you work four doubles in a row.The managers didn't do anything to the people that called off all the time time then get upset when you say that you don't want to work over so what they do is don't tell you that your buddy called off.It was the most money I ever made but the hours was causing health issues which they didn't care about.this is a great job for a single person but a family person mostly ends up in divorce court.
good,"checking all trucks and car going in and out of the gate, checking for correct amount of coils and correct location and to make sure they where not over weight."
good,Ok.....very great job. Very great positive people. Very great learning experience. I’ve always been a great worker and always with great attendance...
good,Pay is good but the hours needed to work are stressful. I would recommend this job to a single person that doesn't mind the long hours needed to make a real good living.
good,Started as a steady place of employment for a family man. Over the years things have changes and work is now unsteady. Doesn't seem to be any recovery in site.
good,"Completed a project on assignment,good work resulted in addition project reward extending job.Strong reliabilty on contractors.enjoyed thinking outside the box."
good,"As with any shiftwork position, the hours were terrible. But that is one reason why you get paid so well. Being laid off was the best thing that ever happened to me. They suck you in with the high pay and benefits to the point that you fear walking away from such a good paying job. Leaving you with the decision of whats more important, family or money to provide for the family. I don't regret working at the mill, but I do regret missing a lot of important events in my children's lives."
good,"I entered all Data from OSHA/Corporate exams into Health Information Management System. Determined and scheduled employee exams according to job, rating, exposure and age"
good,"Everyone here is so freaked out all of the time that they will take any opportunity to stab you in the back, try and take your job away, or make themselves look good off of your hard work."
good,"Fast paced, and unsure about when your able to go home (either 8 or 16 hour shifts). Rotating shift work, and not much of a family life when things are booming in the steel industry."
good,"Hot in summer, Cold in winter. Dwindling work force. They are forever combining jobs and expect you to keep up, No set lunch or breaks. you take them when and if you can."
good,Pay is decent starting out but don't expect much of a raise. Jobs are usually more intimidating than hard at first. Once learned they're usually quite easy. Most managers are just incompetent puppets that cater to lazy and childish union workers. Expect to swing shifts for almost all jobs. Usually weekly shifts 1/3/2. If your lucky enough to be very understaffed in your department you can expect to work 2-3 mandatory double shifts a week and have no life outside of work.
good,There is a wealth of knowledge and talent here. With so many experts it can be challenging to get up standard as you will likely have to learn all aspects of the business to not have your answers challenged. If you can survive you can learn more than you would imagine.
good,"Good job, good pay,good guys ,good benefits, laid off, hoped to retire from there, company is greedy, union isn't helping much been there for 20 years"
good,Review log from previous shifts to determine if addition repairs are needed.  Meet with supervisor to discuss the plan for the days activities.  Set schedule of jobs for upcoming shifts.  Ensure proper tools and parts are available for work to be performed.  Inspect completed projects.
good,A typical day at work included cleaning various locations.  I learned   how to clean and disinfect multiple places.  Management was trustworthy in that they trusted me to complete my job.
good,Operated freight trains both manually and with a controller. Had to relocate ingots of steel from melt-down process to solidify process in outdoor environment.
good,"Working for US Steel has some challenges but overall is not a bad place to work. In a typical day at the mill, a person has to be able to handle the extreme elements ranging form very hot, muggy or freezing cold. Their stance on safety is pretty good overall because they provide ppe and different classroom training sessions several times a year. Management can be a little overbearing sometimes but most of the employees realize the pressures those guys/gals go through.Co-workers there are always supportive of each other because they know if production goes well, EVERYONE is happy. The hardest part of the job is long hrs enduring the ever changing Ohio weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing finished product being shipped out of the building by rail cars knowing we had a hand at sending our customers a quality product."
good,"Plant management meeting for info on the past shifts progress on projects and production of steel. I line my trades people up with a safety meeting and give out work orders, Complete payroll time sheets check daily on budget for projects making sure all are on budget. Hardest part of the job was there are not enough hours in the day for a plant manager running a large plant I never was able to sit down and have a good lunch always in demand due to minor and major break downs due to the age of the plant."
good,"Got layed off twice in one year, stay away from here if they open back up. Main Admin managers got caught stealing from company"
good,This was my first job after retiring from the Air Force and there was a big difference in how everyone reacted to each other.
good,"Hot, hard work at times,  Long hours, continuous operations, no teamwork, volatile market for products, inexperienced coworkers."
good,"Fun place to work with great employees "
good,it was good job had great people that worked there just a lot of misunderstanding with other workers the majority didn't speak English.
good,"Fast paced environment where you are on your feet 12 straight hours with little time for breaks. Swing shifts allows time with your family, more so than any company I've worked for in the past.  Top notch benefits and excellent pay with opportunities for overtime."
good,"All about production and shareholders. "
good,Has its Ups and Downs. On the floor Managers are easy to get along with. Different and Challenging Job each day. Good Safety values.
good,"Located approximately 10 miles west of Birmingham, Ala., Fairfield Works is comprised of both steelmaking and finishing facilities. Included in the finishing facilities is Fairfield Tubular Operations, a seamless pipe mill."
good,"Was given the opportunity to develop new skills, and to work on various equipment. Fellow employees were good to work with and were willing to share work experience."
good,"Lots of overtime(Mandatory)"
good,"Benefits and pay are great. Very dirty place to work. Be prepared to work long hours , weekends and rotate shifts and off days."
good,"So many talented co-workers and a lot of fun to be there.  No company is perfect of course, so they have a long way to go to balance employee relations in order to increase employee morale."
good,"Busy all the time, great co workers. Wish fast track did not pass and all the overseas shipments of steel would stop so I would not have to be laid off and could go back to US Steel."
good,This is a tough place to work as the union members are all about taking care of themselves at great cost to the company.  As soon as a person gets hired the company does everything it can to get rid of you.  Much like the military.
good,Good group of people with tremendous knowledge.  Company was unstable as it switched hands numerous times in the Ohio location.
good,hardest Part of the Job was Dealing with some of my Co-Workers and Working outside in the Winter(The Cold Elements). Typical day at work consisted of Filling Bins and Keeping them fully Stocked with  Material for Production of Iron Ore.
good,"The group of guys I worked with were good guys. We came to work everyday on time, did our job to the best of our ability and made the best of each day. We had good managers and we had bad managers, the same as every other workplace. I enjoyed the people I work with more than anything."
good,"Started working for United States Steel after a 4 year enlistment in the U.S. Air Force.   I was employed there for almost 20 years until being permantly laid off due to foreign imports......the local plant at Johnstown, PA was shut down. I really enjoyed my job at USS....being a shop scheduler was right up my alley."
good,The company is a good sustainable company to work for. There is a sincere push to ensure that everyone be safety minded. The benefits are wonderful and the pay is good.
good,"Very rich history, but lots to learn in how to develop young employees."
good,"I worked in the Hottest,Dirtiest Place on Earth. A steel mill."
good,"They have a very old school work culture which turns off a lot of new college kids or people not used to the steel industry. Good benefits and pay is competitive. Of all the jobs I ever had I learned the most working in US Steel's mills, they have every kind of technology if you are an engineer or mechanically inclined you will like it. However they will work you to death and performance punishment is the norm."
good,well established company. responsible for the administration of the collective bargaining agreement.
good,"Union are great ensure we work safely daily basic."
good,Great place to work for. Have worked there for five years. 12 hr. shifts with plenty of overtime but it does require a rotating shift. Big family atmosphere.
good,Your experience here will depend upon which manager you work for
good,"Not bad for the pay, depends on your boss.  Job relies on problem solving and you will need to be available off hours in case of emergency because the mill runs 24/7."
good,Great team members to work with.  Management was transparent in sharing information that was relative and needed to perform my job.  I was able to access management as I deemed appropriate.
good,A lot of changes happening recently.  Shift work can be rough.  The steel market is cyclical... its either feast or famine.  Haven't been happy for a few years and finally decided to look for other opportunities.
good,"great pay and benefits"
good,"great benefits, great pay, work/life balance is not good.  Overall, a good place to earn a living as long as you don't have to worry about getting laid off"
good,"Good paying job with many good benefits. The job can be highly stressful at times due to being a 24/7 operation. A lot of good people to work with, also many difficult people to deal with. The company is slow to give training for there employees."
good,Good place to start your career in steel industry. After restructure anybody can loose his job due to new business approach. New management company looking just for profit.
good,Us Steel doesnt care for their employees. They give not enough reconition to them and their rewards are none. Its been a take away from employees such as I for some years now and they insist on keeping it that way. Their upper management should be ashamed of themselves
good,Great pay and benefits. Could be long hours and change shifts every 7 days.  Could be mandated to stay another shift on a daily basis. Never knew when you would be allowed to leave. Year long exposed to elements outside.
good,The time and training that I got was very good but working in the mill is not for me. A managers responsibility here is too great of an area to maitain for one manager.
good,Stressful workplace having to deal with Allegheny health department. Very strict disciplinary policy. Very good and productive work force. Facility very well maintained. Some very good managers. Some managers not so good.
good,The money and benefits are great. A great job to raise a family. You will work weekends and holidays. Most people have to work a swing shift. It is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.
good,Been Layed off four times in the 7 years that I have worked at US steel.  Due to cheap imports its hard for company to compete in the market so multiple departments and plants have been shut down.  Has been great experience and great place to work just not guaranteed to be steady enough to get ahead with the rise in cheap imports
good,It's a good place to work if you're looking for stability. The money can be good depending on what department you go to. The down side is you need thick skin to work there.
good,a typical day at work is normal make sure you have all things needed to start and I have learn how to do a multiple things as far as relief foreman cutting pipe learning different types of pipes testing pipes. Management could have been better co workers were reliable when it came to specific jobs hardest part bout the job was not knowing whats going and communication with management most enjoyable part was knowing someone will help you if you really needed it
good,"Assembly line work for the oil and gas industry. Produced pipe used for the  oil and gas industry. Worked a station on the assembly line 12 hours a day. Forklift operating, material handling, quality control."
good,"The feeling that when I go home that I made a Product that I can be proud of knowing that someone will get a great product."
good,"A typical day is hot, dirty, and dangerous. We make raw metal and fill rail cars and send them to the steel making part of the plant."
good,"A challenging environment, where molten steel was processed in 200 ton batches."
good,Rigging for crane lifts of seamless pipe for racking and unracking in the temporary storage facility. Working conditions is anywhere between extreme heat and extreme cold.
good,It is a company stuck in an era long ago. The communication is very poor and they are very slow to change. Much of the leadership shows a great lack of leadership and every boss that puts forth their best effort and actually cares tends to find new jobs rather quickly.
good,"Pleasant atmosphere with enthusiastic people.  Loud, dirty working conditions, shift work.  Knowledgeable coworkers.  Learned to "
good,"A typical day was smooth, the normal routine"
good,"The job I currently hold is the most time consuming, challenging, and demanding job I have ever had the oppotunity to endure.  It has opened more doors for me in terms of access to the company, understanding the business and operations, and also expanded my network within the company and with vendors.  In addition to career benefits, this job has also proven to me what I am able to endure in a job and has taught me life lessons.  I have learned to be more patient, realize how to embrace my strengths and recognize my weaknesses.  "
good,Good place to get practical knowledge in a heavy industrial environment.
good,"Get tools ready. Tail board with co worker about job and decide which side of job responsibility is preferred. Visually inspect pipes. Reject pipes that do not meet the specs. Stencil pipes with date and inspection stamp."
good,"I was a forklift driver, and laborer, enjoyed my job and the people I worked with."
good,"Many advancement opportunities.  Salaries are competitive.  Managers work long hours and market is cyclical."
good,"USS afforded many advancement opportunities early in my career. Slow to change, but the company culture and management was beginning to move forward with a more proactive focus on managing the business when I left in 2015"
good,Decent company when times are good but during downturns there is always lots of turnover and turmoil. The company is working on shifting to a more flexible organization.
good,"This is a hard company to work for on the operations side, but I at least was well compensated for it (this is assuming salary employees still get paid overtime).  The management structure is huge but they do a decent enough job of having a unified mission.  I left because layoffs meant more and more work upon my shoulders and it was just too much for me."
good,"USS is a good job, it provides for a family of 6. The job has it's up and downs as any job does. USS has layoffs depending on how the market is doing but USS trust to avoid that as much as possible."
good,The Clairton Works Coke plant ii a very physically demmanding job. I am an electrical maitenance team leader. The machinery is always in need of repair or updating.
good,In general a decent place to work compensation and benefits are above average. Working conditions are noisy and dirty. Hours are long. Management is generally receptive and concerned with your job.
good,"This was a great place to work to provide for your family. You have the opportunity to work as much overtime as you like. The main downside to working at U.S. Steel is being on a buddy system. If the second shift person calls in its mandatory that you work their shift. Otherwise, I really enjoyed working there."
good,"I left a job of 17 years for an opportunity at USS Research Center in Munhall, PA, and 10 months later the whole group was cut. No commitment to its employees or R&D."
good,It was a good work environment with chances to advance . I was able to learn different aspects of the steelmaking process .The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather.
good,"Good Company to work for but they have very little compassion for doing anything wrong. I was sick and didn't want to call off so I took Nyquill. I didn't know there was a little alcohol and had a positive test for it. .001 , not even enough for half a drink"
good,"Each day at work was somewhat the same, working through organization problems and working through test plans in their Oracle system. My manager was engaged and helpful when necessary. My co-workers were always there to lend a hand if needed and easy to talk to. The hardest part of my work was having a lack of direction or steady workflow and the most enjoyable part was learning the new information and associating with others in the workplace."
good,"I have worked for U S Steel for the last 12 years, and worked at the Granite City plant for 26, 13 plus years for National Steel.   U S Steel bought our company in 2003 after a downturn in the economy forced National steel into bankruptcy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with inexperienced management. Our plant has had a huge turnover the past couple years in the mid management level,  Also couple that with upper management getting huge bonuses while asking employees and mid management to take huge cuts.This has created a strained relationship between management and the Union. Now we face another layoff at Granite City. The best part of working there is the people, a livable wage is also a big plus."
good,"You work hard, it is generally pretty dirty, you will go home tired, but it is a good tired, you feel like you worked for your money"
good,"long days and kind of boring, learned all about how they make coal in to coke, and bad management, and the best of all was the co-works on the crew and most enjoyable part of the job was going home after each shifts"
good,Compensation and benefits are good.  Most managers do not seem to care about employees and only about numbers.  Most co-workers don't care about their job and only care about getting each other in trouble.
good,I enjoy what I do. I am at work a lot . down side is not much time for home an when oil prices are down we usually do not have work. So either we are working 7 days a week or we are laid off. Its one of the safest places to work but if you don't follow procedures you could end up hurt really bad or worse.
good,Great pay and benefits. Some parts of the mill are harder than the others. Have to get use to working swing swift and frequent overtime. Overtime can be excessive at points. Overall good experience
good,"Although the wages are good, they have not got a good reputation and therefore have difficulty hiring and keeping skill trades. Since their takeover of Stelco they have locked out Lake Erie, Hamilton, and again Lake Erie. As you can see Job security sucks. This is a place that you are only a clock number and your reward for doing a good job or going above and beyond is your pay cheque. There is lots of room for improvement and hopefully in the near future they will see this and become a world class operation."
good,Job stability suffers due to US steel upper managments desire to cut back contract agreements.
good,Opportunities available in various areas to be able to develop career over time.
good,Fabricate and/or repair equipment used in the manufacturing of seamed pipe.
good,This place showdown the more important area hit mill and 1500 worker lay-off between April and May 2020 but the management not filling good but they take lay-off
good,"As one of the original Fortune 500 companies, USS has a long rich history, which shows strongly in the current workplace culture. Employees are well compensated with salary and benefits and the management structure is well established. They are working to modernize the workplace culture by becoming more innovative and adaptable to the constant changing markets. There is a lot to learn from a steelmaking standpoint, due to USS's long history and there are many experts to learn from. The complex processes also offer a lot of opportunity for engineers to work on projects and learn. The 24/7 operating schedule occasionally requires checking-in with work on off hours/weekends. I've learned a great deal about the products/processes and the quality group is close knit and full of great people."
good,Was a good job just too many hours per week.  Mill environment was generally not the cleanest.  People were good but was with a union and that baggage that comes with.
good,The CEO is out of his mind not wanting to negotiate we Haven't had a raise in 6 years now he wants to take our benefits from us  with a minimal raise an offer us craap for benefits the hole point of the steel mill is the good benefits that's why you go to work there and risk your life in the environment.
good,This kind of work is not for everyone but there is a lot of benefits here. I learned a lot about steel and the different steps in making it. I enjoyed the people and being able to say I was apart of the process.
good,The people are great in the Sheet Division of the company.  There are challenging assignments to be handled.  The hardest part is trying to analyze someone elses work in order to cover for them.  I love working with the vendors to resolve issues on either side.
good,"U.S.Steel Would be a great place to work at.I took the Maintenance job there as for,what I thought would be a secure job.I am leaving the mill because of lay offs.U.S.Steel does,and will train and expect a employee to to any job safely at the mill,weather it pertains to production,or maintenance.I enjoyed the job,and its duty's.I was an employee there for 3 years,and out of the 3 years at the mill,I missed 2 days,absences.I hardly ever called in on the job,only because the weather was bad enough to drive. I hate to loose the job,but the direction the mill is going,this will defiantly not be the last layoff,even after the production starts back up."
good,decent place to work with a good salary and benefits workers have to make sure they wear protective equipment to make sure they are safe and free from injury
good,"company paid very well but due to the industry lay-offs are often.  The culture in the plant revolved around safety since it is a dangerous job, which is very reassuring."
good,We had weekly meetings to make sure our team was on the same page to know what our responsibilities were. The work moral was high and management made sure his team was taken care of.
good,"Busy place to work, lots of over time, great benefits, industrial environment."
good,"US Steel provides a great place to work, but it is not for everyone. The job provides very good pay and benefits, but if you aren't a good fit it could be difficult to get settled into the job."
good,"As an intern, I did experimental work on steel grades. I ran experiments, analyzed data, and presented the data. I was able to attain my Green Belt in DFSS, a rare opportunity for an intern. The culture was very relaxed, but productivity was expected. I was never in the position that I could not complete my given tasks, and often had time to overachieve."
good,"Work was great, had no issues with doing the jobs I was certified on, I'm certified on multiple operations, there is not a job I can not learn. If it has wheels, tracks, or cables I can run it."
good,"The BOF wasn't the most pleasant work environment. The office atmosphere is stagnant, but inside the BOF is hot and stuffy. It's good for workers who like to get their hands dirty in maintenance, but for the more creative personality, this is the worst type of job. Workers in the office are often lazy until something in the casters break down unless they are especially motivated to implement something new. Benefits are great, however. Overall, not a very exciting job, but for someone who is just looking for a 9-5, this may be just the thing."
good,"	Was responsible for data entry of load plans and reports of vehicle arrival and departure time."
good,Both fellow employees and supervisors are great people to work with. Work smart not hard. Very safety conscious.
good,Its a job that will make you make money by working you 7 days a week 12 to 16 hours a day. You have no job security and any home life is non existent if at all.
good,Industry is a dying breed in this country.  This place didn't care about career advancement or education.  I can honestly say this was a horrible experience for anyone that can count above ten.
good,good jod to take care of your family good benifits hard work management is not fair at all
good,"US Steel  is a great company to work for. The steel industry is weak however which causes a lot layoffs. The pay is good, there is not much room for advancement."
good,"The is a lack of management that take the responsibility and hold be accountable for their actions/decisions. Things change based on the management; there is no set direction; each division is ran very different;; it's understood they are different divisions and their processes are different; however, the process to manage employees should be the same. There is no kind of leadership. Stuck in their old ways and they do not want to grow with the present times.  "
good,"Good pay, good benefits. Layoffs every 6 months if not sooner."
good,"I wish I could say I enjoy working here but I'd be lying. While the hours are consistent, I often feel like another gear in the machine. The opportunities for advancement are few and far."
good,"I am a trained plant operation technician committed to company core values, driving results, and exceeding expectations. Safety-conscious and skilled in the operation of all plant duties, machinery, and equipment. I have 5 years working in the water treatment plant, 1.5 years in gas handling, and 6 years in operations and half year in heating/patching. Monitored flows, pressures, feed levels & indicators. I recorded inside & outside process readings on a daily log sheets. Performed minor mechanical work & routine equipment maintenance. I operated a dump truck, fork lifts, and scissor lifts. Loaded and unloaded byproducts daily. Conducted safety inspections and followed safety rules and procedures. Executed field service work with minimal to no supervision. Retrieved and performed water samples and implement process changes. Recorded gas volumes and process analyzer reading. Adjusted pumping systems, chemical feeders, auxiliary equipment, and pump station indicators. Operated plate and belt presses. Tranferred lime to the soaker machines. Operated and switched pumps weekly in the Water Treatment Plant at US STEEL. I also ran a heavy machinery like a pusher machine, door machine, and Larry car in the operation department. Now I fix battery walls and fill cracks with a slurry mixture. I also keep the battery temperatures around 2200-2400 degree temperatures. I add gas when needed to keep these temperatures. I wear metatarsal boots, gloves, safety hat, face mask, and safety pants and coat."
good,"US Steel is a great place to work at.  Unfortunately, there have been too many ""brown"" noses that have been promoted.  Some of these individuals have zero education and zero experience in managing a complex billion dollar company.  But they have been promoted because they have the ability to ""kiss-up"" to higher management.  They will introduce projects that on paper save $$$ but when the results cannot be achieved they manipulate the stats and move on to other cost saving projects leaving hard working individuals to take the fall."
good,"Good place to work. Good pay, good benefits. Management doesn't understand the workplace. The steel industry as a whole is volatile and unstable."
good,Great place to work in team enviroment but no job security! Company likes to keep you as a contractor forever and never hire you.
good,No job security considering plant is showing profits but yet shutting this plant down I am at.  Pay is good but yet im out of work soon with no benefits after the axe gets me.
good,Fast paced work environment. Great union members to work with. Great benefits and insurance is ok. Close to home. US Steel cares about safety and it’s work force.
good,Inconsistent training including the fact that you may have a different trainer on any given day. The different teaching styles/techniques between trainers made it hard to catch on properly.
good,go in get set up run pipe inspected threads types pipe grade length  work alone most of the time boss wood come around only if we had some thing go wrong
good,"In the 1970s when I hired in there, it was a great place to work.  The 1980s saw the formation of new Quality programs, such as Statistical Process Control, formation of teams created with the managers and wage roll employees called Quality Circle Teams.  The teams helped to contribute to various ratings such as the Q1 rating and other quality awards signalling our efforts to continuous improvement of our products.  However, a change in owners and management saw all of that dissappear in the coming years."
good,"There have been a lot of changes in the workplace and the employee moral, including management is at an all time low. Employees at one time loved to come to work and do their job. That is no longer the case. Employees took pride in their work, but that has all been taken from them."
good,8 hour days could turn in to a 16 hour day at the last minute with out notice but the pay and benefits are great. Most of the managers dont care about anything other than production.
good,Solid organization with opportunities for growth and development.
good,"Job is great as long as you dont mind getting dirty, and long hours. Make sure you prepare your family for the hours, and prepare your social life to be around the work place. Good people to work around, and definately trained and prepared on the job."
good,"10hr work day "
good,"its a steel mill....mills are hot dirty loud and dangerous. pay is good, the dirt washes off. union environment no advancement unless you go to management."
good,Steel manufacturing is a very interesting industry to work in. Due to the nature of the process plant conditions are not the best. Often times long/ extended hours are worked due to production demands. Great pay and benefits and if it was not such a volatile market I would still be working there.
good,"The environment proved itself to be quite intimidating. Very large equipment, massive overhead cranes, and sometimes quite intense temperatures could sometimes be slightly overwhelming to new personnel"
good,"kind of stuck in there ways, Benefits are good, overtime is available potential to make good money if you want to live at work.work can be hard due to the conditions"
good,Not going to say anything else about USS.  They were a good company that is it. They pay well and have good benefits. Typical day. Go to work do your job go home
good,Unstable employment due to the price of current crude oil prices. Not knowing when you will be laid off.  Lack of job security. Positive was the health care and immense training on the product.
good,Working at us steel was perhaps the best job I have ever had.  If you could work in the elements.  (Coldest workday minus 20 to 95 degrees then it was the greatest.
good,Other than being currently laid off after 13 years of service it's a place with excellent benefits and salary but absolutely no job security at all.
good,not the place to work if you expect to see your family during holidays or hope to have a job with major purpose. This is a decent place to work but there is no understanding of what it really takes to make the operation efficient and profitable. The employees are treated like mindless sheep and are the reason this company has stayed competitive for so long. The new culture change is not good for business. The principles that the company was founded upon have definitely been forgotten to some degree.
good,"At US Steel Tin Division, steel is turned into tin for different applications such as cans, aerosol domes and lids, buckets, and brooms, Working in the quality department ensured that customer standards were being met and resolved if there were any issues. The management at the tin division is devoted to safety of the employees and quality of the product. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the production reports for 9 units. The most enjoyable part of the job was the resolution of issues."
good,"The biggest part of working here is expecting the unexpected. No day is completely routine. One day will be spent in front of a computer, the next will be in the dirtiest environment you could ever imagine. "
good,"See other review, same as other good place to work. operations are 24/7 and you will work shifts."
good,"Everyone is very easy going, but still knows to get work done."
good,"I enjoy what I do but I am burn out on doing ndt"
good,U.S. Steel is an outstanding company to work for.Being in the stationary engineering field has been an outstanding working experience there and the knowledge gained in this field will stay with me for a lifetime.My co-workers are very knowledgable and helpful.The supervisors took their time to explain the tasks that need to be carried out.
good,"They follow agile methodology. To gather requirements and analyse and develop applications based on enterprise standards."
good,"Our division needs alot of work, management needs accountability just the same as they expect out of the employees . Rules are strict on the railroad but safety needs to be adhered to as well ."
good,"The money is there you just have to go get it, you'll never worry about a bill again, not when you have the amount of over time they offer... And no you won't have a life so you better have a strong mate at home cuz this job is your life."
good,"As an intern, USS offered many learning opportunities in the steel industry. I was able to co - lead several projects during my time there, which helped to establish my project management skills."
good,"I had a very basic assignment at the beginning, just watching and trying to understand the process of metal forming. I also did a few data collection projects. Very good learning experience."
good,I don't have a lot to say about this company.  I only worked there for a summer as an intern.  It was a good start for my career and I learned a lot.  Hope this helps.
good,The process of making iron and steel can not be appreciated until you have the opportunity to work in these facilities.   Amazing experience to have worked in these factories.
good,"My experience at USS was a very good one. I had the ability to take care of my family better working there than anywhere else around. Because of the benefits, we were able to save money as well as have fun on vacations when I was able to take them."
good,Good place to make money and learn a lot but you have to have thick skin to work there and its very hot in the blast furnace.......................................
good,I started in the offices but moved to the plants as they needed someone with experience and I enjoyed the people although it is a very dangerous work environment in the Steel mills.
good,go in do the job your train to do and be safe must follow all signs be on time to work pay attendtion all time safety first fast pace work areas safety is a must
good,"This is a normal labor job; lifting, marking, banding steel coils.  It is a shift job so you can work midnight, daylight or afternoon shift, and that changes by the week."
good,"Working with the Engineers on Capital Cash and Expenditures was the most enjoyable work I have ever done in my career.  However, changing the culture from ""that is the way it has always been"" to a better for efficient way was very difficult.  Also, changing to a Cash Flow analysis from an liability analysis was extremely difficult.  Way to many accountants did not understand the difference and how to project future Capital Cash Flow was not easy due to a receipt based Oracle system."
good,I spent 6 years at US Steel and I enjoyed working here. I worked a lot of crazy hours but the structure of this company was great. I would still be there but because of layoff I left and have not went back
good,"Very fast paced, absolutely loved my job! Management overall was terrible. USS was a Union co. Majority of coworkers didn't want to work do their job."
good,"Train their employees exceedingly well and nothing is considered impossible there, but long hours.  Exciting place with lots of very cool toys make for good work stories.  Tough folks so snowflakes shouldn't bother."
good,I was a BOF coordinator in charge of turning molten iron into useable steel based off of customers chemical conformance requirements. I was in charge of anywhere fro 15-20 people on a shift. gave regular safety meetings and engaged in union matters on behalf of the company when required. adhered to strict environmental guidelines of the company as well as federal mandates.
good,It is a good company to be a part of and to learn at. I have learned  a lot at USS. The compensation is very exceptional and the benefit package is great for someone who is right out of college.
good,"Good work place, typical day consist of over seeing production , leading a crew of 18 plus men and women. working with management was no problem, coworkers were also great to work with, hardest part is heat and swing shift , most enjoyable part was known you turned out a good product with team effort and made it home safe."
good,Daily we were given our work list and there was hardly a day that we did not have equipment to work on.  I was able to learn how to manage my time and be able to fulfill my daily duties within a timely and safe fashion.
good,"Even though Pittsburg decided to close the Fairfield Works plant in Fairfield, Alabama it was still an awesome place to work. Great pay and benefits. The management were knowledgeable, and had some of the best co-workers to work with."
good,my overall review of us steel is very good. while employed I had the opportunity to learn many jobs and skills throughout my employment. people there were very eager and anxious to train you and help you move up through the plant
good,Job is very dependent on the economy and not guaranteed. Good place to work though if you don't mind not having a job tomorrow.
good,"- You can make a decent living here"
good,A typical day at work was productive in learning new teams and interacting in a positive team environment to solve problems and complete tasks.
good,Great company for getting experience in the maintenance trades. Learned a lot in terms of safety and communication. Enjoyed the experience.
good,"report to work area and receive jobs and safety contact"
good,"Working at US Steel provided me with many valuable work experiences, as well as a healthy work/life balance with various opportunities for growth."
good,Excellent work place that strived for safety excellence and team work atmosphere. Great benefits and retirement Great co workers and management.
good,"During my experience of being employed at U.S. steel, a typical day at work consists of troubleshooting electrical problems."
good,long days and even longer nights. hot as all get out in the warmer months. freezing cold in the colder months. managers on their high and mighty horse at all times. if it wasn't for the pay nobody would work there
good,"learning to work with with the natural elements from the earth was exciting,especially learning how to combine them with hot,melted steel."
good,Was fun place to work. Lot of good people. New corparate management has new big ideas to change culture. They did. Miserable to go to work now.
good,I liked staying constantly busy supporting retirees and employees with benefit questions. I also enjoyed meeting with retirees and employees to assist them with any questions regarding their benefits.
good,Tough work environment.  Good opportunity for advancement but a lot of responsibility comes with that.  24/7 commitment with pressure galore.  Very rewarding when jobs are managed successfully based on the safety and technical aspects of most work tasks.  A lot of good people to assist in daily tasks.  Union work force can be difficult to work with but also again rewarding when you can work through that and accomplish tasks.
good,"Extensive detailed invoice review of over 2000 invoices in 2014 totaling saving of over $980,000.  "
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"My job is very interesting and I like it. On a typical day I update several reports concerning orders that must go to management, I review any orders that have to go to another facility to complete, and I help out by filling in for any absentees. "
good,overall a good place to work with good benefits. Management is strict with a lot of on going safety training. Fast paced enviroment
good,"Worked in maintenance, Supervised 20 to 30 maintenance employees. The most enjoyable art of the job was that it was something different everyday."
good,"Good place to work. Some managers could use some changes but other than that. Great pay and benefits. Work is hard and continuous. Work in all weather conditions such as hot,cold,rain,snow."
good,"US Steel has offered me the great opportunity to use my skill acquired while serving in the U.S. military. I have put my leadership skills to work while managing a diverse workforce, and a challenging maintenance environment."
good,"The saying is that ""if you can manage here, you can manage anywhere"". To be blunt, being a manager here is very hard, but at the same time, it is oddly rewarding. Managing in this fast-paced environment, where your skills are put to the test throughout the entire day, is quite addicting."
good,"I operated a computerized Korbus Trimmer / apprentice trainer , learned bindery machines , completed other tasks as requested and worked around assembly and conveyor lines     management gave us good support      co-workers all helped one other if or when they needed it     working 12 hours shifts for months at a time      management  would serve us lunch when we had a good run , holiday dinners"
good,An ever evolving workplace that allows technical creativity.
good,"Over the many years I have worked at USS there have been many times safety concerns have arose and when conveyed to management they were not taken care of. As of not long ago a spot that we normally picked up our Hot Roll samples got moved to another place that all of us that work this job feel it is now in an un-safe area. We had people look at this and nothing was done even though I myself had a couple close calls with an overhead crane and a Ram Tractor which moves Steel Coils around. We got told before this spot was moved this was going to be done on a trial basis, even though the ""Powers To Be"" knew they wanted it permanent. Now we have to put ourselves in Dangerous Situations everyday because some people are lazy and some people just don't care I guess !"
good,You get to learn a lot from working at the different mills.  Through the extreme cold and extreme hot days we managed to work together to keep the mill's machinery working at peak performance.
good,Large company with a good environment to develop given the embracing culture.
good,Small group with like-minded long term investment management style.
good,-repair and maintenance within the three mills
good,Good job if you can handle the life work balance
good,I learned many new things about IT infrasturcture. Everyone I worked with was great.
good,Operating heavy machine to finish the product.Long hours 12 to 16 hour days.
good,"Overall a great job, decent pay. Management was decent. Strong Safety Culture, and training enviroment.Extremely dirty area, but goes with the terroritory. Finest folks I've worked with in a long time."
good,"very high production shop, with long hours, hard work, worked in all areas of the company."
good,"Hardest part of working for US Steel has been the inconsistencies of the Steel industry.  Love the people, and the environment. Worked with all sorts of people."
good,Long hours and swing shift make this job particularly tough on your personal life. Unhealthy conditions and poor management are two more of the biggest downfalls. the company does however have good pay and benefits making most people stick around.
good,"Good place to learn a variety of control and equipment associated. Overtime is available every week usually. The profit sharing is almost non-existant due to market conditions. Benefits are decent, but co-pays can be a hardship. Overall it has provided a decent lifestyle for my family for 42 years now."
good,"Environment to do projects and gain value.  traveled from site to site.Facilitated training on critical lean and six sigma tools.Collaborated with cross-functional teams to support new facilities and drive revenue and safety improvement. "
good,Traveled a lot during the ERP project deployment. This project should be over now and IT travel should be limited. The skills I learned at USS have helped me to succeed in my role with my current company.
good,"Diry and greasy machines need to be worked on or replaced daily, on your feet alot. Very white male 30's+ dominated but with a lot of inclusion training. Management varies with each part of the mill or what role you play."
good,"I enjoyed working at USS because I was highly challenged and I liked it. My Manager was so great that I recommended her in the next company I got hired after USS. There wasn't any training so I learnt by watching the key representatives working as well as my Manager and learnt on the fly mostly. I started as a contract and was offered a full time in 8 months after. The pay offered wasn't as high as another company offered me so I decided to leave."
good,I loved the job and the people. But being on swing shift settings I was unable to continue and was forced to leave. Never getting on a set shift I broke down.My health in many ways.
good,It's not that bad of a place to work. I was in IT and we had a lot of freedom. They do work you to the bone and the constant on-call is why I left. We had a lot of layoffs and they stripped away several benefits like tuition reimbursement.
good,"Good place to work. The benefits are good also. Staying focused on your job is a must! Operating in a steel mill is dangerous and can be deadly if you don't watch what you're doing. Having a good attitude towards safety and your fellow co-workers goes a long way. "
good,"A typical work day at the plant can either be quiet or be full of interesting conversations, to say the least.  The majority of the people are nice.  Management is constantly changing, so you're lucky to have the same boss for more than a year or two.  What's really neat about working here, is learning the steel making process and getting to see it up close.  I've personally took away more in safety from this place than anything."
good,"can make money here, no time off. good place to work just have to be willing to give up family time. they have lay off every couple of years, but do pay you when you are off"
good,Us Steel is a highly competitive and fast paced culture. It is unpredictable and can be stressful at times. Compensation is beneficial but hours can be difficult to manage.
good,"Stressful job. Good pay."
good,"made rounds, checking all machines, greasing and oiling machines, due work orders or on calls. . management was always working with you if you needed to switch an off day. Hardest part of the job was working on the torches, suspended 4/5 feet in the air over 1600 degree steel. Most enjoyable part was learning and a bit challenging and going on to the next level"
good,Over all work experience was good training and safety is one of the main goals of company.though management and employee relationship wasn't what it should be at times.
good,"good pay too, many lay offs. never a set schedule may work 7 days straight for a year to 32 hrs a week. not very much  room to move up but the pay is good."
good,I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. The jrough at times.Ob could be easy at times but it could also be rough. Just had t take the bad with the good.
good,Us steel pays well and has good benefits. A lot of room to learn more jobs. Unfortunately the company keeps employees in the dark as far as plant reopening sand and their true intentions.
good,You have got to be kidding ... I am not here to write reviews on these companies ... for petesake I left ... isn't that enough.  take a look at the turnover ... that should tell you everything you need to know.
good,"times have changed for the worse, new CEO has cut jobs ,hours ,and pay. everone is on edge wondering if the company is going to survive. I was part of a mass layoff were over 500 people lost their jobs overnight. management doesn't care about their workers. The workers are decent people , I got along with everyone. The union is terrible, only helps the ones that kiss up to them."
good,"U.S. Steel is a very big facility. This place can make or break you. You will work long hard hours but you are fairly compensated for your work. The problem with U.S. Steel is they do not like to honor the BLA with the USW. McKinsey group is trying to cut costs of production, but are willing to out costs over safety concerns."
good,"I loved my job and the people,we were like a family we looked out for one another because it was dangerous work.I hate that we got laid off because of the economy.I am looking for a stable work and willing to learn all I can."
good,"Hard work, cannot work without concern for your safety and the safety of others. Some jobs required overtime and you had to be willing to work hard and with care"
good,A large amount of work load with no real down time.  Management changes direction frequently.  The people are great to work with and are very sharp.  Some technology is outdated and they are trying to move forward with some difficulty.  The people are wonderful.
good,"pending your location and supervisor, lots of red tape, typical large company, needs to catch up to the competition, good ole boys club"
good,"It is a very good place to work, safe environment, and overall fun people. Plenty of opportunities to do different jobs."
good,lots of work to occupy anyone's time maintenance department personnel were excellent and all supervisors and co-ordinators were good employees to have
good,"Good job for supporting a family, ups and downs with economy a down side, communication across the workplace is almost non existent."
good,"US Steel is in transformation to remain a strong competitor in the global steel market.  Long hours, high pressure, demanding.  The most difficult aspect is just keeping up with the dynamic nature of constant change in priorities."
good,A typical day starts off with a safety meeting. I learn the importance  of staying focus on the job. Management does the best it can under the circumstances. If everyone do they're part the day go smoother. The job is not hard the most enjoyable part of the job would be getting paid.
good,This was an iconic and great company to work for the past 15 years.  I learned a great deal about the Corporation and the most enjoyable part of my job was I liked the people and the work I did.
good,"Tough time at the moment for USSteel, ingaging in many cost-saving initiatives, many recent lay-offs and belt-tightening at plant level. Lots of safety protocols when conducting hazardous work. "
good,"Most Employees were good to great to work with and  We became friends, both @ work & on the Outside. including some Managers."
good,Enjoyed working as a team accomplishing the set goals for each shift that I worked. Had the great privilege of working with great people.
good,I learned a lot in this company and from management. Co Workers were always willing to help.
good,"Being able to work on equipment from old to new, really helps form a knowledge base. Always work to be done, great place to work."
good,"The division was fun to work in.  Opportunities to travel to company plants, create research projects, interact with other corporate divisions.  Management started out good, boss was mentor.  Co-workers were great.  Opportunity to take classes to enhance job."
good,"in early out late every day."
good,"Processing our finished product, working with higher management and delagating between the loaders."
good,"No Comment USS provided a wealth of experience and training WORLD CLASS training, experience, and work environment.  Work environment is very highly challenging and is innovative and fundamental"
good,"If you want to work as much as you want and make alot of money, this is the place, everyone here makes just under $100k to well over $100k. If you have a new family and want to spend time at home with them, this is not the place to do that."
good,This type of manufacturing is very dirty and can be dangerous.  It was a great learning experience and very happy I took the job I was offered. I would say this industry is dominated by male and it is very clear while you are on the shop floor.  We had a girl work in our department and she quit after a couple weeks.
good,Good place to make money and support household. Nice quality of life and the location for most people. Union! The only downfall I think would be the environment
good,"The people that you actually work with are pretty awesome.  There is some left over beliefs and actions from a generation that started working there over 35 years ago, but it wasn't ever hostile in my experience.  Now the people you work with are just fine, but the company is massive and very few major decisions are left up to individual facilities. So layoffs and idles happen frequently with market variation, and that creates a lot of ill-will for the company as a whole. US Steel works hard to try and get people on the floor involved with improvements, but the followup is usually minimal when someone does make a suggestion."
good,"It's a great place to get a well rounded education in skilled trades, but with all the mandatory overtime,  you live there and see the people you work with more than your family"
good,"Create and revise Standard Operating Procedures, Departmental Reports, and Forms.  Maintain electronic and hard-copy files."
good,"Good pay and benefits. It is an acquired taste, working conditions are in extreme heat in the summer, extreme cold in the winter, and can be very dangerous."
good,As a manager I was entitled to a vast amount of information and training. I was great full for the experience I gained in-depth knowledge of the heavy industrial world.
good,"Enjoyed the job until entire department outsourced to another country.  We were given flexibility and freedom to process work as needed.  Benefits were great, but unsure of current situation."
good,"well with this job you can indeed provide for your family, but spending with them is definitely out the question. we worked 12 hr shifts for 7 days a week."
good,Typical heavy industry. Hot and cold work environment. Dirty. Dusty. Greasy. Depending on work area and work assigned.  Large and small machinery. PPE a must.
good,"My time spent at Us Steel was a mix of both good times and bad, once I attained the position of expeditor, I really enjoyed my job and the people I worked with and looked forward to returning to work everyday."
good,"Hard but satisfying work. Long hours required,  often short handed. Some foremen act like it  still the 1930's in the way they handle the workers. But over all really good people there."
good,"typical ""mill mentality"" - rough and tough environment. Not much respect floating around. people pretty much say whatever they want and there is no recourse for it."
good,"Pays well, but no work life balance"
good,"Honestly, you work there for the money, it is a steel mill and the work can be hard and unpleasant for weeks at a time but the pay justifies the pain. But when you get more time on the job you can bid on less stressful jobs so if you are willing to do the time things do get easier."
good,"good job, poor job security. Not afraid to invest in employees education, and safety. New  CEO came in and decided to shut everything down with massive layoffs."
good,"My shop takes molten steel and forms it into a slab 9 inches thick. We are customer and quality driven. The shop runs 95% of the time. My job includes all aspects of the process. I manage 70 operators and cover inventory ordering. I'm responsible for running new product trials. Even though my job can be a challenge, I enjoy completing any project on time and on budget. I'm a person who respects my employees and work with them to have a good quality of life."
good,US Steel was a good company to work for.  They have excellent benefits and compensation.  I would highly recommend them for a place to work.  You have good and bad at any job and the pay makes up for any bad.
good,Depends on the job you get assigned to. It is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. Better working there if you live close due to hours of shifts and possible double shifts.
good,"Supervised and coordinated up to 35 mechanical and electrical millwrights engaged in setting up, installing, repairing, and maintaining machinery and equipment. Liaising with designers, researchers and engineering consultants"
good,"Day light shift in the office was 7:30 top 4:30."
good,The work was ok but they are quickly looking for a way to automoate the processes. The matrix work environment that we work in is cumbersome and management does not take any corrective criticism or feedback from their employees.
good,"Twenty plus years Experience in operating Forklifts, pallet jacks loaders, sidsteers, dump trucks, mechanical, boom and cable, and tower and cab cranes.	Operated two and three hoist cranes at #1caster. Wrapping and banding steel coils and slabs loading and unloading trucks rail cars, moving products in many directions. Used hand torches and all types welding and burning equipment preventive maintenance on roll line and cranes at US Steel.  Power tools and hand tools, "
good,"Room for advancement,but job security is questionable as is the norm in manufacturing today. A highly toxic and hazardous work environment,but that's why they pay more than minimum wage."
good,"A typical day at work involves managing crews.  I direct their tasks, pay them, schedule them, and make decisions based upon feedback and my personal experiences.  I attend meetings to discuss quality, job plans, cost saving projects, etc.  "
good,Generations of my family have given life and limb for the steel mills in northwest Indiana and I'm tired of the monogamy sacrificed for the skill that I have. It's time to make a change in the lifestyle that I live and to show future employers why I am valuable.
good,"have worked there for 21 years but due to and glut of foreign steel they have idled my portion of the plant. place to work - Production environment,"
good,"Very hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter. Great people to work with, good benefits. 12 hour shifts good for time off"
good,It is a job with good pay but with new CEO things have changed a lot. You can get tons of schooling and training if you desire.
good,"Interact with Hourly and Management personnel."
good,Management receptive to new ideas and open to suggestions. Employees are afforded the opportunity to give input into safety improvements and incouraged work with management to make improvements within the facility.
good,"A good place to work, Management has no clue how my job is done. I enjoy my job cause I do it well and it is not the same everyday."
good,A typical day was to make sure the line would run good and help along the way.Managment was good to me.my coworkers they are a good bunch of guys
good,"Fast pace work enviorment where you had to stay on your toes and recognize many dangers for yourself and others. While we wanted to produce as much pipe as we could on a typical day we recognized that safety was a priority and never placed that ahead of production. Management and its employees understood that and worked together on making a pretty dangerous place as safe as possible and in turn it made work alot more enjoyable. The only complain was working in harsh weather conditions , it was either extremely cold or extremely hot."
good,"Decent pay and great benefits. Very little job security though. Being a MTE at U.S. steel Is a hot, dirty, dangerous job for which you are well compensated in return."
good,"We were continually implementing and adapting to new business processes.  It was enjoyable to come to work to face business challenges along with a team of experienced people, but staff reductions and Company issued smart phones resulted in virtual 24/7/365 on-call for management and staff."
good,"Heavy machinery operator where using the drill machine to open the taphole of the furnace, and a mud-gun machine to close the hole after casting"
good,Will miss this great company. Underwent major restructuring recently.
good,"This job was an old steel fabrication shop that made pieces for GM, and Chrysler. I would set up a press that cut the sheet metal for different projects around the factory. It was a fun experience learning the set ups for the different die machines we had there. The work was hard, but thee were good people who all worked together to get the job done. It was also very nice being on first shift."
good,Work 12H rotating shifts answering trouble calls while Steel Mill is running. When down for preventive maintenance preform PM's as scheduled and Install new equipment.
good,"Good job, solid company, Union shop, good or bad depending on the individual. Fair benefits, steady work, Good pay scale. Job was at times challenging, as was managemant, only main drawback is rotating shifts and at times being forced over to work when someone called in off of next shift. Hard to plan any family life never knowing your job future"
good,"The management was fair to the most point. The work could be awesome at times. The benefits, the people and the culture are all part of the experience there at US Steel."
good,"Good job, steel market fluctuates alot. Poor management decisions. The infrastructure is deteriorating. Somewhat a dangerous place to work. Excellent co workers."
good,"After the initial training, job assignments change daily.  This prevents monotone from doing the same thing every day.  Job assignments consists of process work, quality control, and environmental work.  The laboratory is a state accredited lab."
good,"It was a good place to work, benefits were amazing, friendly people, always something new to learn and do. Thought I was going to retire from their, applied with another US Steel company in the area, but their was not any positions open at the time."
good,Reasonable hours and not much weekend work needed in this position. The steel industry is very cyclical by nature so there is a feast or famine job culture.
good,Those I worked with were the most enjoyable part of my job.  Everyday is different and difficult at times due to working in a heat stressful environment.
good,"Everyone pulls together to keep running, double time and a half for holidays, Vacations can be taken one day at a time, Safety is a main concern to the company and employees."
good,"they need to look into things a little deeper than they do,like in my case.good management kinda bad conditions when in labor gang but not all too bad."
good,"It was great place to work. The pay was great, the hours were reasonable and the work was modest and fairly relaxed. The issue was that the company is so large that often things go missing or items aren't properly planned, especially during the hire process. I applied first, then they gave me my job which is backwards. Most of it is not the managers fault and my boss was an awesome person and I loved working for him, but the company did have it setbacks as far as planning ahead was concerned. The only other complaint was the outdated equipment in the factory mixed with the hoops you have to jump through to get certain things done. Overall, I would definitely go back to work here."
good,My biggest complaint is that my job was suppose to be a strict 6 month contract with no chance for permanency. I found out after I left to get a permanent job that my co-worker was hired on permanently in the same position and it was no longer contract. I wish I would have been told it might very well be a possibility somewhere down the road to be long term.
good,"Good paying job with good benefits.Us. Steel was a great job with plenty of overtime. Then it had the massive layoff then I was laid off, if they  would call me back I would go back, but I don't see that happening anytime soon."
good,"Hard to have a work/life balance.  Flex time is allowed, but hard deadlines often get in the way of the flex time that is allowed.  Vacation time is also limited due to deadlines."
good,Steel industry is unstable so future is unpredictable.  Overall company pays well with good benefits.  Plan on working a lot of overtime.  I typically work 12-20 hours of overtime a week.  Work is shift work so family life is hard .
good,"24/7 Operations can create demands outside of service related jobs, even for Headquarters roles.  Employees can be great to work with if their priorities match yours."
good,"Great place, great people to work for, really enjoyed my time there."
good,Was able to work for them for 37 years. It really is a good company to work for.They a very safety orientated which says a lot about a company when they care about their employees. The only downside is the potential worry of layoff due to business conditions. I was lucky and was layed off once in 1982.
good,A typical workday would include getting your job(s) at the beginning of the shift and mostly worikg at your own pace.  Emergency jobs were not uncommon when the pace could pick up quite a bit.
good,"I made a good living for My Family, and put 2 Daughters through College. We made high quality steel products back in the day without sacraficing Safety. Overall, I enjoyed My employment with United States Steel."
good,Very good company to work for. the pay was good benefits were great and for the most part the managers in my department were easy to get along with.
good,"Good company to work for, with great benefits. No opportunity for advancement or growth. Swing shifts are difficult on family life. Co-workers give a wide variety of personalities making workdays interesting. Dangerous conditions make safety a top priority. Learned accuracy is most important for production and customer satisfaction. Most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxed conditions in our department, including management trusting employees to be self-supervised."
good,"Enjoy my time there, supervisors were good people, employees were great , excellent benefits , Pay was decent, They  moved the company to China, put a lot of people out of work."
good,"dirty , cold, hot,"
good,"u.s steel is a good place to work, benefits and pay are great. ive learned a great deal in a variety of trades. good people to work with. the worst part about the job is all of the potential hazards to life and limb, but they do have a good safety program there."
good,Make sure everything was ready to go in the vessel to make steel. was boss of the crew and they listened and worked well.  It was dirty but the pay was good and fun to work with my crew.
good,"Equipment is falling apart, lots of unsafe areas that need attention,"
good,"It is not like a regular 9-5 job,work at US Steel is different in that, you come to work at all hours of the day and night, weekends and holidays, not 100% sure if you will be going home in 8 hours, as your schedule shows, or you could be forced to stay for 16 hours if your relief person on the next shift doesn't show up, It is a hazardous environment where you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings to prevent getting injured. The jobs pay well, but aren't conducive to having a normal life, where you make it to all your kids' games and school plays.I wouldn't recommend this type of work, it's not for everyone, but most of the people you work with, are good, hard working people."
good,Had a great experience and was able to learn a lot of new processes. Started with morning meeting. Then assigning jobs to mechanics.
good,Provides a good income at the cost of never seeing your family. Rotating shifts and long hours. I enjoyed my 15 years and learned alot. Now I am laid off.
good,"Fun place to work with supportive management."
good,All I do is work all the time hardly time off to spend with the family working swing shifts without unexcused absences  not complaining glad I still have a job
good,Received daily work order with jobs for the day.  Some days easy some days extremely hard.  Took the good with the bad.  Always finished what ever work assignment we received. Worked with a crew from 2 to 4 depending on the job. Most jobs took 8 hours to complete but some jobs took 16 hours or a few days.
good,I have enjoyed working for US steel . They have helped  through education and given me a very good way to make a living. But it is aligned with the manufacturing of oil and production of oil. Which the price has dropped dramatically. This has affected my wages dramatically which is making it very hard to make ends meet.
good,"Management dependent on individual in charge."
good,"I learned that everyone is expendable. The Utility department was needed 24 hours a day 7 days a week. We supplied demineralized water to areas inside the mill as well as air and steam. We treated chemical discharge water before it went back to the lake. My father got my first start their in 1977, when US Steel bought National Steel they hit economic hard times and cut back on management. Was let go when we were the last department to be restructured."
good,"This company is a heavy industry company with a multitude of opportunities to learn."
good,"heavy equiptment operator 60 ton earth movers,payloader,water trucks etc."
good,"A typical work day would start with a cup of coffee while the planner would give us the job assignments which were different everyday.  I learned everyday something new, mostly about troubleshooting. Management was ok, but I don't think they cared enough. Maybe it was because they felt a lot of pressure. My co-workers were like family. Safety was most important. Even the production people agreed with that. The hardest part of the job is when one of the big motors on top of the mill or some other hot, hard to get to place would stop, we had to jump right on it, and work over until it was under control. The most enjoyable part was when I was doing a job that I really knew every step from start to finish, because I did it so many times."
good,My day included cleaning out coal chutes. I learned the process of how the steel mill works. The foremans were nice. My co-workers were nice. The hardest part was getting the coal all over my body. The best part was the pay.
good,I learned very valuable information by working for a large corporation and gained confidence in my abilities to succeed in a fast paced work environment.
good,"Everyday has something new to offer. My responsibilities are very challenging which makes the job rewarding. In one year that I have been in my position, I have not had any two days be exactly the same. I really enjoy working for U.S.Steel and would highly recommend anyone interested in working for U.S.Steel. I have learned a plethora of information while here from ,OCTG specs to new tricks on Excel. My Co-workers are all mostly pleasant to work with. They are part of what makes work interesting. The hardest part of the job is trying to fit 25 hours into a 24 hour day. There are just too many responsibilities and not enough time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when something gets done and you get recognized."
good,"Each department I worked in there was a good family type of bond among the co-workers, which made the workplace that much better. You have the opportunity to learn to operate alot of different types of machines which helps build on your resume of skills. There is always a chance for advancement throughout the facility's different mills."
good,Great pay and excellent benefits. It is a union job so there is a sense of protection for your job. There is also room to post to other departments and there is also incentive (bonus) money earned on most positions in most departments.
good,Steel City is a fun place to work! My favorite aspect is interacting with the customers and my co-workers. Management is one of the biggest issues I’ve ran into because the Lexington Store isn’t treated as fairly as the other stores.
good,"Overall my time at US Steel taught me how to work in a business / customer service environment. My various managers were all great leaders, however the work/life balance could lead to some extra added stress."
good,"Overall, US Steel is a pretty good place to work as far as making money, the union is fairly strong, the push safety which is a great thing because it is a dangerous job. They have a apprenticeship/Learner program for Millwrights, which I’m currently attending. Theirs lots of opportunity and benefits to take advantage of. It’s worth interviewing for to see for yourself."
good,"Awesome place, would work here again if they'd hire me back. Well that and if I ever moved back home. Union work, but being in the Union was not forced on you."
good,"Based on the work hours at US Steel, it was difficult for me to maintain a work/life balance after working there for several years.  It was also tough working there when the fatalities occurred.  My nerves suffered."
good,A very good place to work if you are willing to work. Has a lot of good benefits and really helps you reach the max out of your career. I really appreciated this job.
good,"Worked in an ERP role, got to work with many folks from diverse backgrounds who were able to help me learn more about my role and more about things that would help me advance in my future."
good,Not a challenging environment for my level of experience.  Felt like there was no room for advancement because no other position seemed appealing. I am looking for a company to retire with.  USS is not that company.
good,"Strenuous work hours. Relief calls off, you're screwed. Too much time away from family. Good job for a single person, difficult to have time for yourself."
good,During my time at US Steel I learned a lot and had no problems with management everybody did their job the best they could and got alone great with each other.
good,Very good experience with mergers.  Took part in acquisition of Stelco and fresh start accounting.  Amazing learning culture and great internal team to complete all SOX requirements.
good,"I learned a lot about managing people; specifically, how to make my staff most productive. Sadly, USX priced themselves out of the business by out sourcing production. ."
good,"United States Steel was a fast paced environment with the ability to advance quickly for those willing to work very hard.  It was great seeing the tangible product in cars, buildings, etc that you are responsible for putting out there."
good,Like any company there is always going to be good and bad . The one thing I can say is that in order to make money you have to spend money and we have some of the most outdated equipment.
good,"Working at USS is a feast or famine type of employment.   It's either a lot of hours or facing layoff, but it is still a good job overall.  You will have the opportunity to gain vast knowledge in your field of work, but seniority will hold you back since it is a union based facility.   The people I worked with were some of the best I could work with."
good,I like the company they gave me a chance and trusted in me to hire me to work and perform multiple task and job assignments. And I did them with the best of my abilities and I did a good job as well! Even though I have to work in some extreme weather conditions hot/cold it still not a bad job.
good,Bad for home life. Sometimes 5 12 hour days were required because they do not wish to hire people. Management isn't bad but they are sticklers for personal protective equipment.
good,"typical work day was working minimum of 8 hours but usually 12, very hot in the summer and freezing in the winter.overall ok company to work for.pay was excellent plus they pay incentive"
good,Typical day at work was operating a remote control engine. Coupling and Uncoupling of cars. Cooperating with train master and having clear communication.
good,"Good money, and benefits, will let you put up with a lot than you normally would.  It's the people that you work with that makes working at US Steel better than what it really is."
good,"Working around explosive gasses, flammable liquids and extremely high temperatures. "
good,"was a stable and safe work environment. co-workers made going to work everyday enjoyable, also recognition for doing a good job was often. and giving the department I worked in which was transportation daily tasked were often something different."
good,rotating shifts tons of hours required to make good money.    great medical benefits if the company does not take them away
good,USS is a great place to work.  Safety is the #1 goal and they really care about each employees safety.  Good leadership whom own up to responsibility and willingness to help you out.
good,"you change shifts each week.days midnight's afternoon's.great coworker's. good pay and medical benefits.you bid for jobs on seniority, but once you get the job you want it can be a good career."
good,"Working at U.S. Steel, I learned that long hours and good work ethic can advance your knowledge can push you forward. I learned Microsoft office a little and worked closely with heavy forklift equipment."
good,Good company to work for.Gave me experience in steel making and operating machinery.Co workers were always helpful in getting jobs done.
good,"Job required plenty of overtime with pay. Good co-workers. Good benefits, Steel industry is up and down. It is a good place to work when the industry is doing well. Tough place to work when industry is down. Many layoffs and unstable conditions."
good,Management needed oversight to cut back on unnecessary overtime which helped to contribute to layoffs. US Steel had a Great Safety program which if followed would limit injuries as well as fatalities.
good,"Set up finisher threading machine for production."
good,i make sure that liquid iron flows out of a tap hole @2700 degrees which is sent over to a finishing  metal  dept. to be made into slabs.
good,Managing the electrical and mechanical jobs on your shift. They change every day. Conduct safety meeting weekly. Helping the guys trouble shoot electrical and mechanical break downs. Working with production to complete jobs and never stop production. Scheduling the right amount of man power to complete jobs and still be able to work on PM'S.
good,was able to do many different things while there from laborer to machine operator and also maintenance. there were many enjoyable jobs that i preformed but i enjoyed working in the maintenance departments most because it allowed me to use my hands more
good,"-Would check email for any new tasks; look over work in progress, which could include design, analysis, coding or documentation to track tasks.  Meet with supervisor to get updates on new tasks.  Answer phone from customers and peers to answer questions on requested information."
good,"My work day is anything but typical, and that's the way I like it. From educating my direct reports on new and innovative ways the perform their job duties, to interaction with the corporate sales staff- there is never a dull moment."
good,Very good place too work if you do not mind being laid off as often as you work. Work is easy with lots of breaks. The managers only care about numbers.
good,"If you work there, you will be able to have a very good life and save up money"
good,Good place to work. Management is pretty easy to get along with and so are my co-workers. The job is pretty easy and laid back.
good,its a typical day and good place to learn new things and good managment with good co workers
good,Good company for a long haul career. I had actually worked there twice. Once at the beginning of my working life at 19 yo and then at the last at 50 yo. I had good experience.
good,Good place to work and make money to provide for a family as well as yourself. However prepare to work lots of hours and mandatory overtime from time to time
good,It was a great place to work with lots of smart people with a willingness to teach. Had opportunities to work on a variety of different things from ac and dc motors to wiring in outlets in a shop. Worked with some PLC's and VFD's. Loved working there and have worked with some amazing people but unfortunately they are closing down so I won't be able to complete my apprenticeship through them.
good,"Very productive place to work and grow.  I recommend this is the place to work, excellent benefits, with growth opportunity. I would have retired from there if I wasn't laid off."
good,"I worked as an IT intern at U.S. Steel for about a year. Overall, the experience was great and they made it a point to teach me some very useful skills and made sure I was comfortable with my understanding of a subject before giving me work to be completed. They did, however, when recruiting us said that they were looking to hire a large portion of us. The reality ended up them offering full time positions to very few interns."
good,I would say overall that anyone that was chosen to work for US steel would be considered lucky. Of course they want to good days work. In return you have job security good pay Good benefits and a chance to advance. Good jobs like these are few and far between
good,Would work there again if hired. Too bad mill closed and was laid off. Pipe Mill stayed busy year round. Wish I had enough seniority to have gotten on there when Hot Strip mill shut down.
good,good company that pays their employees a fair wage. The jobs often occur in dirty environments but you get compensated for the work that you do. All in all USS is a great place to work.
good,"Every day safety is number 1! Great job with great benefits. Can be stressful as it is a 24 hour shift job, but also rewarding through great pay and benefits. Management tries to be fair, but also controlled via Union contract. Lots of money to be made, as overtime is usually available. Advancement is possible in many different fields of the plant"
good,"Good place to work, has competitive pay plus good benefits. Opportunities to advance as needed. Good work life balance. twenty four hour 365 day work schedule."

good,"Significantly increased the effectiveness and productivity of the maintenance department by providing more structured environment for the maintenance personnel, prioritizing work best suit the needs of the organization as a whole and improving communication/interaction between the maintenance and production."
good,Working 90 to 110 hrs a week was not much time for my children I spent more time at work than with my kids the pay was great but not worth the trade of time
good,"typical day at work for me is logging in samples to be processed. preparing those samples to be analyzed, analyze them, input results, and make sure things are done in a timely manner. I think with any job, with senority, there is advancement in the company."
good,"Unfortunately, consistent employment was an issue at the time I worked for US Steel. We were periodically subjected to layoffs. As I was just starting family life, I needed a job that would provide reliable employment."
good,"Excellent organization, compensation and career satisfaction. Organization provided a multitude of challenges, career advancement and educational opportunities. Compensation and benefits packages were excellent."
good,Steel maker very productive until shut down/ The environment  was dirty out side work. c incentives was great pay was good. Good place to make a good living
good,"maintenance and troubleshooting problems"
good,"A typical day would include inquires about pay, getting ready to process payrolls, and assist in anything else that needed to be accomplished. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate employees complaining about not being paid or incorrect pay.  The management that was in place was fair and understanding, but firm on policies and work performance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow employees locally and abroad to accomplish the common goals of payroll.  Payroll is the reason people come to work.  The workplace culture consisted of a very diverse group of employees.  Change was something that was not widely accepted easily.  I learned how to work in a corporate environment, deal with uncomfortable situations, and to process payrolls in Oracle and a legacy payroll system."

good,"Making Steel. World Competitive.  Building Value.  Although this 100+ year old company has seen many ups and downs in a cyclical business environment, it currently is heading in a positive direction with leadership that is focused on technology, safety and building shareholder value through the Carnegie Way.  The most enjoyable part of my job as Director of Savings Programs & Strategy was working with talented people to support our newest employees, our executive management, and everyone in between."

Management was ok got along with co-workers very well. hardest part was keeping inventory mainly because of weather and it was outside.
good,"I learned to perform many different job duties in my position (payroll, administrative, accounting and HR). The job I enjoyed most was working in the HR department.

good,Every day was something new. Each day you came in with something different to tackle. You had to be able to respond to change quickly as various pieces of equipment broke down or had issues. Communication was important between everyone to ensure the shop was running successfully. Co-workers are great and always willing to help. The most enjoyable parts of this job is being able to work on something new everyday and learning the small details of how the shop runs. You learn something new everyday.

Next check in with my supervisor to see if I had any daily requirements or lifts for maintenance techs.

good,"I enjoy working for US  Steel, but with the decrease in work recently I am looking for something else. I have worked shifts, production and labor work."
good,I believe in giving a 100% in my job and will go the extra mile to get the job done. I am a fast learner and am willing to learn new things. I get along well with others and can work with anyone. I think management should be dedicated and willing to help if necessary to achieve the goals that they have set to be accomplished. the hardest part of a job is not having one you enjoy. you are most productive when you do jobs that best suit your craft. the most enjoyable part of a job is setting and achieving goals.
good,Excellent working place.Play a key strategic buying role to support the business operations of the company that provides a wide range of value-added steel sheet and tubular products.
good,"Great company, great boss's, co-workers, pay and benefits."
good,The company is undergoing economic hardship and is reducing staff.
good,A typical day at work includes patrolling the mill and handling EMS emergencies as need and put out fires when needed. I learned OSHA regulations and industrial safety. Management is good and reasonable. Coworkers vary from person to person with the typical personality differences but general good order. Hardest part of the job is when multiple calls go out at the same time for the same plant. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that each of your co-workers are from the same background as you and can relate to them.
good,I leaded how to be a better leader. People are not always willing to be responsible for the bottom their tub sits on.
good,Great company to work for.  Great benefits and co-workers.  Diverse skill set acquired.  OT available.  Set work schedule.  Management and leadership opportunities available.  
good,"Respond to emergency incidents, pre plan, inspect area for fire safety and secure areas."
good,Great opportunities offered in steel and petrochemicals. Company has great benefits and above average compensation
good,I think the upper management here is very petty and childish. They never take accountability and are constantly wasting time trying to blame their managers and the work force for any shortcomings rather than trying to fix the problems.
good,"Good benefits and wages but the job opportunity itself takes your whole and undivided attention there is no playtime...a 7-7-7- shift with very days of means that your mins =d is constantly on your job,"

good,shift work and work scheduale its hot and dirty also the managment always blamws you the worker as the culprit when something goes wrong however the pay and work isnt hard
good,Exciting projects to work on to drive the business! I always felt that I had autonomy in anything that I worked on. Management is always willing to listen to new ideas.

good,great job poor job security pay and benefits super reason to go and work there but save your money because you will be laid off eventually. training and education opportunities great.
good,"I enjoyed my 15+ years at US Steel, but the day to day speculating on mill closing and job loss was stressful, up until the mill closed and I lost my job. The benefits/wages set the standard in the area, and safety was valued."
good,Although USS was a great employer there weren't any advance notices of the shutdown. The benefits were excellent. Unfortunately my department was finally shutdown
good,I've been here 22 years and have made a great living. Only bad thing is you have to work a lot of hrs to make money and you have no life. Benefits are awesome is the good thing won't ever have to worry about medical care

good,"change into work uniform, go to maintenance shop, get line-up, gather tools and parts. Pre-check vehicle, proceed to breakdown location. Communicate with needed personnel in that area. Lock out-tag out. gather proper PPE. Fill out work permit and safety forms, perform work, test repairs, remove all locks and sign papers. clean up area and return to maintenance area for next assignment."
good,"A lot of working outside rain, sleet or snow, 24 hour facility, Sometimes in high temperatures, 12 hour shifts. Good pay, good training. I learned a lot working there."
good,United States Steel was a great place to work. Had good benefits and was an awesome laid back environment. Really miss working there and wish the company didn't close.
good,"I liked my job.    My only disappointment -   I was harassed as a Woman,  alot,....and even with the Union there,...the Mill didn’t get rid of the REAL problems.    Most guys were great;   they needed to fire those few trouble-makers."
good,"Currently laid off. I enjoy going to work and love the challenges that the utility dept encounters. Utilities department supplies steam, wind, and air and electric generatiom to the entire plant."
good,It was a great job for me. I learned a lot. The job conditions in the job I had were generally very good. There was no training though. Everything was OJT. All in all a great place to work while it lasted.
good,Come into work and pick up work orders for the days job then go and perform work or troubleshoot problem for repair the hardest part of the job is sometimes getting parts to complete repairs. The best part is the people I can get along with all of them.
good,"I worked for the co. almost ten yrs.,They laid me off 1982, went trough there apprenticeship and never called me back. I recently applied and was probably over looked because of my age. I still think it's agood co."

good,Great place to work if you can handle extreme heat and outdoors labor. Union environment and typical mill work. Fair pay and overall a legacy company that doesn't intend to go away.
good,"Ive worked a couple other jobs after I left. Nothing compares to the pay at USS. there were days you work hard and days that were relaxed. As long as you stay safe and follow the rules, management would leave you alone. good attendance and punctuality is required or you will not make it here."
good,Wish I could have stayed at USS as a shift Manager. I enjoyed working with all the people. It was very unfortunate that economic times forced the involuntary termination.
good,I was so disappointed that it came to an end.  We had an awesome group of people.  It was a great place to work and I'd hoped this would be the place I would work until retirement.  I will miss the people and the work.
good,I really enjoyed working there. Only thing I did not like were the lay offs. The supervisors were great and easy to get along with. I loved all of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with people that you grew to know and love on several task that you have mastered.
good,"typical day at work can range from an 8 hour to and 16 hour day 6 to 7 days a week, also can range from laid back less stressful workload to quickly escalating to a stressful , very demanding and physical work day.  During my time of employment in have learned many aspects of steel making from beginning process to the finish product and shipping to customer.  North sheet mill division was poorly managed from communication with employees and lack of respect for workers.  The north sheet mill division is a friendly, respectful, and caring workplace. we all work together to provide productivity to the company and also providing safety and peace of mind to coworkers.  Working in the north sheet mill the workload is overwhelming at most times and it also helps you to become a sufficient and productive worker.  I enjoyed providing and great lifestyle for my family and also acquiring skills that can carry me to more advanced positions with united states steel, or a future employer."

good,"Would love to stay and retire but the future of steel is uncertain and market conditions are unfavorable currently.... I hope to get transferred to a new plant since this location is currently scheduled to get ""indefinitely idled"""
good,The opportunities to gain knowledge in all aspects of the manufacturing of steel is abundant with United States Steel.  USS offers challenges and growth opportunities to advance their work force.

good,I loved the work environment and the people that I worked with I like the sting stance on safety and the zero tolerance on lock out tag out the benefits and retirement plan is the best I ever had
good,"I was a contractor here. I was only here for a short while since it was around 2008 and the housing market crashed. For the most part, it was great until the lay-offs."
good,"Without a doubt the most lucrative occupation i've ever been employed. Hard demanding work but accommodating benefits, great coworkers, and a reliable paycheck. being laid off from this job has been life altering to me which i believe speaks volumes for how excellent of a career this was for me."
good,Great place to work.  When the company was doing well financially everyone was happy and well taken care of.  The management was too formal at times and was very cold when they needed to let people go.  When employees were let go they were given a package and asked to leave and could not take any of their belongings with them.  The belongings were shipped to them later.
good,The steel industry in an  aggressive field to get into. US Steel makes working in my field enjoyable and safe. Safety is the number priority in the mill.

good,Everybody was friendly and welcomed me when open arms. I loved everyone's energy in the office. My overall experience was really good. Thank you everyone.
good,"Great job, the pay is pretty good. Some jobs at the plant run 24-7, which means if your relief don't show up, you may have stay an extra shift. You can bid on jobs in other areas of the plant, some are off on weekends, and some only work days."
good,Every Job is what you make it. Hard to tell you that you will like it or hate it. So many different jobs out there that you can fill. Some are harder than others. Every area has a different incentive rate so it's hard for me to give an accurate income potentual. It is up to you to try and bid into the area that you want to be in based on your life preferences. Just be safe and stay humble and you will do well.
good,US Steel was good to me and my family.  The people were great and the job was challenging.  I have nothing bad to say about it.

good,"Very good employer to work for, safety first always, great benefits and pay. I gained many of my skills and had many good times while employed there. I had opportunities for job advancement and was able to move from job to job, department to department. This is a huge company and when I first hired in twice as large.as it is today, (roughly 3.5 miles long and one mile wide) and I wanted to see it all and learn as many jobs as I could. I started in the docks on the far west end and now I'm at 3 seamless on the east end and worked almost every department in between.
