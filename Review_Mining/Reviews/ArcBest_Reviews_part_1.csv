rating,review
bad,"In my opinion this is not the best place to work, lots of turnover, very difficult to get on full time, busy, too much work for one person hectic transportation job."
bad,"If you want to work for a company that does nothing for their employees, ArcBest is the place for you. Every week I worked overtime and every week they changed my hours. Every month I met my quotas and every month they made changes that took away my commission. The insurance is also a joke. There isn’t a single dentist within 500 miles that is in-network. My daughter had to be rushed to the ER and the insurance company (contracted out by choice benefits) is refusing to pay. I was never valued as an employee and was only offered increased salary and a better position as a bride to try and get me to stay after I put in my two weeks notice. There is literally no morale and everyone there looks like a sad, beaten little puppy."
bad,"I have worked in the Financial Services area for 15+ years. Was a great company to work for when it was Panther.  Since ArcBest took over, the morale is bottom of the barrel. They do not appreciate their employees. There is no job security. The knowledge of Management is non existent.  They rely on the workers to explain how to do the job since they don't have the first clue what needs to be done. The only good thing I can say about the company is the insurance benefits are great.... that is the only reason I stay."
bad,They constantly change their goals every month. They discriminate against individuals who get ill. Supervisor had the tendency of sharing your personal business with other employees. They also show favoritism
bad,Basically you come in and you find a forklift and then you will have a meeting everyday before the shift starts.  Me normally I get a lot of really ugly freight but you might get lucky and get something nicer then I would get.  I hate some of the supervisors and there is one supervisor there that shouldn't even be a supervisor let alone be on the dock.  If you get hired there you will know who I am talking about
bad,Small office with great interaction among colleagues.  Worked together and assisted each other to make sure the work was done and transitioned easily to the second shift.  Although profitable and performance goals were met the IL office was closed in March 2018.
bad,"If you're young and recently graduated college, you'll like it.  They take care of their new employees.  Seasoned employees though, not so much.  They reward/promote the young over the experienced older people.  Very poor management.  Don't promote based on experience or quality, promote based on who you know, who your friends are.  Don't make workers accountable for mistakes or being on time.  A good work ethic is not appreciated.  In fact, if you're very personable, the less work you have to do and you get rewarded.  the less work you do and friendlier you are, the more likely you'll move up."
bad,"The one benefit to working at ArcBest is the compensation. Other than that, it has extreme poor managerial standards. All of the accountability is placed on the subordinate and not management! Period!"
good,"The company trains you to program in VB.NET, C#, and COBOL (There's a lot of COBOL)."
good,Great place if you need benefits or just starting out. Fast past when busy. Very dependent on the auto industry. Some groups are paid better for doing less. So watch what vertical you hire into. If you don't like taking or making calls then this is not a place for you.
good,Most of the employees are great to work with but the management has lost focus on what really matters. The corporate culture has changed dramatically and no longer is an environment that fosters growth or upward mobility. The sales positions have had lots of turnover recently. The work environment is stressful.  Your experience will depend a lot on the department you work in.  I would not recommend sales here as they are constantly changing the quotas and pay structure.
good,"Good company your happiness will depend on your manager.  Not much else to tell, company going through some changes but still solid company.   If looking for a job in fort smith area, ArcBest is good."
good,I enjoyed working at ArcBest but the third shift lifestyle was just not for me. I enjoyed the Life Sciences team and the fast-paced atmosphere of first shift when I worked it.
good,"I'm not comfortable reviewing Arcbest.  Not sure why, but Indeed is saying that it's mandatory."
good,Company recently restructured. Not many opportunities to advance your career unless you know someone from the Fort Smith area. Pay is not as competitive as it could be for the area.
good,"If you are from the industry, it is what you would expect.  Very experienced and productive work force overall, but the union protects the handful of lazy workers that drag you down.  Company is solid as far as financially."
good,"*Constantly making major changes to procedures and software causing long delays in processing and days of glitches. "
good,typical work day consisted of setting up customer expedited shipments and dispatch them and follow them to completion and deal with any problems along the way.
good,Not much more i can say about that. Great work experience and resume builder. Once you get to a point in your life its time to make more than the industry minimum.
good,ABF is a decent place to work but the management needs improvement. You will make good money at ABF. I enjoyed my time at the company 80 percent of the time.
good,"Arcbest is a customer oriented company in the process of implementing new strategies and an enhanced market approach, "
good,"Typical day of work I usually got my forklift and unloaded and loaded as many trucks I could during the day"
good,"It is a relaxing environment but can be stressful at times. It really depends on which department you are working in. In IT, it is really fast paced. The management is okay. Not many progressive managers."
good,"Overall, ArcBest is a great, stable place to work. The people are what makes ArcBest. I work with some of the nicest people around. Really true to themselves and others."
good,Great team atmosphere with opportunities across the company and it’s subsidiaries. Provides plenty of training to make you comfortable in the work environment.
good,"ArcBest is a great place to work, but I felt like I wouldn't be able to advance or move from the department I was hired into. There are some people who get promoted, but very few."
good,"It is one of the company's priorities to put school above career.  This makes the managers very understanding when you need to take time off to study for big tests, etc.  They also seem very understanding of family issues."
good,"Insurance is great - rest needs little improvement"
good,Work life balance great. Can be stressful at times during high seasons. Once you clock you leave work at work and can relax. Managers are great. Average at best benefit and pay.
good,this was an environment where a sense of humor was needed. Fun close knit people working together to be productive and have fun while doing it. Strong HR department that was very helpful with any benefits questions or issues.
good,A typical day  for me is basically me delivering to a specific route and once i finish dropping my deliveries off i have to pick up freight from different places.
good,Arc best is a professionally ran office. They are very  in tune with their customers and want to provide the best customer service possible. They move a lot of freight for many different types of customers and try at all times to provide them with the best most current customer service options at all times. The staff is very friendly and family oriented. Over all a great company to work for. If they would of had an office where I moved to I would still be working for them today.
good,"Good Company with excellent opportunity. A lot of growth opportunity with the company. The work has some seasonality, but the day to day tasks are different each day."
good,Excellent company looking to improve day by day in technology and employee well being.
good,"Would recommend to anyone! Great culture, great people, great benefits. Fun environment. They really care about their people. Customer service is a top priority"
good,"Leader in the Expedited market, can be a very good place to work. Lack of management skills in some parts of the company, but overall laid back and fast atmosphere at Panther. Cannot be the cost and level of health insurance anywhere. PTO is very fair and competitive. Great balance of work and personal life.  Big draw back, hard to advance and lower than market value pay."
good,"Culture was good, ArcBest is growing in all aspects of transportation. Enjoyed learning about ArcBest as a whole they are a very successful company who has been around for a long time."
good,"ArcBest in Medina, Ohio is a great company to work for when you are just starting out. You will learn a lot and have plenty of opportunities to advance. Unfortunately, the pay this not the best. Overall is have a great work environment."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at ArcBest. The people I worked with made the job fun and interesting. There was no specific typical day at my job, since I was a student worker I had a new job everyday."
good,ArcBest cares about its employees and has room to grow if you push yourself. People don't quit this place. The culture is getting more relaxed and management is listening to its employees.
good,Working here was great.  The company was very supportive and I learned a lot from everyone.  Lots of teamwork and collaboration.  Good dynamic between the different departments.
good,I was an employee for 3.5 years but only received 2 minor raises during my time and no promotions. I enjoyed the people I worked around and the nature of the business. The hardest part of the job was market fluctuations and keeping up with the average rates.
good,"Arcbest is okay to work for. Didn't really love it, but its a paycheck. There was not much of a family feel and everyone just kind of looked after themselves. As an intern I didn't really feel impressed or welcomed."
good,Worked there as a student worker and went on part time after I graduated.  They kept me on knowing I was searching for jobs outside the company where I could do Mechanical Design work.  As a part time worker they did not compensate well for the quality and type of work I was contributing.
good,I loved working for this company. Work atmosphere was great. Only left bc I was having a baby. I would recommend to anyone! Only downfall is the interview process takes awhile.
good,My team is always supportive and we have developed personal relationships that help make work life balance more enjoyable. They have an open door policy and management is trusting.

good,Coworkers are really one big team. Management cares about the well being of their employees and work life balance is of primary concern. The work environment is relaxed and everyone loves working here
good,great company culture and compensation. Benefits are great but hard sales process. provide a lot of training to make sure you are fully aware of what you are selling
good,"solid experience to work for this company. I would highly reccomend it, but be prepared to sacrifice your time after hours if in sales. it is not always a 9-5"
good,"The jobs requires at least 6 hours of phone time per a day during an 8 hour shift.  It not hard to achieve it but, it can get boring.  It becomes to reparative. I ask the same questions over and over again. Also, I listen to the same customer question over and over again. It just an over paid telemarketing job."
good,"insurance was awesome,  great benefits, good management. But they in and everyone off in one day.  Which was not good and they cut off insurance that same day"
good,Great company with great leadership.  Work/Life balance can be challenging.  Lots of extra unnecessary things come up.  Many presentations and meetings that are not needed.
