bad,"There's the most unprofessional management I ever seen on any of my past jobs"
bad,I have experienced so much in as little as 6 months. Supervisors discrimination is crazy and nothing is done about it. Employee discrimination. Worst company.
bad,"They took seven weeks to reimburse me for my expenses incurred for the interview process. If you are comimg in from out of state to interview for a position (which is typical, as the facility in Guymon, OK is very remote), have them fly you in. Do not spend a dime of your own money as you will just get the run around for months. Fair warning."
bad,"this is a very poor company to work for, the wages are low for the type of excrutiating work you must perform, the managers will belittle and berate you drag your self esteem into the ground , harrass and punish you in order to induce a voluntary quit, and then HR will stand behind the managers when you complain about the unfairness between the prized workers( who are part of the good ole boy system) and the female workers who do the brunt end of the work, they will make up the rules at thier own descretion to dock wages as punishment, and racism runs rampant. think very hard before working for seaboard foods any facility, farm, milling, transportation, slaughter, bio-deisel, and so on......"
bad,If you are not Hispanic forget about it they try to push you out from the time you start there is a lot of racism and the day only ends when you are done it’s back breaking work for little pay
bad,I was employed at Seaboard for close to 11 years. I voluntarily left my career because the safety rules written in your hand book are not worth the paper they are written on. Very dangerous there. My boss got his thumb cut off.
bad,I worked at a farm as an hourly employee. The management at my farm was the worst I have ever seen. They treated you like a work horse and didn't care if you were there for 12 hour a day. The manager was unsympathetic about your personal life and needs and didn't give days off. They even took away my one scheduled day off the day before I was suppose to take it. The farm I worked at was short staffed and the manager did not show an ounce of gratitude for the hourlys that were taking on the extra workload during that time. As an hourly employee I never received a penny of over-time even though I consistently worked 60+ hours a week.
bad,"*busy "
bad,This company has been located in guymon for twenty years and in twenty years they have not figured out how to run this company management is poorly paid most hourly employees make more per year than their immediate supervisor also the rules and regulations can change from day to day just because it was ok to do something yesterday doesn't mean you can do the same thing tomorrow also common sense is not a quality that is rewarded you are nothing but a sheep your opinion and ideas are not well received but they my be used by your boss as his ideas and advancement all depends on your ability to brown nose and say the yes I have applied for several positions I was qualified for and never even received an interview
bad,"This company does not really care about their employees.  They claim they do, but the bottom line is money.  The only thing that really matter is how much money they can make."
bad,"The company itself seems great, but the ""security guard"" position they offer is a huge joke and waste of time. You aren't security at all. They lie to your face about it the entire time training and once they have you hook line and sinker you realize you are not security. You are just safety and logistics and have zero authority to do anything at all and any real security personnel laughs at the position at seaboard. The manager doesn't know what they are doing at all as they aren't even from a security field. The security manual is a humongous joke, full of grammar and spelling errors that the manager wrote himself, and they will constantly ask you to stay late so the rest of them can all get off early. The job itself is a waste of time and disgusting. If you want to come home smelling like rotten meat and wet pet food, covered in a fine layer of film and gunk from the plant then go for it."
bad,They give u a gift card but they take it out ur last check ur bonus if u work there 11 to 12 months they still take 40% back out ur last check they keep ur quarterly safety bonus if ur terminated even though it was after the quarter they are crooks cancel ur insurance very next day BAD company to work for sneaky people
bad,"I don't know how every farm functions or what the work environment is at every farm. But where I work, I feel like every task is difficult and the manager is impossible to talk to. My manager constantly breaks company rules/regulations but human resources cares more about management than the employees."
bad,"I have worked or this company before, the past three years I have applied for positions I know I'm more than qualified for. When they say they're the hiring people..it's more of who you know that will get you hired. It's not the experience you have"
bad,"A typical day at Seaboard Foods, Inc. in the ERM dept. would include sitting around for half an hour after clocking in, drinking coffee and talking about sports. Then, usually,  after the guys who the supervisor favored picked what they wanted to do for the day they would send us all out to do the day's assignments."
bad,No room for suggestions. Management always picks theyre favorites and take work asignments off of them and put them on others. Farm 4 is full un-profesional workers always blaiming others of things they would do. No one would be willing to lend a hand if you are strugling and they'll go and tell the manager that your are being slow when you where just having a hard time. They are always on you about time they want every thing done in a certain amount of time that is impossible to do. They always complain about you putting in to many hours. Wouldnt recommend working here.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working at seaboard at all bosses are mean and they don’t see that there is a lot of people that do bad things instead they think terminating people is like taking them off there back
bad,"Exacting and encouraging.. 3535 S. 500 W. Salt lake city utah . Preparing the labels for the jobs, making sure the production line are following gmp and work order procedures."
bad,"Working At seaboard should be considered self-harm, if seaboard is your last option then you haven't looked everywhere. They pay extremely well but you'll also be to busy and/or to much in pain to enjoy any of it."
bad,The pay is not worth the amount of work performed which leads to everyone leaving. Human Resources is corrupted along with the union. And their is programs in place that that keep the worker pinned down. There’s just a huge disconnect between employed due to language and cultural barriers.
bad,really bad management and life-work balance. The biggest problem with seaboard foods is the feeling of being treated as a slave. one time a man died in the plant and did not stop production.
bad,Terrible work environment with terrible compensation. Work hours not clearly set and benefits are not competative.
bad,Seaboard is a decent company to work for if you have the right management.  If not there is so much drama you think you work for a soap opera.
bad,I loved my job but Seaboard Food came in and took over and I was let go because of my position.  I have a good standing with all of my contract workers and my company workers.
bad,"As a former maintenance tech, this job is fair at best......the best part about this job was the production employees they were awesome and good friends"
bad,"if your looking for a new challenge this is definitely the industry for you, long hours, very high stress environment due to lack of communication, it was a great learning experience, management and staff can use a bit more training on people skills."
bad,"it was a fast place to work at you always doing something.like pouring water on the floor or sweeping, and that was the hardest part of the job. because people was not  so nice at this job.that is why i went to school for about a year. i was hoping by me going back to school will help me to better myself and to have a job that i can learn and grow."
bad,Its a good place to work if you're an animal person and the pay is good. It's another way to meet new people at the same time but it's too quick paced to get the things done correctly
bad,"I love working here, I just dont think that most of the people that work in a place like this have good work ethics. The company thinks that the barns should be clean whitch is a lot better than most companies."
bad,"I accepted this position on the basis that my skill set was needed and demanded; I was very wrong.  I was the patsy that got played from the very beginning.  A few things to keep in mind before you start down the path of interviewing and/or accepting the job at Seaboard Foods."
bad,"My supervisor had only be there 3 months prior to my arrival, she and I we both still very new to these positions and it was very stressful for only 2 people to working in a fast pace environment like that."
bad,If you work under or with the right people this place can be great. Good pay and advancement opportunity's. Some of the management are good and know how the job needs to get done in timely and safe mater. co workers are great.   
good,"The politics has been such a massive problem that plagues production in such a negative and unproductive way, the management is involved waaaay too much in things they have no idea in. The treatment of workers is not viable enough to justify the unnecessary workload and pressures of the job."
good,The difference between 1st shift and 2nd shift is unbelievable. They treat you better if you are Hispanic or Cuban. They do not treat everyone the same way. You have to be “special” to be treated correctly
good,"In charge of breeding and farrowing department 100+ employees in pig farm production. Long hours, satisfying and intense physical labor. Had to shower in and out to prevent disease. Learned lots about breeding and raising pigs for consumption. The workplace culture was a mixture of diverse and local employees as well as management. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the animals"
good,"During my employment was never offered any training to assist me in my position. If I made any suggestions for improvements I was rejected  and could only make changes based on my managers' ideas,"
good,"Alot of nonsense I got fired because I had to report the slightest little cut on my finger or report getting bit by a pig so they fired me because I had to many ""accidents"""
good,not a healthy environment to work for.they show no interest of any of your work. showed alot of favortism within the management department. they didnt want to hear any of your opinions.
good,"not a bad place to work but very close knit, its just too far from my family"
good,"If you did your job to the company standards and if you never forget anything they will love you, they are not afraid to change their mind on the drop of a hat or pile on the work."
good,"Fast paced work environment, loud, and cold environment. "
good,"I worked there for 3 years and I liked it but quickly lost interest after my first year.. I realized that i would wake up go to work then get home fall asleep and the next day it was the same, Saturdays are not always off you might work the next Saturday so you can't make any plans until Thursday."
good,it was hot in summer cold in the winter fast pace working with live chickens had to be careful safety is important you could get run over by forklift but wasa fun job
good,typical day at work was weanning the pigs and taking care of piglets wich were adorable wich was the most enjoyable part of the job only liked some of my coworkers others were know it alls
good,They dont care about firing or losing people cause they can just hire someone else right off the bat. They dont give you many chances.
good,Good company but recruiters told so many lies to get me to the job I wast happy they have some great people in management notice I said some because majority of the people At guymon location ignore you or try to avoid you I’ve never understood how Human Resources would lick the door and shut the windows just to avoid doing the job they were hired to do I came all the way from Mississippi to work for this company to only be treated like a inmate at the doc because of what the people before me had done and they perdiem wasn’t paid like they posted in application
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits. "
good,They care bout family but you have a family problem it wont be excused. I know from personal experience. The hardest thing bout where i worked is keeping the machines that make the boxes running
good,I had a few issues with the way some things were handled by my direct supervisor and I didn't feel appreciated as an employee. I thought that was I was doing for the company was exemplary and apparently I was wrong.
good,"a typical day at work at seaboard foods is showering is (bio security) "
good,I believe it's a good working environment. I personally liked it's easy pay is good. I would recommend people to work there. I had some problems but they were resolved.
good,"Seaboard offers great benefits, however management isn't always the best. Some employees get away with more than others it just depends on how much the supervisor likes you. When calling HR half the time depending on who answers you may not even get an answer to your question."
good,Job pays better I heard where I worked was alright I cut peace's of meat on the ribs I likes it just want to be in shipping cause they pay better and the time you get off really is gonna benefit me alot.
good,"The smell is awful,  and it's always cold where I work,  but the pay is decent and it's a steady job. I'd rather work elsewhere,  but seaboard Food pays the bills,  and does it fairly."
good,"Arriving at the farm at 5am, and discussing farm needs with employees. Which animals needed to be bred, moved, farrowed as well as which animals needed to be culled. Nutrition requirements were gone over daily."
good,Working for Seaboard Foods as a company is good. They have good communication for the most part. The reason that I am leaving is that I don't feel comfortable like myself professionally as I should. It came down to the fact that I just didn't have the passion for my current job that is needed to stay as it is a physically and mentally demanding position.
good,"management was iffy, work hours were alright, very filthy due to livestock, terrible smell, didn't pay to well, not enough vacation time, had to stay on site and couldn't leave for lunch"
good,it is a 24 hours production jobs that involve in swine business. they take care the quality of the product. I enjoy working with the crew member because they respect each other  responsibilities. You`ve been paid with the hour so every hour you work will be paid. Since it it a production business you are required to work even weekend if there is a work to be done.
good,Good pay steady work. Understaffed . But people dont last very long because more work then employees can handle. For my first 2 years i worked with a crew of 2 people. Although crew suppose be 4. So I had do an extra person job
good,I was learning how to become a manager. I did get hurt on the job here but did not have surgery and was not off work just on light duty.
good,"Seaboard can be a great place to work, but it also has it's downfalls."
good,The job is easy. The staffing is not that great in the front office. It’s just a cold environment for winter I liked the job but got irritated and left and I shouldn’t have.
good,If you enjoy working long hours and about half the weekends of the year Seaboard is for you. Competitive pay however management isn't the best to work for. If you have a college degree upper management that has worked their way up the ladder will look down on you.
good,Doing PM's ( preventative maintenance) daily ensuring the safe operation of the equipment. Learned a lot about  electrical  in my time there
good,"chequeo de todas las areas de produccion"
good,It is a cool place to work and make money. People are fun. The hardest part for me was being I the sun all day. The best thing was being around people it was easy to work with.
good,"When I started working at, Seaboard I didnt know what to expect, but about 1 week after working there i realized how much opportunity for advancement that i was looking at and that in its self is happiness."
good,Great place to settle down if looking to stay in one place.  Everyone knows and get along with one another. Easy minimum labored work.  A well satisfying job
good,"I liked working for Scott Waterhouse, as a maintenance mechanic, "
good,The work is very hard but if you have a willing heart you can do it.
good,Assuring that production follows within the establishments HACCP plan and product is in good quality before entering commerce. inspecting that all GMP's are followed assuring that all work utensiles are clean and sanitary for use.
good,"This company is full of cliques. Managers, assistant managers, production managers are all part, and if you are not in them you don't get treated the best. There seems to be no advancement if you are not part of those cliques. They have you do work that is supposed to be part of a higher pay grade but you dont get the pay. The other workers are great, and even though there is a language barrier at times, we seem to make things work and understand what needs to be done. There was a lack of training, and have had to figure things out on my own, or had things explained over the phone. They need to teach their managers how to teach the staff and not leave it to the employee to watch what's being done and just do it."
good,"Working at seaboard is a great paying job that let you have your weekend off with your family. Great health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, management need work on but it a good job"
good,I like working at seaboard  it's a nice place to work plus the pays it's good also. You get along with everyone that works there the supervisor are nice and they help you
good,"The two largest obstacles to satisfaction was continuously being short on help and an increasing work load from above, without equal rise in compensation. For example, on some weekends I covered 5 confinement sites with a total of 21 barns and over 30,000 pigs. This involved walking each pen, inspecting each animal, moving sick pigs out, giving injectable medications as needed, euthanizing, removing the dead, ordering feed, calling in the mortality daily and on every barn weekly. Lot of responsibility for a mere $14.00 per hour with no time and a half since we did not get overtime pay."
good,It’s a good job if you like working a fast pace environment. Would recommend to anyone that is finishing school. Expect around $400-$500 a week if you don’t put over time.
good,I loves working at seaboard foods it is as a fun work environment and great learning place about swine love to coworkers and great supervisor. It’s a hard job but well worth the knowledge.
good,Seaboard is a very fun and hard place to work at.  From pushing big barrels of feed to processing piglets( which is casterating) to power washing rooms. I loved helping and taking care of  the piglets it was a very accomplished feeling.
good,"Restez informé(e) des opportunités d'emploi .. En cliquant sur « Suivre », vous acceptez de recevoir les dernières informations et les nouvelles offres d'emploi de cette entreprise par courriel. Vous pouvez supprimer les alertes à tout moment."
good,"My experience at SEABOARD FOODS LLC. Was a pleasant experience, an encouraging job with an opportunity for optimal advancement, a productive and interesting, challenging workplace. opportunities to meet other employees."
good,I liked the people that worked there and the job was good.  Hardest part of job was getting it all done.  Not enough help most of the time.
good,The people were great workers. Management listened to the employees. Fast paced work environment. Safety was top priority both in food and the employees.
good,"The people are enjoyable, the management needs to stay steady and not switch as often. I worked an average of 16 hours a day, 6 days a week so my checks were nice, but didn't really have time to do anything."
good,"pumped pig barn lagoons ,pulled trucks on location during bad weather ,maintained roads and pads at pig barns locations,also did welding and maintained equipment"
good,"Got QA supplies ready to go down on the floor. Used  on a daily bases metal detectors wonds , checked temps of products and wrote daily sheets on findings."
good,The job entailed proper procedure to locate machine failure. The wide assortment of machine was challenging when preventive maintanace got behind.
good,Good company to work for with lots of work. Great dispatch team in the office.
good,Managed 11 maintenance mechanics on third shift. Managed the Kill Floor and the Cut Floor maintenance crews.
good,"The pay is great, and the people you work with are nice and fun and enjoyable. However management seems to not care about employees. Hours are odd and conditions are  fairly alright"
good,"Routine to go in and out of premises every day. I learned how to sharpen and keep a sharpen knife. A place where people can get hurt if they don't have very good skills.  If you are hurt it is hard to performed your job, specially when the band is way to fast because of production requirements. The best enjoyable part was when belt stop because of a mechanical problem (sad but true)."
good,I enjoyed my job and the supervisors were very helpful----dd not enjoy the size of the town or distance from family. I enjoyed the overtime and benefits that came with the job.
good,Good company. I enjoyed working there and I would work there again if I had trouble finding other employment opportunities.
good,"Se aprende la forma de trabajar en un ambiente con presion, ya que hay que demostrar que se es apto en un periodo de tiempo corto."
good,Did general laborer in warehouse loaded trucks tested gas field equipment before sending it to the field safety is at high demand
good,Your job is to tend to the pigs. Making sure they are feed and watered. Management willing to help with any problems or concern you may face. Worse part of job is mass treatment.
good,"Overall, the experience at Seaboard Foods was good. Had the opportunity to work on the Farm side and the Plant side in Guymon. Both cultures different, yet both have a common goal. People are great to work with there. Management is ok but could be better. Pay is fine for hourly employees, but for salary employees, it is not. Cannot advance in management career unless you are buddies with the upper management. Most management grew up in the industry, so they stay with the same management in their network. Having those challenges made me a better manager, so no negativity toward the Seaboard management team in Guymon. That is just how it is in the processing plant industry, whether its beef or pork."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for seaboard. I was hopeful that there like be better opportunities for job advancement. The benefits at the company are pretty good for what I was needing
good,"I was fired from this company after one offense. I was told that there had been ""multiple complaints"" but none of them were ever brought to my attention until the day before I was terminated, I know another employee that this happened to as well."
good,"As a Managing Director, I travel frequently to different affiliate offices to train Financial directors and implement procedures to expatriates and local alike which exposes me to different cultures and different languages in diverse business environment. This is very exciting, fulfilling and challenging, all of which  which I enjoy. "
good,"The pay is good, but you can get fired for a million little reasons. The management lacks a lot, including intelligence."
good,"Work on a poultry line all day, packing, machine operator."
good,Some days were tiering some were really fun days like any other job but me personally I liked working there because I really enjoyed what I did and they would treat every employee the same
good,"Seaboard foods expects a lot from its management team, but is willing to help if they see you putting in the effort.  They encourage "
good,Seaboard is a really great company very diverse from hourly employees to uper management if i did not move out of state i would still work their
good,"Seaboard foods animal caretaker is crazy if you apply to work be ready to work. It is a lot of things to remember and a lot of things to do every day. But if you do everything you need to do every day  it becomes easier. And if you enter the pigs pen just remember they only want to eat you,some of the pigs will let you pet them and when you get the piglets and they become sick if you sit in the sick open sometimes they will sit right next to you"
good,Its a great paying job. The down side is there is poor management. They expect you to learn something quick which you have not been properly trained for or they have no idea of how to do the job youbare doing
good,"Seaboard was a good company to work for. I did enjoy my time with the company and benefitted from great experience there. The downside I would say is that you are a part of a high paced work atmosphere and have to be ready for changes at anytime. Additionally the upper-management tend to be a large group that hang out after work hours, so I would say if you are part of management, you will eat, sleep, and breath Seaboard the whole time. Starting in lower management roles, you also have to give up weekends and tend to have to work 11 days on and then 3 days off"
good,"i enjoyed working there and getting to know everything and everyone, the safety is very important as well as how clean it is. i would go back, if i could."
good,"Fork lift op package handler. Every day was w"
good,"I was responsible for keeping the line up and running, also making the boxes for the chicken. I also learned how to de-bone chicken and inspect the wings"
good,"My job included total care of workers, job physicals, on job safety, drug screenings, workers comp follow ups, daily prep for line workers. I learned state safety regulations and the running of the plant. I loved the people. Co-workers were great. Management ok."
good,"It’s a good company to work for. Decent pay for the area, and hours are nice. everyone is great to get along with. Everyone work together as a team to make the day go by quick."
good,Seaboard foods is best company to work the pay is fair but the management is not comfortable.th equipment is modern technology by the i had great work when I was in seaboard foods i was working hard.
good,Making sure every animal has feed and wayer. Pretty flexible work place. Not the best smell. Alot of walking. Lifting and pushing 50 lbs or more. Paper work and computer work. Jumping feed bins.
good,In my experience I actually injoy working here many things to learn new experiences learned many new skills. Met a lot of new friends that were always help
good,"Fast paced, quick start and end.  High volume amount of work.  I enjoy my coworkers and bosses.  Stressful but quick days with the work load.  Improved my multi tasking skills."
good,"It was a fast paced work environment that demanded a lot of attention. I gained abundant knowledge at Seaboard shipping department. My duties included "
good,I started out in shipping as a box stacker.  I was able to work my way up in less than six months to the role of supervisor.  This was a great place to start and learn and improve your life.
good,Overall a goid place to work. Paid well and relocation was taken care of very well. Needed some updating at the time I left. I worked both shifts in my time there and I would recommend the second shift over the first.
good,"Very fast paste work environment, great people to work with. Staff was caring. Easy to move up in the company. for people who wanted to, or cared to. Good insurance for employees."
good,I used to be an employee and I enjoyed my time there. However some of the supervisors that I associated with just didn't make me feel comfortable working for them. I'm always honest and do my best at everything I set my mind to. However attitude reflects leadership. I left only because I felt mistreated there. I'm not saying I wouldn't want to work there again but hopefully when I do it could be a better experience because it is a good job with great benefits.
good,Enjoyed working with this company. The only problem was having to work nights if it wouldn't had been for my coworkers and management it would of of been hard.
good,"Bueno, aprendí a manejar la maquina para aplicar los medicamentos a presion con aire, por parte de la gerente no tuve buena comunicación pues ella no habla español y mi ingles es corto. y el traductor no hablaba buen español y no entendía los términos médicos de manejo con los que me comunicaba, hicimos buen equipo de trabajo dentro de la empresa y fuera, lo mas difícil fue hablar correctamente el idioma Ingles, estoy estudiando para lograrlo, ver los parámetros  de producción mejorados."
good,"Job was good for an entry position, and while the rest of the facility may be noisy the accounting department is quite."
good,"Domestic and international presence, headquartered in Merriam, KS near Kansas City. Excellent physical working conditions, and family friendly communities and environment."
good,"Worked there for thirteen years, opened and closed."
good,There are many people from different countries there that's not a problem but but when it comes to leadership if you're not Latino your not going very far .
good,"The best part of the job was the benefits, you're no likely to find another place that has such high quality benefits. They really do their best to take care of you as an employee."
good,Great company to work for just some racial profiling with some people in HR. Most of the people there were really nice!! Bosses were great. when it snowed they would order in so that we would not have to drive. There was just one bad apple there that was making it impossible to work in the environment but if that apple was to be removed it would of been perfect
good,Seaboard food es un empresa exelente para trabajar  buen ambiente de trabajo y buen salario
good,Seaboard Foods is a great company to work for. Be prepared to work hard if you apply. The product produced at Seaboard Foods is of great quality due to the policies of the company.
good,"The daily processing of paying poultry farms could get routine, but period end closings involved more detailed focus and attention. I was led to believe I was going to be promoted, but when I came back from vacation, someone else had been promoted."
good,I was being trained to work on knives and my coworker would also help me. The pay was great and the supervisors take time to understand your work pace.
good,The manager is constantly checking on you and doesn’t speak English. Other than that you get lunch break and the labor isn’t super hard.  The small pigs run around as you give them the medicine and jumping the larger pigs pens is easily completed in 15 minutes.
good,Good opportunities to learn alot about agriculture.friendly team working employee's .if their was a seaboard in Michigan i would still be working.i rate it a 10 .
good,"Es una compañía eficaz, eficiente, con una excelente organización y dirección,  buen trato y un buen ambiente laboral."
good,It was exciting to learn how to process overseas shipments and the paperwork that goes along with that.  It was also exciting working with overseas liasons.
good,Good job with good benefits. But could do better at advancement. all in all great job to learn about the pig industry. Great People to work with.
good,"i enjoyed working for this company never a dull moment, and i gained a lot of work experiance from there ."
good,"I started out as a supervisor here at this plant, and eventually got promoted. Typical day at the plant was busy, if it wasn't repairs, it was work orders and PM's, get parts and materials lined up for the weekend projects. with all the automation installation I really got a chance to hone in on my electrical skills and troubleshooting. All the co-workers there both production and maintenance for the most part were easy to get along with. Everyone has their bad days right. I really cant think of anything hard about that job other than lack of stock parts. This got rather taxing at times but it made me better in a sense that it challenged me to think outside the box sometimes when making repairs. I enjoyed the challenge of getting to make a difference and make improvements. I had a great director, a good management team, and some hard working team members. "
good,Seaboard was a good experience. Meeting new people from different countries and seeing their life style wassomething cool. Always smiles all around you look. A fun place to be and and over all good place to be.
good,not enough hours anymore a new plant open so cuts our hours down alot  and we receive less hogs and less orders to ship out to our clients  so no more overtime

Management was friendly, helpful, and quick to respond to any questions. I was given an atmosphere that let me reach my potential. Since, I am independent and can work at constant level of positive output, I was not restrained to doing exactly what was listed for the day. I could move on to other sections or details and when it was suitable come back to previous items. I also enjoyed the team spirit of working together to resolve issues. The toughest part I would say was that I was taking 9 credit hours online during my internship, but I managed quite well.

I learned the importance of treating animals in a human manner. I really enjoyed working with my first line supervisors along with co-workers whose were always willing to give me a helping hand in order to make my job easier and faster. Nobody stands around not doing nothing. There is always work to be done whether it was unloading hogs off trucks, helping co-workers, or helping maintain the workplace as clean as possible. Hardest part of the job was having to drag animals who were considered broken or stressors, due to the fact that they could not walk. most enjoyable part of the job was to unload trucks which contained coles. Coles were animals that did not need to be unloaded, because they were being transported over to different farms other than Seaboard farms."
