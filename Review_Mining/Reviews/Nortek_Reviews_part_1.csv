bad,"This was the first production company that I have ever worked for that always ran out of parts. They even had cycle count department , still ran out of parts that we used everyday. Management put their friends in positions that had no skill , education or training to be those positions. Things started getting really slow of the years other Nortek companies started closing and they assured us that we wouldn’t close. However I went on Tennessee.gov website , the human resource director has filed paperwork to lay-off 100 plus employees.  They lie about everything!!!!"

good,The facility in Olive Branch has had so many managers through the years they care nothing about dedication & commitment. The hours are long and the pay is mediocre. They have switched over to different companies several times. You can bleed blood sweat and tears for this job if you don't fit in with what they like regardless if you're the best they will get rid of you. They don't think of people lively hoods only what's best for them
