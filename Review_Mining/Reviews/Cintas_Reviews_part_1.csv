rating,review
bad,it provides your uniform the partners are friendy and helpful it has nice hours and weekends off as long as you can just stand and hang it is a good job
bad,"Load/Unload Familiarize myself with route schedules to better assist local SSR drivers as well as location shuttle drivers"
bad,"Very unsafe and unprofessional environment to work in,no organization and does not care about it's employees at all. Very uncomfortable and prejudice environment."
bad,"Run"
bad,I actually hate giving bad reviews but seriously no respect from anyone. They want their money but yet don’t pay their employees well at all. I was very naive and did not see all that was happening in my face. Lesson learned!
bad,Underpay no raises bad management Very hard to Move up. Stop  Paying Bonuses to regular Employees no diversity among’s minorities. It’s not really a good place to go for my opinion for entry-level any way
bad,"The worst Company I have have ever worked for. 2nd shift manager is lazy. Doesn’t like to work. Tries to give all her work to her employees, shows favoritism and racism, Lies so much, selfish, the pay is to low for the amount of work and labor. benefits are great. They will try to sell you a dream that won’t come true"
bad,In my time with Cintas the duties were repetitive & unstimulative.Most employees were elderly and prejudiced towards younger ppl. Management is a joke
bad,"Do not work for this company! Management only cares about how you're not meeting goals, but doesnt provide any help or feedback. They're main concern is how you dress.Very little ,training, pay, benefits, and PTO time absolutley horrible! "
bad,"Managment does not care about working you to the bone. People are constantly quitting or being fired, because of management. They do not hold themselves to the same standards they'll hold everyone else, and expect you to just switch your entire life to work around them. They'll talk down to you, tell everyone your personal business, and if you're a woman, you shouldn't have an option on anything."
bad,they will suspend you for just about anything and fire you for false items. don't pay for your vacation time off.. managers just don't care about you or their jobs.
bad,"RUN! They tell you that as an SSR that you are the face of the company but they don’t treat or pay you like you are. In fact I was paid more as a trainee than an actual route guy which is backwards. This is actually their tactic to bring you in. When I asked why I was making less I was told to sell more and grow my route. It is a physically demanding job as it is driving sometimes close to 100 miles to your first stop, yet they keep finding ways to make your job harder by giving you extra paperwork and and hound customers for checks as well as service accounts and run the route. There is absolutely no room to move up in the company unless you have college experience and look good on paper. There are a lot of politics in place. Management is very condescending. They could care less about their customers but care even less for the faces of the company! Your bonuses will depend on you getting customers that sign contracts that a lot of them don’t want to sign! This is definitely a job for a single person rather than someone with a family!RUN FAR AWAY!!!someone with."
bad,Horrible place to work never have any of your stuff loaded on your truck you have to load all your stuff if the loader don’t load it. Mananger are don’t help only one guy did and he was a supervisor and been pass up on a manager job 4 times they tell you to do all this stuff like lie cheat and steal from the customers and only fill them up with 70% of what they are paying for cause they are renting the product...this place is a joke no pay and no opportunity for advancement
bad,Just don’t say nothing to nobody every one is sleeping with everyone watch out for lead people they will lie and bully you if you let them and they don’t care if you go to chain of command they all are working together
bad,Cintas makes many false promises of advancement then gives promotions to those unqualified for the job. Claim they want you to advance but make up corporate answers as to why you didn't get it.
bad,"Cintas has a new check in woman at our location and she is making  jobs for ssrs miserable. I hear them complaining daily about them, have heard ssrs try to talk to service managers about it and he just laughs it off like it’s not that important."
bad,"U have no support from management management does not get back to customer the customer email the management call the management don’t show or call, email the customer back then the drivers get the blame from management because they don’t do there jobs they talk about respect the management don’t know what respect means"
bad,One of the worse places I have ever worked. They do not give you the proper training to do your job. Any time something goes wrong they will find the nearest scape goat. Favoritism is shown greatly. Highly stressful environment. Health care benefits were overly expensive.
bad,Cintas bought out my former company and made many promises and kept none  they are only about their people and not the ones they took on.  They slowly weeded us out after we took care of the transition for them.  They call each other partners but you are only a partner if you came from them originally.  Would never recommend their employment or their services.
bad,"When I was hired I was the “lucky” one out of 184 applicants to get the job. Within a few weeks in I knew the other 183 applicants were the lucky ones to have missed this train wreck. I was bullied at work by jealous coworkers all because they were intimidated by me. I never mistreated any of them including my supervisor  because I was raised to respect my elders and superiors. My supervisor and her minion hated me for reasons that had nothing to do with my work. When I placed my first complaint my supervisor apologized and confessed that her minion was jealous of me and I quote ""because you're pretty and you have cute curves."" Seriously? How professional is this office. Management at Cintas is the worst. The General Manager turns the other cheek because I'm sure he can see all the bullying and favoritism going on in front of his face and he does nothing about it."
bad,"very poorly managed at my location, did the best that I could with the little training I had. never had the things needed to service the customer correctly."
bad,Imagine working in a roach and maggot infested environment. Imagine it being sweltering hot and smell like vomit. Now imagine all that and being micromanaged constantly and all for 14 bucks an hour. No paid holidays because if you are off you just gotta make up for it later in the week. Hate life? Wanna hate it more? Go to cintas.
bad,Not a place to work if you want to make good money.  Once you get things going in your territory they shrink it again so you do not make to much money.  No REWARD for doing a great job
bad,"I had one GM that was amazing and created a team like environment, which Cintas quickly eliminated by forcing him out.  They replaced him with a GM that sniffed out all the positive momentum created in the team.  They fired one of my partners because she had no sick days, which you don’t get any time off until you have worked there a year.  The parent had a sick child and had to call out because she was a single mother with no one to watch her sick child.  They embody evil soulless corporation."
bad,"Managers are not helpful. Sit down all day and collect on your new business. Always changing prices. Some trucks are poorly taken care of. It's not a 4 day week. The Friday you think you have of you have to come in do paperwork, 1-2 hour team meeting. Back stabbing people. One route might get paid more then another. Work for 3 months and if you don't see a change in your pay....get out"
bad,"Where to begin, you will get no where here unless your in the boys club. Raises are 2%to 3% at best. They will tell you how much you are valued but won't pay you anything near your worth. Just run you into the ground and then pass you over for any advanement, because "" your so valuable to the department"". It's all a lie to keep the status quo."
bad,Work you like a dog and pay you like they are doing you a favor and they fire you based on he said she said. I thank god everyday they fired me. I have a much better job and life
bad,"Don't apply, if you have and offer don't accept, if your working there leave! Thankless job just run.....Money hungry rats that will take advantage of you and force you to take advantage of the customer."
bad,It started off awesome. Great pay & very supportive management. Once you pass your SSR certification you get Base Salary 475$ week plus 3% of route volume up to 10k. It seems great but they sale you a dream.  Over worked and under paid. Very unorganized & hostile. Very frowned upon if you call off. Work hours are well over 40 with no over time it’s less than half of your hourly rate.
bad,"Don't do it.  The only plus here are the benefits.  This place is nothing short of a sweat shop.  The mentality here is beyond high school.  Completely DRAMA city and the back stabbing is beyond belief.  Save yourself from heartache and look elsewhere.  If you do decide to work here, don't say you were not warned."
bad,Alot of management issues. Had to deal more with nonsense than any other job. Tried to better the company. Alot of high school gossiping and not enough work.
bad,Expect you to work all over plant in multiple job function with less pay billion dollars company cheap want workers hold the company the gether but don't wanna pay the workers  cheap company l like the hours I worked that's bout it supervisor a ont listen
bad,"Had a total of 5 interviews And a try out and still they chose ""other applicants"". I wasted my time and gas with them. Not sure who they are looking to hire for their SLAVE plantation of a job!! Good Luck!"
bad,"During my first few months at Cintas, my identity was stolen by another employee, who then took my driver number and gas card, going to different gas stations using the company gas, the employee had written my info down because my service manager left my personal info out in the open on his desk. That employee used the gas card to get gas in my name making it look like I stole gas. Management found out it wasn't me using the gas card, but I still got written up for it. CINTAS is a joke, Deep Clean is a joke."
bad,"i hated every single second there "
bad,Been here a while. Was never told holidays aren’t paid holidays??? My family thinks Cintas is breaking the law. I heard there use to be a awards/rewards ceremony once a year for drivers in June? It’s almost sept not a mention if it. Was told drivers get a free pair of shoes once a year again never mentioned. Has been a change recently in management and end of day process where guys are forced to wait to go home? A lot of angry drivers here. As soon as i find a job i am out. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone...
bad,"They put all the responsibility the drivers, the face of the company. And treat them awful. All i keep hearing is guys whispering if they have found a new job yet. Sounds like they are bitter. Haven’t been there long enough but i see guys who have been there for years and they say don’t stay. I hear there is a new head manager who is making job tough on them. Guys are sitting around for a hour at times to get checked in?? Not sure why it takes so long but the guys they are not happy"
bad,Was interested in being a delivery driver/ssr. Cintas is a very unhonest company. Drivers are sent out missing product yet they are told to charge customers no matter what. Spoke to a few people there saying not to accept a job. They recently changed the end of day process guys are out in the heat all day and want to go home at end of the day and are forced to wait around hour or so?? It seems like a lot of the drivers are upset with recent management change and it sounds like  a few are looking to leave
bad,"They take advantage of you and work you to the Bone and think the are high and mighty with their communications dagree Will never work for another manager like this one he is the worst ever told me if I have a death in the family i got to take a picture of the body to prove it and when I got married I had to prove it and I gave no reason for this type of action just trying to play king"
bad,"I asked about paid holidays drivers have a 4 day work week was told no paid holidays? Not sure for reason why. Heard from a lot of people saying don’t take the job due to a change in end of the day process and slot of them saying it’s a nightmare. Not sure what that means but more than a dozen told me to stay away, would suggest talking to employees and find out what the issue is, doesn’t sound like a good place to be"
bad,Cintas is treating their ssrs/ the face of the company like dogs!!!! Ssrs are told they are the gm of their own route. Until a recently ssrs were in control of fixing a customers invoice if there was a issue. Now they have brought in a new office person to ubdue any credits ssrs have been rightfully giving their loyal customers!!
bad,"In complete chaos, no organization. Managers not willing too help. Short products for customers on a daily basis. "
bad,"They promise you a lot of opportunities in the interviews and when you get hired not one opportunity is open to you. They have very poor management system, no communication. Especially the production manager and supervisors."
bad,"Terrible work environment did not have an enjoyable experience with the company the general manager did not care about the employees. Overall, awful experience."
bad,"Don't even bother with this company. The leadership is not at all practicing what they preach. They over work you as a service supervisor and really don't care about your personal needs. That leads to you getting underpaid and direct leadership is very immature, favoritism, unethical, and don't know how to run a productive company. Their HR is pathetic and really don't hold anybody accountable. I'm glad I'm no longer there."
bad,"Poorly managed, overworked, not enough pay, not enough help. Have to keep an eye on your paycheck and commission or you will be cheated out of money. Even If you don't take a lunch they take it out of you paycheck anyway.;"
bad,a Very racist company. Lack of diversity at the upper management level. very little pay for the amount of work that is being done. No genuine appreciation for the drivers.
bad,I worked there for almost 21 years and they kept a woman that’s only been there two and I work my butt off for that place and because she harassed me we got into it and they fired me
bad,"Not worth it, The stress of poor management coupled with the stress of 135 (at least) costumers per week and not having  the proper product from day to day is to much stress."
bad,"too many responsabilities for one person, they ask for help once and then it becomes your responsibility for little salary. bad supervisor supported by managment. they dont care if you are in pain. same movement makes you be in pain."
bad,Worse place to Work treat you like robots they only care about numbers too much pressure so stressful staff so rude with new employees. Worse place i ever worked
bad,"If I could give management 0 stars I would. Pathetic ""company"" that only cares about it's office workers and treats the 'real workers' the production team like refugees. I would describe the vibe in this warehouse as gloomy, just a bunch of dejected souls. Office workers come to work with fake smiles. But they think buying us pizza every now and then will make us happy. The loading job is not worth the money and the unloading job is even worse(filthy work). There's rare appreciation for the hard work we did. If you plan on moving forward in life, do not apply for this job. No raises, you'll get paid the same measly wages forever. You can't even report things to HR with confidence. Supervisors only care about there own jobs and are scared to defend us workers to management. Loaders get blamed for everything that goes wrong with the drivers. The drivers at this company run the show, just remember that. Overall it's a sad place to be at."
bad,"False promises, hazardous work environment, toxic environment as well as toxic management. Stay away. They will use you without appreciation or recognition."
bad,Come in at designated times only to find that we don't have all the materials for the day. Once the proper materials are found and loaded the starting time has already passed. We catch heat for leaving late when it isn't our fault and also when we come back late. Team meetings aren't in the best interest of the partners that go out of the ways to make it to them. Partners are punished for things out of their control. Unqualified people hired in higher positions. Too many managers and not enough people to actually do the work.
bad,"Company does not have integrity. They add stuff to clients acct hoping that they wont notice on the invoice because store managers are over worked and dont have time to check invoice or team has no clue what the should be getting vs what was added. "
bad,False Hope's of career advancement. No leadership. Stress filled work environment. Expected to perform supervise duties without title or pay. Was given the unofficial title of wash alley lead with no increase in pay and no authority but held accountable for the actions of others
bad,The worst company and dis organized I have ever worked for. They run you and use you like dogs. Stay far away. The management lie to you from the start. The GM is a joke.
bad,Cintas is a mess . Supervisors HR and managers secretly hate each other. They most definitely will protect the bottom line and will sacrifice someone’s livelihood to do it. Truck will break down everyday.4 day workweek sound great until they call you in on your day off. Gripe when you ask for help or lord forbid put vacay time in. Overall this was the absolute worst work experience of my life. Stay away from Cintas Baton Rouge
bad,"🤔 Asked me to shave my beard🧔off...completely OFF to a clean face, I tried to compromise and I told them I would shave it down but I ain't shaving it off. So basically what they're trying to say is that you won't be able to sell anything to any Customer because you have a beard? that's the saddest thing and the most discriminatory thing I've ever heard in my life when we were kids we're taught not to judge a book by it's cover that's essentially what you're doing it is up to the employee to make the customer feel as though they are a customer and appreciated it doesn't matter whether I have a beard or have a whole body full of hair I don't have tattoos on my face I don't have earrings on my face or anything like that but again even that shouldn't matter and it's discriminatory to think otherwise it's not like it was Food Services where in which case I might have to shave my beard or I would have wore a beard net I have never been asked to shave my facial hair in any interview in my life this is horrible and I hope you guys do better just know I went to CP24 with this review and I hope they review it on your show cuz I know I'm not the only one. At my last job I had customers calling my boss asking specifically for my services no one else's hit the boss said he was going to send somebody else they didn't want the work to be done they just wanted it to be me I wonder why that is play Cintas you guys just lost a really good guy and i didn't even get a chance to work for you guys BECAUSE I JAVE A BEARD 🤷‍♂️😡!! 😤😤😡🖕🏼🖕🏼"
bad,"Terrible company to work for they lie to you to get you to start and then work you to  death.  Very clicky as well."
bad,"I worked at Cintas Colorado Springs. they are always finding loop holes to ensure no partners don't bonus. You constantly have to fight for your money. You try to call out to your Manager and they don't pick up. Managers go home to their families while you are out working past 6PM. Over work you with your route and you will work over the 14 hour DOT regulation period. They will lie to you about pay when switching hourly to SSR Route Pay. Technically you have to sign to switch over, NOPE! Managers will move you over and not mention to you.  Managers will never try to help you but if there is a issue regarding your route then they will call you immediately so that you can fix it. When you bring up multiple issues regarding the route you get avoided. Product is not always available. Manager states they will bring it out to them and won't. After 5PM no managers are in the office so if you have a issue you have to find time to hound them down. Vacation time! What vacation time! I tried to take a day off that was promised to me when I took over the route and the day comes and managers say I don't remember that conversation. Don't plan on eating lunch, or getting a break because there too much work in day for any of that. you try to do right by your customer and the manager will not. If you ever have a issue don't bring it up to management, call the direct line to get the right assistance. If you are having issues management will try to find something to get rid of you. Anyone who has interest in working for Cintas or think it's a great opportunity please do your homework."
bad,"I worked here for about 8 months. After about two months of training I was given my own route. It was already in the red but I was expected to clean it up. They offer a payment plan for drivers which is rigged to benefit the company and not you.You're essentially making minimum wage. Actually no you're making less than minimum wage. Some weeks I brought home 0 dollars on my paycheck after working 50-60 hours because of this route being so bad. The management was rude and very clique oriented. They treated drivers like nobody's and would not respond to any complaint. Customers were always right and they could easily lie on you and you would be the one in hot water, even if this customer hadn't paid their bill in months! I would never waste my time on this terrible company again."
bad,"Racial bias at the Greenville,SC location.  Minorities at this location are marginalized , profiled and often overlooked. Reports sent to HR, reviews are made and shortly after the minority employee will be terminated. This location is very good at hiding this issue from corporate."
bad,Bad management bad HR if ur a woman u will not advance in company women are not treated fairly doesn't pay well don't give many raises work u like a slave management talks bad to employees preach safety but have workers working in unsafe conditions definitely would not recommend horrible management and pay not worth ur time
bad,"Horrible- too many hours, not enough support, training or development. People would sell you out just to get ahead. Worst experience unfortunately. Which it could have been better."
bad,the company was not good to work for.  The management plays favorites and doesn't follow the rules for certain employees.  I would not recommend working here.
bad,"Poor Management,Bullying/Racism in the work place.Highly unprofessional staff.Hard work is not appreciated.You can be terminated for using your earned vacation time unless your Caucasian,No place to advance unless your Caucasian."
bad,"You are worked to the bone for very little pay everyday. The management doesn't do their jobs and put the employees last. Would not recommend to anyone that wants to have a life outside of work. There was nothing to benefit from the job at cintas. The healthcare took more out of your weekly check than what is was worth. They are NOT veteran friendly. If you are in the Reserves or National guard you may as well forget about it. They do all their military leave through a third party company called sedgewick, which is also a joke of a company. Hopefully Indeed doesnt hide this and this review saves someone their time."
bad,. Deep clean supervisor tells deep clean crew not to punch out after their shift if they dont get their 8 hours that's a no no.he makes up hours......
bad,"Not A Good Company to work for, management is clueless on how to run operation. Never have I seen such a poor group of mangers. Working here is like working at the office (TV show)"
bad,"Overworked under paid ,stressful ,uneasy feeling from management ,unpleasant work place ,supervisor has  favorite workers,very hot environment ,very different experience for me"
bad,"no advancement in this company unfair management, pay is unfair. horrible management, I would no recommend anyone to work for such a horrible management"
bad,"Work hours are long 10-14 a day even with only a 4 day work week"
bad,"worst place to ever work,poor management,bad managers,no place to grow,they don't  train and expect you to know everything,micro mage everything you do"
bad,"Too many details to keep up with, to many expectations, management never satisfied with hard work, always pushed for more ,over pressured , over worked , under paid. The warehouse took 4 months to get orders of safety & first aid products for us that we ordered  to be able to sell these products to our customers & then would write us up for not hitting our numbers when our numbers were based on the sales of the products we were waiting for to sell to our customers for months. The office takes for ever to complete tasks. Management is lazy & doesn't complete tasks necessary in a timely fashion. The office is completely not organized, the warehouse inventory, and truck inventory is never correct !"
bad,"Do not work here, you can move up, pay ain't enough,upper management and hr look the other way with concerns. They work you to death and don't want to pay. The deep clean manager a big liar and hard to work with. Work get slow and you may work 1 day a week."
bad,"Hired new hires rather then calling Laid off employees back. Does not value hard working, responsible employees. Had 5 employees out on lay off and chose to hire new rather then call back."
bad,"The videos of their mission, culture and jobs are great but it is a lie. They don't follow the mission and culture. They work the production hard and they don't take care of them like they do the drivers or the Management team. Management team only takes care of themselves and specially the management trainees. HR or corporate do not know  what goes on."
bad,this place over work their employees and under pay them. This company has crooked upper management and really don't care about the employee just care about production
bad,The days were long & the nights were longer. There open door policy was never open. Pay raises were Cents on the dollar but no more than 10 cents. No room for advancement if you was a female or a person of colour
bad,Going to keep it short and sweet. Had over 4 interviews for a carpet cleaning position. They send you out on the job training before you get hired. You can work your tail off and be professional and show extreme ambition and motivation for there company and they will blow it back in your face. Don't bother wasting your time interviewing for this company by far the biggest waste of time and do not reccomend for anyone.
bad,To long ago to provide decent review.  I did not experience a good atmosphere with my director as she was not a solid leader nor was most of the mindset of the office.
bad,One of the work experience in my entire life as a working professional. A Patriarchal and misogynistic environment that marginalized women and people of color.
bad,"this is a turn and burn company. "
bad,"BaD Stressful, Mean , back stabbing, untruthful for the top down. Well maybe it has changed, I hope it has for the good people who worked there. Time can help things and people to change."
bad,"No review , company’s okay, people are another story "
bad,"The job is very hard on your body physically, I went home sore almost every day  the whole time I work there. I learned how to use a sewing machine by working at this company. It can be a good environment but the supervisors lack professional skills. It's not a lot of diversity at this company as well. The most enjoyable part was the hours and the new friends I met."
bad,Worst place i'ved ever worked at. Very poor management. They trained you for like an hour and expect you to get the job done. You get tosed around every department and get paid munimum for all you fo
bad,"They bought a small company,picked an existing manager from another department and had him run it.He ran it into the ground and within a year the entire department was let go due to lack of work."
bad,Very bad management the supervisor treated people like they were her slaves and the manager allowed it. Both of them had there preferences and their favorites got away with anything they wanted. It's very low pay for to much work for one person to do. They will abuse you and they expect you to smile all the way through it.
bad,A typical work day was a typical work day.  There were no ping pong tables.  It was hot and smelled bad.  You are dealing with dirty laundry all day everyday.
bad,They are not fair they over work their employees their warehouse in Chelmsford is crumbling and they don't want to fix anytyhing. So many people have gotten Injured
bad,"I worked for Cintas only for a few months. The supervisors receive a bonus when the employees have no overtime so they supervisors are rushing you constantly to do work. The pay is very low for the amount of work you do each day and if you get medical, vision, or dental insurance your pay is even lower. The supervisor I had was annoying he would always rush you to do your job and sit there with his arms crossed watching you while telling you to speed up. Working there was like being on a plantation. The supervisor even said out of his own mouth that he rushes us off the clock so that he could receive his bonus and so that he could see his wife because he never has a chance to see her. And if you are an investor in this company please ask to see the back of these trucks because your uniforms and other clothes are just being thrown around with nasty bulk. And most of the bulk smells horrible with maggots in it with your uniform sitting right on top so on a surprise day take a look at these trucks and don't let the company know you are coming because then they are going to clean up like they always do when investors come around. Route 3 is the worse!!"
bad,Promise one thing and provide another. They will lie to your face to secure a sale and then proceed to not pay your for accounts you've sold or bonuses you've EARNED!
bad,I was sexually harassed via text messages from Cintas cell phone to my phone during work hours. I was sent 22 explicit text messages from my ex Gm. Cintas never issued an APOLOGY.
bad,"If you are an educated motivated individual, work elsewhere.  Poor management, racist tendencies, extreme favoritism, impossible KPIs, complacent workers, unrealistic goals, no transparency, top level management makes all the money and does little to no work. There is no teamwork, no organization, no direction, constant drama, and to top it all off, you’ll have to work 50-60 hour weeks to keep pace.  Concerns are met with opposition rather than endearment, advancement opportunity is always eluded to but never achieved.  Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Poor Management, favoritism all around most unprofessional environment as a whole. It is like High school even Elementary. I can do better than this so I did. I am writing my review in hopes others are aware that unless they like Drama and not interested in a support system to educate you and assist you in growing within then reconsider."
bad,this is an okay work place fast paced I think that there employees are underpaid for the work that is expected to be done. but overall is it a god company
bad,It was complete waste of time for me because the management team didn't care about anyone but themselves. Awful work conditions such as putting too much work load on one person to do. And it was just overall stressful. If I could give it no stars I would.
bad,"The worst company I ever work for. CoWorker was very rude, uneducated, and  unprofessional. Management has sociopathic tendencies they are  very superficial, untruthful and insincerity."
bad,Expected to post payments as quickly as possible.  More than 6 errors resulted in write-up.  Poor management identified specifically in mandatory overtime.
bad,"Underpaid with A lot of responsibily but no help"
bad,"Over saturated territories and low commission pay out. Some weeks my pay equated out to $9-$10 hr. The only perk to this job is the company vehicle. Management lacks experience, direction, and have no rapport with the drivers. Take this job if you are in need but GTFO as soon as possible because this is a sinking ship with arms. Remember boys and girls some companies have openings for a reason. Think about it."
bad,"At the plant i worked there were 2 delivery and service departments, company seemed to only cater to the uniform side. Any work you couldn't get done due to their inability to properly route your area was left to you and it seemed as if ALL forms of management were on board with this way of thinking. They didn't take time to help you understand your job but had this expectation that you could jump right in with ZERO assistance. Not the type of company id recommend to anyone."
bad,Work is horrible I did not like management and supervisors had no knowledge of what yo do. It is a stressful environment and they show favoritism to others
bad,"This is the most horrible place to work. All management are a bunch of moronic bullies and do not know how to take ownership. The dumbest one is Ms. Big Bird. They are racist and uneducated.  The balance is completely off. You can work overtime, come in on the weekends and they STILL want you to work harder. They don't care about you living with your family and loved ones."
bad,Very non family oriented.  No work like balance.  Expectations way to high for the $ they paid. Management very one sided no support on the lower level employees.
bad,Zero stars for management. They believe word of mouth instead of their own employees. They quote you a bonus and don't follow through. This company does not care about their employees. They're more concerned with their money. They show favoritism and don't take their own advice. From the start this company was a joke. They expect you to meet impossible numbers and barely train you on what you're doing. Definitely wouldn't recommend this company to any sane person!
bad,Horrible place to work.  No diversity.  Do what you are told and do not speak.  Slave atmosphere.  Augusta has the worse management.  Only people that were Caucasian were promoted.  All African American plant with no African American managers. No air conditioning in plant.  General Manager most narcissi  person.  Pure evil.
bad,"Unorganized, sold and over promised their customers products they never had enough of. Fleet of trucks in disrepair. Mangers blew off customers calls, meetings and needs. No advancement opportunities. Payroll was a joke, checks never accurate.Always pushing more and more responsibility without fair compensation.  Overall bad place to work. Only good thing was the four day work week."
bad,Our director wanted us to bill companies for false garments just to meet a goal each week. I never did this and got let go because I did not think it was right to bill someone for false lost shirts and pants.
bad,"Don't work for this company if you are a single parent as they don't care if you have outside obligations to your children first. Forget it if one of them gets sick. They will just write you up for missing work. "
bad,"Very large corporation, have no tact or desire to advance an individual always putting the corporation needs above everything else. Difficult to advance."
bad,"People are mean , not fair, and set in their ways. Everyone has been there since before 1992 and are very mean and nasty. I would not recommend them to a"
bad,push you so much to achieve alot with very little resources. the manager earn big bonuses while junior staff earn very little and used. would not recomend
bad,"A company that is built to shorten the customers.  Changing shifts, lack of communication, inventory running short, and charge-back of accounts make this job unbearable."
bad,This is the worst paying job ever. You get a 30 cent raise if your lucky. Management is uneducated. Even though they went to college. Turn over in every department is high. Most people stay for about 6 months. This job is ok if you need money weekly to survive half way  until you can get a real job. And trust me they are going to work the tar out of you. For a company that brags they profit 4 billion a year should be ashame of themself on how they pay and reward their employee's.
bad,Management micro manage you. Hours were long. when you have vacation. It can be change by GM. people employees control the out come of your performance.
bad,"This company is horrible to work for. I have never experienced such uneducated and backstabbing people in management positions. Additionally, your coworkers will try to stab you in the back at any given time because they hate their job and the company. HR is corrupt and should not be in that position. The supervisors are only promoted on how willing they are to stab people in the back and walk over dead bodies to get what they want. The so called customer service reps are actual account managers that have to sit at the tiniest cubicles in the world and are paid a measly $15/hour (if they are lucky) and don't understand what their actual job title should be (of course the company loves that fact because that means they can underpay them). No vacation for the first full year (that includes not a single sick day either). You get a whole 3% raise a year (whoopdidoo). the location is a revolving door. And upper management still doesn't get it. They love to hold speeches to brainwash their employees and tell them how grateful they are but aren't. The more money they make, the less they give back to the employees. If you are asking for a share of profits, you will be told by the division's national management that you will never get any because that would mean people like the cleaning crew would have to get it too and that is obviously ridiculous. "
bad,"They don't care about the employees,"
bad,"management  doesn't listen to partners and HR Lady is the worst when it comes to partners. The partners are the best, but when it comes to management there are the worst. always looking on who to bust!"
bad,They will lie just to get you into door and then use you for a certain amount of time making it seem like you will get a full time position and then when that time comes then they will let you go and then hire someone else its a repeated step i guess cintas is a waste of time
bad,I never worked here. Never got passed the application. If i have to make a password and user name just to fill a application out i dont wanna work for you.  Doing to much when im not an employee of this company.
bad,"The pay isn't commensurate with the work that has to be done. The benefits are nothing to write home about, either. If you have an opportunity for something better, take it."
bad,"let me start by saying ive been in retail all my life.i was looking for a different career.i applied for a route postion with cintas in bessemer,al. i did an interview with a guy named robert which went well..the following week the human resource woman named tiffany wanted to schedule me to do a ride along with a driver which i did.i arrived at 530am on a monday and i finally found the supervisor mike and he just handed me a uniform and told me id be riding with chase.he said he went out that door.. so i had to go find a guy i didnt know what he looked like.well after about 5-10 min i finally found him. we went on our route and i liked the job.when i returned i had to interview with 2 other supervisors.which went well.i was told i had to interview with the general manager caleb but he was on vacation so i  had to wait another week.well i never heard back from them so i called tiffany again after trying to reach her for at least 3 days. she finally called me back and we scheduled an interview with caleb. we talked and he told me he wanted me to talk to tiffany about the job.well i finally got to talk to her about a week later.she told me they would decide in the next couple of days about bringing somebody on.well its been 2 weeks and still havent heard from her.ive called her numerous times with no answer.this interview process has been going on for 7 weeks which i think is ridiculous.luckily ive accepted a postion with one of there competitors after only my 2nd interview with them.im assuming there not going to bring me on board since i cant reach them. the least they could"
bad,It's a very cheap company with little opportunity.Poor management. Incoherent goals. This is only for college grads or people with no experience in sales. Mostly customer service.
bad,"worst job I ever had, the management was definitely unprofessional  was not compensated for all work that was done.did not have a good work experience at this company."
bad,"I went through two in-person interviews with three different people and a ride-along for their floor cleaning division. The entire process from first contact to the last interview I had took about two months and everything went smoothly. My only problem was that the ride-along was NOT PAID for AS PROMISED and it was over 10 hours of work. Also, I was never contacted back about the job through email or phone; it has been over a week since I last left a message."
bad,"This company hides behind a we are ethical and the lame book the spite is the difference. I was asked numerous times to work off the clock and lie to auditors.  "
bad,"Decent job ,pretty easy simple work management sucks and they treat their employees terrible , not of enough pay or hardly any decent raises for the hard work you do"
bad,"If you want no direction and no home life this is the job for you. I was an experiences sales professional who was recruited to work for this company. I left after 6 months into it realizing what a huge mistake I had made. If you are entry level this may be a good fit, but would not consider other wise."
bad,Terrible management. I was targeted by management. I was called racial slurs. The entire management were unprofessional.
bad,"Whatever position you get it won't be a good one. Tons of corporate brain washing, expected to work weekends, poor management etc"
bad,"I did my best, I worked long hours -upwards of 50 a week. The environment is solely based on favoritism, not on how hard you work. If you enjoy gossiping, backstabbing, and bullying the people you work with, this is your place! The management sucks and all they care about is making a buck. The job itself wouldn't be bad - if you worked alone in your own office. Not to mention the rules are strict, cant talk, cant get up, etc etc bc if the management doesn't say anything, you can bet the person next to you will. I grew to hate this place with a passion. Please don't let them fool you."
bad,"I do not recommend working here for many reasons. ( pay, management, office atmosphere, morale of employees, no growth or opportunity, dead end job, long hours, no work/home balance, goals are too high, not the same playing field as other locations and no support."
bad,"A typical day at work began at 5:30am until 2pm Monday through Friday. I worked there for almost two full years and there was really nothing good about the job in all honesty, besides the work schedule and weekly pay. There are a total of three shifts. I worked first shift, hence an early start and end to the day with weekends off. When i was first employed at Cintas I was a bulk folder. For eight hours each day, i folded bundles of towels. Not exciting or enjoyable whatsoever. Big carts of towels would be dumped in front of you on a table and you folded bundles of towels as fast as you could to reach your numbers because you were on incentive. All Cintas cares about is numbers. Most of the time the towels that needed to be folded weren't even clean, soaking wet, or torn to bits. Extremely unsanitary because these towels were coming from hospitals with god knows what type of germs on them. Cintas also offers room for ""career advancement."" Basically, if there is a job opening you would apply or tell your supervisor for consideration. If you got the new job it was considered a ""promotion."" Most of the time management would make you feel like you were getting the new job/""promotion"" only to announce it to someone else making you feel confused and let down. My second job at Cintas after a ""promotion"" was quality assurance. I enjoyed it a little more than folding but it was still extremely hard labor for low pay. Initially, i worked with a ""partner"" (Cinta's version of coworker). After a few months she was ""promoted"" to a new position. I was left alone to scan and inspect enough"
bad,"cintas is the worst job i have ever had, not only they lie to you, telling you there are opportunities for advancement, that is completely false, unless u are already part of their management team, you are not going nowhere here, plant employees get the worst benefits, vacations and salary, yearly reviews are a joke, can go anywhere from zero cents and up to 20 cents, service team get a better deal , better pay, and plant employee dont get nothing but peanuts. simple as that, management is corrupt, hr manager and the rest of the management work together so employees dont get anything. work in a place where they expect a lot from you, but than all of their equipment doesnt work, they break down every single day, they dont care about fixing them, its not safety and could get hurt while working under those conditions. and they dont hire enough people , the job the 4 people are suppose to do, only 2 people have to struggle to do it,"
bad,Terrible working conditions. High turnover rate. Not very personal or compassionate to employes needs as far as training.
bad,"Long work days and very low pay for your responsibilities.  You will drive a truck everyday and in the winter most trucks don't have heat and in the summer they don't have a/c.  Management is more concerned with forcing their ""culture"" down your throat than they are improving your income or quality of life.  Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
bad,"missing traffic with early work hours"
bad,trucks were in unsafe conditions and management was not concerned for the drivers safety. customer service was not top priority.
bad,"Was hired for a route with 10+yrs experience, and was put loading trucks for two months, then a super route for 6 months. Both were horrible work, and they will try to pump you up to do it. Too many lies about what you are going to make and a good old boy system of who they like and want to promote."
bad,"To many negatives to name but if you are not salaried and if you are thinking of working in customer service, order fulfillment or the distribution center, please reconsider unless this is your very last hope. The depts. that I named is ran with a communist approach, it's a degrading and border like sweat shop environment. One lady who I sat next to that has worked their for 10 years in the customer service dept said that working here is a slow death. When I started feeling like that was true, I had to go.Consider yourself waned."
bad,"no work life balance management is terrible, pay not guaranteed"
bad,doesn't care about their employees. They talk about promoting within the company but that doesn't happen. Instead of promoting employees who work hard and know what they are doing and show up to work every day. They make you apply for a promotion. You can work there for 8 years and know everything inside and out and still not get a promotion unless you apply.
bad,This place cares about nobody unless you work in the front office! They care nothing about your family. THEY DO NOT GIVE RAISES at all! This place is full of their selves! I  would never work there ever again!
bad,"Not sure where i would start. You never get time to take your lunches. As they schedule you enough work to keep you slammed all the time. You get no help or support from the San Jose branch. Managers weren't even licensed in fire extinguisher service. Management was terrible. No advancement opportunities and pay is really low. They have high expectations and make those expectations nearly impossible to achieve. If you like being treated terribly and talked down to like your an idiot, then this is the place to be."
bad,"My typical day was easy , I liked my supervisors and management team a lot, but the employees were mean to me, and made my work days unpleasant at times."
bad,"The expectation from the company was outrageous! I'm a hard worker and enjoy working hard, but what the wanted was out of this world."
bad,"Extremely low pay for the amount of work performed. WAY too many incentive based on unrealistic sales goals and quotas. Always short on product, truck never fully loaded. Only ones you can count on are the other drivers. Felt sleezy trying to increase customer bills every chance you get. Just a miserable experience if you have a conscience and any moral compass. 4 day workweek not as fun as it sounds considering you end up working 4 12-hr days instead of 10-hr, which ends up being the same as working 5 days."
bad,Very frustrating place to work as management avoids you constantly and hides in their office. There is no communication period. A very unsafe company to work for even though they claim to be the best in the safety industry. If OSHA or DOT ever reviewed them they would fail beyond belief. Very unsafe work conditions
bad,Cintas provided poor service! Excpected me to sell excellent service???
bad,"Perrysburg location is prejudice!  Your paid by how much you hang, too many females and attitudes, management say one thing then do another! Pay sucks!"
bad,"Poor place to work I use to work at 492 in ft worth texas and trained as a ssr . They pressured us to get the customers to renew there contracts by harassing them constantly were they hate to see us coming.  They say four day work week  thats a lie , had 3 to 4 meetings a week and mandatory ones on your off days just a all around bad place to work."
bad,"Cintas Document Management of Raleigh, ... Not the best place to work. The work load is unreal, the company preach about safety and the trucks lack of maintenance. During a period of 12 months 14 plus employees including supervisors, managers and GM decided to move on. The same goes for Winston-Salem location."
bad,"I was hired in as a Mat Roller. I had to go through 4 interviews and a drug test in order to obtain this job. The best part is, even with that, I was hired in as a temp through an outside agency that had literally nothing to do with the pre employment process. "
bad,"I began every day between 5:30am and 6:00am. You have to work at a break neck pace to finish your day in 10 hours. Don't plan on eating lunch at Cintas. The work is very physical and dirty.  The trucks are old with NO A/C. The pay is very low until you get your own route. Even after you get your own route the pay does not justify the hours and work environment. You are expected to mislead and even lie to your customers on a daily basis. If you don't management will.  Out of stocks, mispicks  and incomplete orders are the norm.  It was hard for me to sale for a company I didn't respect. High turnover throughout. This is the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
bad,"its more like a slave plantation than a job you are on your feet for 8 hours at the minimum a day! they do not care about you they have air conditioning but will NOT turn it on. you can throw up all over the plant all day but they will make you stay or yu will be punished! they always want you to stay late and if you dont they start treating you badly. very poor work conditions, non caring management staff. very detrimental to you physical and mental health!!"
bad,"J'ai travaillé dans un environnement agréable qui n'est décevant."
bad,"Wow Honestly I Dont Even Know Were To Start!?..This Job Doesnt Even Deserve not one star thats how AWFUL This Company is.. But Am Sure Not All Cintas Places are like this, But one thing is for sure the ones located in Las Vegas are sure *%$# .. I Cant STAND HR, Managers,Supervisor, Co workers..Why is that Every time I Have Something Important to Ask they always too Busy to even take the time to listen to what I have to say (even when there not BUSY?!) how do i know there not busy am standing rite in front of the door (its half open) waiting for the manager to let me in but shes too busy talking to one of her ""Colleague"" about how her blind date went REALLY am Guessing its more important then what i have to say..And About my Co workers its Wayyy to much about what i have to say heres a few ..LAZY, DISRESPECTFUL, IGNORANT PEOPLE,SELFISH"
bad,U R WARNED! DO NOT APPLY AT THIS PLACE! They will take you for all you got and its not apperciated!
bad,"The culture is one of backstabbing and succeeding the wrong way. Forget being sick...if you are not working long hours (they encourage working saturdays) and cutting invoices, you are nothing to them. The turnover rate speaks for itself (it is high). You are dispensable and managers are trained to oversell the role to get you in the door. Advancement opps are only given to those that kill themselves for the company."
bad,"Horrible! Management at this location with human resources aware of it, both commits illegal activity & is racist! You will be required to work over 40 hours & will only get paid for 40 hours. Management shaves all hours worked over 40 to avoid over time pay! ILLEGAL!! Furthermore, the management at this location is extremely racist! If you are of any other ethic background other than white, you will be harassed, micro managed leading up to termination! Corporate is not far behind, they do not back employees up, make situations right, instead they pass the back. I do not recommend this company to anybody! You will regret it!"
bad,"They call their employees ""partners"". That's your first clue that you are anything but a ""partner"". They are constantly running management trainees thru the system. These people have no real world experience and it shows in how they ""manage"". Why does Cintas use management trainees? Simple, it's the cheap way, which is the Cintas way. Churn 'em and burn 'em culture."
bad,Horribly managed and the HR is a complete joke. They only care about themselves and would fire you for their own amusement. Just stay away.
bad,one word sums up this job..............HORRIBLE. The job was strenuous and nerve wrecking
bad,"If your looking for a check,then Cintas is for you.. if you are looking to further your career in accounting keep going because cintas only thinks their 10 year employees deserve promotions."
bad,"Management doesnt care if your there or not. They favor employees with higher numbers. I was in a situation where i was being bullied and my supervisor didnt want to deal with it so he let me go. The manager was completly unapproachable, other people went to her about this person and she just ignored it. Overall it was a terrible experience. There was no supervision, people were able to cheat to get there numbers and take the easy ones from your pile. Your just a number and they'll fire you at any time for no reason. I wouldnt recommend working here at all."
bad,This is a very dirty company to work for I worked for them as an accounts receivable rep one of the positions that they are hiring for now. I had surgery on 05/07/10 came back before I was supposed to on 05/16/10 and then they let me go on 05/20/10 because my surgery was unnessacary. Really are you a doctor I think not. Well any way. This company will use you to get what they need and then they will let you go. Everyone that started when I did they have laid off because they cleaned up the diaster of a location because they the people that were original running the location had no clue what they were doing. They laid everyone off and now they are rehiring more instead of hiring the ones they laid off back. How funny is that. Think before you apply this will be the biggest mistake of your life working for Cintas.
bad,Day starts with wondering what went wrong previous to you getting there and how you are going to get blamed for it. Figure out how to make production quotas with insufficient staffing.
bad,This is from the perspective of a production supervisor:
bad,It is a horrible place to work management lies about hiring you and giving a raise they pay poorly and stab you. I was hired for a position and there was no work so I was placed on the warehouse I was forced to quit I couldn t lift anymore boxes.
bad,"Promised a certain salary after 90 days of training, never worked out to be anything close. Most managers were great, one was terrible and encouraged lying to customers."
bad,You will be working 10 hour days (50hrs wkly) and your pay check will look like a part-time job's pay. Co-workers are the best part of the company.
bad,The only positive experience were my co-workers who were all nice people.
bad,This company needs to uprooted and someone needs to help them with a strategic plan. I worked in the corporate office. The relationship between business to business was awful. Most of the business representatives complained quite often about how this company changed so much. The managers are not experienced and do nothing to support any decisions that are made. Countless meetings with no success. Customers complained all the time about being billed repeatedly or how the route drivers changed. The company merged and never told their business clients. They hire a lot of people through temp agency for two or three weeks just to catch up and then they fire them.This company has great potential and just doesnt seem to care about it's employees or the businesses that support them financially.
bad,To much drama in the workplace and Favortism to certain employees and very cheap with pay rates.
bad,"This place is horrible and unprofessional. This office manager job has been on file for over a year now and every time you call to speak to human resource to find out more about the job and the pay, you can never speak to anyone it's always a voice mail and THEY NEVER return your phone call!!!"
bad,They don't care about their employees only their bottom line. You are not appreciate by management and they are very deceiving. They micromanage you to no end.
bad,"Diversity seemed to be the major area of focus, to a damaging degree.  My unqualified manager was clearly in the position for the wrong reason.  The HR Director had an obvious ""agenda"".  I made several complaints about things I deemed offensive and it never got resolved.  But, when the same complaints were made by a minority or a female, they got addressed.  He took no interest in getting involved in""trivial"" mattersregarding payroll, etc."
bad,"Cintas is short staffed everywhere and people do not respond to emails. They say they care about the customers, but if you do not respond to customers, how can you care about them?   The HR Director in the Denver area only cares about being liked and does not give respect to Leaders in their positions.  He treats leaders as if they are 2 and not only is degrading, he feels HR should be Switzerland and not get involved in areas that HR MUST get involved in, such as FMLA, attendance, etc.  I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,This job was so demanding and didn't pay me what I deserved for the work I put in and the extra hours I stayed and clocked out but still worked when my manager knew that I was doing that and he was okay with it. There was a lot of pressure at this position and no information on how to train for the position in the office other than a binder full of information that I made for the next employee.
bad,"The work day was repetitive, your learned as you went along.  There was 1 other person (Black) in the office, others worked in the warehouse. Management was the worse.  The hardest part of the job was sitting there everyday feeling like I didn't belong.  The pay rate was rediculous for the task required of you. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing 4:54 was coming every Monday through Friday."
bad,"Management will tell you whatever you want to hear even when it is not true. Told I would service a specific area, wound up covering an insanely large area. Driving 2 to 3 hours one way almost every day. Was told I would get raises and never did. Only offered to give me a raise when I put two weeks in. Trying to screw me over into paying an amount for class they made me take earlier now that i'm leaving. Overall terrible experience. All they care about is how much money you make. The whole safety thing is a front, will tell you to just get it done and billed."
bad,They don't care about they're employees. SSR does everything when absolutely no help. Management are snakes and will do unethical practices to employees and customers. Management use scare tactics with employees. The location I was at definitely needed a union! Trucks fo not have sufficient heat.
bad,This job is really repetitive makes the day seem like a 18 hr shift which would probably be better as this east ft worth location lacks in hourly pay you  can make more at a staffing agency for the hour.
bad,Sorry HR department and management this job has no future its a dead end. Pay's less then AMZ and the average pay in north fort worth is far better and better companies.
bad,I worked for Cintas for 4 months. If you ever called in sick you were treated like trash from all managers and supervisors about 5 to 10 people. Horrible work conditions. Will fire you  immediately if you call in sick. Will not take any calls after they fire you for no reason. Poor training from service managers ie. No proper training. Imagine you just had a new baby 1st baby and ur working as hard as you can but then ur fired on the spot for no real reason. HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK PERIOD.
bad,"Stay away from this company! They lie constantly. "
bad,"Management is inexperienced and will talk down to you. Management will have affairs with employees and promise them promotions that they never get. No privacy and will tell all of your personal business. Will advance only the people that tell on everyone else. No words or encouragement given. Just work and make your goals. If you speak what is on your mind, you are considered negative or hostile. Then they will create things to write you up. HR is messy and does not do her job. Never available to help. Only available for mess."
bad,"Was a trainee not to long ago, thought it would be a decent job but then at the end of the day i would hear a lot of the drivers grumbling  about this and that. Cintas sends the drivers out daily with product missing, mats soaked and smelling moldy. Customers would be angry about getting bad product or missing product and it would all be on the drivers shoulders. I would ask a driver who has been there along time for what it’s really like that management doesn’t tell you about. Surprised they haven’t lost more drivers. Guys seem great but seem very frustrated and doesn’t seem like a fine place to work"
bad,The linen location is a mess.  If the customers knew how short on product they run they would run to a competitor.  The location is constantly low or missing product with no plan in place to correct the situation.  It truly is a dumpster fire.
bad,"The culture there in all departments was very difficult. No cooperation between areas of office, sales or the floor.  Managers not concerned with treating staff with respect."
bad,"I worked in the Newmarket location.... The people that i worked with were great..(SSR, production staff)..... Office, sales, and Management staff are always better then you and look down on you... Pay is low.... Work load is higher..... Constantly changing your hrs making you work till 3- 4 am with no overnight shift premiums. When asked they tell your a Afternoon worker... Management is clueless and just care about money.. They try and make you think differently by giving BBQ's in the summer and fall while SSR's go out with missing stuff or have nothing on there truck at all. Loaders and Unloaders take the full brunt of everything missing on the truck's...... Yet we dont have the product to put on.... I could go on forever with this..... If you take pride in you work not a place for you... If you dont care then this place may be a fit for you..... Oh and forget about HR helping you with anything. There just there as a title thats all."
bad,Forced to drive unsafe trucks that are definitely not DOT approved. Forced to lie to customers and try to make them buy more product when the company could not get enough product as it was. Constant pay cuts from your salary if you had to credit your customers (which was always) managers that did not care about your safety or if you got paid what you were supposed to.
bad,The management when I first got there was awesome then it changed that's when a bunch of driver's quit the northeast plant is horrible only care about numbers
bad,Worst job. They tell you the shift and then make you work 13 hours a day and expect you to work Saturdays also on a exempt salary. You will work 60 plus hours a week and only get paid for 40. Hiring process was ridiculous. It took over three months. Training is awful at best.
bad,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Pay is ok but nothing to write home about. Tend to hire people only to have them quit or get fired in their 3 months. New employees Don't last and management is a joke. They like to brag how great the company is but by far the worst company I have ever worked for. Only thing keeping there is the steady shift in on. If you like to work with over 3 quarters of east indians who all like to be boss then this is your fit. Keep to yourself and keep you head done and pray they don't fire you in the 3 months after that the so called union is suppose to help you. Good luck. I hate it.
bad,"The amount of favoristm that is played within the company is incomparable to any other place I've ever worked at. Managers (especially production managers) don't appreciate people who work hard but give all the time of day to those who cause nothing but problems within the workplace. Managers like to force you or guilt you into doing tasks way out of your reach. They don't take injuries, illnesses, safety seriously. They talk to you in a very condescending way constantly belittling you. Some of the worse managers I have ever dealt with. A few surprise lunches here and there doesn't make up for what people put up with. In regards to office managers/workers, production worker can barely get a smile from them making us feel below their work status."
bad,"Accounts Receiveable "
bad,"Will not be given equal opportunities as they claim. Demand extra long days with very low pay and slim chance of advancement as there will always be a larger agenda at hand that is controlled and decided by very few and never in a professional and fair manner. Will not be paid or rewarded based on merit but they are quick to hold you accountable for anything they can if it benefits them and their ""planned"" budget and agenda. Way too many under qualified chiefs and never enough workers as turnover is rampant based on their low pay and high labor demands. Strongly suggest working for a company that actually cares about their employees and rewards you based on your performance and not according to their budget."
bad,I can’t speak for every Cintas but the one in Maumelle is not it. You can’t talk to anyone they expect you to do these work so they can walk off and do nothing something like slavery and the turnovers rate is so high we are low on staff every week and they won’t even hire temps.
bad,"Company is far too segmented. No one knows what the next man does. Communication is poor. Very little trust in the facility. Very little support in the facility. If you’re an individual contributor, that’s your best bet. Any steps up immediately disrupt the work life balance. All business needs will never be met. You’ll sacrifice your sanity if you try to stay for a check. Get your experience and go. Unprofessional behavior is tolerated from the top of the chain down. Lack of performance accountability. Performance standards are inconsistent. All that matters is that a body is in a chair. Ignore the job requirements on the job requisitions. Trust me, they don’t care if you have experience or not. Numerous policies in place that are pushed off and hardly followed. Many managers and supervisors have limited knowledge on how to formally support front line partners. Everyone is pretty much underpaid. Salary is a rip-off. You’ll have to work overtime to get the pay you deserve."
bad,"I worked for the fire protection side of the company for about 2 years."
bad,"Wasn’t a good experience at all. The way they’re treating people. Just constantly had me wondering if this was legal. "
bad,"Worked there for 2 years. No job advancement, unless you suck up to management. Poor management skills, lack of communication between you and supervisors. 1st shift supervisor always hid away with production manager. They play favorites and make work harder for you if you have some type of disability. Small raises even if you work your hardest. Everything is disorganized."
bad,"I've never been surrounded by more unorganized, dishonest, immoral group of office people in my life. Over worked and underpaid with impossible financial incentives. Communication is awful, there's never clarity on anything. 50% of the time you're trying to get ahold of costumers by just showing up at their door or calling/ harassing them because they don't want to use Cintas. You never know what you're getting paid for and why your checks are always different and inconsistent. They play both sides of the fence, whichever serves them necessary in the moment. Probably one of the most frustrating jobs I've ever had because if people knew what they were actually doing and did their jobs it would probably be a great job. But this location couldn't be further from that."
bad,Management didn't care about the employees only about how they look. Because of that they don't have a clue of what each customers needs are. Clothes are wet when they go to the customer. You don't get the days that you request off at all.
bad,"tries  to push legacy employees out"
bad,"Cintas in general is an average company to work for. It is what you make there. The work volume sometimes is  importunately balanced. Unfortunately, at the Location of Cintas that I worked for, there was poor management. The management in itself showed often that they were only concerned about the amount of money that the company earned from the routes and not about the route runners themselves. "
bad,Management will do anything to hit their monthly goals & will easily sabotage anybody who chooses not to participate in the office politics and drama. The General Manager is NOT to be trusted! It's unfortunate how poorly managed this Company is!
bad,"very unorganized company, bad time management, management is difficult to work and get along with. does not pay for overtime worked,doesn't care about employee safety during inclement winter weather, takes a few months to get new work boots"
bad,"Overworked, Underpaid, Underappreciated! Management could care less about you as long as you produce! Violates ADA just to benefit production. Atmosphere is very undesirable!"
bad,Poor management results in poor attitude amongst employees. Maybe once HR and the supervisors start looking out for the employees instead of their own pockets it will be a much better place to work. It’s also one of the worst places to work in the summer it does not have a controlled environment so it is very hot and all they will offer you is some sort of shammy to try and keep cool. I guess if you would like to lose weight it would be a good place to work. Stress + heat = Weight loss
bad,"no job security, horrible hours. management does not care about you and will target to fire employees that have any concerns or disagree with anything."
bad,The company takes advantage of its stuff. they work you like bulldozer with very little pay and benefits...............................................................
bad,"managers believe in themselves and will cut you out from under the table if they think they can get ahead.  also if you ever get hurt, might as well find another job because they will do everything to push you out."
bad,"Constantly hounded for more sales. Sales Managers are no help whatsoever..Encouraged to overfill first aid and safety cabinets...Well beyond customer's needs!! Accounts receivable inquiries are a nightmare to get followup answers..AR practices are way to aggressive! No four day workweeks here. Management will pressure you to work 6 days per week, so their bottom line looks better to upper management!"
bad,"Your typical day as an SSR consist of trying to get companies to buy first aid and safety supplies from you. Since your pay is largely  based on your sales after training. You may or may not make enough money to pay your bills."
bad,very un organized company with unrealistic expectations management is joke horrible place to work.  the training was horrible if any at all.  worst experience ever!!!!
bad,"Maybe it's just the location I worked at but the GM is very cheap, doesn't pay employees well at all, everyone in the plant feels like they work for a sweat shop, the only drivers that actually like the job are the favorites, the guys who cheat and lie to all of their customers to make management happy since all management cares about is numbers and how they look to corporate. I had numerous occasions where I found something unethical with a customer's bill or when I covered someone else's route and I brought it to managements attention and their response was that if the customer didn't know, dont change it. There are so many aspects within this job that are just horrible and you feel like you don't matter, you're just a number, I definitely would never recommend anyone to get a job here. Oh and they hate unions because that would mean they would actually have to pay you a fair wage for the amount of hours and stress you get working here. I'm not trying to bad mouth the company, this is just my honest experience and it might save someone from dealing with it. I quit over a year ago so maybe they have changed some but I doubt it."
bad,"At first it starts good, good pay and a welcoming atmosphere.  The training promised to me was supposedly ""world class"". I ended up having to teach it to myself as the Jr management was unable to answer any of my questions. There is no help here if you have trouble. After a few months you begin to see the dynamics of a dysfunctional management team. "
bad,Terrible management! Went to them several times about problems and there was never resolve to the issues. Co-workers wouldnt do their jobs standing around talking all day leaving others to have to do their work for them on a daily bases!
bad,"Hostile work environment, micromanagement, unprofessional, hated going there everyday. management is miserable and cusses a lot,"
bad,"This place is managed by a group that does nothing but reward their favorites. Even if by some chance the favorite does not get promoted, they turn into the same characters. "
bad,A burn and churn employee environment. Great way to get your feet wet in sales. Lots of training and hard work. I worked seven days a week and had no work and family balance.
bad,This job not just for anyone as there is a high turn over of employees. Was there for a little over a couple years and saw many good workers leave before their first year anniversary . Co-workers helped each other finding service locations and the best way to try to get job done.Got to service and know many customers who appreciated our hard work as they noticed we were undermanned.
bad,"I worked for this company for two years and was so glad when I left due to the backstabbing and gossip mongers.  Management fawns over fakes who are drug addicts, theives and alcoholics but great brown nosers.  The health benefits are great but the pay maxes out around 13.00 per hour unless you have a degree."
bad,If your not a driver or supervisor your not going to be paid well for your 10hr work days
bad,You do not have control over what type of accounts the sales department put on your route. They get paid regardless but if it is a small invoice you waste time servicing and not making money. Management is so busy they do not meet the needs of the service reps. Hand held computers do not work all the time which affects what you get paid
bad,entry level position with little advancement oppertunities
bad,"Former employee, wow, you can tell the truthful reviews"
bad,"After 5 years of working for Cintas, I was let go.... I've never had a write up or been in trouble there. I received many awards, letters and pat of the backs at Cintas. I'm not trying to brag but I was one of their best employees. I tore my rotator cuff lifting 400lb bins by myself and had to have surgery. One week after filing and winning my L&I claim for my shoulder, I was let go. Literally one week! I received my award letter on a Monday and the following Monday I was let go for for joking around in a friendly manner with another employee. Everyone and myself think it's because of the L&I claim I filed. It's absurd they did this to me. I am a married man and a father of three. One with special needs. They just got rid of me like I was nothing... It was so hurtful. They call them self family orianted but they are not. Beware of working there. Not a good place to be."
bad,Pick up load by 5:30am.
bad,"As a Service Manager, I was asked to lie to customers daily, increase prices, blame the Sales Service Reps (Drivers) for lack of product and upper management did nothing to repair the problems. The concerns were communicated through many meetings, but in the end the execution failed. The hours are long 5:30 am to sometimes 8 or 9 at night, and the work is hard. The uniforms/aprons/bar towels were greasy, dirty and in some cases covered in maggots, located in areas of businesses that were disgusting. The weather plays a big role working with frozen product and slippery conditions. As if that wasn't enough, the worst part of the whole job was the lack of appreciation for how hard everyone did work all the time quoting our Culture was the difference that made us superior to all others."
bad,"Worked at 319 for over a decade and these personal favors cost many good people with 15 and 20 years their jobs. Their motto is ""out with the old, in with the new"" All they want now is collage kids but since the new change we went from #1 to almost dead last in about a months timeThey have went with a cheaper soap that dosent get the clothes clean. The garments smell awful and they dont buy American..People are so scared to say anything about safety violations that always go on for fear of losing their job.Never see lock out tag out,people on conveyor,people going in back without a key, management working on steam tunnel or conveyors or any machine without them being authorized personnel themselves and working on it with a hammer(no lock out tag out)They turn the tunnel full blast instead of what the company set.Absolutely no drug testing is being done on people who need it.We were told if the GM says Morning to you, you better say it back with a smile and mean it or you shouldnt be working there.The HR cannot even do the job unless it makes her look good or for ""her people"" that she protects.Have asked several times for assistance and was not helped adequately on any.MANY are looking for new employment before they get fired.They can and will fire you without a verbal, written, then final.This can go on and on.There is not any job security here."
bad,"I worked for this company for over 7 years and they go thru managers like underware. No one communicates with one another, polices are made up and not implied. I was in the top ten percent out of 40 and was fired just weeks before I would have earned my third week of paid vacation. I know they fired me because I was earning too much money and they hired someone at half the pay to replace me, and to top it all off they are fighting me on my unemployment. Corporate america at its worst!!!"
bad,"Absolute worst company to work for.  The Halifax branch is the most micro managed environment you could ever dream of.  Hard, dirty work changing maggoty bar towels and soaking wet mats."
bad,I was so happy to be  out of the company the environment  is very demanding  to cheat the customer  they want to charge for products  the had returned and were charged
bad,There is alot of funny business that goes on behind the scenes. If your the golden child then your in a great spot. Overall lots of turnover! Stay away at all costs!!
bad,"Nepotism favoritism racism everything but professionalism."
bad,Upper management and HR are horrible.  If your not in the click with Plant manager and HR expect your write ups. Plant manager doesn't know anything how to run the plant.  Got hired because GM and HR are friends.  HR never there and is the biggest two face there is! If they don't like you they look for ways to get you out. I know I've been in the meetings with them. Horrible people.  GM never says anything positive to the supervisors or partners.
bad,"The company is too big for its own good. Management doesn’t know how to manage, processes are a mess because there aren’t any solid ones in place, the company is all about numbers and revenue, but not the actual customer, or their true experience. They care about their bottom line and getting money in their pockets, not the customer or the partners of the company. There are people too wrapped up in the surface level - like showing face on social media and drumming this company up to be grandiose and wonderful, when in actuality it’s a terrible company behind the scenes. Watch out if you decide to consider! It’s not always greener on the other side. This is a deal company with no true morales and filled with seething money grubbing low life’s. Be ware!!"
bad,Manager sucks at his job. Worked me everyday non stop working no breaks. Every employee including the boss talks behind your back. Never satisfied. Just HORRIBLE.
bad,"Horrible Company to work for, Hours were never consistent, pay was too little for the amount of work you did. Would always promise to hire more people to help, but the interview process was so long (4 interviews/Try out day) It made it difficult to bring people in."
bad,Spent a third of my life at Cintas. Saw a lot of the “old timers” leave and the place go down hill real quick. Business formal 100% of the time. No bonus unless you are a GM. Outdated office equipment that slows everyone down. Annual review process is a joke and the raise is the punchline. They are Fortune 500 because they do not put any money back into the business or their partners. One thing I will miss are birthday holidays.
bad,"No loyalty"
bad,"12hrs. I taught myself after 19 years.management the worst in the company history. the worst morale I have ever seen,no one happy!!!the job is great as long you are with your customers the best part of the job was the customers you have no backup with management!!!!!!!"
bad,"It was a terrible job they lied about my job,pay and hours. When I worked there they had illegal immigrants working there and when the immigration was going to show up they all disappeared and never saw them again"
bad,"This place THRIVES on drama and it's all coming from older women and the people working in HR. You are overworked, underpaid and highly under appreciated."
bad,"Bedford Park Location-Customer Service/Order Fulfillment Depts. Management was horrible. Harassment, disrespect and disregard...and corporate does nothing about it. No equal opportunity work/life balance. No Sick Days. If you get sick or child gets sick they expect you to use your Vacation Days for sick days as well. No personal days. All PTO days off must be utilized for sick, personal and vacation. Totally divided and unfair work environment. The director is the only man in the depts and is ruled by bitter women."
bad,Company is a joke. Treat employees like it's a rookie army camp. Work you like a dog and no recognition what so ever. Only thing good there is the insurance and they have a good profit share program.
bad,"Since Cintas acquired us, it's been quite the disaster. All talented employees left for better jobs. Only the ones who couldn't find a job are still here . I was demoted as soon Cintas took over  so they can save money. Management extremely poor and HR incompetent and dishonest...spying on us all the time."
bad,"The Ottawa branch is very male dominated and chauvinistic enviroment.  If you don't fit their click, then will do whatever they can to get rid of you.  This has happened 4 times so far.  The HR representative does not follow the employement standards guidelines and doesn't really care about the employees.  Top management are all old army vetrens which is great, but it leads to a male dominated egotistical enviroment.   They don't know how to do business and treat their employees very poorly especially the Ottawa branch.  If you really need a job, and you have exhaused all other options including moving to a different country, then this company is where you want to be.  If not, be for warned, if they don't like you, they will get rid of you with support from their HR."
bad,Not good people the company is progressing but management is very discriminative. Pretty much if you're of color with any hair on your or face or head they will not accept you not saying that its something that happened to me but I've seen it happen with my own 2 eyes. Management are living like they're slave masters and I think its time for a revolution.. Everyone deserves a fair chance but when you come to think about some companies are just a joke and waste of time like this one
bad,"Production supervisors are something to laugh at. 3rd shift supervisor is a snitch for the plant manager. He likes to keep everything a secret (ie) if he's taking a day off, he won't tell you. 2nd shift supervisor doesn't know if he's coming or going. The plant manager has no idea what's going on. He's so negative and thinks he knows everything but, he's a millennial so theres that. HR has to much power and think she's in control of everyrhing. 1st shift supervisor is the best one. He knows what to do and what is going on.  But he only covers his own a**.  I was there for 3 years. I've seen a lot of people come and go. Leaving that place was the best thing that could've happen to me. I was fired for doing my job also. I was employed there before the plant manager, 2nd, 3rd shift supervisors. Me and the 1st shift supervisor started there around the same time."
bad,Worst place ever to work unless you have buddies that work there and they can get you up the ladder regardless of what you do to disrespect other people especially women. Management is horrible trust me steer clear of this company.
bad,The management and overall company is horrific to put it mildly.  The overall leadership cares nothing about the employees like they claim to.  This company’s focus is a complete disaster.
bad,you don't get the right training the people are nasty and mean and management is the worst if they like you you are fine but if you stand up for yourself they will get rid of you those male  management have a problem with strong women the worst place i ever worked!
bad,They over work you for such little pay. It's a lot of favoritism at my location and the management are very unfair to the women. If you work on an incentive make sure you got top dollar in order to get a raise. They also sell you a dream during the interview and when you work it's a totally different story.
bad,"Cintas is focused on the bottom line only.  They state they state they are working for their partners and customers satisfaction, which is not true.  The office environment is stiff and everyone is walking on eggshells.  The company is is very far behind the modern workplace environment as well as technology."
bad,They have their favorite so if you was not a favorite you got look down on or looked over only the people that the supervisor liked would be able to do things and not get points or written up
bad,"Don’t waste your time here. Over the past few years they have changed into a company that doesn’t look at your skill set or merits, they only promote/hire based upon what they call “diversity and inclusion”"
bad,"This company has major issues, use to be alright but now that the managers have no real world experience and come straight from college through their “trainee” programs it’s a freaking joke. First Aid Office out of Austin is a complete joke no one knows what they are doing and people are leaving as fast as they can. don’t even attempt this place so much better out there"
bad,"I worked at a branch that was a company called GK. Once cintas bought that company the branch quickly changed from employees first to managements numbers first. "
bad,"I don't even know where to start. This company sucks!!! "
bad,"My first year here was good,but I was soon to pick up that it’s very political and Based on favoritism. They promise you advancement but never happens."
bad,"A typical day at work was to hit the ground running, and make sure you sell something. Help was always available through upper management, and the overall environment was like family."
bad,In 14 months we went through 3 managers and 9 engineers.  All meetings but no one to do the work. The sig sigma way or nothing else.  Does not work with IT
bad,Bad Management leads to hostile workplace. Be warned. People like to look the other way on some people and then nitpick on others. People are treated differently. People are also allowed to threaten coworkers without any consequences even though the handbook says personal threats will not be tolerated.
bad,Was a great place to work but has changed drastically after the acquisition of G&K Services. The desire for profit and growth has crippled the quality of products and services which made Cintas an industry leader.
bad,"I would start of by saying I like what I did in cintas. I think my job was more like a  Active  Position the only sad part about cintas is all the management that they have isn’t really good.my biggest challenge in cintas was me being by myself as a high bay person on the night when 1 shift people had at leas  2,3 people work"
bad,"Management is disrespected and unprofessional on all levels, a very stressful place to work where they make up the rules as they go along with each rule designed to meet their own agenda which is usually personal. I would prefer to be homeless on the street than work for a company like this."
bad,Not productive employees are messy managers are too. Machines always breaking causing lack of work. No heat / no ac. Building old and dirty. That’s all
bad,To much work with not enough people. Expects to much for little to no pay. Also get lied to by upper management. The people hat work there are easy to get a long with but it seems to be a miserable culture  to work for not many people enjoy working for this specific location.
bad,"It was very stressful, and you are told before accepting the job that it is very little over time, but then once you accept the job they ask you to work overtime everyday, and even on Saturdays. This job seemed very color segregated. You only get a 10 minute break after working 3 hours, then you must work almost 4 before you get a lunch. no breaks, and is almost impossible to advance."
bad,"This place is nuts! For it being a big company you would think the pay is good. Nope $11 an hr for all position for warehouse worker. Are you serious!!!"
bad,"Cintas the only issue is you work way to many hours and not get Pay overtime,I used to work more than 60 hours on weekly basis, I was yes to many hours on a weekly basis."
bad,"I was on medical leave for spinal fusion surgery. I called in every week. Told HR several times I want to come back to work. I thought I was a valued employee. Never late, never sick, was hired to clean up what bad employees had done to territory. I was told I was now a burden to the company. HR told me hope you feel better. Feel free to apply to any position. I was actually promised a promotion while I was on leave."
bad,"Long story short..."
bad,Management does not care about employees just the numbers. Management will not let you move around in the company. Be careful about what job you choose because you will be stuck there. The only way to get anything accomplished is by writing corporate. It's a shame how high the turnover rate is at this place. Also you're supposed to get employee appreciation day every month..you won't.
bad,"Gadsden,Al plant definitely needs improvement!!! Management is horrible about safety, and employee concerns. Nothing is ever addressed or fixed. An advancement in this plant is not a true advancement Pay wise.. pay is not worth the job duties. Production pay is never accurate and NO ONE in this plant can tell you how to accurately calculate your pay! Hard work and attention to safety is never acknowledged! I would NOT recommend working in this plant. Cintas company as whole I'm hoping is not as bad as this particular plant, or Southeast region."
bad,"This company is a pipe dream promising piece of work."
bad,"Cintas treats you like you're a child. Typical day at work consists of ""Homeroom"" before you start your shift. Then after getting your announcements and getting told to work faster and harder to meet unrealistic deadlines while being understaffed, you then start your work for the day after some stretching. Then your first 15minute break comes around, that is if you can afford to take it, and then you continue working. If a manager hasn't come by your workstation by first break to tell you you're not moving fast enough or to pick up the pace, then you're lucky. Second break rolls around and you can finally go to the bathroom or grab a drink because you're so parched from running around like a chicken with your head cut off and it feels like you're in an oven. The co workers are just as miserable as you, except the minorities. This is in no way a racist review. The only people that aren't treated unwell are the minorities and they can do whatever they want because they're a tax write-off. Cintas expects you to go above and beyond and they don't pay you for it, or at least what they should pay you for it.You have employees that have been working there for 10-15+ years that aren't even making what the new hires start out at. 9-10.50 an hour starting out, depending on the position and shift, but the pay should be double for what they expect and push out of you."
bad,if you wont to be used and toss out like trash work for this company they care about nothing and are raciest if your not a yes man they will do ever trick in the book to put you down
bad,"This company has the potential to be great, but I personally believe that the management is the only thing holding this company back from achieving it's full potential."
bad,"Management is horrible one sided make you work like a dog if your a young man but isn't willing to recognize or reward good work ethics only worried about customer more than ""partners"" they have no culture but try to shove their own corporate bible down your throat nothing to advance to lots of drama no hr to talk to or resolve problems only two fifteen minutes breaks for an 8 hour shift"
bad,"What a joke of a place"
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had! STAY AWAY. Upper management was horrible, HR was worse, and the way they treat their customers is terrible. Huge price increases to customers that are already over charged. The customers that expressed concerns or were shopping for around for a better price were hit with thousands and thousands of dollars in fines/penalties, then sent to collections. Cintas would site breach of ""agreement,"" (they would be upset with employees who called it what it really is a CONTRACT!!!!) "
bad,Cintas  issues credit memos when Customers fail to pay. It's a joke that they take money away from you. That was the worst part of the job. Freedom was great..but again the credit memos sucked. Management wanted those numbers by any means necessary. ...
bad,There are some great people working there that have been there for many years. The new style of management was not working well with the older employees. Working a rotating shift was also very hard changing from days to nights every four days.
bad,Too hot in the summer and really cold in winter. Seems like they get rid of you after you reach a certain pay rate/ number of years. Team leaders dont communicate.
bad,"They don't and I mean""DON'T"" practice safety. Only when the higher ups from HQ are there. Management don't know DOT/DMV rules & regulations of vehicle repairs and drivers safety. Have to fight with them everyday on fixing trucks.They don't give performance reviews for a raise. All of the drivers that are their longer then 2-3 years haven't seen a Review. Meetings are worthless. you have CDL guys that don't know Rules & Regulations of  driving a vehicle.If you speak up at a meeting the Operation manager will be gunning for you."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. I worked at a similar industry for 14 years and move to this company.  This was the largest mistake of my life. They may call their employees partners, however they do not care about their employees well-being at all."
bad,"I grew professionally with Cintas. However most of my growth was due to self motivation, promised training rarely materialized. "
bad,Absolute terrible place to work. Treat people like slaves and expect you to be superman. Management from the top to bottom are unprofessional and if your not putting money in their pocket they will send you packing. Great coworkers and office staff.  All in all the worst work experience I have ever had. Stay away from Cintas!
bad,You could start at any time of the day.  One day could be 6am the next day could be 6pm and 8am the next.  I did learn a lot about the job I was doing but that was it.  They never believe anything you tell them.  I worked with Drug addicts and nobody cared that they were high on the job.  The hardest part was coming to work everyday and dealing with all there stupidity.
bad,"Cintas acts like they care about their partners but they don't your just another number to them, oh and don't get hurt or file a complaint your are almost sure to be let go. The pay was horrible considering the hours you put in for this bum company, and management..I could write a book on how horrible it is"
bad,SSR / FS.
bad,Poor management Revolving door. Long hours little pay. Google them and see how many class action suits are against them
bad,"If you do not have a degree, & are under 30, they do not want you."
bad,management has no feeling towards employees only looking for there identiify. pay no attention to facts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I've never worked for a company that was more worried about ""counting beans"" every day than Cintas. They worry SO much about it that the benefit of their customers falls way down the priority list. There are so many issues with the way things were managed at the location I was in that I can't even begin to list them without sounding like I'm just ""piling on"" and that doesn't do anyone any good. Suffice to say Cintas is only worried about Their own entity itself and all other considerations or merely secondary at best. VERY poorly run fire division,... that is if you'd like to keep happy customers for later on anyway,..."
bad,"Was AP team lead did not give me supervisor role due to ""not enough"" experience. Hires outside of Cintas a person that had ZERO AP experience! Communication was awful and when I reported this to HR there was retaliation against me.  I had zero discplince or write ups, no issues on my review expect for communication with the ""millennials"" that I needed to put ""white gloves"" on with them.  New supervisor wdid not like me. Found a way to get rid of me"
bad,"A very cut throat culture, people will go to management behind your back about anything, thinking it will somehow advance their careers. A very stressful and toxic work environment. No overtime and raises are laughable because management is only concerned about their end of fiscal year bonuses! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place."
bad,They say there’s a special brother/sisterhood about cintas in gilroy but that’s a lie !!!! They will  stick you with anyone who “needs help” the females there are all very insecure of themselves 10 hour work day but you must sit there or put chemicals away if you come back early . stay away from this place if you value yourself as a person . Not the rental company to work for or with
bad,"The managers think that that plant is theirs, they treat you badly, if you have any problem Human Resources is always on the side of the managers, you can never give an opinion about the work because the manager thinks what you don't want is to work , The only good thing that and have the benefits after that NOTHING MORE, you do not have the opportunity ,if you are a friend of the general manager or you are a relative of any of them. That company is a game, they play"
bad,Willing to let long time partners go because they refuse to mold to their corrupted way. They are unfair and play favoritism. Strict on the partners that want fairness. Manager allow drug and alcohol use during work hours for their pets.
bad,"Cintas in other locations may be a great place to work so I’m not speaking on the entire company when I say these things, but location 235 charleston, SC has one of the most narcissistic people as a plant manager I have ever met in my life. Safety is a big deal at Cintas but this guy only wants you to hydrate during his times. I’ve seen him use terms like sugar to “nothing” to tell other employees why a guy isn’t worth moving to a different department, he shows favoritism towards a certain race, he believes he is god in that place and this is an issue he brought with him from his Baltimore location so it’s well documented. If you need a job for now take it but be looking while your there, because unless your in sales you will be under paid and treated like trash if u work for this guy. You meet some really fun people at Cintas but the management and pay at 235 charleston are the reasons 8 partners have left in a month. It may be better for you but it’s not pleasant dealing with this guy on a daily basis, you are not appreciated for your work at all."
bad,"Management was a absolute mess, no proper training, no support at all just a terrible experience and I highly recommend not working for this company period."
bad,"No ethics. Supervisors tell your reports of wasted time and cheating the clock and cheating on production to the person that was reported and then tell who reported it."
bad,Cintas is a job nothing more. Managers try to sell you on the job. That should be your first clue. HR is nice but turnover is higher than it should be. Not for everyone.
bad,"Do not apply here unless you a butt kisser.  Very poor management.  always out of supplies needed to perform job. Show favoritism to foreigners, not americans."
bad,I just started at Cintas in the Accounts Receivable area. The training is horrible the people are negative. They all hate their jobs and complain constantly.
bad,"All ways shorthanded, everyone they hire have no drive or work ethic. Management doesn't communicate. They allow employees who complain about everything to get what they want over hardworking, positive workers."
bad,"Management and higher ups are wanting to see revenue go up but the pay is bad for a multimillion dollar company. Huntsville, al management is Terrible"
bad,I'm embarrassed to say that I ever worked for Cintas.  They are crooked and slimy.  It's all about money with Cintas.  They want to screw people over as badly as they can and enjoy it when they ruin small businesses.  Awful from the top down.  They breed a weasel culture.
bad,"I would not recommend this company. There’s major lack of communication. The culture of management is a buddy/buddy system, if you’re a part of the click you just pass the buck & wait for someone to pick up the slack."
bad,"If you like doing 20 cold calls a day, this is for you. If you like incompetent management, this is for you. If you like having no direction, or support, this is for you. Avoid."
bad,"This would be a great place to work if they get their management team together, and communicate with each other. I would be told five different things before the actual truth would come out."
bad,The management at the company now is only concern about themselves and as soon as something goes wrong everyone but them are the reason. They treat employees especially long term employees not good. They will get rid of a long term employee quickly (with the new management) Their only concern now is getting yes men in place.
bad,Pushed to work every weekend. More than one person can schedule you. Because of this you were doing good to get a full 4 hours of sleep at night before you had to be on the road again. Terrible management. They don’t care that you work 60+ hours in a salary position. You can’t get approved to take time off to go to the doctor. Just terrible all around.
bad,"I do not think that Cintas is very structurally sound. As a management trainee, I was ""thrown to the wolves"" on numerous occasions with little to no support. During the interview process, I was told that I'd receive as much support as possible but I do not believe this was the case. As for the management trainee program, I was pulled during rotations to fill a ""company need"", which was not helpful in my career development."
bad,"Cintas only cares about money. They do not treat their employees fairly. If you are not a yes man you will not go far in the company. If you are a top performer and reach your goal every quarter you will receive a bonus but not a promotion unless you are a favorite. The company has so much potential but until they actually implement there company's mission and culture they will continue to have a huge turn around. They lost several great employees by promoting people that were less qualified for the position. They rob their customers by continuously increasing their prices and locking them in a 5 year contract. Stay away!!!! The company will steal your spirit and break you emotionally, physically and mentally."
bad,"The company is made to look like it cares about it's employees. Like: you are ""asked"" to take breaks but there is too much work that you have no time. Too much pressure at work."
bad,"Cintas Madison has very laxed upper management and human resource personnel. I went to my tryout date 2 months ago and still have not been paid. I was in formed that the information had not been sent in. There is a lack of culture, upper management is snotty and the ladies who run the front have less than satisfactory communication skills. Try your luck somewhere else! I did. The confusion is not worth the stinky job!"
bad,Management will forge numbers to seem more profitable and productive. They will also do the same if they want to get rid of you. Management will lie directly to your face and say they will do anything to help you out but once u need them they wont help. Worst job ever.
bad,"I don't know where to start. After 10 years i am now looking for a job. The management is a joke. They make empty promises to push you to work harder."
bad,Cintas as a whole is a great company to work for. They have many issues with management that need to be taken care of. The work environment is not favorable.
bad,"I worked at cintas for a number of years (13). On the surface it seems like a good place to work. the longer you work there the more of the truth you see. All cintas cares about are its shareholders (money). The pay plan was revised four times while i was there and each time the employees and customers got screwed while the company made more money. I witnessed multiple managers come and go which gave me zero incentive to move up. It seemed they were always finding ways to have you do more work for the same amount of money or the same amount of work for less money. The goals were unrealistic and they were always raising them. There is only so much a person can do and the more you give the more they want. I did receive some decent training and for a person with no college degree I was paid OK. I used the experience from cintas to get a better job. If you are a current employee, trust me, there are better places to work. If you are thinking about working there, go for it, just have a back-up plan when the place makes you crazy or fires you. They like to hire young naive people that are easy to manipulate. Don't listen to what they SAY, but watch what they DO! Soon you will see the truth too."
bad,"I worked for cintas for a number of years (13). At first it seems like a good place to work. Over time you come to realize that all they care about are shareholders (money). The management would find sneaky ways to have you do more work for the same amount of compensation or the same amount of work for less compensation. While i was there they revised the pay plan 4 different times. Each time the employees and customers got screwed while the company made more money. I had multiple different managers, the place was a revolving door. It gave me zero incentive to move up watching manager after manager be get let go or move on. The goals were unrealistic and kept going up year after year. A person can only do so much and the more you give the more they want. I did receive some good training which I used to get a better job. Cintas may be good for you if you need a short term job to pay the bills while looking for something better. They like to hire young and naive people they can easily manipulate.  I was there long enough to realize the truth of things and then i moved on. Join at your own risk, you have been warned!"
bad,So many audits for maintenance staff unable to keep up with repairs and pms when have aduits every 4 months .  Then constanly dogged for down equipment when parts or on order. Never allowed to have more 40 hoirs for the week. If you have more than 40. You get sent home so you wont have ot.
bad,"Cintas is a great company, but continues to have issues with management. Management is number one reason for high turnaround rate. Cintas needs to focus on hiring better management and training management better."
bad,The GM was a terrible leader and a hot head and the company continued to be little people. covering up worker comp claims and the HR Lady was a snake in the ground. so glad to have that career behind me!!
bad,You are overworked and have no time for youd family they do not care about family health emergencies and management only cares about themselves. Working 6 days a week every week is part of what makes it so stressful to work there
bad,"This is NOT a company that you want to invest any of your time in. It takes a year to earn 1 week of vacation. Most companies start you with at least 2 weeks of vacation. The culture is not enjoyable, your opinion is not valued and job advancement is for the chosen few. I would highly recommend looking for another company."
bad,Bad company to work for. Get your hopes up just to let you down. Hardly let anybody advance up in the company. I traveled from Ohio to California and was promised a job just to get there and be denied.
bad,"Management is a joke. The job itself isn't bad, but then you have to deal with the morons when you get back from a long days work. They make your life miserable. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"This is a company where you are considered nothing more than a number. You will not be valued here. Don't expect a whole lot out of this company. If you are a good worker who takes pride in their work, you won't do so well in a place like this. It doesn't matter to them...all Cintas is concerned about is ""bottom line results""...they are not concerned about you as an individual or employee...the ONLY thing that matters in this company is if you are making them money. If you don't expect much, you will probably be ok. Have to play ball, or they will get rid of you.  Making the wrong comment from Cincinnati management can get you fired."
bad,Check truck for maintenance. Then go start your route with customers. Customers are the real reason employees stay. Management is horrible and not dependentable. I wouldn't recommend this workplace to anyone.
bad,The mobile branch has unfair supervisors who pick favorites. No help from route mangers(kp)and the salesman do not work well with route drivers
bad,"I worked there nearly 5 years and I wouldn't recommend working there.  The raises per year are not enough to buy a gallon of gas.  You will not get any bonuses or commission.  You will be expected to work the hardest in the company and get nothing for it.  You will watch everyone around you do what they like and not be held accountable for anything and you will have to walk a tight rope and not sneeze wrong.  The management all sticks together and will hang you out to dry any chance they can.  The manager is on a power trip and will let you do your job as long as you stay in good graces with her you get anything you want.  If you don't, you will pay the price.  You can't change positions in the office unless she feels you are worthy.  "
bad,"A typical day would be waking up around 4 am and drive to Harrisburg/ Lancaster pa area to service /sell fire protection. A in service i would have to make sure there equipment was up to date and would work incase of a fire , if it wasn't i would have to replace the damaged product or sell them a new one"
bad,If you are young and looking for a job that you can stay with and grow and has advancement this is not the job for you. if you are looking for a job with 40 hours a week with benifits its good for that.if you work in the clean room there is a lot to fold and never enough people to fold it.
bad,"Cinta's had a great work history and back story that is why I took this job. Only one person In management is still there, and I'm now the longest consecutive ssr After 3 yrs! All the new management they have hired has really talked a big game and then had NO follow through unless you kiss it. St louis facility Is horrid and we cant get our logo Mats back or the right items we order In the first place. The turnover is terrible! And now our office manager and service manager are married, so you cant even complain. Oh yeah my pay also went down three consecutive years due to new pay plans, Cinta's is the lowest paid in the industry So i would check with Aramark or Clean first they are hiring 2!"
bad,Went on a interview.at had to talk to six different people it took about three hours..they don't pay good at all unless u speak spanish..and don't really care how much experienceu have they pay the same.. they don't have any sick days off.and no vacation days until after a year..after six interviews the same day they say we will call u back..they don't have the guts to call u back in person.they send u a  e mail saying u weren't. Selected for the position..that was actually a good thing because I wouldent have gotten a better job the next day..just saying do not waste your time applying there are going to a interview..they tell u what a good company they are..there a bunch of lyers..
bad,"If your a SSR and have a facilty service route youll have about 35 stops a day.   Youl have to deal with hundres to thousnds of dirty, soiled, smelly, wet, magget infested terry towels.   They want you to sell sell sell.   I knew a guy who was the SSR of the year and they still wouldnt give him a raise.  Bottom line is that there out for there bottom line!"
bad,"Great benefits and insurance but that is about it.  Always finding a way to pay the employee less money.  Lots of changes and never for the better.  I am sure it is like other companies, but more work and less pay."
bad,"They make new rule everyday. Its a dirty job and its not climate control at all. Its dusty and it hard to work with the employee there, no team work at all."
bad,"Its like being in a lottery,you have to compete against fellow employees unless you are in the clique with management,they want 100% work,no mistakes with little pay.One day they praise your work,the next day they criticise,if you are temp they will use you to there advantage,in closing temps beware...."
bad,Stay away!!! Worked there for a year never had any problems enjoyed my coworkers and customers then i ACCIDENTALLY passed a weigh station and get fired for it. I never got a written warning like policy stated and i also didnt even get to explain myself when corporate came to our shop...i cant stress it enough STAY AWAY!! Im glad i got out when i did because our manager got busted when 10+ trucks failed inspection
bad,"Cintas would do anything to protect their investment and Company even if it acquires to get rid of any old or new employees. They may seem like they’re family in the beginning or even throughout, but they will fire you anytime no matter what or how much you do for them. If you’re looking for a job that will always support you and reliable for employment then this isn’t it. They say two different things in the interview and months into work base on finish time and pay. Not good management or problem solving in Cintas Company."
bad,"Manage and grow customer accounts through upselling and cross-selling additional products and services. "
bad,"One of the worst companies I’ve ever worked for, you get no help from management, and there are 0 opportunities in advancement in the company. You never have all of the items you need to complete your job and if there is an issue with an account, good luck having a manager fix it."
bad,Long hours unorganized clothes not organized by route loading of truck horrible they want you to up sell constantly to customers lot of pressure to sell sell sell 4 day work week but you work 12/14 hours a day terrible job
bad,"Management and Hr are messy you have a Manager who slept with an employee and promised advancement within the company. A Manager  Who destroyed the office morals by keeping up mess And recruiting minions to snitch for job advancement when she left two were actually made supervisors!"
bad,Management blows and they play favoritism. I don't know if it was because I was a black woman in a different position but my work was always undermined. Stiches were everywhere. When something was wrong even with me showing proof they didn't believe me. From the outside looking in I believed everyone was friendly but boy was I wrong. Watch your back. You have no friend. And to top it off my boss was telling my personal business to other employees whom I didn't even know. Yes my BOSS. He wasn't reprimanded. Still upset about that but I got a better job so I'm happy
bad,The only opportunities for advancing will come if you suck up to management. Many inappropriate relationships between managers and team members. Shady sales profits.
bad,"Have run into several employees with mental illness, when they forget to take their medication, look out , the yelling and screaming begins . Not a good work environment for professionals."
bad,"I loved the people I worked with however my GM was clearly not ready for the position which led to a lot of turnover."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend working at this place the pay is low for amount work they want you to do also be prepared for the favoritism and bad management lack of communication.
bad,Very unorganized location. I don’t believe the company itself is represented well by this location. They don’t pay well for the stress and task they want you to take on. They hire you for one thing but expects you to do more than job responsibilities with no change in pay because of “title.”
bad,"The only good thing about Cintas is the Health Insurance.   Bad turnover, Bad Management a lot of favoritism.   Management has no clue what they are doing they get rid of all the good employees."
bad,"It’s a warehouse job. Needless to say I was on my feet for my entire 10 hour shift. We were give two 10 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch during that whole time. You went to the bathroom? That’s “down time” you don’t get paid for that. You went to get a drink because it’s extremely hot and taxing work? Down time. You’re unwrapping a piece of clothing? That’s down time. You better be sure you kept track of how many minutes you spent doing each because you will get in trouble if you don’t and god forbid they tell you that during training. "
bad,Management is controlling and toxic. Borderline abusive. No true appreciation to work as a team but more so destroy a team. Work life balance suffers as a result. Not recommended to work here and waste precious time.
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,Terrible racist location they only wanna promote you if you get on your knees and kiss there but your hard work means nothing they abuse it and you way to many politics
bad,"The company is a scam. They increase prices and add things on bill without telling anyone. They train workers to lie to get people to sign contracts and deal with it later but they preach having a trust relationship with the customer. Avoid working here in new york!!!!!!!!!!!! I hear other locations things run the right way but in new york it isnt. It's all about management bonuses, even if it means taking away your bonus. They also look into hiring people that arent capable of the next level so these people dont leave and cant find another job to pay more so they deal with everything they will put them through."
bad,The goals are unrealistic.  You have to wear a stuffy suit every day.  Management provides no training or path to success. Customer satisfaction is the lowest I have ever experienced.
bad,A typical day at Cintas as a Deep Clean Specialist consisted of going business to business. The managers will tell you one thing and then expect another. No training at all! On my 3rd day I was thrown out into the field not knowing anything. I was never properly trained the whole time I was there. My manager was located in Texas so I never had any direction.
bad,"No reason to review cintas it is not a place i would recomend to work "
bad,They lied in the interview do not work here its not a job to grow with they lied about everything in the interview run run run  dont work here at all.
bad,Management changed constantly people in production treated poorly. Very high turnover. Hot and demanding work load constant hour changes. Very poor employee appreciation.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this toxic job. If you want to be treated like garbage every day and yelled at. Than this is the job for you. The managers treat you like dirt if you on the road or in the plant. You don’t have friends their. They are all liars. Don’t work here. Run!!!
bad,"You will work 10 to 12 hours each day. You are required to sale company products to existing customers on a route and meet a quota each quarter to make your money."
bad,Management is incompetent and screws over customers constantly. Supervisor sets an awful standard as he tries to cut corners any chance he gets. SSR’s are heavily leaned on to load and unload own trucks and GM expects SSR’s to act as AR by demanding payment from customers 30 days or more behind on invoices.
bad,"Come in first thing floor meeting, then get to the calls that was delinquent, and then post payment by ach or credit cards that have come in sometimes even cash.  Then filing all payments and invoices that was sent in by mail or by drivers."
bad,"They take advantage of you and promote if your sucking up to management, they make you do other people’s work! Place should be in a union! I force people to join the union for this place, they will tell you straight up we can’t give you a promotion because your to good at your job plus we need to find someone for your position that’s to much work! Who says that!! No communication with one another, they will tell you the last min before your weekend is planned out that there’s overtime if you want it when they know this in advanced!"
bad,When I started here it was about the customer and the partner now it's about profit and the share holder! I couldn't wait to get out of there. Two many managers in my time there
bad,"High turn over rate! Quality has taken a big hit, the gm has even said they rather have a partner focus more on their number than the quality of the garment that they are sending through the system. Management is horrible. They don't care how you obtain your production number as long as it looks good on paper in the end. They know people cheat by double swiping a garment on the counter but nothing is done about it. They sweep major issues such as harassment complaints(physical violence to be specific) under the rug. Some supervisors lack the ability to properly communicate with employees. The training process for a plant partner needs a complete revamp.  Reviews and raises are a joke. On the bright side most co workers are friendly."
bad,This company is not for everyone. It is designed for profits only and doesn't consider building customer relationships. The brief time there was very unstable with management and employee personnel and the company philosophy didn't match my moral obligations. I was instructed to manipulate customer invoices and contracts for the company to protect revenue.
bad,If your single or if your married and hate your spouse Cintas is the right place for you. The culture at Cintas breeds ill will and contempt for the job and the management team. The working conditions are that of a 3rd world sweat shop with no air conditioning or heating to help stem the winter and summer months. Inside the plant it reminded me of the arid climate of Afghanistan all year round while outside loading trucks you either passed out from heat exhaustion or froze to death depending on the time of year. My advice....STAY AWAY!!!
bad,I work with a lot of great people but our management is out of touch about the different aspects of our job.
bad,"this company tries very hard to be cutting edge and the leader in its market, they fail by not listening to their employees who are face to face with the customers that drive their numbers. management likes to lead from behind their desks. this is a unprofessional company masquerading as a professional one"
bad,"Typical day, report to work at 7:30 am, see what mess some unauthorized person left for you, do a quick inventory to see if anything is stolen, set up to pick orders. Somewhere around 9am when purchasing agent decides to print out your picking orders you can try to make up the last two hours wasted waiting (can't complain about it agent is buddies with plant manager.). Sign in, and unload  any FedEx, UPS, or bulk freight that arrives all throughout the day, restock the incoming items, allocate special orders to routes. loud van to meet outreach routes twice a week. For those deliveries report to warehouse 6am meet drivers by 7:30am 75mile away, transfer load, back to office, check inventory to see if anything is stolen while you were out. Finish picking orders. Pick supply orders for production, assist walk in customers. clean warehouse."
bad,"Once you have been trained on all 5 stations by the above described personnel, you are left to fend for yourself, unless you become one of them, but still must watch your back."
bad,"This is a delivery company for customers who need uniforms, bar towels, and other things that businesses need to perform their daily tasks.  The management was never willing to help with customers that the employee could not reach their satisfaction and would allow an individual to fail because they were not meeting the customers expectations.  The other employees were also not willing to help when one needed it.  The hardest part of the job was the lifting of heavy products, working in weather conditions whether hot, cold, raining, or snowing; the job still had to be done."
bad,"so anyone that says this job is a good one either one they have totally given up on themselves in finding a real job and are accepting the egg shell walk and control. my expereince here was horrible. training was limited, seemed my supervisor just wanted to find reasons to fire me rather than help me do better. i worked long hours doing hard work and trying hard as well. 14 to 16 hour days. co workers at the gilroy location for the most part were alllll unsatified and miserable and locked into cintas because of life. team members would snitch on each other to get ahead and be in managements favor. if you want this on your resume apply here but the gilroy location is not a good choice i did it!!! trust me.. its cool the first 4 months then they try to just control you. with phony meetings and phony managers. all robots almost like they could careless if u are alive or dead as long as your making them money. i was hired as a skipper and was suppose to get my own route as a driver and they had me doing sanis, carpet and tile etc."
bad,"May not be a total review of the company, but I had a bad manager who only cared about himself and numbers. Talked to us like we were sheep and could care less about getting to know you. "
bad,"There is no room for advancement. You will walk in the door and your greeted with open arms. Thats all you will get once your in. Your pay scale will never change. They will no promote from within. If you do not have a degree you are frowned on by upper management and looked over for any opportunity. Company policies are only implamented but are disregarded to very few. This is not a across the board place to work in. Did we for get to mention there is a huge turn around in this office. There is a person being let go once a week. Leads have no real world experiance and will do ""anything"" to get ahead."
bad,Work is stressful and number driven. Customers are not management focus until they threathen to cancel. Partners are not appreciated nor treated well. Management is sneaky and will stab hardworkers in the back at every turn.
bad,Communication throughout the plant is horrible. Your promised alot of things that just seem to never happen.
bad,Cintas as a company great!! Loc 492 in Fort Worth is awful. They treat the SSR's like garbage. If your in management then your fine in your office looking busy. When it comes to family forget about it.
bad,"Stay away from trying to get employment here. The company teaches strong values but does not follow them themselves. Workers are treated as slaves and as if they don't have value. It is impossible to get raises for the company. Instead of giving raises, they find ways to cut your pay. I was one of the highest sales reps for the company yet still had my pay cut in every review. The management is extremely deceptive and do not follow through with what they have agreed to do."
bad,Working for cintas is the true meaning of the blind leading the blind. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy. They dont care about the people they employ.
bad,"The jobs ok, it repetitive and easy not real the problem. It's the employees that sucks. If you don't mind being fully grown in a high school environment its for you. I spend my days in silent mode with my head down.I do my time and I go and management sucks."
bad,"Perks: Flexible hours, company vehicle, and benefits."
bad,The older people are the only people that get respect in that place and the management is very poor. Great benefits! The hardest part is dealing with management and the older people.
bad,"Cintas is a company driven by corporate greed. They like to pay their small employees little and save everything for the already rich white guys. Very little room to advance even when you do bust your butt by working the job of 3 people. Heaven forbid a raise was given. I’ve worked here a year and a half and STILL have yet to be acknowledged a pay increase, and if you do ask “it’ll happen at your annual review” which are only conducted in October"
bad,"Been there almost almost a year job was fantastic up until the summer came along. Has been a change in service Dept  managers and they are making life for the ssrs a living nightmare. Moral with the drivers is so low I don’t know how they still have guys doing the job. Was told one thing when I got hired and it is defiantly not what they tell you it is. Drivers are putting out fires all day long. Have long days on the road and the end of the day procedures is awful. Drivers are sent out with product and are told to still charge the customers. At the the end of the day they have to “check in “ with office workers and explain why customers aren’t paying their bills, like it’s the drivers priority to hunt down money. Then you have to sit up to a hour at times to get checked in in order to go home. And now they are making drivers sit with a catalog manager to explain why they aren’t selling stuff regularly. Drivers are told to physically count clothes for each and every stop which can take a long time depending on how big the account is. Then your supposed to push additional product, and try to sell sell sell and oh by the way hunt down who ever is responsible for paying the bills!!  "
bad,Very high Pace to get the trucks done and unloaded and loaded before 9 was never guaranteed more than 40 hours a week unless you worked more than 9hrs
bad,"never have product for work day so we would screw over customers everyday day lots of stops and low pay heavy lifting constant moving bending over and driving"
bad,How to figure out things on your own with no help. Training isn’t very good. Most partner are great to work with. There is always a few briar make things hard.
bad,"Nice place to work, decent benefits. Very poor management. Just concerned with numbers and not the welfare and being of employees. Too many people kissing butt in order to get promoted."
bad,Lack of communication seems to be a on-going issue with this company. If you are in sales good luck because your weekly goals are almost impossible. And unfortunately either your the man or they treat you like trash.
bad,"It's a uniform company. Aftet 9 months, I  still don't have my own uniform.  People in charge are not the brightest bulbs in the box.  Never learn from their mistakes. Repeat same costly mistakes. Manager did not know what a load bar was, so he sent it to scrap yard. It was brand new worth $175. Lucky if scrapped for $5.  This is second time load bar scrapped. This person then buys more load bars when employees mention missing load bars. VERY hard to work under morons."
bad,Moral in the building was just dead. The management hardly ever properly communicated so there was an array of issues all the time. No tuition reimbursement or assistance was given yet expected their employees to have a degree for advancement.
bad,Supervisor dont know anything he don’t give chances for some people to advance. He always ask for more production but he himself doesnt do anything about work he just sit and talk to his phone all day
bad,"Start at 5 and are done whenever you finish your route, which is probably a lot more work then one should do for the pay they give you. No one follows direction and everyone is your boss. Pretty much steal money from accounts by overcharging the life out of them."
bad,"Preceived themselves as a company that cared about their employees (partners), however when the minimum wage went up in Ontario, even though the Cintas had bought G&K after our contract had been made, waited until the 1st of January 2018 to put it in court and not up the employee wage.  After months of fighting the arbitrator sided with the company and now a washline member would be paid only 22 cents more then a general labour.  When I first worked the washline, the job paided 2 dollars more then a labourer.  Glad they saved themselves some money, but cost them some employees, including me."
bad,they said once you learn everything in the plant you would become a drivers helper. then get your own route. that didn't happen. you were a good worker in the plant. there was no way to advance.
bad,"Bad management, the cultures was good, there was not Drama "
bad,"No work/life balance. Pay is pretty good if you have good accounts, but not worth all the time spent working. Managers don't care about your well being. Sometimes you have to walk through sketchy places and factories. Very small amount of help when needed. Managers are too busy with other things.Training is not thorough. Uniforms say we are all certified, but we were not trained for any of the certifications on our shirt. No one teaches you about the products and laws, it is all self taught at home after work."
bad,"Every company has its pros and cons. This company only cares about numbers. They don't care about doing the right thing, they only care about making it look like they did the right thing. That works for a specific type of person... and for that type of person, this may be a great place to work. Decent benefits and room for advancement."
bad,"I really do not want to get too into this, but the entire organization is running on technology older than me in some cases and I am in my mid 30s.  They are filled to the brim with zealous conservatives who think any regulation is immediately evil."
bad,"Good pay, very poor management.  If you are a veteran with a disability they will discriminate you.  Management will tell you one thing then turn around and say something different.  Training is a joke."
bad,This company was very good to work for until it was bought out by Cintas.  Upper management only cares about themselves and not the people that do the actual work.
bad,The mangers at the location I was are very unprofessional and they did not train me the right way. The managers had promised to help me with the proper training and not only promised me but that was part of their job and they did not do their job!
bad,"Lies about pay rates and benefits. Will not get trucks fixed properly."
bad,"Management is self centered , and training is terrible. I was not trained while the other new girl was. They let customers treat/talk to you horrible , and then they cater to them. Management gets a x-mas party in a see all conference room , and if you are not management , you can sit and watch. never saw anything like it."
bad,"I thought it was going to be a job I could turn into a career, especially after being told I could advance within the company upon hire. Benefits are pretty good (roughly $70/wk for health/vision/dental) and you don't work big holidays or every weekend (mandatory weekends if even another part of the plant falls behind). Loopholes everywhere and the company seems to only care about their self interest instead of the interest/safety of their ""partners"". I had medical restrictions and kept being denied a new position within the company, even with documentation from my health care provider, which made me question their whole ""SAFETY"" practices. So many people gossip and worry about what others are doing instead of doing their own job. You're never told you're doing a good job, only what you're doing wrong, yet are supposed to believe ""you're appreciated"" when they remember to do the partner appreciation lunches or hand out paychecks."
bad,Working there has taught me a lot. I don't regret a day of it. It was a very fun and laid back job especially if you're out on route. Inside is what you make out of it.
bad,"Over nearly 10 yrs of service with this company I have watched mgmt become extremely greedy all so they get a higher bonus. Greed among upper mgmt has ruined the moral among many partners. I miss the days of great mgmt who cared about the partners and not the extra money in their pockets.  Every few yrs they also lower your raise percentage claiming its the economy yet make their highest gross profit ever that year. In the nearly 10 yrs ive worked there I only increased my pay by $2.50. Jobs among partners within the same dept are also very unfair, almost discriminating. Mgmt cheats and lies excessively to their bosses all to give the appearance that all is well instead of being honest about issues that will not just fix themselves. Save yourself from a dead end job andrethink applying for this company."
bad,Plant always breaks down. Management doesn't care about the front line partners. God speed if you take this job.
bad,"This was by far the worst job I've ever had at 38 years old. The fleet of trucks are junk always breaking down. The pay sucks even if it was a 4 day work week. I can make $10 hour anywhere, and not get calls on my day off because my accounts are missing uniforms due to a poorly run plant and system that doesnt' work. They tell you 40 hours, but its more like 45-50. Product shortages never stopped. Hard to make your customers happy if you dont have what they are paying for especially since it's a commission job. Management always focused on the negative rather then positive. DONT TAKE THIS JOB YOU WILL REGRET IT!"
bad,Management is lazy and lies to you. I was promised twice that I was getting promoted then got some lame excuse as to why I wasn't. Then months later they fired me and tried sueing me for damaging the shred machine. They claimed they had video evidence of me doing it. Court came about and the video evidence never showed up. Management needs to be replaced there
bad,terrible company they like to fire people and they dont care about there employees
bad,"Very unorganized! System is out of date. They dispatched using outlook Calendar. Appointments would get missed, multiple  people had access and would delete appointments. They did not give me the correct tools to complete my duties! Too many steps to complete one task which would then result in multiple errors."
bad,"Management never knows what's going on.. Lack of communication..."
bad,This job would be good if they would give a decent raise and would stop cutting hours. And would have a solid starting time. Its hard to etart early one day and the next day they change your starting time.
bad,"During my time at Cintas, I had the top sales at my location but was denied promotions and was often reprimanded against because I refuse to do the unethical things my managers wanted me to do. Sadly I decided to leave the company and months later I found out the managers at my location were all let go for unethical practices."
bad,Wasted 10 year of my life on a Company that promotes manager's that can't manage. Managers only care about they're bonuses and perks then actually doing the job that is MANAGING!!!!!. if you enjoy asking for problems to be fix and never do then Cintas is the place for you.
bad,Terrible. Little to no training. No organization. Lack of leadership. Everything is 'we are working on it'. Excuses for everything. You are setup to fail. Only good thing was an early shift in which you are off early afternoon.
bad,"It's nothing more than a plantation , not worth working here , they don't appreciate the employees , the work condition is horrible an they don't pay well"
bad,"The 4 day work week was great and the people I worked with was even better. The management was always talking a big game and trying to get every pumped up just to try and manipulate many costumers. The products that we was supposed to deliver was missing the pieces the majority of the time. The mats was always shorted on our truck and the warehouse would run out so our management told us to do the ""shake and bake"" method. This method was to take the dirty mat out to the truck away from costumers eyes and shake it out as good as we can then roll it back up like its a clean mat while still charging the costumer full price and sometimes 2-3 times more than the competition. This pretty much sums up my experience with the management at my branch in Arkansas."
bad,"I spent a month in the hiring process, went on a ride along, went in for multiple interviews, got uniform sizes, And got my CDL printed out and sent a picture of it, and for no reason I was dropped from the Hunter in process for no reason and not told why after asking multiple times. Seems like it would’ve been a good job too bad management sucks"
bad,"A typical day at Cintas would hot and humid the whole time I'm working.  Very stressful, physical and sometimes unorganized.  Poor management, lack of advancement and communications.  The work atmosphere is very draining and can be down right disgusting.  Some of the workers are easy to get along with which helps at times."
bad,"Everything you do is counted, you must meet a quota daily."
bad,"Constantly cycling through management no guidance whatsoever. Was initially brought in as an advanced management partner, when i arrived i was given the responsibilities of a junior technician with no explanation, other than they were short technicians."
bad,Every leadership meeting centers around revenue per day.  Very little emphasis on a job well done.  The middle management is treated very poorly.  I would rather be a technician than a service manager.  You can make a lot more money as a fire extinguisher sales person than if you have many certifications and can repair any fire alarm system.
bad,"Would not recommend working for this company, slow environment, pretty poor management, and lack of compensation form time worked. not a friendly work enviorment."
bad,The Charlotte location unfortunately was not a great place to work.  Management used intimidation and endless meetings to harass employees.  Your job is often threatened by the General Manager of this location.  Supervisors are often calling your personal phone while your servicing customers and hounding you for constant sales.  The 3 day weekend is without a the best part but be prepared for harassment when you return to the workplace for your upcoming work week.
bad,"Cintas is an awful place to work.  No work/life balance.  Work comes before everything.  Your are expected to perform miracles everyday.  Production is awful, no communication.  Don't value employees enough, and are always way understaffed to maximize profits.  Don't work here no matter how much they tell you how great I is.  It is awful, and you will be taken advantage of."
bad,"Hypocritical managers, inexperienced in dealing with workers, and thoughtless. Were only concerned about improving their status to upper management which is also clueless about what really is going on in the locations."
bad,"Cintas is an ok company to work for when it comes to benefits. However, working production in the plant is far from a career. The starting pay is pretty low for what you do on a daily basis. As far as a typical work day its pretty much the same thing each day, so the repetition gets old very quickly. Management doesn't boss people around, however they rarely listen to new ideas being put forth by other employees. Management is also pretty good at giving people the run around on promotions. I'd assume most people would expect a company to promote within, if you're looking for that then I highly encourage you not to work here. I worked for Cintas for two years and was interviewed numerous times for a promotion my last year of employment with them. Every interview went exceptionally well, but they never moved me onto the final interview and approval for a promotion by senior management. When I would ask why I was not scheduled for my next interview I was always told that so and so is out of the office, or we're too busy right now. I was given the run around for about a year, before deciding I should seek employment elsewhere. The most discouraging thing about the whole process was seeing myself working hard for the company and wanting to move up, but was never given an answer only to find they hired someone off the street for the position I was looking to promote to. As far as daily life working in the plant, its pretty hot during the summer time and they work you like a dog in production. There's also no bonuses or incentive to do more. You can expect a yearly evaluation and less"
bad,I was lied to about the job length and the office manager decided right away she didn't like me and made it hard on me. I was also instrucred to forge COD audit call logs. When I questioned upper management about it I was let go.
bad,It was always very hot in the warehouse. Poor supervisors. Co workers were great.
bad,"Very heavy work load with 0 work/life balance, I'm sure some Cintas plants run much better, ours used to until our GM got promoted to Seattle. They WILL change your pay plan every so often and tell you its to give you the chance to make more when nobody ever does. Price increases for the customers and pay decreases for the people they expect to get those increases. If your route is too big, don't be a hard worker and go faster and work harder, they will pile on until you break.  Go really slow and don't work hard and you will be graciously rewarded by a light workload.  Had a route for 2 years, loved my coworkers and customers! Had 150 customers to service in 4 days with 600 miles of driving. Asked for nearly a year to get some relief and cut up my route and it never came.  I can't say that I wouldn't recommend Cintas in general, but I can strongly say that the Normal, IL location is a sinking ship and beware. They will be looking to fill A LOT of positions coming up, and for good reason so beware."
bad,"A typical day at work was great due to a hardworking and professional team but one slacker who was looking for a free ride on a false disability claim. I learned that being a supervisor with no support is worthless. The management team didn't have authority, Human Resources did. My manager was only a manager based on seniority and it showed. The hardest part of my job was knowing that said manager was incompetent. These hardworking employees  suffered due the one employee who that said manager refuse to get rid of due to the obvious. Too bad, so sad for the revolving door of great employees."
bad,Lacks progressive and contemporary business strategies unless you are in Sales
bad,typical day at work every one has to be quiet to get the work done.
bad,"very poorly run from management, promise the world but never follow up or thru. try to deal with all the drama but it breaks you down after a while, starts great ends badly"
bad,Fast pace demanig job environment leads a lot to be desired .Good benefits They do have unfair hiring practices you can be there years at a pay rate and they will hire someone doing the same job and oat then more no reguard for longevity
bad,"Too much work not enough pay. Salesmen get paid most. Route pay is trash, only good thing is 4day work week. Very physically demanding. Would recommend to someone in their early 20s."
bad,The work I do for Cintas is not that  hard. On a good day I will work 7-10 hr. Where as on bad day there is no work or 4 hour or less hour. It is very hard to pay your bills and take care of your family with a job like this.
bad,"Management is usually the smooth talking, yes man type. Two different branch managers while I was with the company, both were the same. Very questionable accounting practices, rental company but charge customers for products they have not received; no true book charge, so charging whatever the sales person decided, etc. Drivers were overworked, even according to the standards that corporate sets."
bad,"Be prepared to not have everything needed to service your customers, be ready to constantly go in and tell customers prices are increasing, be prepered to take the blame and not be allowed to place blame on managers as is should be. Hours are good, pay pretty good, but all it's about is numbers and being trained to lie to customers."
bad,Management at the location I worked at is terrible. Everyone is overworked and under paid. Benefits are great but other then that the company is nothing special.
bad,"The management especially the new General Manager is only concerned about the numbers. The Production Manager was difficult and she would not listen to any of our suggestions we would give. I feel sorry for the girls that still work there. Had to leave after six months. They do not appreciate your hard work, and they never do what they say they will do. Do not apply, save yourself the trouble. You are better off at a fast food restaurant."
bad,Good companyh but expect too much with not enough support staff. 
bad,"The company has NOT been able to get caught up in production for over 10 months now because of all the FIRINGS of good workers, all for their own personal favors even with all the extreme amount of overtime to only the people they favor.The GM ""made"" room for the ""new"" plant manager specificaly for that reason.Plant manager dosent know how to manage people.He addresses you as if you are beneath him and you should not respond back to him as if you were a child.They have people who have chronic health issues and they do NOT turn the air on to keep costs down.Had one collaspe and what do they do-they put them in an office chair and wheel them after 15-20 mins.to the break room.Dont accept a ""gift""card because you will get TAXED on it.How sad is that! As for raises, forget it, you will be lucky to get .17 and that is on the high end.They only will hire college who dont know what they are doing or care to learn the whole operation.They will only ask for suggestion only to cover their ""behind"" so they can say that they asked you,"" what can happen to make it easier"" so they will get credit for the idea.Now for people NOT getting fired our GM has on numerous occasions almost been fired but somehow dodges the bullet.The latest incident was him coming up behind a worker, picked her up, and was JUMPING UP AND DOWN in, as it was also stated for the so called ""investigation"", inappropriate behavior where she was also injured.As for the hardest part of the job, I would say getting out of bed knowing it will be 8 hours of managements fakeness.Remember to smile and make us believe it or your"
bad,"If you have a personal issue with anybody related to management or who is good friends with management they will try to make your life terrible there, they carry a passive aggressive stance. Pay was good but I was made to wait 3 weeks to get my first paycheck. Mainly because there ego an pride wouldnt allow them to do their job like they were supposed to because of a dispute i had with a supervisor since I didnt get a debit card in the time allotted before my first check. Honestly if your a person who doesnt suck up to management you wont last here"
bad,"Poor management... How Dare any manager of mine work with or over employees and don't speak or communicate for an whole 8 hour shift poor, poor, poor not decent behavior for leaders"
bad,"Coworkers were great. Benefits were great. Management was a revolving door, service as well as general managers. Managers are kids they get out of college and are put in a two year training program. They are then put in charge of people in technical positions with much more experience. The culture went downhill. You are literally a number, and “easily replaced” per old GM."
bad,No sense of direction from management from an AR perapective. They dont understand segregation of duties. Management is always changing. Also there is no support in the office.
bad,"This company teaches the employees to cheat on customers, little service, but charge too much, show you their price list and under that a huge commitment as a contract and obligation, but they think they can get away with that, they never talk to you about it, just collect your signature and charges, charges and charges, Their quality of the stuff they bring also are out of standard and create irritation on skin and cannot be used all the time."
bad,"Benefits are really excellent if you want a good benefits for you and your family. Job is very physical, exhausting and tiring. "
bad,"The local management is full of surprises like: irony,sarcasm and arrogance . Lots of lies regarding job description(they advertised one position Calgary based and the position is actually outside of Calgary,more in BC than Alberta). Extremely unprofessional. Lots of mess!!!"
bad,Need to pay more money and treat the in employees on the floor BETTER because they are doing all the work and people on the floor get treated like dolls in the people on the office get treated like kings and queens
bad,Job are very stressful! One person doing a three person job. You must be stable to work in this facility. Not enough salary for the work you do. I recommend no one on this job
bad,This job has no order people do what they want.Run the other way if you ask me .Find something better Its not worth nothing but the benefits but other than it's nothing but stress!
bad,"I worked at Cintas for almost two years, In the two years I was there I noticed that managment was poor, treated everyone differently. If you were not on a favorite list you got treated unfair whereas if you were on a favorite list you got away with everything."
bad,"The GM at D-56 I’m Connecticut is just horrible. Rude, no respect, chased a bunch of good worker and hr hasn’t done a thing. Show no appreciation and I literally searched and left the job. No help and no likes the guy and he knows it. Yelling at you and literally disrespect you calling you names and empty headed. Never been so happy to leave a job."
bad,"Worst business to give your time and dedication to. Managers are bullies that are allowed to get away with mistreatment of other partners. When reporting to HR you are ran around in circles in meetings with no ending results. This place is full of corruption and no matter how hard you work or how good you are at your job they will toss you out like moldy spaghetti. Upper management is a joke, they place the blame on everyone other then their leaders. Glad to finally be out after 2 long years of dedication."
bad,I applied a couple of weeks ago for several positions & your company can't even call me to chat about it or possibly set up a interview. I had a interview with one of your manager's at the Maywood IL location but the day of interview he called me & cancelled saying he had a emergency in the field but would call back to reschedule interview. well that never happened & even when I called him to leave a message he didn't return my call. doesn't seem very uprofessional to do something like this? Have a wonderful day.
bad,"I was excited to work at this job until I realized that management abuse their power, have no integrity or confidentiality. The people there are AWSOME but because of the lack of integrity and respect management doesnt seem to possess its difficult to remain excited. Be warned the San Leandro location is NOT the one you want to work at. I quit and went back to my old job. Maybe if policies were enforced for everyone it would be a better environment to work at"
bad,"Management was upfront and truthful during the interview process. Early before dawn start time, long hours, dealing with dirty and contaminated uniforms, heavy lifting and working in hot or cold outdoors.  You will do a ride-along before you get hired. ASK QUESTIONS & GET ANSWERS!!! Most drivers will refrain from negativity to avoid repercussions but be adamant and get them to be honest. Weigh out the hours, versus the labor versus the pay. Hey, times are tough and you need a job, right? But this place might be more of a downer as time goes on. Trucks never seem to be loaded properly; there are constant shortages which will put you behind when trying to leave for your route. The pay is generated from a base salary plus a percentage of what your route volume is. Obviously the harder routes make more money but you'll be working 40-50 hours in four days. Want 9-5? Keep looking. Average day starts at 5am. This is a 4 day work week with optional 5th day if management approves OT. SSR's are salary but yet are required to swipe a timecard??? Doesn’t make sense but somehow they get away with it. SSR's salary range from $35,000 to $70,000+ based on direct sales and promotions. You could bring home $300 one week and $1200 the next week (I made $40k my first year and worked my a** off). SSR's are expected to sell. If you’re looking to just do your route, no more no less, then you will be gone as they post results for everything. You are expected to ""make seconds that count"" and spend a few moments with decision makers, but yet you have to keep moving or you'll be out all night. If you"
bad,The job was not difficult but you could not even go to the bathroom because there was just to much work for one person to handle. Everyone you work with seems stressed out. You couldn't even breathe with out someone jumping down your throat. Supervisor was constant yelling at you for little things that had nothing to do with your job performance. Never once had a nice thing to say. I think that it was just my manager that made the company seem so bad. But no one should be treated that way. 
bad,"Cintas is company with a long history, they care about excellence and have great corporate structure. If you want to sell for Cintas you need to bring your A game every day."
bad,"Cintas has great work, life, balance when it comes to employees with families! And Cintas as a whole is a great company to work for with great benefits. But when it comes to management ...They do not know how to manage. Along with showing favoritism to certain employees! And also work load is not worth the pay!"
bad,"The management tends to favor young pretty bubbly outgoing girls And if you don’t fit in that Category you’re pretty much screwed. I’ve witnessed multiple cases of “partners”Harassing other partners because this. management tends to favor  pretty  girls and not help or protect the not so pretty, quiet ones.  They will not fire or discipline their favorites.  One girl in particular was harassed so much she ended quitting and they refused to help her even going so far is blaming her because She was quiet and not as social as the others. And this will affect your raise And promotion as well because if you’re not overly  social it would actually be used against you!   This is a big deal because if you’re working on the production floor you can’t  get A promotion Or move to another department  by relying on your work Performance you literally have to bend over and kiss the managers butt!"
bad,Great company but local management and culture is lacking severely. Very low moral and upset employees. Decent work hours and good benefits. Not a family oriented or inspiring location as seen at other locations around Ohio.
bad,I worked one day as a loader /unloader  . I liked it easy job  I was a temp to hire . They asked if I wanted to work there I said yes I would starting pay $11.35 A hour they bought me lunch I was treated good .At the end of my shift they asked a bunch of stupid questions . I had 3- interveiws they told me we will let you know in about a week if you get the job . It is now 4-weeks so the way I see it is you wasted my time I could do the job why not hire me ???... And to this day they are hiring for all postions  so this company has problems . If they would call me today and say you are hired I would say .. Not interested you should have hired me on the spot .!!!...Please dont work there look elswhere ..
bad,"As a Sales Service Representative I focused on new, business to business account development in our Uniform business. Responsibilities include prospecting, cold calling, setting appointments with prospects, presenting programs, and delivering a sales quota. I also transported samples of products for presentations. To become a Sales Service Representative I also went through a thorough training program, including product knowledge and development of our company sales process."
bad,"The amount of work doesn't add up to their actual pay rate. It's just another big name company that prays on the less fortunate doing all the excessive dirty work for nickels and dimes. If you don't value yourself and want to work unreasonable long hours while being exposed to filth with no time for lunch break , than this is the perfect job for you. "
bad,"I experienced some issues that flowed"
bad,I am a little disappointed.  I expected more professionalism. I  applied foa a position. I have tow interviews.(by phone & in person) and   i still waiting for a call with some information...
bad,If you like working with maggots and all types of nasty stuff like that and not getting paid for it then cintas is the place for you. Your gonna deal with lies and so be ready for it all. And its impossible to make any complaints because you'll just be put on hold for every phone call you make. Dont make the mistake of working with cintas like I did.Workin
bad,"A company to run from,racial and your work is definitely not appreciated always increasing and no place to advance unless your skin color is white,there is a reason why this company is always hiring"
bad,They lie to you when you start they constantly have no working trucks when it snow jobs cancel they so unorganized that people don’t know your coming to do a job because the supervisor doesn’t do his job. Then we’ll make it seem like it’s your fault with a smile on his face it’s no union so wen you on his bad side he will get rid of you.
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers and the route managers, but upper management does not keep there word. If you are selected for an interview, I suggest you do your research and ask questions, before you accept an offer."
bad,would not recommend and i have to right something in here for a review so im just going to go on and on cause i have nothing good to say about this company
bad,Not a good place to work don’t know why they have a Manager he let  those people run the place and when you want to move to different department they hire people from the outside and give you some  excuse why you weren’t  picked  people don’t last there only the ones who been there for decades and can’t speak English Manager very unfair and HR is right behind him also.
bad,"If you apply for a job don't expect an interview call if they think you're not qualified. They strung me along for 3 weeks, never returned my calls and never told me any updates on my application. One month later I received an email saying I wasn't selected. Waste of time."
bad,working in a not so clean environment when it comes to picking up dirty materials and replacing with clean materials.  Be prepared to work overtime if needed. Traveling is included with this job.
bad,"Someone once told me that if I had nothing nice to say, to say nothing at all. It was an experience that I was able to learn an abundant amount of information in a short bit of time."
bad,Good company to work for. You will be extremely tired when working for Cintas Corporation. Worked here for about three years and am looking forward to facing new challenges.
bad,Don't waste your time here.  Cintas doesn't care about their employees or being ethical.  They are just in it for them and only care about the sale and not retaining it.
bad,It's a family type of environment. The pay could go up a few dollars for all of the work you do but it's still a great entry level job.
bad,Terrible interview process. Management and HR does not care about anything.
bad,"At this job I have learned a lot about accounts receivable."
bad,"Good company. Not good work life balance. Frat house environment. Coercion involved in company politics, policies and upper management."
bad,Soon to be former employee.. Actually considering getting the eeoc involved.
bad,It was like high school at that company.
bad,Quite possibly the worst job I've ever had. No raise after one year even with a good review. Incompetent management. Poorly run shifts. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,I loved working here and I loved the people I worked with but I just had to live due to personal issues that I felt weren’t being issolved. Great place
bad,Cintas is a good company but Management still has an old school mentality. Their culture is very old fashioned. No work life balance here. Management does not care about you. Everyone is replaceable and you are treated that way.
bad,When you have an issue with a customer and the company takes there side and doesn't support there own employee. Lack of leadership. They ask way to much of the employees and don't give them anything in return whether its pay or a little recognition.
bad,"Was excited when hired, but I've grown to hate this company and my location with a passion. Cintas does NOT invest its people. Bonuses are joke, literally a few pennies that won't fill up your gas tank on its own. They only care about the numbers, not you. Poor training, management makes up their own rules, there are no clear policies and procedures in place on how some things should be handled so you're left feeling like you'll never truly know what to do with issues. Told to play things by ear which is irrationally ridiculous for a billion dollar company. Expect to do more than just your job but other people's jobs too because my location prefers to stay short staffed. Coming from a company where my management was in a completely different state, the micromanagement here is insane. My location offers no recognition for anything, no motivation, nothing to look forward to everyday with little compensation and 0 opportunity for advancement unless you move to a completely different department that you know nothing about. If you are lucky enough to get a ""good job"" it's filled with negative criticism of what should be better. I'm fine with constructive criticism but this? This isn't it. Literally cannot wait to find another job."
bad,"Work until you break your body poor pay supervisors are like puppets in college thinking about themselves while whipping you to push harder for more money in there pockets, they only promote from outside like drivers but people inside hardly see the light of better pay and there own route to drive because you always need to look like a person to be in public."
bad,"This is the one and only job i have been discharged! Would not recommend if you are a serious person trying to make a living, honestly the management was akward!"
bad,I worked for this company for 5 years the company trucks were very unsafe  management  was horrible  I'm happy I moved on to better wages and staff
bad,"Poor.  I have been a mechanic for 30+ years.  It is a slow paced environment."
bad,"Start work at 6 am checking in with my manager and picking up supplies. I would then go out to service customers taking care of their first aid, safety and safety training needs."
bad,"It is my perception that the management is in lack, thereof. I spent majority of my time defending myself based on false accusations. Every week, a new drama unfolded and work place bullying was very real. I loathed having deal with the few i did, because i was always under scrutiny. The superiors over me would prefer grouping up in cliques and talk about subordinates. It seemed no matter  how hard I worked or what % we got down to, it didn’t matter. Management there is poor and ill-informed."
bad,I worked at Cintas for 2 1/2 yr and it was bad. Pay was below industry standards 4-10s shift which was really 5-12s cause open routes and people leaving. Low moral in the plant in due to bad good old boy management. More work then they are willing to pay for. If you are hired as a SSR your stuck with no chance of advancement.
bad,"The Renton location is an old G&K location.  A ton of hold overs and pay doesn't reflect the company.  Zero commission for an SSR. Paid by the hr. All you are is a glorified delivery driver. Upper management has no idea what is going on. The promote from the good old boys club and not off skill or performance.  Our service manager is a joke and has never done the job, but hes in charge of all services."
bad,"I wouldn’t work there knowing what I know now.  Match 401k they told me, that’s a lie after 5 years.  They have cook outs which you will get the leftovers because you will be on the road, no air condition in the trucks, and everything is your fault, but they tell you that part in the job preview.  So they also tell you that you get a day off for your bday naw you don’t."
bad,"Worked 4 days a week which was a plus, but days could be long and tough. That wasnt the issue though. When hired on you are led to believe you are in control of your route and have the abilities to handle it how you see fit. Upon running the route though it was anything but that. Management team is also terrible. They themselves are also very under trained from my experience and majority of the time dont have answers to any questions you may have."
bad,It wouldn’t be so bad if the management was better most of the time they have ego issues and if you don’t kiss up they will come for you on any and everything they have a bad habit of doing this to the best workers instead of the people that’s not actually doing what they’re suppose to. They will overwork you! I felt that we were definitely under paid for the type of work that is done. No job security if they don’t like u they will try everything to get rid of you
bad,"Just don't get hurt on the job, my career and life as it was is over.       My pay was  cut immediately.  and keeps going down as time goes on.  workers comp.  to long term disability to social security disablility.   Would  get in a month what i used to make in a week.     Workers Compensation is a joke, and their IME doctors lie for them.     Sedgwick attorneys twist words and make judges and people involved  think I am a  liar,  so I was denied treatment.   I am working with another company with an injury i received from working at Cintas. Surgery is the only option for treatment.                     I almost lost everything I owned.  Would have, if a friend hadn't lent me money.  Cintas ended 17 year career and my way of life as I knew it just because I got hurt on the job."
bad,"The benefits are horrible, the only good thing about this is they they do let you go to school because they know you wont better yourself investing years of your life there."
bad,"shred customer documents as needed"
bad,"Horrible company. In a typical day, you reach the plant between 530 and 630 in the morning. Usually, your truck is not loaded and you are forced to do so yourself. The Plant is always short product and you are forced to try to make it back to customers later on in the week to service them if you could not service them on their delivery date."
bad,"A typical day at work be okay I get along with my coworkers, and management we have our ups and downs"
bad,"I asked my supervisor for advancement opportunities. He always beat around the bush. Also, I asked for more fair wages once and they pretty much laughed at me. They like to call the hourly employees ""partners"" to try and make them feel better about the low compensation, but in reality the management's actions show the company's true colors. HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK"
bad,"They do not care about anything in your life, strictly business and a number to them. They truly do not care if you have family issues. Only if you are at work or not that's it."
bad,"Not recommended. Too many restrictions. Too ridged. Crooked and manipulated management. Deceitful. Morally poor management. They purchased the company three years prior, I tried this stay but they pushed me out by making my life stressful."
bad,"The pay did not reflect years of service, mandatory overtime with working 10 hour days, 6 days a week, no work/life balance, no room for advancement within the company for most employees."
bad,"Third shift is for people with no social life  or family Sunday night - Friday morning."
bad,"they dont care about there employees anymore.they use to take care of the employees but now they are all about that dollar,they are always giving price increases.ignoring customer issues."
bad,"Perfect job if you have a record and have zero options elsewhere. They put on this front like it’s the best place to work and train you on doing the respectable uniform job and when you’re done they throw you in the “other job” that have the most disgusting duties ever. Digging through restaurant mag got soil ed linen. Spend 90 days doing one thing trap ping you to only hope you stay doing the job. Mislead by interview process, mgmt and trainers. 4 day work weeks is only plus. But you’re so exhausted on day off from being over worked it takes a day to recuperate. The clients truly did like the company due to the contract they’ve been signed. Once client realizes they’ve been had they turn on you. I pulled back the curtain on cintas in 5 months to see who they’re. You will have to lose all respect and integrity in yourself to do the job and for little money. Keep searching this place is a labor trap and unethical as. 4 day work week unless a holiday is nearing then you work extra day anyway. 6/7 days of work packed in 4 days. Commission structure is a scam. I promise you on this. The harder you work and more clients you get the less money you are able to make. The tenured guys told me stay within a certain volume or else you will be working for free. Scam. I’ve never worked harder at a job and felt so taken advantage of before. Cintas you should be ashamed of yourselves. After a long hot excruciating disgusting day you still have computer training to do that takes hours on these outdated glitchy computers. I calculated with the amount of daily prep-loading/weekly meetings/end"
bad,"I worked at Cintas for almost 2 years. For the 2 years, I worked and did my best at my job. I always aimed to have the best scores and be sure to be ahead of others. As for my hard work, I have requested a shift change due to being a single mother. The manager agreed with the shift change and stated that I can return to my normal shift when ready. Once I ready to go back to my normal shift changed, I was told no. They gave the new employee my shift and said I will have to wait. I was dedicated, hard worker and passionate about my job. When I have learned for all the work and efforts I gave Cintas to not care about me, that is when I had to leave for a better opportunity."
bad,The Salary/Benefits do not reflect the work load.  The hours were nice but the mgmt. has been there forever and do not support innovative and new ideas.
bad,Managers will run u in the ground & give u empty promises!! Only cares about Cintas...does not care about the customers or partners anymore! Would not recommend an enemy to work here! Always looking for ways to cut ur commissions earned...not really anything good to say about them except for the 4 day work week but who really cares about that when ur not making great money?!
bad,"After 18 years at Cintas I Got terminated for a Good deed I did for the company. They speak of Loyalty but its a one way street, the Plant partners are treated poorly, The Drivers are given low product and are expected to service the customer like they had 100% loads."
bad,"Being a sales representative for over 5 years here is what I've experienced."
bad,Management tends to ignore serious issues such as workplace harassment and ignores near misses almost every time. They only get safety awards because they do not report the incidences. Management and HR are manipulative and dishonest. Not a very good experience for me.
bad,"Working with sales representatives and enter all of their sales in computer.  They over sell and companies do not know what they even are signing up for.  Sales reps always cry that they do not make enough money but as a matter of fact, they make more than any employee in the building.  Employees in the back are underpaid and over worked.  Complaints are not handled very well.  No follow through.  Also, general manager just sits behind his desk collecting a paycheck."
bad,"Cintas only cares about the people that have been there 10 plus years , I say there unprofessional because they switch GM's every other month switching all the rules and not keeping us partners on whats rules that have changed, but be quick to write you up."
bad,"The team managers were not helpful, the did not extend any extra effort. It took several phone calls to get a hold of them, if needed."
bad,"This company doesn't communicate with their employees, the management absolutely has no concerns for their employees only about production.  There is a lack of honesty between management and employees.  Pay day is every Friday and they are always either short on paying or or completely doesn't pay you at all.  Then will make excuses about it."
bad,"They stopped caring about the most important part of this company a long time ago,the drivers. Without good drivers they are losing customers. All they need are people that don't question what they are doing just people that can get a signature and settle an invoice. No customer relation skills required to do this job just show up, don't get paidwhat you deserve and definitely don't try to use logic and common sense you will be black balled as a thinker and complainer. The worst communication ever."
bad,"The workplace culture leaves much to be desired. A lot of paperwork and unnecessary office time leads to less activity in your territory. With very little structured training, the challenges of beginning or continuing a sales career at Cintas is difficult."
bad,Answered phone calls for 8 hours a day. It was a tough work environment with lofty goals to achieve with little training. The fellow associates were kind.
bad,this job was not what I expected.  They hired more that 300 people and at the end they only kept 30.  We were very disappointed because the whole time they kept telling us that we all had our jobs secured and that we were going to be hired permanently.
bad,"What could be a great company and great job is NOT due to poor management.  A typical day is labor intensive and demanding, however, with good customer relations it makes it easier.  You are expected to do sales and service on a daily basis.  There are salesman but they do very little after getting a company to sign a contract.  The rest is on YOU.  There is little room for growth in the company.  Supervisors sit behind closed doors on a daily basis and take off of work very frequently to enjoy 3-5 day weekends.  They are never available or willing to help, but instead always ready to turn their head in the opposite direction or point a finger when work needs to be done.  There has been a very high turnover in the past couple years due to this, and as a result lots of new people on routes who are not well trained or effective.  The hiring process itself is a downfall, causing the applicant to attend multiple interviews spread out among weeks and spending a day on a ride along only to find out later that they weren't chosen for the position.  Base pay is low.  You will rely on commission.  Some people get off at 11am each day, but others are required to work until 5pm to correctly do their job.  You can find better opportunity elsewhere."
bad,"4 day work week, Paid weekly, day ends when your route is done, on the road all day, gain alot of friends and connection through customer base, 401k, monthly bonuses, quarterly bonuses, constantly having adds contest throughout year for cash payouts."
bad,"My job was quite enjoyable, dealing with and helping customers and service route drivers resolve issues in a timely and productive manner was a highlight of my day.  Dealing with constantly changing management and their constantly, daily, changing expectations became impossible."
bad,"Busy"
bad,"Production manager talks to you as if he is better than you. GM comes and goes hardly ever there. Go ahead and try to get out of a non compete agreement, wont happen even if you move away and try to work for a competitor miles away from your former location. Head of HR at Corporate never looked into legal department to see if I could work for what I call a non-competitor. The reason I know, she never called me back when she said she would. I was never confident in the call being returned. Lost that job opportunity cause of the non compete, thanks for letting me lose that opportunity Cintas."
bad,Management does not care about employees. Bad customer service and unethical in business practices.
bad,The reps that did well were in the right territory at the right time and often times fed by the managers or service. They plaid favorites and there was a lot of people back door paying for leads and sales etc. Ultimately my manager used my personal life against me and said that I wasn't paying for myself. It was extremely offensive and I'll never forget it.
bad,Wanted days hours and they refused to change my hours. Mangers shows favour with certain employees. Pay is not good for the labor work that you do for long periods.
bad,Position requirements are often changed without advanced notice affecting your salary in a negative way. No standardized training program. The main theme is to make money at all costs no consideration for employees. Tend to hire younger people with a degree over people with experience. No accountability for employees that don’t do there job. Selective enforcement of policy. A lot of employees turnover.
bad,Very stress job do not recommend for some one that has a family. They require you to put your work before family. There was not a lot of training due to short staff.
bad,"GM and Service Manager are never in the building, make decisions without any clue as to what is going on.  No communication from either.  Service Manager always has an excuse for not doing his job of ordering products or payroll."
bad,"Spartan culture, if you don't know it then you might want to Google it. What it means to Cintas, work M-F for 15 to 18 hours daily. On a low low low paying salary."
bad,"I worked a very large rural territory as a Service Sales Rep for the First Aid division."
bad,"this company PRIDES itself on diversity but the diversity hires are only to maintain that image. there are no people of color in real management roles within this company. They have TWO actual managers that are POC. Beware of this shady and unhealthy work environment. The leadership is TOXIC.  They only care about what appears to be true versus what truly is.  not recommended as a "" retirement career"""
bad,It is ran by a bunch of college frat boys who are only concerned about the money they put in their own pocket.  If your not friends with them your not getting a promotion
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people side by side. The hardest part is the tremendous workload. Not enough employees to complete the task. Unable to speak freely on how to make your processes more efficient. Systems are archaic. Young management team is not experienced enough thus creating a lot of unnecessary problems based upon trial and error methodology. It is a shame...such a big company they will say it's confidence but actuality they are full of arrogance.
bad,"Racist /Prejudice environment, low pay for the amount of work, overwhelming overtime, uncomfortable environment and deceiving management in all departments."
bad,"Long time employees aren’t appreciated, new management has priorities mixed up. Dishonest GM is creating a very poor culture inside the building. I would not recommend working there under current management."
bad,"I worked here several years and was a top sales rep. It didn't matter, it's a what have you done for me lately job.  Management is backstabbing and childish.  No one can be trusted."
bad,"Cintas is a numbers-driven based company, with little to no regards for employee needs unless it benefits them or the employee is trying to leave. Management is very unwilling to change and the TSMs are unknowledgeable.  Bullying tactics are often used to compensate for lack of knowledge or to cover up mass fails that pertain to the customer.  The hardest part of this job is completing the mass number of ever changing daily reports on top of the 6-14 national accounts requiring micromanagement daily.   There is a huge lack of training but the most enjoyable part of this job is the relationships built with various employees as they help encourage each other, band together and teach one another various aspects of the job as they learn it through trial and error."
bad,nothing is in order..managment always seem lost. They have no order/organization...it takes forever for me to move product and other materials out of the way in order for me to start my actual job.
bad,Good place to start for sales. Once you get acclimated look elsewhere to grow and make your carer path. Little to no advancement. Made good friends i still talk to today
bad,Cintas started out as a good place to work but managers do not provide the support that is needed for the position i was in. Managers are very hard to get a hold of. The GM had an open door policy but when direct management found out I was going to the GM I started receiving write ups and when I asked for back up they could not provide any and then I was terminated.
bad,"No union no job security can be terminated at any time!  The coworkers not management made it a great place too work pay was ok, work was very stressful and Manergers never cared! They just cared about he bottom line!"
bad,They hire sales reps for three years and then they leave and sell something else. They basically find new college grads and brainwash them for three years until they move on.
bad,No room for advancement unless you have your lips glued to your supervisors back side. Everyone will go behind your back for their own personal advancement. No credit will be given to you for the job you do. Management is a joke.
bad,"I made less than others that turned half the weekly volume. Don't expect anyone to unass a desk to talk with a customer or help with big days. Don't expect leadership to correct problems with production or outside orginzations. Asheville location will beat you down to the point of needing a break, asking for a break, taking a break then getting let go for taking that break. Leadership was willing to lie to customers and ask SSRs to fudge numbers to advance in the company."
bad,Dedicated a lot of time into the company with no support staff. Manager was very poor at handling the location. If you want to work more than you see your home or family then this is a great place for you. Service Manager is the bottom of the totem pole in their corporate leadership role. They will pay bare minimum and work you to the bone. There is very poor training for this position and the location has steadily declined due to General Manager's lack of involvement. Couldn't even take a vacation when I wanted and was told to try and cancel my trips to remain at the branch. If you have a difference in opinion or speak up they will push you out. If I can save someone the stress and time from this company by informing them then this review is well worth it!
bad,"They could care less about employees in every regard possible. They think we should be grateful, considering we are the reason they are doing as well as they are. Management is trash."
bad,"I definitely would not recommend working here!! The working conditions are horrible, it's extremely hot, and things are constantly breaking down. You will be over worked and underpaid! Management is unorganized and doesn't seem to communicate with each other. The company lacks diversity and majority of the employees don't speak English."
bad,"Cintas as a whole I;m sure is a great company however working with the First Aid and Safety division is a real challenge. When supplying customers with first aid items for first aid kits some managers and GM's actually encourage their service reps to over fill the first aid kits to invoice for the highest amounts possible, which for some is totally unethical and very dishonest so they tend to stay on the hot seat with there perspective managers because of low numbers. They use phases such as "" Don't make decisions for the customers"", and assume the sale........... I would think a company based on honesty and morals would not tolerate such practices. "" If you leave a customer with a ""0"" dollar invoice it's your fault"" Wow what if no one had an accident.... Isn't that a good thing ?????"
bad,Worked there for 2 yrs on nights promised to go to days over and over never happened. Management not the best.. guys I worked with were great. Good job if you wanna work nights and don't have a life or family
bad,"Company is all about numbers. If you get a good job it means you did ok but we want more. Not enough trained management. Managers to busy to help because they worried about putting more rules in place and making spreadsheets. Supervisor to employee ratio sucked. Never enough help even when they say come to us when in need, they never have time. They want volume over quality and won't take into consideration if you quality is better than the volume of calls you take. They watch how many calls you make and receive which negatively impacts your performance even if you're bringing the money in. A lot of dumb micromanagement. More worried about your dress attire than other job aspects (your in a call center, you see no one)."
bad,"If they do not like you, what you wear, or if they feel intimidated by you,  even the slightest bit, you will not be working there!! . "
bad,nothing don't want to say I did not get the proper training and instead of helping me to learn the job the asked me to move over to Document management.
bad,"this company lies to employees , and favoritism is blatant. This location only cares about profit over people, and encourage drivers to engage in unfair practices with customers. This is what the current GM instills"
bad,"Cintas is very behind in technological advancement. Although being an extremely large company, upward mobility is very hard to come by. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,Cintas is unethical in the way they do business. Service Representatives are forced to lie and cheat in order to keep their jobs. Customer's receive 3 to 4 price increases a year without warning. Management doesn't care about employees. They only care about their bonuses. Drivers jobs are threatened if they don't go along with what management wants.
bad,"I was a Maintenance Partner, they hired me because I have my 4th Class Power Engineering ticket so they are legally covered by Albertas boiler laws. What they should really hire is a Millwright."
bad,"* Learned how the stockroom department works, shipping and receiving"
bad,"Would not recommend working for the rental division of this company. Bad management, terrible turnover, and a Cintas culture cult. If you do not drink the Kool-Aid you will surely be replaced in no time. Best part about the job is taking care of your customers, worst part about you job is company constantly trying to raise prices and add unnecessary products to customers invoices to hit sales goals."
bad,"Cintas took away multiple benefits, and incentive plans. Managers micro-manage and they lack honesty and integrity."
bad,"I liked working here because I loved doing route sales and meeting new people...unfortunately, I learned quickly that managers were NOT honest about the job requirements/hours they expect...I averaged over 50hrs weekly consistently when I was paid and told only 40."
bad,"I start work at 4:30 am and I load the truck with the daly needs that were not puton the truck by the loaders the night before. Now I ride shotgun because I have not been through the class to drive. The driver I ride with has been given the name of Helper Killer because she has made 7 assistants quit in the past year. Something to be said about how mindful the company is about there help. I am belittled for overisghts, told how to do things more efficiantly but then my driver does the opposite, questions are not answered then I am punished for not doing it correctly even after being ignored for asking how to do it correctly. When a complant is made about my driver I am asked to give it time and let managment correct the problem I am retailiated on by my driver for complaining. Was told I would work 4 ten hour days yet I almost never get a full 40 hours."
bad,I worked for this company for about 6 months and it was horrible. I do not know if every location is the same but the location I worked at that does the shredding (J89) here is horrible. The General Manager smiles in your face and pretends to care about you but he is far from it none of the managers has actually done the work all were hired to manage so they dont know what its like to that work all day for 4 to 5 days a week. The supervisior over the shredding has no communication skills and is disliked by everybody. He has no leadership skills and expects everyone to work like a machine like him. This location is unorginized and they will work you till you cant take anymore; they dont beleive in you spending time with your family because they always dump more work on you unexpectedly especially because the trucks break down everyday and you're sitting in the hot sun waiting on the mechanic oh yea the a/c in the truck probably wont be working either. They also say you or off on the weekends but you may come to work and the supervisior that doesn't know how to communicate may just put your name down to work on a saturday for a shred day without telling you. They also take 30 minutes out of your pay everyday for lunch but you have so many stops to make that you cant take a lunch so basically you are working 30 minutes for free. The pay isn't worth the work they put you through thats why this location is constantly hiring because people get tired of it and quit or either find a better job. If you are desperate work here till you find something better but keep looking because you
bad,This is a job for someont who is single with no kids and no life.
bad,"This place sells you a pipe dream and plays off the fact that you want a job bad. They played on my emotions This is what they did to me. They lured me away from my home to move down to the San Diego telling me that I would be making great money and making great commission. Telling me that I'd be doing a job that was different than what they actually had me doing, when I got down there. They lied to me about everything. I asked numerous questions about pay starting pay commission and they side stepped so many questions. You start off at a decent base which is about 36,000 a year when your training. But your base drops dramatically once your on route. How does your base go from 36,000 range to like 20,000?? I didn't understand that and they never explained it to me during orientation and numerous meetings we had. The goals are ridiculous and hard to meet. If you have a family good luck trying to make it in this company. I could go on more about them but it's a waste of time. I'm frustrated I ever decided to work for this company."
bad,"Management is highly unorganized, the work week is 50+ hours, with no work/ life balance. The expectations from management are through the roof, and no matter how much effort you put into your task, it's never enough. "
bad,Not a good working environment. Management is not helpful at all and are only interested in their numbers and will toss you under a bus in a heartbeat. Very unethical work culture with high turnover.
bad,"The pressure to sell more product every day pushes the employee to sell the customer items they do not need, or over-selling them products that they already have.  Morally inconsiderate and motivated only by the dollars you charge."
bad,"Manager specifically loaded my route with accounts which earned me pennies compared to my Male counterparts then wrote me up numerous times for not making my required dollar amounts.  We had ""territories"" which allowed us not to service in each other's areas, yet every single day I'd learn of the other techs working my area. I was the only female tech and was the only one treated this way. I was also working 12 hours on some days while some of the guys only had 4 to 6 hours worth of work."
bad,"Fake people and very outdated methods. No work life balance. Not open to change. If it’s not in policy it’s a no go. Not treated equal, it’s all who you know and whose rear you kiss."
bad,Bad business ethics. Left company after they acquired G&K services. Cintas Management does not hold values of what they have in print media. Not a good company to work for.
bad,Nice work there if we more people only four people can do the job that what have say had nice manage just not engouh people for the plant the work was easy I could do it all
bad,Tell them what you want to do and that your a hard worker and quick learner. Ask them about pay. Make sure they explain about paid time off also ask him. Paid holidays
bad,Corporate Culture is what they call it.   It is a very stressful environment. Not much more to say. I met many good people that are committed and work very hard.
bad,"They like to hire people right out of college and mold them into their own. They pride themselves on their culture, yet it seems more like a cult. You can make some decent money... but forget about your family."
bad,"I was not paid enough at this job, it was not a good place to work. Not sick or paid time off until you have worked there is crazy. you were expected to go a full year without getting sick"
bad,I know that people are always putting bad reviews but sometimes its true. when first hired on told you will make more then what you actually make and then they tell you that you misheard even if you have proof. then training is inconsistent and does not change with time and keeps you from being ready.
bad,Cintas hire from within based on exceptional sales numbers not the ability to manage. This more thatn often leads to managers failing and good people leaving because of poor managers.
bad,"Training was terrible, one of the other supervisors was a complete jerk, manager spends zero time with you on the floor. HR Manager and General Manager are good. Other positions seem to be good, and Cintas is a good company. This particular shift sucks. The load team is slow as turtles and has zero respect for their superiors. They make your nights super long and they should be replaced before they hire another supervisor.  This problem has been allowed to continue. For the difficulty of motivating the unmotivatable, the hours, dirtiness of job, the long hours,  the pay is not good at all. Again, this particular job sucks."
bad,What started out as a great oppoortunity quickly soured. Unattainable bonuses and unreachable quotas lead to very high employee turn over. Management is over whelmed so not a lot of follow through in regards to customer service.
bad,"It was a brand new team when i started working there, management went way down hill when the initial management left, no structure of the team after that point."
bad,"Demanding & had to take work home most days. "
bad,Always taking things away from you. Revamping pay structure constantly. Do as I say not as I do kind of environment. Worked here for nearly 10 years... missed a lot of my kids functions. Glad to be gone.
bad,"No upward mobility; too many leaders that have no leadership skills; utilize intimidation tactics to try and ""encourage"" you.  Very old company.  Wants new ideas but not truly ready for them"
bad,My typical day at Cintas is getting the job done in a fashionable manner learning to be on time and alert to get the customer what they need  learning to deal with your employees and be the best that you can coping with what goes on on the floor keeping your area clean around you
bad,"Great Co-workers"
bad,"SSR route driving positions are  defined by every day sales numbers to the existing customer base u are serving that day, and u are expected while doing your daily run to solicit new customers while on your daily route, if your sales numbers are not what management expects you are told u will be demoted to a skipper or terminated. Every day starts off with a meeting about selling and how management considers any day without hitting the sales numbers they expect while u are out serving that day that u took ""a day off ""and did no work even though u physically serviced and satisfied customers uniforms, mats, and hand soap accounts for 10-13 hours which is a typical day. Tags put on uniforms to be repaired aren't done, but cleaned and returned with the repair tags still on them, shortage of mats being  clean to do the days run, so u are told by management to just shake out the existing ones and leave them down. Corporate atmosphere where the number 1 concern is about stockholders earnings, management is a club that cares only about itself and doesn't value employees and u are only as good as your last sale. Don't waste your time here."
bad,Company is great if one is looking to understand how organization works in corporate america.  Very structured organization and have not changed its policies and procedures for the last 10 years.  Company believes in its shareholders first not their employees and certainly not their customers
bad,"Management is willing to throw employees under the bus to save face. Good luck getting time off and when you do, they do their best to make you feel guilty about it. It's work first, family second. If you're hurt on the job, you're lying. Bad work culture. Blame for a lot of issues falls on the SSR, no one is held accountable"
bad,"tres physique,aucune posibilité davancement,aucun support moral,l aspect difficile ses d etre lesser a toi meme aucune collaboration de ton chef d équipe,le seule avatage ses tes assurance mais tu doit etre permanent pour les assurance,le seul aspect agreable les employé,,,,,,,"
bad,"a very regimented, stern environment. a typical day consisted of calling customers all day long without much opportunity to really assist them in their needs. There wasn't any time for research every minute was accounted for. the most enjoyable part of the job was the  group of people I worked with directly who all felt the same way & so we were able keep each other motivated. The hardest part of the job was lack of morale, never receiving a compliment though receiving a lot of criticism on the daily basis. I did learn corporate culture & I enjoyed learning about safety."
bad,Worked 5 yrs as SSR and did my job well. There was always some goals to hit and management was never satisfied. You put it a lot of hours in a four day work week. There's only a select few SSRs who are properly taken care of making good money and have helpers on there routes. Almost impossible to get promoted if you're doing job well. They cant seem to find people to tough it out to long cause of injuries or everyday pulling and bending. This job will wear you out and so will the management with the constant meetings saying you have to do better. Prepare to start early and leave late. And you still may have to run something out to customer on your way home cause management won't do it!
bad,"Management at this location is terrible! They don't care about their employees at all. Chances for advancement are nil. A $.09 raise is all you can expect to get regardless of how well you perform if you don't work in the office. Management doesn't appreciate the hard work of employees but are quick to point out every mistake you make. This place is where you want to be if you have no goals, no hopes, no dreams about your life and don't mind doing mind numbing, brain cell killing work day in and day out with little to no appreciation... The only good thing about this place-- no weekends!"
bad,"Document Management location."
bad,"Phone block with 50 or more calls"
bad,This is a turn and burn position. In a year or two you may see 75% of the Regions sales reps turned over. They will build you up at first and get you to put in your 60 hours a week and convince you to mislead prospects in order to close accounts involving company uniforms. The reality is you are locking them into a five year service contract where they will be subject to regular price increases. Sales overall has a poor relationship with service so don't expect a lot of help. Rough gig but the pay is ok.
bad,"The hours were extremely long for the small salary.  Management were a bunch of wolves, I felt like I was constantly walking on egg shells.  No job security whatsoever. The employees are constant complainers. Worst job ever."
bad,The job and Company was the most inconsiderate of family and their employees time. Unless you are a driver or upper management this company does not care about you.
bad,Management  is not the best and the company is not organized. lack of technology
bad,"Very busy office,I would have to train new management at least once a month because of high turn-around.I learned the SAP system.Most of the co-workers were nice ,but very stressed."
bad,Lots of shortages on my truck which happened consistently! Hard to get a day off! They screwed up payroll a lot then you always had to wait till the following week! You can't trust anyone in the work place! Management would always drag u into the office accusing u of saying this or doing that but wouldn't acknowledge you going out of your way for your customers! Trucks always breaking down and look rusty! Company says they are behind u but I figured out its all about making money! Worse company I ever worked for! Never again!
bad,"While at Cintas I have learned SAP, made good friends, and have learned about accounting for a corporation. My typical day of work was to make at least 70 dials a day to other businesses to collect on past due invoices. The position has not challenged me to grow nor is there fairness in chances for advancement. The management is unprofessional and inexperienced in their actions towards the employees."
bad,"A typical day at work would be independent, but will not be supported by management or training for changes that may affect the co-workers as well as customers."
bad,Local management does not care about the employees. It's all about the numbers. Employees work long hours for little compensation. No loyalty to long term employees.
bad,"They need to pay more, do the position your hired to do. The manager’s supervisor are friendly and open for the most part, I found myself coming in for my work schedule to do things I wasn’t hired to do."
bad,The only way to promote is to stab your manager in the back to get their job.  After working 15 plus hour days I was stabbed in the back so someone could get my job.  Laugh was on them when the same thing happened to them.
bad,Overall bad experience with routes and pay n management.i did not like the favoratism i experienced and the lack of attention there was to me while i was on route.
bad,Check you have got the right domain name or company.company is good .but according to work salary is less than .they put the pressure create everytime.
bad,"I loved my job, but was very demanding. Management was not available to me for help in adjusting my route so it was more manageabl. I had roughly 25 stops a day and drove over 1000 miles a week."
bad,"Loved servicing my accounts. Management pushed selling products at all cost, nevermind that the customer did not need anything or want for that month."
bad,"Cintas is a stable company, but you will find that the hours and effort you put in are worth way more than you get in return. Overall, the company and senior leaders don't care about the employees, but rather they care about what they can get out of them. This creates a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of shady practices, and creates a high level of burn-out (especially in management level positions). Front-line partners are paid well for their work, but if you are a supervisor/manager/people leader, you should expect to work about 70 hours per week and be paid very average salaries for your work. There is a poor hiring model that perpetuates an understaffed and overworked department. The company tries to create a culture that being overworked is a badge of honor to be worn with pride, instead of confronting this problem and trying to change it."
bad,On driver side plan on burn out by 6th yr. Managers asked to hold partners accountable and get fired when they do. CINTAS Fire HR is a joke and don’t treat managers with respect.
bad,Leadership was very unprofessional.  There was no structure regarding advancement within the company.  Conduct of managers was very poor with little accountability from the top down.
bad,"Advancement is not achievable at this company. All hiring for management is done from the outside. There is no promotion from within. If you are going to work in the uniform industry, try Unifirst or Aramark. They offer better pay and take better care of their employees."
bad,"Lot of management issues, too many meetings getting in the way of doing your job. No accountability on product being available to you. Nobody to follow up with when there was a issue."
bad,Trouble getting paid correctly. Other employees not doing their job properly making your job harder. Management hard to get ahold of/not doing their job.
bad,"No advancement, they keep and adding on to you all the while once your route grows to a certain amount, your commission decreases.  Awful model to motivate someone."
bad,"Working for the business itself was OK. The only thing I didn't like about it was the management. The management of any business can make or break an employee. They would pressure you to meet a certain quota, and if you did meet that quota, they would pressure even more. My experience there was not a most pleasant one."
bad,"Pathetic management. First interview lead me to believe they were hiring me and everyone told me I would receive $21/ hr for training. My first training day went well as I had previous experience with this work. Definitely need to wear gloves unless your okay picking up trash with your hands. After my 1st 10 hour shift I had to wait an hour for a 2nd interview they do after your 1st shift. Never recieved a call back after my first day of training and 2nd interview... about 3 weeks later I received a paycheck in the mail for the 1 day of working 9.5 hours picking up disgusting laundry and moldy mats to receive only $80.. I finally got ahold of Gene one of the managers to be told I signed a contract at 4 AM right before my shift stating I would only receive $80 the first day... So they got away with paying me $8.50/hr and called it ""Job shadowing"" as there excuse to pay me only $8.50/ hr. Basically everyone lied to me. You can tell they do not have good intentions. The salary ""commision"" reminded me of a pyramid scheme."
bad,"Great benefits and pay overall. If you like route sales and inconsistent leadership great option. It's all about who you know and who likes you when it comes to promotions and advancement.  Do your daily responsibilities you'll make money, just prep for the empty promises."
bad,"Opinions aren’t welcome, management wants you to keep your head down and work.  Keep your thoughts or differing ideas to yourself or quickly be labeled a cancer."
bad,"The work was fun and simple to complete. The leadership team allowed employees to bully and create a hostile environment for others. Despite my efforts to communicate the behavior, there was not change."
bad,A lot of different opinions on things. Would be told one thing then another would be done. The people and management work together its the way the company runs as a whole.
bad,"Long days with minimal life balance.  "
bad,When I first started here it was great. Management changed and it went downhill fast.   Would not recommend working here to anyone.  Dept. Managers started to leave it was unorganized and stressful
bad,"They bark production down your throat like dogs. GM is very nice, and walks around on the floor regularly. Workers are very moody and all complain. Goodluck."
bad,"Company provides a lot of opportunity to work in the different divisions.  Ability to advance in the company but sometimes there is a ""good old boys club"" mentality."
bad,The policies and procedures for this company are very out-dated.  They need to reevaluate their guidelines that will satisfy their employees and not just the customers.
bad,the Cintas in Decatur Ga. is a horrible location. They hold meeting every morning that hold you up when its time to start your work day. The leadership is horrible they show favoritism.
bad,It was a good experienced.Met friendly people.I get to do shipping and receiving.Learned about job safety OSHA etc.Get to talk to big bosses from other cintas location coz I was doing/installing new accounts.
bad,"Tremendious turn over. 150%+ turn over of production management, supervisors, crew leads in 2 years. Strong ""anti-union"" and retaliation to employee discussions re: inequity and random altered policies. Good place to be in sales... terrible place to be on production crew. Even worse if you are stuck on second or third shift. Payroll errors are common and very slow at resolve. Self- insured and claim to be above state regulation and human rights. Many English challenged production workers are stuck at low pay with minimal increase and their potential of promotion is non-existent... even demotion and pay cuts regardless to fact many of these are very productive, long term, and loyal  employees. Jobs and special classifications are made for those that best conform as local upper management appoints best paying jobs with addition (special) benefits. Sales and office seemingly has unlimited budget (annual office remodel for ""professional appearance"") where as production and maintenance is on tight budget causing needed repairs to be frequently held off from mid month to after next month's budget is released... Still unrealistic pressure from sales and service for expedited product turn over (frequently leading to high turn over of hard working production, receiving, and repair staff)."
bad,I dont have a review to say  about the company besides the bad managemnt styles and how the managment talked to people. That was my main issue depite the back breaking work.
bad,"What you do is never good enough, you are micromanaged CONSTANTLY. Treated like children. No matter how much you care about your job you are treated like a number."
bad,Management  was MIA. None of the Management has ever fulfilled the role of Sales. Therefore there is no consideration for what it takes to efficiently run a successful route sales position. Working remotely doesn't allow much time for family with travels averaging 300 plus miles weekly & actual service times per stops. Your day can run 10/14 hours easily. It's expected.
bad,Big company makes moving up very hard. They are always hiring from the outside no from with in. Insurance is not good and compensation is low. They only look at you like a number not a person
bad,"Overall the culture is painted as a beautiful picture, but is not carried out at the location. The pace is non stop and will not let up for one bit. Good place to gain knowledge about how a business runs."
bad,just was not a very worker friendly place to work. mamagement only cared about them selves and their bounus checks them the workers that were actually doing the work
bad,This is a terrible place to work at. Management treat you like a animal. Never seen anything like it.Please dont waste your time. Treat you very poor!
bad,"They have a hugs turn over, and depending on which group you work for they also have a different mind set. They have gone through so many drivers, sales, and safety trainers it's a wonder why they have not fixed the upper management."
bad,"Great for people new to sales, horrible for those with successful experience. Cintas seems to actively recruit candidates that are having success at other companies. This candidate quickly become irritated with the micromanagement. "
bad,"The biggest problem I see with Cintas is management. They don't Focus on customer service all they care about is the bottom line dollar. It's All About Numbers they don't care how many hours you put in or how long you been working whatever it is all about hitting the numbers they don't care about the SSRsthey don't care about production all they care about is numbers. So they can get their bonuses from my experience. If management would listen to their SSRs they might get better ratings. And it's too much of a buddy buddy system!! if you are a $2,000 account a week they'll get you everything you need if you are $300 or less you're not priority I've seen it with my own eyes!!!"
bad,Did not like when Management would not take full blame and basically trickled down to either new hires or lower in food chain. Management smile in your face and really could care less about really helping you to succeed. Had a nerve to try to  make me feel like I was a problem when really it's Management they need to be replaced they are out dated. Any Women who believes  in the year 2018 that other Women can't hold down a fulltime job and be a Mother and a Wife should be removed from any Management Position. I could not believe the she would even quote some awful out of date statements like that to other women.
bad,Very low moral for most employees.  High turnover rate due to low moral work environment.  Picked up somewhat when Shred-it merged with the Cintas Document Management Division.  Very slow opportunities for promotion and salary increase.
bad,"The culture at Cintas is that you place work over family and life.  They expect you to work weekends, late at night, answer emails and phone calls even late into the night.  Management will give you no formal type of training.  You will be asked to do task that are unsafe.  There is never a reward for doing good work they will only look at what you did wrong."
bad,Poor work life balance. Very early mornings that start at 4 am and continue to 4 pm. Everyone is too busy looking for who to blame than seeking a solution. Poor training and development.
bad,"Cintas seems like a great place to work but it is exhausting and cut throat. The management trains you to be deceitful and manipulative to customers from the very beginning. They only care about making a sale, they do not care about how it affects their customers. If you truly want to make a difference and help those you are selling to, Cintas is not the place to work."
bad,"Cintas Corp recently purchased G&K Services. Since the purchase of the company the career goals of G&K employees have been disregarded like they do not matter. Everyday there is complications and it has become a very stressful environment to work in. Everyone spends more time trying to figure out what is going on. Not even the corporate office knows. I also feel as though the G&K Employees are being treated less than, and not equal to."
bad,Not a super bad place to work if you like a disorganized business. Management has no clue how to run the place. When they get new customers they have no idea what they are doing and no plan what so ever. If you are working with someone else plan on doing all the work. They are more talk than action. They say things will happen and after asking 15 times and 2 months later nothing changes. Trucks have no heat. Suppose to work 6am-4 but hardly ever leave by 4 because you have to help lazy ppl that can’t do there job or load trucks after you ran a route all day.
bad,"at cents it is all about production, very poor culture and attention to employees, the work is very physical and demanding high possibilities of getting injured"
bad,"They are very corporate, they like to micromanage. They do not work with employees on concerns. It is generally their way and if you do not agree they will push you out the door. Do not reccomend working here"
bad,I would not recommend this company.  It involved long hours and little satisfaction.  The work-life balance was horrible and they only provide one week's vacation in the first year.  That leads to burnout and dissatisfaction.
bad,"Don't recommend, not a good environment. lots of disrespect between employees. leadership doesn't step up and lead by example. lots of personal things going on during workday."
bad,I was told I was a body in a chair processing paperwork. this was a long time ago and they have grown and I'm sure made changes within. it is a stable company and should be in business for a long time.
bad,I have worked at Cintas since 2013 and have repeatedly stressed my personal career goals and have not been taken seriously. I also experienced discrimination and racism in the past few months. With no real effort for resolve. And that is disheartening and shows the company's loyalty is only to and for the company.
bad,It's all about the bottom line. They tell customers that you provide a top notch service but at the end of the day they want you to deceive them by trying to sell them things they don't need. They only care if you hit your sales goals. They don't care how.
bad,Very physical position for very low pay..poor communication and very unstable.. Constant job cancellations and not guaranteed 40 hrs..and constantly sent to jobs blind
bad,"too much gossip for nothing. In fighting in the different area of work. The other parts are okay, but it is becoming a hostile work enviorment. I like the work but the people are becoming hard to digest"
bad,It's Ok to much favoritism going on and doesn't give you the opportunity to learn anything new bc they are short on staff. Always have to fill in for someone abd don't get appreciated.
bad,The company motto was is they have a door and a floor they were a potential customer. You were required to physically check in the morning and the evening. All paperwork for each sale was due at the end of the day
bad,"Cintas is a US based company that provides uniform, entrance map rental & now first aid services in Canada.  It's an interesting company with good values & company beliefs."
bad,"If you enjoy being your own boss.  Then this might be the job for you.  It was nice being able to kind of be on my own and not have a boss breathing down my neck all of the time.  But, I wouldn't go back there to work."
bad,"Nothing much to say, its a job. Its a job that pays the bills, and pays for the gas in my car and the food on my table. I really do not have much to say."
bad,The training program was descent with the majority of computer work requiring a lot of after hours computer time. The work weeks are short (4 days) but you will likely work at least 10 hour days initially. The pay is way too low considering the position is the backbone of the company.
bad,"Dishonesty from management is overwhelming. Bad place to work. Focused on numbers only, not customer service. Managers were selfish and only cared about themselves."
bad,"I currently work here and hate it. I am currently searching for something else. Management is a joke, no one wants to do their job, people talk behind everyone's back. "
bad,"A good company to work for and having said that the Bakersfield location has struggled with upper management problems for going on a year. My experience and personality could not prevent me from respectfully expressing my concerns, they fell on deaf ears. Two months after my employment was terminated the Plant manager was let go or quit, less than six months the General manager has been demoted to sales rep. and the HR manager quit or was let go last week, 7-01-2016. What a shame for the production partners, they deserve much better treatment than that. The place could benefit from a union presence, at least this location."
bad,"If you have served in the armed forces and you are a subpar employee then Cintas is the place for you, you will immediately be put in charge of things that you have no idea about to run into the ground as you wish. If you never found the need to serve but are an exceptional employee that knows how to do your job and do not need to be micro managed by supervisors that don't know how to do your job that I would stay away."
bad,"Worked at Cintas for 18 months. In that 18 months we had two General managers, two plant managers, three production supervisors, one maintenance supervisor and one regional Engineer. That should pretty well sum it up. The Bakersfield staff has little to know experience and do not communicate at all unless you are in their group or click. If you come from a real maintenance background you may find it hard to work into their mindset of maintenance. Regional managers not on the same page as local managers, two distinctive game plans from Production and Engineering departments on how to handle and perform the maintenance."
bad,-typical work day at this company consists of you coming in and logging on to your computer. you then review your a/r and get to work collecting on delinquent accounts
bad,"Cintas trained its employees to always go further."
bad,"This was a very boring job, unfortunately there wasn't and potential for  any growth, This made me feel very unsatisfied in my self and my performance."
bad,"Good company, great benefits, but does not offer a work/life balance lifestyle."
bad,"I would so not recommend ever working for Cintas. They say they care about you by calling all their employees ""partners"" but they only care about how much money you can make for them. To corporate, you're just an employee number."
bad,"I would never work for this company again. To them, you are just an employee number, not a real person. They say they listen to their employees, but they don't."
bad,"I worked in the First Aid & Safety division, so I cannot speak to other areas.  Hours were between 50-60 per week.  A lot of this time was spent driving as we covered much of the state of Arkansas.  A large part of pay was commission-based, so the more you spent driving the less you made in the long run.  "
bad,"The position was a outside sales route position and the  routes were sometimes two hours drive from office. The manager persisted on having a hour meeting every morning and a hour meeting in the afternoon, which left very little time to complete route and ultimately effected commissions."
bad,"Cintas was a job, low paying but had good hours and benefits. Not a place to have a career."
bad,We had to drive and grab all customers shreddables with in a time frame.  I had to miss lunch sometimes do to the time schedule and I only worked 4 days a week.  I had 32 or more stops a day to get finished.
bad,Cintas is good company but managed by not so good management staff. They often do not follow up.
bad,Really hot and fast paced work environment. It can get a little frustrating working here.
bad,Good overall company but has made substantial errors in judgement when hiring Managers and Supervisors. Most knowledge gained is by trial and error.
bad,"This job had excellent benefits, however this was a satellite location which has not yet established itself."
bad,good sales experience but do not value employees for how hard they work.
bad,"Management expected drivers to tell customers their prices were going up almost 5 times a year for the 6 years I was there. They do not care at all about employees and when someone does speak up they are asked to ""see the manager"" after the meeting instead of airing out the issue. There were many times when it would snow a lot and it would be a level 3 but we were expected to drive for them. If you didnt, no one would help you the next day so it was either drive in or work double day the next day with no help. GM was clueless and expected drivers to hide as much from customers as we could. When there was a union vote that did not pass every single person who voted yes was fired within the next 6 months for reasons like, ""not hittting your numbers"", which is absolute trash because out of 32 drivers there was 1 who was hitting his numbers and only because he had a massive account. I was fired because i forgot to have a customer sign an invoice for 4 dollars. The customer did sign my hand held device but that wasnt good enough for management because they believed I was one who voted yes for union. Joke is on them cause it wasnt me. My advice is to stay away from this company at ALL cost."
bad,long days.. how to deal with customers . management does not last long alot of turn over .
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. Poor management, antiquated systems, low compensation, treated like a kid, you train yourself"
bad,"Absolutely the worst job I have ever worked at! Management gives absolutely no guidance and only is interested in making their year end bonus. If you need a paycheck, Cintas will pay you every Friday. If you are an IT Professional, do your homework before you accept an offer."
bad,"If you like to put in 60 hour weeks, not make what you are worth, and have your supervisors take all the credit for your hard work then this is perfect for you! I worked here with 5 other college graduates and we thought we had won the lottery making $30,000.00 right out of college when most of our friends were making less at dead end jobs. Little did we know we were making hundreds of thousands of dollars for upper management and when we did the math on the hours we put in we were not making any more than our friends that had better jobs with better culture and bosses. I left here after one year and have never made less than what I made here. All of the jobs I've had since this are easier and I make more money!!!"
bad,One word HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! Management sucks and is a drama crazy work place.
bad,"Good place to work if you are a student, and you will get alone with everybody"
bad,The management makes the job worse than it should be. They use to care about employees but now it’s all about profit for shareholders at the expense of the workers. There is no room for growth. This is not a good place to be long term. The 4 day work week is only positive.
bad,Good company concerned more about the bottom line then being an employee of the company. Hard demanding work that requires you to work in all weather and long hours
bad,"Cintas was a decent job while I worked there. Nothing amazing, but definitely far from my worst job. Consistent hours on a weekly basis was typically the best part about the job."
bad,Your only as good as your last day. You become hero to 0 overnight. Very stressful as its a day to day job with many sleepless nights and long days each week
bad,"I'd depends what department your working in will determine your Job experience. "
bad,"Pros: Diverse work-place."
bad,Routes are all over...18-24 stops a day in a 40 mile range with traffic everyday....constantly getting tickets and stressing about how fast you can run in and out of an account without getting a ticket. Super stressful day to come back to plant to have the slowest checkout with a miserable employee after being out on the field for 10-11 hrs just wasn't for me.
bad,"Pros - The job isn't hard to learn , good benefits."
bad,This is a great place to work when you are young. Youll work a decent amount and not get paid much but you can still have time to do other things outside of work. Management sometimes changes goals and makes up rules on the spot. They are pretty crooked when it comes to contracting customers and tricking people into contracts. There are some benefits of working here but overall I would not recommend.
bad,"Company promotes a community type culture. Family atmosphere. Facilities are HOT and NOISY, unless you are a Manager or Administrative worker in an A/C'd office. Prepare to be on your feet all day long. Production work gets tedious. Expect you to play ""janitor"", because management didn't schedule enough work. Very hands-off, and seem to ignore safety concerns of employees, as if it's your fault if an injury occurs. The uniform/garment service industry is a hard work. Since takeover of GandK, managers seem overwhelmed trying to get facilities up to par with Cintas standards, while old GandK employees forced to cope. Often, I can tell there's no communication amongst those in-charge, as you are asked the same questions/issues occur, from different supervisors and Managers on an ongoing basis. If you are hired, be prepared to do jobs that you were not really hired for. Expectation of contantly helping others, while nobody sometimes to help you when you need it. I don't mind being a team-player, but some took advantage because of their laziness, or just not caring, or disappeared during shift altogether. On the outside face, Managers give the impression that nothing is ever wrong, and keep employees in the dark about issues that can affect them directly."
bad,Management sucks! Masters of the spin! Nothing is ever corrected. Problems will be resolved for two three days tops and things go back to how they were.
bad,"They only care about numbers, say open door policy but no such thing.  They don't give people a chance.  Supervisors cut throat they smile in your fac"
bad,"I learned it was not a place i did not want to stay. There were safety concerns, poor working conditions and pay were not equal. Working on equipment that deals with dirty water and processing was not sanitary. Management team was more worried about promotions than team building."
bad,"Plan on working as early as 4 in the morning for drive time and getting home at 9 at night. They tell you family first, but they mean work comes first, then family."
bad,The pay was very competitive but you'll be trading your life for it. Walking into work was like walking into a bad 80s/90s sales movie. It's also an incredibly competitive market.
bad,Customers are over charged and sold items they don’t need. Management tells the employees  inaccurate information to have the employees make the customers buy more. When the customers find out they are sold items they did not need or want management gives the customers credit and blames the route driver. This doesn’t fully impact the company because the route driver is charged back and it is taken out of your commission. This effects your weekly pay because you never know what your pay will be. This is basically a commission only job. They give you a base of $311 a week and commission but with all the hours you work the base is less then minimum wage. During the holidays you have to work 3 days a head at all times if you don’t you will loose money because management will give your stops away to a relief driver who doesn’t make any commission but the location and management will still get its quote for the month.
bad,There is a serious break down in communication form upper management to SSR's. When i worked there my direct manager had never preformed my task. They hire people right out of college to become managers threw there programs that normal folks can't join. They recently have been hire folks form out side to fill these manager positions and do not promote form with in. Several 5 plus year employees have left due to poor management.
bad,"Managers are often promoted through trainee programs not by merit of performance and time. Management is young, lacking experience, cut throat, and ill equipped to perform managerial task. This leads to poor customer service, confusion of task, dishonest decision justifications, and neglected employee's. The benefits though great must be fought for by the employee. The shady  processes of earning commission and shady young management hungry for the next promotion means that its almost impossible to know what an individual has truly earned."
bad,"Problems with management and major issue resolution. Excelled in my position but due to suspect decisions, decided to leave on my own terms in good conscience."
bad,things went sideways when Cintas took over Zee Medical. money got worst. stopped being able to open locations. spied on by supervisor. kind of weird to many useless conference calls
bad,"Loved my job but back when I worked there, I was sexually harassed constantly by management & peers and when I said anything about it, I was told to toughen up.  I even brought it to HR in my local location as well as corporate.  I did get an I'm sorry you worked here then because it was like the wild west back then and women weren't safe.  lol  Shameful!!"
bad,"Good co workers ,poor mgmt , trucks not kept up, 10hr days , 5 days a week , not 4 , lie., disappointed  customers,  always short items on load. Always an excuse, takes two to four weeks to get new uniforms for customers."
bad,Cintas is a great company but the management is terrible. Advance opportunities are created only for people inside the circle other wise is a great company.
bad,Good place to learn about the uniform business.  There will be many days that you will have to think is this what I want to do every day because of the many task that they ask you to do that haven't been done in the past.
bad,The supervisors there need to be more nice and willing to help there employees. There Job is to care what goes on in the workplace in they seem not to care.
bad,Long days little pay. Promised a promotion that never became reality. Long routes sometimes no helper. Some nice managers and supervisors that are willing to help.
bad,"Long hours, no support from management, Pay did not average out to what it should be for the work you did. Enjoyable part of job was being on your own."
bad,"depending upon position, each day is a surprise of what is expected and no plans ever stick. As a Service Supervisor I was not ever performing my job description (I was constantly a fill-in for missing delivery drivers)"
bad,Has the potential to be a great workplace. Benefits are great but the management is the worse I have seen in 10 years. They do a lot of false promises and lie to cover their butts. Charges customers for products not received.
bad,"As much as they push their productivity numbers, you would think they have a productive ""system"" but they don't. They ask alot of people and don't have their own monitoring and have an antiquated paper system. This leads to less productivity and little support for people in the field as well as in the office."
bad,"This could be a great career but company is moving in the wrong direction. They put pressure on you to do too many different jobs at once, while pushing you to sell products to customers who might not necessarily need them. The micro managing of employees is out of hand and causes so much daily stress on the job."
bad,A lot of friendly people to work with. A lot of long hours with low pay. A lot of deliveries. I did learn about customer service. The management was pretty poor. Really learned everything on my own.
bad,"I worked here as a SSR for only one week before I found out how horrible it actually is. They are so low on people due to the high turn around rate, that they can't properly train you. As soon as your 39 days training is complete they throw you onto a random route and expect you will know where to go and who to see. ( These days will take 15+ Hours. It will take you over a year to get your own route.) "
bad,Managers are required to work 50+ hours a week and most weekends. Salary is only based on 40 hours a week with no other compensation. Cintas needs to approve their work/life balance.
bad,Not worth it.   It's a job what else.   Bad management. Early morning bad equipment.  Workers are good but they are over worked.   Management bad.
bad,"Great people to work with but you are mainly on your own all day except for the customers you visit. There is a HUGE learning curve and you are expected to learn quickly and be on your own after a few weeks. You are expected to increase your sales through selling customers things they don't actually need in their first aid kits. You are also expected to learn the other products the company offers in terms of safety like gloves, respiratory equipment, glasses etc. This as well on your own. The pay is very low for what they expect. They also track your every move as to where and what you are doing. You drive around in a set territory in a van that as well you are expected to keep up inventories in order to make sales. In order to increase sales you need to bring on new customers, sell items customers don't need, sell safety products, - which you have to learn about yourself. You are warrant to the elements as you work outside part of the time getting product from the van. The customers rely on you to know the OHS guidelines which you have to research and figure out for yourself what is expected. You mainly learn from the other reps who all have their own way of doing things. No consistency and no procedures in place to ensure you are following the OHS guidelines. You do set your own hours so if you start the day early you can finish early (around 3-3:30 pm) but you have to keep up with emails, dropping off catalogues to new customers, extra sales in order to make better money. The company was originally Zee Medical and is now Cintas - numerous changes within the organization and"
bad,"The Co-workers are all friendly.About safety its all updated,the facility is very nice and clean.The benefits was excellent.But the 25 cent salary increase every year is no good!!!!"
bad,Company has been reducing employee compensation every year for the last 15 years. Turnover is extremely high and management is subpar.
bad,"This job is designed to consume your life.  They continually demand more of you, all the while paying you less and less.  Once they began the garment scanning program, they took may customers away from routes to allow time to scan each garment every time.  That would have been fine if not for the fact that we get paid on ROUTE VOLUME!  Many employees took a financial hit of 5 to 10 thousand dollars a year due to this ridiculous decision.  After this, they began hemorrhaging employees. They began only hiring very young employees that had no dedication, skill set or heart.  Employees who are literally hurting the brand."
bad,"You work long hours, didn't learn much.The management is always changing rules and keeps making us work more overtime.All the workers are good people and fun to work with."
bad,Friendly work environment but it can get UNCOMFORTABLY hot in production. For this to be the most profitable location in the Midwest the pay could be a lot better for everything they want you to do. There is NO overtime they will make sure you clock out not a minute after. This company is better for students on summer break and should not be looked at as a career.
bad,loading clothes in cages to send to joplin and roll up mats management was poor unloading smelly clothes getting to use forklift
bad,"Was terminated for missing work for doctor appointments.   Wasn't aware that if you miss more than 24 hours of work in a 90 day period for ANY reason you will be fired.  The job itself wasn't too bad.   Alot of room for error.   If you have more than 2 errors within a certain amount of time you will be fired.   Alot of turnover at cintas,  everyone getting fired for ridiculous reasons.   Started out making 8.85 per hour as a garment processer."
bad,I enjoy talking with customers and helping them with anything that I can do within reason and company policy.
bad,The management is horrible and unable to deal with in-house issues. I worked above and beyond what was asked for me and when given a promotion they waited two months and I never saw the 'promotion'. Was being bullied and walked all over and HR and management did nothing. They lost a good worker who loved their job even though the pay was bad.
bad,"Co-workers were very nice and helpful"
bad,"Typical day consist of 40-80 dials, 10-15 foot cold calls, 3 appointments, sizing employees and meetings."
bad,the job was mundane repeatitve easy work. you could get along with  your coworkers and have a pleasant day. they offered health benefits. but did not give you time to use them.
bad,"I was a CSR/scheduler and had a great trainer, however, management didn't see it that way. Every time something was done, they would say"" we want it done this way"" so I'd change it  and then it would change again. They claim to be big on the Cintas policy, but I can tell you that it depends on who you are if it's ok to "" break policy rules"".  I felt like it was a thankless job.  Constantly micro managed!!!"
bad,"The SSR is overworked.  It's a hard physical labor job starting at 5:30 am and rarely finishing before 5 pm.  Then you have to come and deal with check in and csr reps that do nothing to help you with customers basically just message takers,  then you deal with managers that are never satisfied.  Raises are a joke, and so is support you are truly on your own out there.  Thank God for the other drivers because they go through what you do you have there support.  They put you in a truck all day that's from 1995 no air and sometimes no heat in the winter."
bad,"Worked at Cintas IT for a little over a year and found the management to be absolutely terrible. Meetings to have meetings, lacked direction and new ideas. Most importantly, Cintas spends it time and money shoving their ""Culture"" down your throat and no absolutely bare minimum on technology and processes to make the company more efficient!"
bad,"long days they tell us sell sell sell then we dont have the products to deliver, misc charges on invoices really anger the customers ive been in the uniform industry for 15 years this company is the worst"
bad,Cintas presented themselves has a driven company with employee advancement and opportunity as their main goals which proved over the course of a year as a ploy.
bad,"Too much work for one person as an SSR and if you ask for help for at least one day they would say no unless your route does a lot of money. Every day a lot of stuff wasn't loaded on the trucks, things were wrongfully loaded."
bad,"While working here started off okay, because its very easy and simple in training. Timing and speed is everything. The hours are great. The only thing bad about it is the smell of the clothes, working in the different temps."
bad,Management is more worried about getting done with the job. Keeping the customer happy is not a priority. Quality of customer service is lacking. It can be a fun job.
bad,"If growth within the company means work for a year to receive  pennies on the dollar, then growth here is excellent.. I moved/ advanced through 4 positions within my 5 years at this company with little pay increase. New guys at positions I was promoted from cane in making significant amounts more than me cause we all were being paid under pay scale for our positions. should have left sooner"
bad,"I worked for Cintas for 3+ years. "
bad,"I was brought in under the promise of teamwork environment, I quickly realized there was no support for partners that are below supervisor/management.  Would be a great place to work if dollar signs didn't mean more than the condition of lower level partners.  Staffing is at critically low levels, but workload continues to increase."
bad,"They don't care about you, they want you to hush and do what they tell you. If you don't kiss their but, you'll be micromanaged to the extreme.  HR acts like your friend, but then she goes around tattle tailing on you."
bad,The best part of the job is the work life balance. The pay is not adequate but not exceptionally gratifying relative to the workload. Benefits are decent for a large corporation.
bad,Some days it was a fun day depending on the people with you on shift. Other days it was miserable. the biggest downside was the fact you dealt with on a daily basis product so gross and dirty most garbage disposal workers would lose their lunch. yet only got paid $11/hr after a raise.
bad,"Dealing with Cintas customers and co workers was great however management in a few department's are lacking any type of leadership and are more concerned woth covering their own backs than leading their teams."
bad,"I will begin with the pros of this position. It is a 40 hour work week with weekends off. They offer a decent benefit package. It is a stable company that doesn't lay people off. Now for the list of cons. The expectation placed on individuals is very unrealistic. The pay is not the greatest. Don't expect a huge pay raise. Raises are based on an annual review. The management team knows next to nothing about fleet operations, therefore the reviews are rather biased. The more an employee takes the initiative to perform tasks, the amount of duties will increase. A fleet mechanic works solo, which is not safe. Cintas is huge on safety, but they neglect the safety of the person responsible of keeping their fleet operating safely. Up until recently Cintas has been extremely reactive, opposed to proactive. If you need help from management, good luck. More than half the times the front office is vacant. Most of the managers are out to lunch, golfing, out on the water or just nowhere to be found. When you do find one, chances are they are to busy to help. The company culture makes you feel as though this is the best you can do and after time you actually believe it. Trust me, you can do better. Good resume filler or stepping stone, but not the place to invest your entire career at."
bad,"From the Corporate level the Principal objective means something.  from the local level, the principal objective is discussed not not followed.  Don't expect to be coached or guided in your career. I was with the company 11+ years and left the company due to lack of customer service philosophy.  Cintas pushes you to assume you know the customers needs without asking.  Management is not honest about cutting routes and general information.  the routes have been split so much the a beginner sales service rep needs to have a 2nd job."
bad,"Management only cares about earning their bonus's. They promise a salary that you will not get. Everything is always the SSR's fault. There is too many people in charge, but only one manager cares about the well being of the employees. I loved working for CINTAS at first, but over the last two years it has gotten way worse.  They have broken multiple HR policies/laws. as well as jerk around the pay of almost every SSR at this location.  Multiple people have come from other locations loving working for CINTAS, then come to Frankfort and are miserable and way underpaid compared to their last location. I liked being out on route and talking to customers, but hated having to tell them their items are not ready yet because the plant cannot keep up."
bad,"Cintas overall was not a bad place to work, it was a B2B positions which worked well for me, but the management was very poor. The manager I had was good, but did not know how to ""direct"", was not a leader, more of a pusher. Which was unfortunate. Advancement was not something that they do often, and I was ready to become a manager."
bad,Would be much better to work here if the management was better.We have a couple really good managers but we have more poor management that you cannot get help from if you need to
bad,As third shift supervisor had to arrive one hour prior to shift start and would normally remain 3 hours after shift end for staff meetings. Not fully manned shifts causing delays in production.
bad,If you have a family I do not recommend a Sales position with this company hours are very demanding. Its not hard to work 12- 14 hrs a day. Management could not tell you in which direction to go for answers.
bad,"It probably depends on location. But the Greeley CO. location is full of management that is below par. Got to be in their circle to benefit. Have a couple SSR that don't care about anything, and have had people interview and ride along that would benefit company."
bad,"Most employees are seasoned employees, as well as most of the mid-management. Upper management has less time with the company. Mid-management has no idea how to train other supervisors or managers who are new to the company. Shipments and inventory are constantly inaccurate, leaving others the nearly impossible task of searching for items and cleaning up the mess. "
bad,You make decent money but unless your good friends with upper management no advancement opportunities and also some of the upper management act very childish and if you mess up your labeled for the entire time you work there. You almost never get a break unless you get done early enough to clean up and do anything extra then have time left.
bad,"Unloader / Loader position ;"
bad,A Fun And Productive Place To Work With Limited Opportunities to move up in the company. Management exploits their employees miss use them and sends them on jobs with inferrior supplies and equipment to complete the task at hand. This Company also terribly over charges their costomers
bad,"If you start out as a SSR, be prepared to work early (5am), hard, and have to deal with many potential problems that were not of your making. For example: you have a route that has 55 stops that particular day, and over the course of the day you are supposed to deliver 5000 shop towels and 1000 white aprons among many other products, but production only had 3000 shop towels and 100 aprons. You know before you even head out that several customers are not going to get what they paid for and are going to be unhappy with you, and even though it's not your fault, it's productions fault, you are SUPPOSED to take the blame and run the product out on a different day on YOUR time to make up for the shortages. That is a typical day in the life of an SSR there. I did it well for 6 years, but if you are not the type who can roll with the punches and have a hard time taking blame for something that wasn't your fault, DO NOT WORK HERE! The example I gave above happens almost every day, it's a common occurrence there, and if you're not an accountable person who protects the customer and gets them what they pay for even when it's not your fault, you will hate this job!"
bad,First Aid Division is quickly losing out to stiff competition
bad,"People in the office never answer their phone and do not know what they are doing. GM was a SNAKE! All he cared about was getting his bonus while he and the office loaded you with work. Doesn't matter if you finish or how hard you work, they just keep piling it on. No room for advancement because they do not hire within. No paid holidays. And if you told the GM you wanted switch to dif departments, he would sabotage the opportunity. You would have to go behind his back in order to work at a different department. To top it off he left the company with just a days notice without saying goodbye"
bad,Managers are cut throat. They blame workers for their deficiencies.
bad,"Revolving door company. New employees come and go too quickly. I worked at Cintas for 5 and half years to long. Started work at 6am and got lucky to be off by 6pm. Hard physical labor on the route and then came back to the office and had to deal with managers who were NEVER happy. Managers always had the ""I don't care what AWESOME thing you did for me yesterday, I only care about what awesome thing you did today"" Attitudes of managers were horrible. They use the manager scare tactic for their employees. Everyone there was afraid they would lose their job at any moment. Cintas didn't care about the customers who pay their bill or the employees who busted their butts to service the company. They only cared about growth and the investors. I was on a route and my route was transferred to another plant and I had to drive much further to work. Once again they didn't care. Once there the managers dismantled my route that I had worked hard at building relationship with customers and gave me a whole new route with tons of ""window time"" on a commission based job. No money was made for the 1st hour and half to my 1st account of the day due to the job being commission. The accounts were small and they gave all the big money accounts to the RSS that had been with the company for 25 years. Avoid this company."
bad,All partners beyond the upper management were great to work with. Managers at this location set unrealistic expectations. Nothing is ever good enough.
bad,They need to give over time to make stuff run smoother and they need to give more pay for jobs instead of spending it improving the place. And new employee should work they first year before getting vacation time when hired after they do they 90 days. They should give it when they do they first year like I did
bad,This is the only place I know preaches about promoting from within but only for a select few people. Honesty is first on my list for companies I worked for but here at Cintas management believe there own lies.
bad,There was not enough people to assist with the workload and it was a very stressful environment and long hours. There was not enough training given. I did however enjoy the people I work with.
bad,Always missing product. High turn over.  Management is lazy and does not care to help the drivers. Management staff always changing. Never have what you need to be successful. Run!!!
bad,Good benefits while it last. No attendance point system. Very strict. Use your PTO time. The rate is ridiculous and impossible to make with poor equipment that you use.
bad,"Wont fire a guy for insubordination but will have 6 more meetings with him reminding him of him being on his last insubordinate write up. Guy is hostile, grandfathered in (didn't have to take testing for his job), brings gun parts in to work, works on spent ammo for doing reloads, and repairs triggers to guns all on company time. Brought these very big concerns to management and it had continued to be brushed off. It seems to be a gun violence situation in the making. The company fired a 14 year employee for sending a text to another employee when he called off the text was 2 emoji one clapping hands and the other a pistol. Company said zero tolerance. Blown out of proportion. Partner could have been going to gun range had many days of vacation to use or lose. All the while a hostile angry, mean partner has gun components and ammo on premises and working on them while getting paid. "
bad,"Company has Good Pay, Benefits and Hours...Management is off having lunches, ""Team Building"" at the golf course...Fridays the plant is empty...only support staff is there...This has just become common place.  Managent, Hmm...Well, let me start off by saying no matter what they hide from doing work..answering your problems. Always make procedures that put most work on the Drivers or SSR's. God forbid they dont like you they will find a way to get you out. They hire mostly Military so they get the tax breaks and so they can work these poor guys to death. Military folk don't ask questions and the Management likes that. The Drivers were all great...Honestly I would probably still be working there now b/c of pay and benefits but I started to make to much and they got rid of me without any blemishes on my record! Just said I could not work there anymore...told me to hand in my stuff and they would not even give me my vacation...Yes, I am bitter..lol but I am being honest as that was a long time ago....Good luck in your search!"
bad,"it was an ok job, good friend how Love to work, to many favor going to some people but not the same for other, they need new personal in the office to make thing better"
bad,"Was there for years and got passed over constantly for promotions. Terrible pay, someone just hired makes more than someone who’s been there because terrible raise standards. GM is a joke and complains about everything. No overtime available. Waste of time."
bad,"Have you ever dated someone you saw so much potential in, but he repeatedly let you down and broke your heart, and you began to realize there were actually much better guys out there? Working at Indeed is like that."
bad,"As a service rep, I loved this job! Once I moved into management things changed. No work life balance. 60-70 per week and I was on salary. Very stressful. Leading a team of 10+ while running a route for service . I didn't even work in service. Exceeding expectations, they claimed. A great company but hires terrible mangers. Upper management never notice these issues.  Of course they were suppressed by local  managers."
bad,There needs to be more of an emphasis of partner engagement. it's very all work no play. it's boring. I wish management didn't favor certain employees also...it's awkward when someone doesnt speak to you and walk right past you
bad,"Stood in one place for 10 hours per day (mandatory OT almost every day), worked with women who had a high school mentality/drama. Wasn't the place for me."
bad,"coworkers are great to work with-make the day go by fast. Supervisors and management have no personality and rarely friendly. Do have favorites which clearly are ""right"" even when wrong and will always justify that. "
bad,"Cintas is a high pace and high stress environment. It has too much turnover and lack of proper management.  I have worked their almost 30 years.  Things seem to get worse every year not better."
bad,"Every day is a surprise on what you do and do not have on your truck for the route. Most times, you will not realize you are missing product until you get out on the road. If you do catch the missing product, management does not help/they question you like you are stealing product. There is a lack of individual direction from management, and will not assist you with any issues you may have."
bad,Operate machines. learned people skills and learned machine operating. Management was successful. Good people to work with. Very fast paced at times .
bad,Great place to work if you like doing things half baked.Management does not care about job being done right just get it done under budget and make them look good. Showed management proof of other employee's lack of doing the job per NFPA standards.I got the short end of stick. I can go on with examples.
bad,Lots of cold calling and working extra hours just to do the minimum.  Mostly contests and selling products the company needs but using that to trick them into a contract and then raising prices.
bad,"I worked for Cintas back in the 1980's and always wanted to work for Cintas again. I was working in the A/R department, and the requirements were almost impossible to achieve. And also if they felt like they could not assimilate you to their thinking, then you were not a good fit. It was like working for a Cult!"
bad,"Like many I have had an interview with Cintas that went so well I was told that before I left I would be interviewing with one or two other members of management and that their interviewing process was thorough and would entail several meetings with various members of management. Well the people He wanted me to talk to were gone so he told me to call back in a couple of days if I hadn't heard from Him and even gave me his personal cell number. After repeated calls with no return or any answer to the multiple messages I left I finally gave up. I've been in route sales over 13 years and I'm qualified to be a mid-level manager at least even though I was applying for a route driver position. I wouldn't give them my time of day now. The most unprofessional and inconsiderate group of idiots I've ever seen. Oh, make sure everyone knows this was at the Bessemer, Al branch. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"There is no room for advancement unless you have worked here for 10+ years. "
bad,Cintas is a great company but it's very corporate. I would have enjoyed my job here if I had a safer territory and a manager that I liked. I took this job so that I could get into pharmaceutical sales.
bad,"Cintas is a good company, but the sad part is after they brought in new management for their office and Branch Manager at the Joplin/Webb City location it changed a lot.  After I left the company they fired the Branch Manager and the Office Manager immediately put in her two weeks notice but only stayed for one week and left the company.  Since I have left the company I have heard some great things of the new Branch Manager, that is good for the current employees."
bad,Not challenging enough. Stuck on a computer all day. The pay couldn't make up for the atmosphere that was there at Cintas. People kept to themselves and didn't bond. Each day dragged on long.
bad,"Worked at a small shredding company. Great place to work. We never missed a stop! Then we got gobbled up by Cintas! Their crack management staff doubled our routes. Couldn't get everything done in 10 hrs. Within two years they lost half the accounts!!  Very large accounts!!  This is a ""Last Resort"" company!!  However,they do supply you with quality uniforms!!"
bad,"Get to work at 5 AM to 6 or 7 PM. I learned that to corporations you are only a number, I worked for this company 18 plus years and they let me go without following procedure. Management will protect their own interesrs, my co-workers were great except for one or two. The hardest part was having to document employees for being truthful and making simple mistakes. The most enjoyable part was that I was able to create a positive atmosphere within my team and being able to help them provide a better life for theor families."
bad,management acted like they care about you in the beginning then you realize you are just another employee i was recently let go for being sick with doctors notes and everything i even had 3 vacation days left and they let me go......
bad,"competitive work place,piece rate job,work very hard for little pay"
bad,The job itself is a pretty nice job.But the rules and inforcement of them vary week to week. They are always changing your duties and do not do a very good job of telling everyone. They also like to blame others when things go wrong. The management seems to be more in the way of getting the job done.
bad,"More interested in how the company apprears than the quality of the product. We needed to dress mice, but never saw customers. Yet, employees would occasionally brush off customer. Not a good business tactic."
bad,Long days but only worked 4 days a week. Strenuous on the body and a lot of driving. I enjoyed meeting new people along the route. Management was very fair and honest.
bad,I appreciated my experience with the company as it prepared me to reach higher levels of experience and compensation. There wasn't room for advancement in the position I took but the pay was decent and the people friendly.
bad,"I worked overnight as a garment hanger in jacksonville fl. I was NOT trained properly, although it's simple work, and the supervisor was apparently bi polar, screaming at me and talking down to me. I had to make a hard decision to not go back, to avoid losing my temper with her, now I see they need help again, and I just landed a better job!"
bad,The plant manager was Awesome. The supervisor was a religious bigot and racist. The Supervisor treated the women poorly. He was always pushing way too hard.
bad,"Very stressful when you first start. Depending on your department, you might be getting paid incentive. Which means they pay you for how much work you do, the more you do the more you get paid, but it’s not easy to high numbers and get good money. Another thing, you checks will never be the same if you’re in an insensitive position, each week will vary it all depends on how much you produced. They really suck with giving people their yearly reviews. Everyone sucks at communication, from the managers to the supervisors to the leads. People come and go as fast as they get hired. Overtime woul highly not recommend working here."
bad,"The managers are beyond fake, base pay is super low, other employees just stuff cabinets making every customer hate you. Unrealistic goals. Also suppose to pay you $80 for your training when you ride along with someone. And they never paid me, just beat around the bush and gave me lame excuses. 6 months have went by and this lousy billion dollar company can’t even pay $80. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time"
bad,This place has understaffing issues lots of plenty work but not enough workers back breaking and Spanish speaking workers are the partners that work here friendly partners but not enough workers
bad,Cintas workers needs better pay because they are making enough money.They pushed the warehouse working while management chill in the lunch room then go home early.
bad,"Cintas, the company is a good and fair company, it's the management they hire that makes for a stressful and poor environment. Management who does not think outside the box and is not trained on Diversity."
bad,"Do your job, make judgment calls, deal with issues others could handle, run random routes, certain managers are lazy and make your life and their team miserable. 5:30 meetings, work a 12 hour day/any less and you're questioned, even though you handled your responsibilities for the day. Politics"
bad,"I enjoy delivering to my customer base, making sales, getting leads, and most of what my day involves. Being trained through sessions, one on ones, through training on demand (internet) and the daily grind has made me a well rounded service/sales man. My coworkers are great, and my day is mostly filled with smiles. My management is brutal. I am regularly on the top of the board for numbers, but I get overlooked and bullied. It has become too much to overlook at this point."
bad,"No thrills employee perks."
bad,* Grow existing national clients through the sale or rental of uniforms
bad,"Hard work, fast paced job."
bad,"The job culture was not for me. We were scripted in what we were allowed to say to clients, which was unnatural for me. Though I embraced the culture at first, it became clear that they wanted clones, and not innovation, regardless of the success it would bring. My team and I personally was reprimanded for being awarded 4 complimentary letters from clients in my short time there. The ""turn and burn"" mentality of sales was one I could not get on board with, and that was reflected in my management and my people. I motivated in a different, more nurturing way with both my people and my clients. "
bad,"Very diverse working atmosphere,ability to grow within the company,however their point system for being tardy or sick is horrible for new hires"
bad,"Schedule techs, met with management on revenue projections, numerous pot lucks."
bad,"Cintas says there's opportunity for advancement but every time a position becomes available, they hire someone from outside the company. Management doesn't listen to employee ideas. Moral is low. Pay is low. Employees aren't happy. No one acts like they care about their job. Management expects employees to ""go above and beyond"" but don't want to pay employees to do so. Bringing problems to management's attention is a waste of time because they say ""oh well"". If management doesn't care, why should the employees?"
bad,Pay was very decent but management was very unfriendly and coworkers were worse I felt like i was working by myself. The training was poorly orchestrated and my trainer was a tad bit weird.
bad,"Cintas is a very stressful workplace they dont like to work with you. Hardly any holidays off. Christmas day, thanksgiving, labor day, memorial day, and the 4th of july.  Barely gives raises, if your not kissing butt you want get far there."
bad,"I resigned from my position due to the poor management skills of the office manager and the AR employee that is the definition of a delegator. Don't  ask for help if you work in AR because you'll be given a schedule rather then the manager helping you review your workload. You can't ask AR questions because you'll be told they have a stress ball they hold every time they hear your voice. You are given credits to enter by a variety of people but you are told to enter what benefits AR numbers first everything and everyone needs to wait. You are not allowed to work overtime yet at month end you are given multiple checks to enter which can take an hour to post, you need to hurry up and they are given to you throughout the day. "
bad,"I loved all the people I worked alongside"
bad,"Good company bad management,will not recommend working for this company they want you to service customers and you dont have the supplies to service the customers"
bad,"You are given PTO time to use how ever you want to use them. When you call off it is a big no no and you are given a big speech. If you schedule a time off then management is happy. Direct supervisor likes to call workers names such as ""sandbagger"" . Cintas wasn't bad place to work at first but when routes were reduced you were not aloud overtime. When ever anything went down or day got behind you were expected to stay over. Next day supervisor would come tell you that there isn't any overtime and you were told when to clock out. When I first started was great place to work. Then after a year they changed."
bad,"I really enjoyed working for a company that offered full benefits, but the management and lack of communication was very frustrating to deal with. I learned that when communication lacks, production and sales are hindered from distributing customer orders at it's fullest potential."
bad,"Cintas is an average company I will say, sincethe Management team sometimes  take advantage of their partners as they call them, I understand the job must be done, however I don't think it was fair while I was there for few months...again this is my personal opinion as a Production Supervisor."
bad,"Lots of nepotism. Boys club mentality. Manager ex-military and could be disrespectful to underlings. Benefits ok, but sometimes not enough. Almost filed for under employment."
bad,"The Position was posted as Accounts Receivable, but it is really call center COLLECTIONS. The first 2 interviews went smoothly and were enjoyable, but the third interview was like a hostile interrogation - with a manager from a different department. I feel the company was dishonest with their posting. I would not have applied for a collections position. (Was not offered the position, nor would I have taken it.)"
bad,"low pay for alot of work crammed into a shift.  "
bad,Everyone works together to get the job done and to have successful daily outcomes. One has to be on task and stay on task to do what's needed pertaining to his or her particular job title.
bad,Face paced environment. lots to keep up with and changes on a daily and weekly time frame. Need to stay on top of the constant changes and maintain your business.
bad,"working for cintas was very challenging. Mentallydraining andincluded long days that started early as 5am..Also involved driving in large trucks, hauling dirty uniforms and magget infestedbags"
bad,This job had a good starting pay but the physical workload was very heavy and the amount of stops expected to complete in a day was near impossible for some routes.
bad,considerar q la globaluzacion es sinonimo de progreso y supervivencia a corto plazo en el caso de este pais.
bad,"A few years back I applied here and after two interviews was told I was going out with a sales route associate (or whatever they called it) for a day of 'training' to see if I fit."
bad,"Experience can be very different depending on branch location and management, current focus, and if actual job responsibilities and opportunities accurately reflect those given when initially considering employment for the position."
bad,"they only hire part time workers and more often than not, they don't have any work available. management is so so, because low level managers are okay but upper management don't really interact with us."
bad,"I'm thankful for the job skills that I have gained while being employed here, but they do not compensate their employees considering the duties and responsibilities."
bad,"Great job for out of High School, college graduate. Had a great experience. Would recommend to family and friends."
bad,This was a route cleaning service. We had water tanks in the back of the vehicle. the water and hoses froze in the winter. Time devoted to getting things flowing dramatically effected service.
bad,"This is very difficult work.  The hours are quite substantial and due to salary, there is no incentive for the hours"
bad,"After being hired, Both Managers were fired plus one of my fellow mechanics."
bad,Answer a multi-line switchboard phone and determine nature of business and direct callers to destination. Type memos and process mail. Make future appointments and answer inquiries.
bad,"I would deliver clean uniforms and pick up the dirty ones.I learned how to efficiently run a route,and I learned time management and thru trail and era of doing things right the first time.I got along well with co-workers ,but management was to overbearing."
bad,"I was contacted for an initial interview as a route driver/ sales.. I was told that I was being referred for a face to face interview. Never happened. After a month of repeated phone calls to the local office were not returned, I contacted corporate e-mail for assistance.I know the interviewer got chewed out, as I received a voice mail call after hours, stating I could return call for more explaination, which I did. The result was that a management trainee was put into the position and that position would again be open in three to six months. Why do they bother to advertise and interview applicants, when the positions will be filled by trainees? I felt cheated, used, and disheartened by the process, and may have second thoughts about ever applying with this company again."
bad,"Ive given Cintas 3 Plus years of dedication. Recently I have applied to a position at a different location. I didn't get it for some reason. They want you to apply in the internal job board but it doesn't give you any advantages over someone from the streets. Favoritism is a big part of the problem here. The commission isn't fair at all. You get 3% every 1,000 till you hit 11-13K. Then it drops down by a half of percent. Now it is a very easy job physically, You only work 4 days a week with your day off depending on the route your chosen for. This job does teach you a lot about Customer service and selling promotional products. They make sure you don't ""work"" more than 10 hours a day. Im only getting away because my family and I are relocating. At hire date you will be told about possibilities of income that is no way possible. Its not about how hard you work here but how much you impress upper management. With working at a depot you gain love and respect for your co-workers. Your like a big family. Unfortunately nobody is paid enough to help with your bills."
bad,Great people but the actual job was tedious. They started caring more about quantity than quality. Then bought another company and added more work for us making us fall behind so that we had to come in on Saturdays. I'm not sure if they ever caught up
bad,"I absolutely loved my job as a First Aid and Safety sales rep. However, that was cut short by a horrible termination of 4 people in less than 3 weeks. Would NEVER recommend this job to anyone if they were looking for a long term position. Management was amazing, upper management, not so much. I was let go due to not being able to parallel park, sideways while other employees before me never had to do. They terminated our GM for something that happened at a Christmas party that had nothing to do with the company. Steer clear of this company if you want to have succeed in your career."
bad,"Cintas is not a bad company to work for, I suppose I just managed to find the location that wasn't the best to work at. The people were friendly enough, although there were a couple of bad apples. Some would do things to intentionally get out of working. . ."
bad,"Every morning I get up at around 4:30, get to work around 5, do my paper work, run my route and I'm usually home at 1:30. I'm off! . . . . That is until I get bombarded with phone call after phone call after phone call. Complaints complaints and complaints. Not from the customer but from management themselves. They are really big on saying ""Its YOUR route"" that is true as long as they get to dictate how you run it. The plant partners are lazy and will sometimes not wash your clothes nor load it on your truck. The pay is good but not worth the headache management gives you."
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Make as many calls as possible to find out payment status, send missing invoices to customers, make payments on behalf of customer with saved information every month, apply misapplied, or unapplied funds with customer approvals. Management was ok. But I was written up for doing things that I did not know were incorrect ways of doing things. The hardest part was making contact with customers who were in Chicago and an hour behind. Makes it hard to call them when you leave an hour earlier and the time difference was difficult to maintain. Enjoyable were the meetings every week to see what our overall numbers were for the previous week and who were the top dialers etc"
bad,Very labor intensive with demands to make deadlines well beyond expectations. Management doesn't communicate effectively with each other. Too many chiefs
bad,"Great coworkers and friendly people, just horrible pay, you work only 4 days 40hrs a week but expect to work a second job plus its a really physical job and pay is 38k to 43k a year good maybe for a single guy"
bad,Great place to work. My immediate manager and supervisor were great! Wasn't the greatest in terms of in house promotion. I would go back and work there but definitely at a different location!
bad,I was a utility worker  it was and okay job I Liked what I was doing It made me feel good about myself knowing I could do everything in the warehouse ..
bad,Stay to yourself and the job will be a lot easier on a day to day basis. Know that you will never be able to make everyone happy. Do what you’re told to do!
bad,pretty laid back job lots of great benefits just stressful with the calls and the angry customers yelling at you constantly management is easy to get along with
good,Management came to me 2 years ago & ASKED ME personally to move off the floor to the front. My work load kept constantly increasing with no increase in pay. Out of no where I get called into the office for printing out a resume & was terminated the following day!
good,"Low wages, no vacation or sick days for the first year. (Point system for lateness/absence.) Job was not difficult, but very tedious. Poor management, not a lot of chance for advancement."
good,Not a great place to work. The managers dont know how to run the operation and they contradict themselve all the time.  Its hard to get promoted because they dont not know how to hired the right people for the job
good,Working for a boss who would fire people for no reason and no warning.  You never knew if you were doing a good job or not.  Manager discussing you with other employees.
good,Title says it all. Co-workers are great. Pay is minimal. Manager rules from the top and there is no appreciation to those that are not in his little group. The HR is a joke.
good,"Overall an ok place to work, the pay was not good for the working conditions.  The factory was very hot in the summer time and it was hard to keep motivated there."
good,Clock in at 5:30 AM prepared all my merchandise truck delivery and organized on order stopped; picked up dirty clothes on different warehouse or restaurant dropped cleaned uniforms and picked up dirty uniforms.
good,"management it s not good at that place the management is not a LEADER is poor  but all the worker is hard worker and friendly .  you work at high temperature in summer ."
good,"Cintas... Well, the company portrays themselves very good but once you start to work there you realize it is not what they claim to be. Management does not care about employee's they only care about the numbers!! The Accounts Receivable position is a bill collecting position. You are to focus on collecting at all times regardless of the reasoning behind the customer not paying. The drivers will add on things just to win a gift card but than the next month it has to be removed from the account because the customer never wanted it."
good,"lack of communication between office and field"
good,"you better have a back up plan if you get sick. The attendance policy is strict. You start out with 5 vacation days a year which you better not use all at once because if an emergency came up or you had to miss work for some reason, they do not care. If you are out of vacation days, it will go against you, you will get wrote up."
good,its a fun easy work and i like it but it was a seasonal position so its ok and they let us know befor 2 week that they will lay us off
good,The amount of work you have versus the pay was terrible as a company they run you into the ground and tell you its your fault your not making more money.
good,"They pay well, but they will pitch a promotion to you just to keep you working for them. I worked on 3rd shift with 3 people. 3 PEOPLE!!!! They fired 3 workers off of my shfit and never replaced them. They will see a problem and just tell you to work harder or pick up the slack. They say they are open to suggestions but never fix the problem."
good,"Not enough workers on 3rd shift..."
good,"The company's values are inconsistent with actual every day life. They preach respect for all but many managers are bullies, saying one thing and actually doing another. High degrees of favoritism and inconsistently addresses practices deepening on who you are and if they like you at any given time,  which changes daily. Hard work and workers are publicly humiliated and intimidated.  I could go on and on..."
good,"Great people to work with, management team not the greatest, little room for advancement. Salary very low for the job required, benefits ok,"
good,I worked my butt off for over a year straight no sick time was used I showed up on time and did a great job during my review I was only giving $0.81 for a raise which I felt was unfair. Management was a great team my manager was a good man can you make me feel like I was part of the team most of the time when it came time for kpi I thought he was a little favoritism toward the other workers and I didn't get my KP eyes
good,My location had absolved G& K customer base. We had a ton of unsatisfied customers. Drivers were substituted weekly and compensation for work load fluctuation wasn’t up to par. Also product availability was lacking so customers were disappointed with being billed for services not rendered. If you want a 4- day work week then by all means go for it but you will work long hours. Almost 12-14 hours a day and a very low hourly rate but commissions are included.
good,"Enjoy the job as long as you can, it is unlikely that you will become a permanent resident at Cintas because of either pay or job security issues. There was a lot of promise coming into the company, but like myself and many others have learned quickly, there is a reason their SSRs leave so quickly and they have difficulty retaining their employees for more than a couple of months."
good,the company is dedicated to its employees .They offer ways you can move up in the company. No weekend and you get paid weekly .Some days things can get stress over the work load .
good,"I would only advise someone to work at this division if they were in desperate need of a job. The only people who are able to be promoted and recognized within this division are ones who speak gossip upon other partners and are not people of color. If you stand up for what is correct and decent, you are blacklisted and targeted. Systematically, this group tears down the integrity of individuals who try to achieve goals for the company and share in the corporate culture as Cintas as whole. I have never seen this level of unprofessionalism and bigotry within a company. The turnover rate is so high the management teams have told people they are use to this. My advise is to find another place to work for even if it means you will to make money. Cents has a lot of work to do to keep its underserving title of Top 500 in Diversity and Inclusion."
good,For the most part co workers are very friendly and knowledgeable. I learned alot from everybody i worked with. Its a very diverse environment. Management is as fair and understanding as possible.
good,Management is very poor. The employees are great but it was a lot of drama within the workplace which made it stressful. On top of working 50+  mandatory hours each week including weekends. they take a lot of time from your personal life with little benefits or thanks in return.
good,"Fast paced workplace, minimum training, processes constantly changing."
good,The best part about the job was the cafeteria. The women were very caddy and the management team was phoney and over the top! I did not enjoy my experience with the people there....very negative vibrations. High pressure for no money. Stressful
good,Company is going through a lot of changes.  If you can handle lots of changes at once then you will do fine at this company. Downside is if you don’t fit into the click of this company it won’t be a good environment
good,"Seemed like such a great company to work for at first.  However, extremely long hours. The pay is alright. The managers don't communicate very well and there is a high turnover."
good,"this job is sold as allowing for my time with your family but in fact I had a lot less time with my family because of the crazy hours. Not only do you have terrible hours but the people that you have to deal with talk down to you because ""you're just a delivery boy. What do you know?"""
good,"Training is there when you beg for it. Managers harp on you constantly. And the managers that are there may not be there. I was with Cintas for a little over a year, went through 3 managers, and had accounts taken from me that I sold but were not good enough for Cintas."
good,"Cintas as a company is a great place.  I can not say the same for some of the Cintas locations.  Weak management systems and favoritism.  "
good,"Incredibly intense work environment. Heavy Corporate culture, with a heavy emphasis on structure, training and daily goals. Militant in nature, it builds thick skin and solid sales ethic."
good,"Good Company at least that is the idea they present. I saw multiple wrongful terminations. Management is happy to lie, pay is always screwed up. They preach a corporate culture and in no way do they live by it. If you want to get ahead go there and be a snake serves most leaders there quite well."
good,More diversity is needed at Cintas Texas locations.  My day started at 7 and ended whenever.  The workload was strenuous and overwhelming.  Collections was brutal.
good,answered phones and scheduled re[pairs to appliances and had alot of angry customers yell and scream about things not getting done properly or in a timely manner...
good,"It's an ok place to work, just needs to give seasoned employees better pay and way better raises for all the hard work they do."
good,"Working with sales to provide valuable information to clients i.e: budget, delivery dates.  Handling any issues that arose and providing solutions that would benefit the company and the clients."
good,"A typical day at work as an outside sales rep. at Cintas is tons of cold calling and presenting. The Monday/Wednesday phone blocks are AWFUL and not needed to be successful in sales in any industry! The work culture at the Chester, VA Cintas location sucks at best. The GM has been there for ever so its his way or the highway. Overall you learn on the fly as you go because the sales manager that hired me was young and not a great trainer. Sales and Operations don't get along and there is always inter-department fighting. Field time is great for experience, but overall I have not hated a job so much as this one!"
good,"work/ family is completely off balance, always working extra hours which you are not compensated for. Heaven forbid you need to get home to your family"
good,"Diligently request payment for all past due balances in accounts receivable for assigned clients through calling and sending routine written notifications customers from paying on time."
good,"Cintas is tough on their drivers who are the face of the company. ASR’s are sent out short products or often products not except able condition. Mats smell fowl often and don’t lay flat on customers floors causing trips. Cintas wants their drivers to add product, sell catalog,get contracts renewed and be a debt collector all while sending the drivers out the door   Ready to fail even before getting to first customer. Every month they put more and more on the sets plates. They will make you sit in resigning classes and role play situations that only happen in make believe land. A lot of unhappy/ stressed out ssrs in my location. Not sure how they will hire new employees with these working conditions. Wouldn’t recommend to a friend!"
good,"The job itself is not bad, I actually liked what I did there. It’s the management and coworkers that would make you want to leave. They have petty/nosey/immature and mentally unstable people working there, management who don’t care to fix any problems. The one and only thing they care about is safety."
good,"Not a great place to work. Number and $ focused, not worried about the partners. Not very good working conditions and the pay is horrible. A hard working partner gets very little help from coworkers."
good,"I learned how to program computerized washer/dryer systems and operate overhead crane system. I also learned how to operate a PRC"
good,"Family and company do not co-exist well. Its company first, family last. That's the main problem most people have with the company. And they keep changing policies supposedly to make things better, never seems to work out that way."
good,"They promise much through the interview process. The glitz and glamour of being a partner at Cintas, or an SSR is pretty enticing. It's all that and then some; at first. The corporate culture is a thinly veiled construct that closely resembles a pyramid scheme. Good for a experience, but move on as soon as you find something better."
good,"If you have that great personality for handling customers, managers and drivers. This is the place for you. This place will help you deal with the best and the worst of the worst. If you can handle Cintas Customers you can handle any customer service. But remember Customers are always right."
good,"Good company, just wish the pay was higher for all the work they provided. They really weren't to understanding when it came to family issues on the outside of work!"
good,"Managed a uniform room under a sub-contract. Never had any contact with the head company or anyone in it. I can't comment on the actual company."
good,I did not receive a pay raise my last four years there and management was irregular and very dictatorial. Work guidelines fluctuated with no training and usually very little notice.
good,Don’t be a loader/unloader it’s a lie hours suck and management never cares. Good benifets though and uniforms are kind of cool. Also if you was 1 minute late you got a point
good,"I worked for Cintas in San Antonio for almost two years. There are long hours, no time for family or a life outside of work. You got off for major holidays, but you had to work longer hours the week prior to the holiday. The management was disorganized, and very demanding. You never got any appreciation for the long hours and hard work you put in. The only enjoyable thing about the job was the amazing friends I made while working there."
good,"2 days a week in the office phone blocking and the other 3 days a week your meeting with appointments. "
good,"While the company is a whole is great, the Chicago (Bedford Park office) is really not a great fit for a younger generation. The location is not very safe, and there is not opportunity for advancement. The people are all very kind though!"
good,"Not for accounting professional to grow locally"
good,"Typical day at work stressful "
good,"I had the position of an office support and it was just eh to me. Management was extremely lazy and always pushed upon their work to others to get done when they didn't want to do it. Culture in the workplace is closely followed by policies and procedures on how things are done, which was annoying. No tattoos showing, no short sleeve shirts, professional attire at all times, never jeans. Always fast paced, and a lot of whining."
good,"you are always busy, and work a lot of hours.  you really do not get much time off. management is always watching, and can get snipy. "
good,This is a place where people just end up they don't chose this job as their first choice. My boss was not  leader. People will push their work off on you. Everyone just covers themselves.
good,"Managing a 24/7 Division for Northern California comes with several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is growing so fast and maintaining the staffing to adhere to the growth while staying focused on remaining successful in all areas. "
good,The company overal is an excellent place to work. The problem is that individual locations can be very poor places to work. The Oklahoma City location used to be great and then the management was changed and it has become an extremely stressful place. Very few people enjoy coming to work and most feel that the local management does not care about those that work for them.
good,"There is very little time for a learning curve.  I personally came into the position not knowing the company very well and was expected to learn everything on my own.  There was no formal training at all, my supervisor was never present.  I was covering a maternity leave, and was left wondering about a permanent job right until the last minute when they then divided my job into two jobs-i had been working very hard to do all of it and was starting to succeed finally before being let go."
good,they under pay for the job that i do. they give me a lot of stuff to do on top of my original job that i was hired for. sometimes its hard to get it all done.theres to much drama around there the supervisor shows favortism. the most enjoyable is the people that i work with on the floor.
good,"Great company but poor management equals lack of motivation and job culture. It doesn't matter if you show up to work everyday, it only matters how close you are to management!! No advancement unless you kissing up to the bosses!!!"
good,I like that I don't work on weekends even though management tries to say that its mandatory. The pay for my experience is very poor.
good,"Typical day consisted of traveling throughout southeast working with National Account reps calling on hospitality, health care, resort and airline business.  Unfortunately, 911 happened within weeks after moving to Atlanta for this position and had devastating affects on our core business segments.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge it presented and finding ways to overcome them.  Most difficult part was the economic times."
good,"Hard work and ok pay, poor management and several safety issues, co workers were good to work with.  Lots of turnover so there are many unsatisfied customers you try to ""fix"" the situation."
good,"Limited advancement, long hours. Co-workers are great, the main reason so many people stay.  Very conservative environment."
good,Sun up to sun down. Own boss which is nice but poor management when needing help in certain situations. Very lazy people behind the scenes.
good,"Fast paced, organization is a must, planning ahead is key, co-workers make a great team at Cintas, great opportunity to make big commissions as well as bonuses at the end of the month."
good,"Cintas is the first distribution center I worked in. I was always in food service. The job itself is not hard, very easy to learn and to handle. The overtime can be a bit much because of the strenuous workload, so the busy seasons can be hard. My co-workers are diverse, coming from different countries and backgrounds but like anywhere you click with some and not with others but able to work as a team, so I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job are my co-workers."
good,"Be prepared to be overworked"
good,"As a route sales representative, it is supposed to be four 10 hour days per week. Depending on your route, you might be working more hours. Also depending on your route, the job can be very physically demanding, coming home exhausted most days, resulting in little quality time outside of work during the week. Management is all about making more profits, which often results in giving more work to already over-worked employees."
good,people are nice company has parties and is very team based. a lot of work for not a lot of pay. I we never had what we needed for the customers and customers never paid.
good,"Good pay but the job was hard to perform with the support given, and entire process was very disorganized with many customers wanting to stop service and not being able to because of contract with company."
good,Its a ok job in the fire protection department  in production  but to mich buddy buddy going on if you not cool with certain people you won't advance  smh
good,"Their not very organized there's no communication between the managers, they say that your all family there but really if you don't have a college degree they look down on you ."
good,Never get no where at cintas poor management and the pay was horrible. No room to grow they only would let some folks get away with stuff while the hard workers that actually worked would get in trouble for the smallest thing.
good,Management was very poor at my location. Whatever the manger could do to not work was done. I was asked to pick up after other people because they had been there longer than me and was given the worst jobs by the manager because no one wanted to do them.
good,"No longer a partner.  Tough dirty work.  Room for advancement if interested.  They are the industry leader in rugs, towels and toilet paper.  Sales is the game, good place to work if you fit the culture."
good,"Was Terminated by new Manager almost without warning, along with 14 other minorities, like myself, all within 5 months of his start! Had to move to De"
good,"Cannot fill this in as Indeed will post this in conjunction with my job title, which is unique. Typing more to fill in the one-hundred and fifty character minimum."
good,I really enjoyed  My job with cintas most of my career there however the current leadership and direction the locations are going I felt as if my integrity is going to eventually be jeopardized.
good,Pick and choose who should move up. Lie a lot. Middle management is ok but higher management is shady. Raises are small. Overtime is given out to there favorites.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job with Cintas. Unfortunately, not every leader executes on the vision and terminates quickly and without just cause. The termination process is secretive, lacks any follow up questioning, and is quick to rush to conclusions."
good,"My first location in Anaheim was great. It was managed well by a veteran sales manager that know exactly how to do his job. He was always available to help his reps."
good,Cintas is a good company to work for. A great place to start your working life but not a forever company.   They do apply a ton of presser to hit numbers and sometimes people have to over charge a customer or add goods or services to hit the number they need but the customer may not need the service.  You do what you have to to keep your job.
good,Benefits were good. People were not. Very “clique” oriented. If you weren’t “cool” they didn’t want to talk to you and were rude. Upper management was good though.
good,It was an alright job. The management team only cares about their numbers and it is hard to move up if you are not close with the current management team.
good,"Good earning potential, no work life balance."
good,Cintas is a very good company to work for. The service sales route drivers are not paid well. Cintas has merged with one of its competitors G&K and the workload has affected the work life balance for the drivers. The culture depends heavily on the leadership team and their ability to understand the nature of running a route and growing business.
good,Cintas was a good company. There are a few down falls while working the position I was working while at Cintas. I was an Ssr (sales and service representative). This position was made out to be that i would be going to accounts on a monthly bases. I would maintain chemicals that needed to be ordered based on inventory at the time. After 6 months of working there I ran into a lot of problems with the dishwasher that i was doing PMs on to make sure that everything was working properly. And i had no training at all with any of these machines. Management just expected me to figure it out. I am mechanically inclined but it was almost impossible to be home at a decent time while only making a set salary. The company itself had good benefits gave bonuses as long as no accounts were lost in my territory. I was still never made to feel comfortable or able to ask to be taught anything everyone was always busy from the manager of my department and to my supervisor. Not enough staff for this type of business within the business of matts and towels.
good,"10 hours a day, 4 hours on saturdays. Very stressful work environment. Decent pay but if you show any competence they will put you in any department whether you want to or not."
good,"Not much to say here"
good,"lots of busy time at this company, learned a lot about the uniform and facility services business.  Management is lacking in many areas but overall work culture is good.  The hardest part of the job is personalities, the most enjoyable part of the job customer satisfaction."
good,"This job is merely one to use as a stepping stone and not something to be relied on as a 5-10-15yr job. The hours are ok as long as you live close to the location. The pay is below what it should be for the amount of physical work you have to do and the hours you are working. Can be a very physical job but not every single day, the benefits are pretty good, health/dental and vision. 401k etc"
good,I felt Cintas was not the type of environment for me as there was to much confusion and noise.  I have been in the medical field for a very long time and really was not able to utilize my talents
good,Most management is unwilling to work with there employees needs. They will also throw you under a bus to save themselves. Most posititions are limited to no advancement
good,"Cintas is a great place to work. Management is very helpful. The culture is relaxed, but steady paced. The hardest part is standing in one place for long periods of time."
good,Doesn't pay well for the expectations. When I got hired on the pay was different. Told I would probably make 85k this year and not even close. After 9mos I'm searching for a new job.
good,The only way to advance with Cintas is to leave and reapply. No one is taken seriously unless they leave. Diversity and Inclusion is preached but not practiced.
good,long hours and very lean in Management/Leadership.  Most do 2 job roles or locations. They always have 5 things on the go at the same time.  They need support people.
good,"I absolutely love what I do for my professional role. I am currently looking to move away from Cintas though. The micromanagement and the chaos in the office is worth my taking a pay cut just to get a happier environment. The stress is unbelievable. There is no positive, not even with coworkers. Everyone is so overworked and micromanaged, there are no smiles, laughs, and overall, no helpfulness."
good,"was a good place to work. now management is""too busy""to handle day to day problems. when vacation time is scheduled,is not approved untill 24 hrs prior. if more than one day,say like one week,they give you all but one day."
good,Driving in a company truck to deliver uniforms. Freedom of not being stuck in an office and being able to resolve issues on your own.Not much culture you are basically a sales person.
good,"I truly did learn a lot here about how to manage a sales territory and what you have to put into it to make it succeed.  However, in my experience, very few people last longer than 2 years here.  A very ""culture"" heavy workplace and even if you buy-in, you're only as good as your last month."
good,deliver mats towels an toiletries to companies an picked up the dirty mats an towels an replaced them with clean towels an mats
good,environment great plant work was great people were great. Management was bad not all of them really just one person who had no clue on the job.
good,The worst part of the job was that we were paid by how fast we worked but in order to protect ourselves from the chemicals and biohazards the protective gear provided would slow your production rate drastically. There was really no sense of a team bond and most of the management team was not that supportive of any individuals success within the company.
good,Not the company it used to be. Company upper management is more worried about how THEY look than taking care of customers or employee's.
good,"longer work days than initially expected which makes it difficult to find a healthy life/work balance."
good,The work was good simple tasks that i got paid 11.50 to do. It was a fun place to work at as long as the supervisors left you go which most of the time they didn't. The supervisors at the Allentown location 101 are the most arrogant snobby people I have ever come across in my entire life. Its disgusting how they speak to you. But as long as you can ignore them and just do your job you'll be fine to work there for a little while. Also the raises there are performance based and if you get 100% when reviewed the most you'll get is a 0.30 cent raise. The average raises there are between 5-15 cents.
good,"This job is the early bird starting anywhere from 4-5 in the morning. You're given your route for the day and begin the delivery process once your truck load is verified. I learned that this job is one of the better of the delivery jobs. They encourage you to develop friendships with your customers while efficiently running your route. The only time you really see your co-workers is either in the morning when you start or at the end of your day most of which are veterans of the company who've been around for quite some time. The hardest part of your job is fixing the previous route drivers mistakes and animosity the customers have towards the company for one reason or the other. In this job you're obligated to renew and maintain contracts with these customers and if they're not pleased with the service or unknowingly are obligated into another contract they wont be pleasant to deal with. This goes hand in hand with the harder parts of the job. You are given adequate training but once you're on your own, you're on your own. There's not much micromanaging from higher ups unless the problem is beyond resolution. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new clients and delivering all over town. You get to meet and discover businesses and companies you never knew existed as well as acquire new friends."
good,"Cintas taught me about customer relationships. I learned the importance of strong communication skills, and the integrity of your service. The hardest part was the lack of resources (raw materials). The most enjoyable part of the job was work life balance."
good,"Cintas was very good to me on a variety of levels, with the opportunity at times to learn valuable skills from a talented pool of leaders and colleagues.  Unfortunately over time, this talent pool was eroded and replaced with individuals who did not embody the spirit of how Cintas says they want to do business, or treat their employees."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. At the time it did not offer benefits.
good,"Co-workers are  great. Training  is good, Days are long ,Hard part driving. "
good,"Keep myself productive at all times.If not busy rolling mats,I helped my other co-worker loading or unloading the trucks with dirty stuffs.Management they keep on changing people who run the production.I like my job but there are times that I was not paid for my incentives which is really upsetting because I worked so hard and I deserved to get paid.My job is quite hard because,I work just by myself and no one likes to do my job.If there are a lot of mats to roll it is really hard for me,but I dont mind.The most enjoyable part of my job is that most of my co-worker are my friends too which is somehow helping me to relieve stress."
good,Safety oriented company. World's largest uniform 8omp as ny
good,"Was hired based on an income of 60-70K, found out, after hiring and training that I'd be making 30K at 105% of sales target. Management didn't seem to care."
good,"Company is slow at making things happen.Your told things a lot of the times,they hope you forget.They're slow at fixing their equipment.Some facilities are unsafe from the bad areas that they are located at.Don't get me wrong.They do have some awesome people working for them that make a person want to do their best to go the extra mile for the customer.The customer pays the bills."
good,Accounts Receivable was very stressful.  Management not very approachable.  Being best performer in the department for months felt like I was not doing enough.
good,"Was not fully clear on the role as they keep talking about the Service Sales representative and it can take awhile before a local route can get open making the ""promise"" of the sales portion of this enticing but it takes while to build up the route."
good,Co-workers and people were friendly. Management is very slow to promote and pay is on the low end. Company benefit package is great. Pretty strict corporate culture with very little flexibility for work/life balance.
good,Good company to work for if you don't need a lot of overtime hours. Not much pay raise when you do a lot for the company. Good insurance  for the most part.
good,Management never returns calls they blame it on too many meetings even when you have an emergency in the field. they don't really have a work life balance they over work you for a low pay.
good,Overall the place was decent to work...the demands placed were not realistic all the time and often if a change was made there was not enough time given to see if the change had become effective.
good,Stress..production on top of production... No training and company as this employee need more hands on training..Need be able talk to employee and production quote needs be lower.
good,"Provide great customer service to its clients, but poor management. Able to take company vehicle home, which was a great incentive, gas paid for."
good,"The employees are great, but management only takes care of their salaried employees. No one else matters to them. I love my actual job, but you don't get paid enough for the effort you put in."
good,"My shift started at 6:30 am, which we had our preshift meeting.  After the preshift meeting we were given our assignments for the day.  I pretty much did replenisment for the most part.  I did however do a bit of putaway as well."
good,"The pay is not worth it. For the amount of sweat and extra work you’ll do as an Unloader, you get paid nothing. Better off working at a grocery store."
good,"My job was good until around 2009, then Cintas started downsizing and putting a lot more work on employees who already had enough on their plates. People started leaving, one by one, and their positions eliminated. Customer service department became a disaster, since it was grossly understaffed and had only ONE representative to handle everything, with no backup for breaks or lunches. Totally ridiculous! For a long period we had an office manager who mistreated employees and caused a lot of stress and turn-over in the office. GM was aware of the situation and did nothing to remedy it. Several employees, such as our Direct Sales representative, were given management positions and then quickly became dictatorial, which was not conducive to a good work environment. Only had one really good GM there during my eight years of employment....he realized I was underpaid and gave me a $2.00 per hour raise! We changed GM's four times while I worked there....first one was transferred to the Vista location and demoted to service manager; second one was put in the position short-term to ""clean things up""; and third one left due to conflicts with upper management - despite his explanation to us as to why he was actually leaving. I overheard several of his phone conversations with other managers and knew the truth. (Anyone out there looking for a ""company ear""? It's truly my area of expertise!). I finally had enough of Cintas, their conflicting company policies, and most of the management. I opted to resign from a fairly decent job to preserve my health and well-being. When the (fourth) GM"
good,Normal 8 hour days monday - friday with no overtime opportunities. Physically demanding with lots of lifting. Some fun days ie employee appreciation week.
good,"Great co workers, a couple of good managers but most don’t have a clue what they are doing. If your not buddy buddy with them you won’t move up even though u done a lot for the company."
good,cents provides a diverse work environment that includes dirty to clean laundry operations that have many different jobs that include awash process and sorting.
good,"Management is a joke.  Pay scale is good in the right markets.  Salary of 43k plus car package doesn't sound great, but if you are selling decently, then you will make good money. I can only speak on behalf of sales."
good,"I started at this job with the idea in mind that I would be starting a new career. The benefits are great as most big companies. Soon I started to notice the company views we're very much all for show. Safety is a huge focus with this company, if it isn't too expensive, or inconvenient. The location I worked at was twenty years old and was falling apart and processes were bypassed. No one seemed to take pride in their work."
good,"Cintas is laid back as far as pace goes. Their pay is not competive but their benefits are really good. they also offer a match for your 401k. Not much room for advancement, they have their picks and favorites. Its really not based on skill or seniority, it truly is who you know. They are in the top 5 of safety for employees and customers with a VPP certification. Management is the sane as anywhere else, you have the good, the bad and the lazy."
good,"The best part about working here are the fellow partners.  Lacking efficient processes which creates much frustration,  and difficult to perform your job."
good,"Mandatory 10 hour days and 4 hour shift on Saturday at startup distribution center location. Every time we caught up and were promised no more overtime or weekends they would just add more locations we had to service. Was assured that they offered tuition assistance at hire on, was later told that they would not be able to offer since it was not 'directly pertinent to my job'."
good,"I think its a good place to work for people who dont mind dealing with every aspect of the business, but being compensated as just a delivery driver. Everything from the smallest detail to dealing with the contact at every stop. The work load never gets easier. As soon as you get used to your route, they add more stops to make your day even more difficult."
good,Atypical day at work is 7:00 to 3:30. Management acts more like a friend to their favorite people with them not having to do the requirements of the job leaving us others having to do our jobs plus take up the slack of doing theirs. What I have learned is to cope with the different personalities plus knowing how to have a positive outlook on my job.
good,"Cintas 1st Aid/Safety could be a great place to work, but is overburdened by too much middle management. In addition to the General, HR, Sales Team and Training & Compliance managers, our location has 4 service managers to manage 30-35 SSR partners, which is one, if not two service managers too many. There is also a prevailing notion, albeit not overtly stated, that customers are there for us to take advantage of, not take care of."
good,I enjoy helping customers with their questions and requests. I do not like that Cintas is becoming all about a corporate state of mind and loosing sight of how to provide great customer service and be an enjoyable place to work.
good,"Worked for the company for 3 years. I did every position in the First aid and Safety division minus management. Compensation and benefits are all above par and quite frankly are better than most businesses. As a company, they do care about you, but local management is another story."
good,"The job was great and the customers are friendly, I learned a great deal about sales and customer service."
good,"moderate to fast paced work environment. every employee has to perform their tasks in order for goal accomplishment."
good,"If you are looking for a job to just show up to and leave this is the place for you. Advancement is very slim, management will not hound you as long as you run your route."
good,"•	Experience working in a fast paced and high volume work environment"
good,"*From start to finish of each work day we take multiple of calls. I am still learning from management daily. "
good,"I didn't hate Cintas.  In fact, if the two managers above me would leave, I'd go back.  But they didn't do their jobs, found fall guys and treated supervisors horribly.  Overall, liked the job.  Pay was decent."
good,"Not happy while working there. Micro Management environment. A typical day at work was full of reporting, meetings and pressure of hunting new businesses,"
good,Good place to work when needing experience. They hire within the company. Offer many computer training to refresh or learn something new. Management is continuously changing which can be seen as a positive or negative.
good,"If you show a shred of intellect at certain Northern California locations, you are shunned. Taking the lead and saving accounts that Service Managers and SSR's almost loose leads to no recognition or help in promotion. General Managers of particular location have a very closed minded mentality on outside thought to assist in increasing profits. If you ever get hurt on the job, be ready to suffer more as they limit your pay and put you in harms way with their ""light duty""."
good,"Cintas has excellent benefits, however their salaries are incredibly low and there are not a lot of places to move up. They do excellent in providing training. You do not receive vacation until you have worked there a year."
good,"Work was not Appreciated, lots of long hours and unusual daily schedules.  High presure to Make sales and not much assistance in Making those goals. Tended to be alone on an Island."
good,Their training system is old and they are permanently short-handed. This gets the supervisors overworked. 12 to 14 hour days were normal and it seems that there is always a shortage of products.
good,"IN ORDER TO BE TREATED FAIRLY THEY NEED A UNION."
good,"Load and unload trucks, sort items as needed.  This was a great place to work, great hours and great people to work with.  I don't recall a hard part of this job."
good,"Very nice people to work with however extremely poor management is in place.  "
good,"it ok, they dont want unions which stops them from needing to be accountable for the lack of work done for employee's. I worked there for 6 months and after 3 months i was suppose to get a 50c premium, but they never added it to my pay."
good,Hand picked management team even some with no experiance is driving down the partners. Benefits are quite spendy considering you oay for them every week
good,"This is a high stress job. There is little room for growth. For higher positions openings they hire outside of the company, rather from within.The percent of your commissions goes down as your route volume goes up.They are lacking in their management and training.  There is a high turn over rate, causing the company to be constantly short handed in drivers."
good,"Cintas has a good base pay and benefits. Commission is also good. However, the expectations are unreasonable and unattainable. Management is poor. You work and learn on your own with little help from above."
good,"Fun and challenging but very little support from management. Managers promote teamwork at the route level but certainly do not function as a team at management level. If your manager is unavailable, other managers will not answer phone calls or emails from a sales rep if that particular rep isn't a part of his team. If your manager finds out that you have worked with another manager on a question or issue, his response to you next you will need him, ""why don't you go talk to X since you and are cool like that now"". LOTS of management issues!"
good,A good start for your entry into the work force. Working at cintas has helped me grow as a person and helped me also identify some flaws that i had not recognized before. But while working at cintas the different teams i worked with helped me get rid of said flaws.
good,The job was good and opportunity for overtime was great. Sales commission was ok. I was terminated without proper procedure and for a poor reason. I had won awards for performance 2 weeks before I was terminated suddenly.
good,"Easy work, has rare company festivities, good shift time, unorganized management, VERY poor raises, no appreciation for being overworked and underpaid"
good,Cintas was a great place to work for just the hours put into the job did not reflect on your pay.  The job was vvery physically demanding.  The pay used to be phenomenal until the economy turned sour and the pay scale was changed for route drivers.  The job at most times was fun and exciting to strive to beat other representatives in upsales and catalog sales.
good,Management is not very resourceful.  Have to rely on vets to help you out.  best part about running route if you are a driver.  Faster you work faster you'll get done.  Hardest part of the job is getting 5 year contracts with minimal help from managers.
good,"I wanted to work for Cintas Fire and Safety division for a while when i knew i was leaving Publix.  I feel like a kid on Christmas who got what they wanted, but it fell apart quickly.  The job is menial, and even though the people are good, most are miserable there including management.  It's disappointing to see how this company actually operates.  I had high expectations and it's definitely not what i had hoped.  The best part of the job is the good pay, especially for this area.  The reason though, is because of my experience."
good,"As a tile and carpet specialist, our manager was the worst manager ever. low wadge, more work, and work over time like it or not. sometimes after 12 hrs. very large property to clean. up to 5500 square feet of carpet imaging that. work days, night, weekends, 14hr?? hard labor. IDK but to me not worth it. this was two years ago maybe things has change. we travel allot to the mountains m-F you don't spent much time with your family. we stayed up there, dinner was bought for us, lunch was on us, we had to take every receipt we use for the $100 gift card given to us as spending money. we we use all the boss asks questions."
good,"Largely staffed company, so there was not much overtime. The company, as a whole, seems to care about the employees. There were quite a few team building events and company gatherings. The biggest downfall is having to meet a quota that seemed impossible, at times...and having your numbers posted, publicly."
good,"Extremely strong safety culture, management is good but always changing from a high turnover rate. Providing a lot more training for maintenance partners development of essential skills. There is a lots of room for the company to progress even further as in getting up to date with current technology, paying employees better when other companies pay significantly more for the same work being performed, and the differences in a two shift setup where the second shift works very long hours and first shift only is doing their 8 hours."
good,"A typical work day starts early, although, not for everyone. The plant runs three shifts. Usually I have my direct manager come by and lay out the day's work ahead. There is at some point a safety meeting. They have lots of safety meets and once a month the plant manager dose kind of a state of the plant meeting and acknowledges employees birthdays and anniversaries. Sometimes I might get asked to come in early or stay late to cove a co-worker's absence. that does't happen all that often. Very seldom we asked to come in on a Saturday to catch up. it is a production facility with customers that deserve the service they deserve."
good,"Worked as Maintenance Supervisor. First month I was rotated around working in every position for a day. I unloaded garments, went on routes, ran the wash alley, hung, sorted...Worked until 10pm many nights and was expected back in at 5am.Shortly afterwards I realized why. They expect the MS to fill in any position in the event of absence or turnover. After six months, safety was given to me. Was also responsible for safety for the location. All of the hourly workers, including my techs, were not allowed to have OT. If they had to stay over, or come in on the weekend, they had to take time off during the week, and I had to cover their shift during that time. There was also no call in minimum for coming in after normal shift. Had to cover shifts for my maintenance techs, and for other positions, and then expected to keep up with my administrative and paperwork duties. Got where I was working 12-15 days in a row, 60+ hr weeks as an exempt worker. Cintas culture thought this was normal for their management. 10-20% match for 401k. Management gets 1 week vacation after 6 months, and two weeks after a year. Hourly gets 1 week after a year. Health/Dental/Vision insurance is great and affordable. Uniforms are provided for free. Management is expected to be clean cut. Pay only .$0.30 per mile for travel or business related transportation. $50/month for personal cell phone usage for management."
good,There is little training and the company does not care about their employees. The warehouse is extremely hot except where the managers are. Typical work day has you spending most of  your time on the floor with very little time for brake and lunch. Lunch is only 30 min and the location of the plant is far enough from places that you better pack your lunch or you are eating from a snack machine.
good,"arrive at 9:00 a.m. and gather all other available employees in a stretch and learn that was lead by me. Also this was also a process that was created by me and used by the other locations."
good,Its a decent Job to grow at and find great benefits but I believe the branch I was in just wasn't were I fit in. Cintas biggest flaw is the time they take to do anything from getting something as equipment fixed too finding employees.
good,"My day started at 6:30 a.m. daily and included, working in collections (specifically collecting on 60-90 past due accounts) made 20-30 calls daily.  Followup on calls made on a daily basis."
good,j'ai acquis d'experience canadiene. travail typique dans usine.
good,Cintas was a different place to work. The most enjoyable was being able to stay in the warehouse and work with customers.
good,"Benefits and pay are great."
good,"Trucks are loaded and unloaded for you. Customer Service skills are needed to maintain customer base on routes. "
good,Very hard strenuous work. Customer service at its best when pushed. I learned a lot from the workers there about having high expectations from a job.
good,Do not enjoy working here. Nothing to enjoy about working in a warehouse all day long for managers who don't even supervise.
good,"was not happy at this job..management and seemed to have a conflict with me as a lesbian,"
good,"A typical day at Cintas is basically work from start to finish. Once we clock in we have to have our daily safety meeting followed by an overview of orders we have to complete. we are a uniform plant and we provide and process uniforms all day. We wash, dry, steam clean, mend, and press uniforms."
good,"atypical work place, Load and Unload Trucks. Management unstructered"
good,I enjoy the work I do its just becoming boring to me.. I love to learn an accomplish new goals..
good,this company was not understanding as far when it comes to having a child
good,Cintas expects a lot out of their employees and openly admits they pay average wages.  Manager training on demand actually specifies to work 4 hours on Saturday after the expeted 50-60 hour work week.
good,"I worked at Cintas almost 7 years. "
good,I worked there for a short time. I would suggest a ride-along. The training is good however they shift trainers constantly and that in itself can be overwhelming.
good,The job isn't to hard no matter what position you work. It's just very fast paste. Your up and personal with coworkers.  Your literally nest to them if your separating clothes. You just do the same thing every day working in a ware house.time flush by
good,Great People work for Cintas. Enjoyed my clients.Most of Management is great. Have to be into sellling to work this job. Over all Enjoyed my time at Cintas
good,"merge with shred weeded all cintas good drivers out, its was top heavy with managers they pushed the old managers out. and the went in a new direction."
good,Ok place  to work I was in Sansi really didn’t get promoted it was favoritisms there but all an all it wasn’t a bad place to work. Hade good hours family time and no weekends work
good,"No opportunity for advancement even with many years of experience I had in customer service and management; poor work/life balance and will work all over the city no matter the weather. If you have a family and kid(s) get sick its hard for you to take off and or get to them if you are out on a route. "
good,Easy job task. You must be ready for the workday. Good Benefits. Good work ethics. Safety first and it starts with you. Osha certified. Alright starting pay.
good,If you want to grow a professional background this a good place to start but if you're looking for advancement this is not the place. They only promote people who are already management or have college degrees.
good,"The pay is good, the Benefits are good. Management needs to go. A lot of the people that work there are nice though. Be prepared to work hard. Good paid vacation."
good,They don't pay enough an they say it's a chance for advancement i guess that's for certain people. I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone. Manager isnt all it should be
good,"Overall it's a pretty good company just have to make sure you are always keeping up with all the key performances,  and try not to have an injury.  I fell once, twisted my knee , and was off work for almost two weeks  due to that injury. When I came back to work, I worked diligently including the entire weekend to make up,  but was still written up for not making my quota that month"
good,There is no communication or consistency at this facility. Seems as if the supervisors or more concerned about the lunch menu rather than supporting the SSR! Routes are overloaded! Again I’m speaking on one particular location!
good,"A typical day is answering phones, scheduling fire extinguisher inspections and service. Learned about Fire Inspections on kitchen hoods, sprinkler, alarm, extinguishers and emergency/exit lights, hardest part was figuring out their computer system ALS 400 with no training."
good,"After a 60-90 day observation of the lack/ or exceptional qualities provided in previous service, a typical day has potential for great communication as well as challenging obsticles leading to prolonged satisfactory. Communication with many departments outside the required duties are more often than usually necessary to successfully provide excellent customer care .Management can be a breeze with some customers and difficult with others, all gainfully increasing the abilities and quality service for the future. The most enjoyable part of being an SSR is the networking with various agencies providing what they expect and need."
good,"As a folder, it was fun work!  Liked the hours but they seem to only care about production, not worrying about workers and sometimes the overload was way too much. Completely exhausted after work everyday! Also pay could be much better for the amount of work you do."
good,"Nice to work independently and the four day workweek is nice. Workload varies we have a growing location that eliminated a route for some reason. Benefits are good but pretty expensive. Management at my location is not good they mostly seem interested at hitting bonuses with doing as little as possible, they are not willing to do most of the things they will ask you to do. The culture has gone downhill in recent years our annual banquet disappeared. You get to know and like your customers and then have to hit them with astronomical annual price increases. More often than not you will not have the products you are supposed to."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for but it depends almost entirely on the location you work at."
good,Cintas is excessively and unnecessarily stressful. You do learn alot working with Cintas but if management took the time to organize some internal factors it wouldn't be so bad. There are growth opportunities if you're liked but growth opportunities here mean a poorer work life balance and gives Cintas 24/7 access to you.
good,"Worked here for about 1.5 years.Management is not very good. Unresponsive and very reactive instead of proactive. The scheduler was operating all on her own and 3 managers couldn't get her reeled in. Probably a great company anywhere else but just not in Prescott, AZ"
good,"A typical day working for Cintas will start between 5:30am and 7:00am. You'll have two check ins with your service manager each week plus a weekly development/staff meeting. You're expected to be at your first customer by 8:30 each day. You'll have a list of customers to see each day and, provided you don't finish *too* early, you're in charge of your own hours, really. You can work between 35 and 55 hours per week depending on what route you have. Though, Cintas doesn't consider you 'at work' until you log into your first customer. If your first customer is 2 hours away and you leave at 6:00am, you don't actually 'start' working until you arrive at the customer's location."
good,Corporate culture based on integrity. Hardest part of job is depending on office and plant partners to support our efforts out in the field. Management is supportive.
good,"Very demanding job, doesn't treat union employees well. I don't think upper management is in touch with the ""boots"" on the ground partners. Their philosophy on Unions is agreeable, but a detriment to existing front-line partners, managers and customers."
good,I was only a temp at cintas but I was not happy with management there. Fast paced environment. Was only there during my 90 day period. I didn't work there very long but they work you like crazy.
good,"Cintas is a good company to work for. The main issues for me were the lack of flexibility with work life balance and lower than average pay. They value time in over value. If you are looking to move up quickly, that will not happen. This is a great place for someone right out of college to go work."
good,"Teach me how to work a  pallet jacks ,  hard work and effort helps to get the job done faster . Everybody had to be ready to work hard it was a team base job work together get the job done fast and right ."
good,"Long hours, bad management, two many people in charge that don’t know the fire industry, that being said there are good people in the field, and a good manager in the sprinkler division and the repair division"
good,"Management does not really care about anything but themselves. In large part they are an unnecessary burden to everyone in the division. Most management seems to think that micromanaging everyone is the answer. Despite the employee handbook stating Cintas is a family company and calling everyone partners they miss the mark on that. They often put profits in front of good people and tell you its the way everyone at Cintas is doing it even if its not the most productive for the employees. "
good,"Good company, high stress, lots of mileage, no work/home balance. Lots of moving parts that they haven't figured out since the merger with G&K.  They'll figure it out."
good,"4 day workweek is great. 11/12 hour days on those 4 days are rough. The customers complain constantly. There is never enough product in the plant. GM and Service Director are fantastic. However, too many managers. Routes have way too many stops and they’re reluctant to take any stops off.."
good,I was stuck working many hours and when it came to my annual raise they never gave me a raise after all the hours and hard work I put in. Also management never helped. I was always stuck on my own and when I would make an error they would threaten me with write ups and never gave me the assistance I needed.
good,"Cintas is by far, the number one uniform company in America. The route sales reps that I supervised worked four days a week. This makes for a good work-life balance. However, the downside to the organization career advancement is challenging especially for people of color."
good,"This company is very right winged and they push it on the employees. The Farmer's are known for this. Management quick to throw people under the bus. "
good,The difference between military and no military workers sometimes causes a huge rift. It makes working together a bit difficult. The strictness of military life and the more loseness of civilian life. I believe is the rift.
good,"Ok place to work, very high stress when it comes to sales number. Great benefits, and company culture is great. They do not promote from with in as they claim. Very hard to get promoted."
good,"It’s very tiring, not good for someone who doesn’t like the heat or function well in the heat. Some coworkers can be difficult to deal with. I don’t think it’s a job for me but definitely for someone who likes the heat."
good,"There is alot of room to grow your experience and people skills. This is a very structured company, and is very focused on developing its employees and safety."
good,"It nice to go to work, everyone was worked well as a team and we all assisted each other to get the job completed.   And to keep the customer updated on what was happening."
good,"Fast pace working environment, lots of room to grow in company for technicians. I worked in an office setting in my case I experienced poor treatment due to office leadership & morale skills."
good,As far as services for customers they are great but working there is not so much. What is expected is unrealistic and they do not provide good morale or incentives. They are also really terrible with time off and accommodating for single parents or anything having to do with children/missed time.
good,"Good luck if you have a route that takes hours to get to. If, so expect putting more hours to compensate for the time you are traveling. Great GM but a lack of transparency between the GM and Service Managers."
good,"Working at Cintas is very hard and challenging.  Everyday is a new a challenge, you don't know what the day is going to be.  As an employee I did my best, and I can say I delivered."
good,Cintas can be a nice place to work if they would allow people to advance. If you are good at your job they tend to keep you at that position. Unless you are management you never really get a holiday off. You should be in shape due to constant standing in one place or  heavy lifting.
good,"Its very stressful due to the fact that 95% of employees are underpaid  including me for what we do they keep adding more work to everyone's work load every week and not bothering to up thier pay we get yearly raises and the biggest for my part of the job is $0.25 and thats with a perfect review and from what I have heard no one gets a perfect review so you'll be lucky just to get $0.20."
good,"The people I worked with were great, as were the 4-10 hour days (3 day weekend every week). But other than that it wasn't a great job. We were in a saturated market and management kept demanding we get more money for the same service, but we couldn't touch national accounts. So were left trying to rip off mom and pop businesses. Books of business were based on seniority, the tenured reps had the best customers with the least amount of work. Newer reps got the small accounts who were often time conned into their contracts and couldn't pay up. Newer reps were also on a different pay system than the more tenured reps and were bringing home half the money for twice the work."
good,"Cintas is a good company, they have great corporate culture. A typical day at work is telemarketing and setting appointments for new presentations. Cold calling and training employees."
good,Nice place to work.  Excellent pay.  Extremely fast paced sales environment.  Demanding weekly quotas.   I had a great group of coworkers.  Core goals and projections way too high for the market.
good,I learned a lot but any job that goes through multiple managers and supervisors within a years time has other issues that need to be addressed. I like stability. cuts down on confusion
good,"It is a descent place to work at, if your not looking for advancement. Management is willing to help with anything. Also the medical benefits are great."
good,"Some management members care more about certain areas of the plant than they do others. Piece work jobs, as well. So if you get behind, they wont let you receive help"
good,Amazing staff but unorganized and no mummification with management. The company over looks many in home issues and/or concerns that are never addressed.
good,Only worked with my new partner for two months. All of Cintas HR staff was very nice and strict about staying in your work area. They have nice air condition production warehouse.
good,The company has great benefits if you plan on staying their for a while. It's very hard for a female to become a manager (service manager). They micro-manage the office staff and the technicians a lot. Pay is okay for the amount of work you have. The company is all about money.
good,"Very unorganized and ran poorly, but as a SSR you work 4 days a week so you put up with bad pay and leadership for having 3 days off a week.  Great temporary job, but no career thats for sure."
good,great place to work. great company to travel for and lots of tools you need to regain skills set and get back into the working field. lots of chances to grow
good,Typical day was 12 plus hours without support on the route. Little training involved. Management didn't contribute to the service department. Culture was always tense in fear of management. Hardest part was completing the job and was very physical. Most enjoyable was helping individuals achieve goals.
good,The job would not be so stressful if they had enough people to do the job. The benefits are nice. They have a 401k plan.  The work load is very challenging.
good,"Cintas is a good company to work for but they have their issues.  First thing is they promote work/life balance, but it is not achievable when you are always short staffed.  They promote a 40 hour work week but everybody works 45-50.  No vacation for the first year.  Holidays you have off, but end up working your normal day off to make up for it, so not really a paid holiday.  Crazy system where once you get over a certain amount of sales they actually pay you less percentage for working more.  When the SSR's realiize they are working 5-10 hours of OT for almost no additional commission and the OT at min wage, people get frustraded real fast.  Managers work hard to help keep it all running smoothly but supervisors were working 60+ hours a week and Service Managers were working 70+ on average.  They literally didn't have enough time in the day to do what needed to get done,  They need to change their culture and pay their SSR's and support staff more, give them vacation and treat them as the valuable asset they are."
good,"The dress code is terrible. They do not care about their employees. They have the worst benefits. You have to wait 1 full year from your start date before you receive any type of leave, sick, vacation, pto, etc."
good,Has great benefits but not enough pay and management are the people that truly benefit from pay while the Route Service People are the ones truly doing the work. Overall just not enough pay
good,Good company lacks adequate staffing in order to operate as expected. Some positions are extremely physical. Communication between departments is horrible causing friction in the work environment.
good,"This company used to be great.  As time progressed numbers became the focus and employee care and culture took a back seat.  4 day work week is great.  Most manager have never actually been trained to be managers.  They do the best they can, but to say they are adequate is an overstatement."
good,"Incredible place to learn about numbers and sequences."
good,"Cintas purchased Metro Door. As Metro the company had a great atmosphere and strong relationships between management and personnel. Cintas came in and everything changed. They are such a large corporation and everything they preach is about increasing profitability, so the customer has now come second and the employees feel the pressure on a daily basis."
good,"If you are driven to be successful under any circumstance, it is possible to enjoy the fast-paced work.  As with anywhere, it has many pros and cons.  The business itself can be very stressful."
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"nice place to work, friendly coworkers. very good place to practice your experience, it is environment where you can learn and practice."
good,The job itself is very challenging and takes time to learn. its plenty to   learn about each company order. Most of the workers have bad attitudes ans speak bad on others when their not around to defend themselves.
good,"Cintas overall is a great company.  However Edmonton specifically had trouble on the service end of the business.  As a salesperson my job was to sell to new customers.  Unfortunately the service I sold was to much for the service team to handle.  On a very consistent basis my customers would not receive their products and services.  The service truck would show up with no clean uniforms, or entrance mats etc.  Sales and service management was very disconnected making it so improvements were unlikely to ever happen.  My status is still great with Cintas today."
good,"Productive, fast pace environment. I have been cross trained in various departments to cover workload as needed. Management is satisfactory. Work with multi-cultural individuals that are team players. Required to stand all day which is the hardest part of my job. I enjoy working in various departments."
good,"Running your own route as it was your own business. Freedom to make decisions for the betterment of your customers. Advancement opportunities, and benefits."
good,"the environment is stuffy and very corp- not much fun and the people who work there are almost cult-like. There is a lot of drama, especially with the hourly employees. Once you try to leave, the people there will make you feel bad. The pay is terrible and there are tons of rules and regulations."
good,"too many clothes to repair with one person, worked with sewing machine, button machine, heat sealer machine. A company that provided uniforms for different companies along with cleaning them. A company that provided different cleaning supplies, a company rugs  logo."
good,"Very demanding fast paced environment but highly disorganized. Fire protection start up that focuses on monthly revenue and MONEY. Turnover is extremely high and compensation is not comparable to other RTP, NC businesses."
good,"I come in listen to the Supervisors daily updates to everyone. Then I would get right to work cleaning and oiling the machines, then framing up the garments and getting them running on the machines."
good,"Sales for over two years - great pay, great car allowance, but a poor culture."
good,"my typical day started about 5am ,grabbed my truck keys ,checked my truck,grabbed my invoices,went out and did my route"
good,company not layered. Not much room for advancement unless you want to move to a very slow city
good,"Varies from location to location."
good,"Like I said before, Cintas is a great place to work, but they seemed unorganized when it came to hosting us Summer Temps."
good,"spent more time on the road then in an office."
good,Overall it is a okay job to work for. I have had worst jobs. The management is the best I've ever worked for. They are not fair at certain things. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the hours.
good,"getting customers invoices,log in prc look for customers need,pre inspection of truck,driving to delivery area,reviewing invoices,customer communication."
good,"-Solid route work"
good,het is zwaar maar wel afwisselend werk collega's waren super
good,I drove a van around Calgary and Red Deer and cleaned bathrooms. I worked from 4:30am to 4:30pm four days a week. The main focus of the company was on a different department and therefore I felt like I was often being overlooked.
good,"The typical sales and service rep works about 12 hours a day. Its only a 4 day work week but they still get more than a full week out of you. They are never satisfied. You have to work fast in order to finish your day. Even though your route is overloaded already if it isnt growing, your not doing a good job. It seems like they put your head in a vise. Once you get use to the pain, they give it another turn. The majority of the SSR,s are unhappy with the work load. Most of the SSR,s dont want a promotion because it means even more work and longer days than they work already. The turnover is extremely high."
good,"If you just need a place to work its a job, I didn't much like working there but the weekly paycheck is a plus"
good,Management was not fair at times towards employees views.  The company offered great benefits packages and the work hours are great.  
good,"A solid company with many great core values. "
good,Mi valoración general es positiva y he aprendido mucho en esta empresa.
good,Loaded truck with mats and supply. You have about 35 stops in 3 different towns and you must be down in 8 hours while you wasted already 2hours in traveling from and to Cintas.
good,"A typical day would start with my 1st shift parnters and I doing preventitive maintenance on all machines. Check for leaks, broken bolts, machine guarding, etc. From there, we would start shredding all material from the prior evening. Once material is shredded, it would be loaded on a staged trailer and wait to be transported to be recycled. Midway through the day, my 2nd shift partners would come in and start unloading all box trucks with unshredded material, at the same time loading those box trucks with empty bins and continue shredding. An hour or so before the end of the shift, all partners would start a clean-up to ensure the 1st shift can get a good start the next day. The co-workers that worked for me were excellent. Everyone had a good attitude and attacked the day without complaint. My partners did not see me as just their boss, but as a member of a tight team. My partners and I had a great relationship which was the best part of this job."
good,customers i serviced were pretty nice.
good,"Not very good hours, poor compensation, unconcerned management, free food but that was about the only redeeming factor"
good,get a large burrow of rags to be fold up in bundles to be ship out to companies. I learn to ship out rags bundles of ten and done thbem on my own. We disscuss the work processing to th e management and we got along well. My coworkers was okay and we got alng okay. The hardest part of the day if the head leader were out for that day and someone have to take lead. The most enjoyable part of the job that we would get out the work on time.
good,"Loved the pay and the hours, sadly the management team lacked the proper communication and problem solving skills to prevent poor employees from exploiting the time clock by staying out in the field while doing no work."
good,way overworked and underpaid. Never know what your going to do from day to day.
good,great company with great values. the specific location upper management lacked simple leadership skills. The lack of leadership skills made the culture a little toxic for middle managers like supervisors.
good,"Una empresa común y corriente, mucho trabajo se trabaja bastante siempre que la situación lo amerita"
good,I like it just ready to advance and i think id make more doing the same thing some where else... the company is good great people just unfairness at times
good,"i worked there as a fairly seasonal position, I had issues keeping pace myself but everyone was nice and most of them had been there a while. Very close knit and not a lot of different positions"
good,"I would not recommend as tasks were very physical and intense. The pay was very less for the nature of the work performed. However, goodies would be provided on occasions."
good,Not a bad place to work.  Advancement based purely on performance.  Great benefits and an ok salary but the job required 60+ hours a week to complete.  I learned a lot.
good,The company has a great culture that has employees that are tenured their for over 20 plus years. The upside to that is they know way more information on details needed to perform any job. Downside is leadership sees you as a number rather that an employee. Do your job. Leave. Wear a tie. Most basic Business Formal Company you can work for.
good,"The interview process with this company is unreal! You upsale and deliver and take in uniforms etc to be cleaned, I had 4 interviews just for this position. Each one on a different day and time. I guess they think everyone applying has no job and can come whenever they call. Some people have responsibilities with a current job. I found that a little much for the position. I interviewed at the same time  for a position delivering to the federal reserve and had one interview and was hired on the spot! STILL WORKING."
good,At cintas it can often be stressful. If your truck is not loaded you have to load it or short your customers. Managers not thankful for what you do. You have to bag borrow and steal to get the tools you need. They have a training program but truth be told most of your training is on the fly by trial and error.
good,The job wasn't the best i have worked for. I did not like my work shift. 4pm to 11pm. Job had dirty work conditions because of the soiled clothes and aprons.
good,"Leadership is average, company really wants to be known as a positive workplace although many people just tolerate it. Not bad if you find a location with a positive environment and people that want to help you."
good,Some supervisors are poor at giving instructions.  New people come and go but are not properly trained.  Employees are expected to train new people which I think is stupid because each person does their jobs differently.
good,"Was told to come in and wait to be trained and i got 1/4 of the managers time compared to the other person. Manager would bring coffees in for the other person but not anyone else. Some days they brought breakfast in for everyone. People asked "" can I help you with your sales, or finish them"", be careful."
good,it was a good job for 14 years. it really depends on the local management. the company is so large that sometimes you will have a bad manager . and they split your route and you loose pay.
good,"its a physical on your feet type of job never a dull moment always have things that need to be handle. its a fun job once you get the handle of things, the only i would say that the job pays salary so if you have long days you will get paid the same."
good,after your training as a route driver you will have no life if you want your route to grow. You spend a lot of after hours time restocking your van and sending e-mails. typical days are usually 12 hr days! that's included in when the business's close and you got to restock your van. my personal home started to become over whelmed as a warehouse. you had to take your ordered buisness product home.
good,This is a great company. There is lots of work always and a lot of room to grow as well. It does become very overwhelming at times and makes it hard to balance personal life and work
good,Anything in the Fire Protection industry is time sensitive and stressful.  This company has a difficult time providing vision and leadership that is meaningful.
good,"In most locations, the company is run properly and management and partners work cohesively. Other locations have cliques and advancement is difficult."
good,"the people were awesome, very kind and dedicated. Management was disconnected in their expectations and lacked teamwork. I liked the 4 day work week and it was close to home."
good,"start at 5am, find out what is not on your truck by looking at your load sheet maybe your all loaded up but more than likely your going to have to go grab some stuff which take time, than you go out to maybe 15-35 stops, you have smelly rags and wet mats that you have to pick up and a lot of the time you going to be running behind if you have to speak to the customer. they expect you to sale to accounts that have been with cintas for 15-20 years 4 times a year. They know what the deal is and don't want any part of it"
good,I enthusiastically work at Cintas. It's a partner friendly work place.The company supports the idea of work-life balance. For my better prospects I  want to change my workplace.
good,"There is opportunity to advance, but it will come at the expense of time with family or personal life. It is better to apply for a driving position as the pay is more competitive in that position."
good,"The benefits working for them is almost unbeatable. The salary for the area is more than most people make. Managers are not fun or easy to deal with. They do not care about their employees. Work is hard and taxing on the body. Most people quit as soon as they are off training and are put on a route. The hours are long and hard. There's days so long that it takes 2 route managers to get done and sometimes takes them longer than a day, when a driver is expected to get it done in one."
good,My typical day at work was just a fast pace work environment. Trucks would come in one after the other and we would have to unload them as fast as we could. The hardest part was dealing with the heat of working in the warehouse but you get used to it fairly quickly.
good,"A typical day at work for me is between 10-12 hours a day for 4 days a week, I've learned pretty good customer service skills and how to deal with all kinds of customers.  The management is okay but could be better if they're main concern was the customers and not money.  The workplace culture is pretty good, but I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with the conditions of the work truck and constantly trying to sell the customers product and the most enjoyable is a 4 day work week and the benefits."
good,"Decent opportunity. Very hard to move up in management unless willing to move.. kind of a dead end job, if your not willing to relocate. 4 day work week, and off weekends is great."
good,Over all I liked working for the company I just think they need to make some tweaks in how often they do they pay raises and be more sensitive to people needs because some of the managers people skills suck.
good,The facility and employees were nice and caring but management (not all) needed to be more professional. In the short time I worked there many managers got let go for several different reasons.
good,Go in early and know your route inside and out. Take seconds that count seriously it will benefit you in the end. Definitely not made for the average person. Be prepared to work hard and deal with conflict with a smile.
good,"It is a good company to work for but my experiences thus far exhibit poor work/life balance. Furthermore, there are times that it seems like I am not utilizing my educational background enough on a day-to-day basis"
good,Start out with this job and i kept looking for better employment. I worked early morning and got off early. I worked 4 days a week. Pay wasn't the best.
good,very poor communication; very high turnover rate;  however good pay and benefits; the four day work week is alright however you put in a lot of hours;
good,not with them long enough to provide review.  Going through transition with company.  i am not in a postion to provide any further update due to lack of time with new management and company policies as a whole.
good,"The business is fast paced with potential for large increases in both pay and advancement.  Unfortunately the high turnover rate with this company can be attributed to the capping of numbers for bonus, thus limiting your money, and if you don't adhere to the controlling nature of theie philosophy they look to move you to a better fit.  Good company, just not for me."
good,If you want to work for Cintas just about every other department is good except for the deep clean Department which is carpet and tile there is no schedule you can start anytime of the day at the last minute not even a 40 Work Week 60% of the time and no room for any type of advancement especially when your management hold you back from trying to apply to other departments your best bet is to go to the GM
good,"Cintas would be a great place to work under the right management. Unfortunately, my service manager has made it difficult for me to advance within the company."
good,working conditions can be very harsh no A/C in the trucks. Not having customers products and uniforms is an everyday occurrence.
good,"Overall Cintas is a good company to work for.  While some things could improve within the company, it has a good working environment and they focus on customer service and safety.  The people you work with and the people you meet on your route makes the day enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job is getting customer renewals which affect bonuses.  Some routes have difficulty meeting this requirement, while other routes do very well with renewals."
good,"this is a great job, if you are able to prioritize and lead yourself."
good,i learn how to do many different jobs at cintas it was a good place to work if you had kids with many different activity going on i loved what i was doing there
good,I have enjoyed my time at cintas they are a great growing and fun company .i had a medical issue and wasnt able to perform my job duties due to this matter .I. Think Cintas is great with there pay and benefits and well as there management. I am a great worker and very reliable for my job.Cintas allso has great jobs where you can apply at home or work they want to provide the b3st they can for there partners
good,"I learned alot about Inventory Management, Shipping and Receiving and how to work well with others., I learned to work on production, the people are horrible and like to gossip."
good,Management needs major improvement. It's like the blind is leading the blind. They do not like when others have difference of opinions. The workflow is unbalanced. There are overworked employees making the same salary as others who hardly work.
good,"Hard work, great rewards. If leadership does not believe in you. It is extremely difficult to move up. SSR have great schedules now. Only working 4-10's. support is not there, as they are always short handed."
good,"Lots of old fashioned rules, needs some updates on policies. Could use some better methods of getting the job done. Late start times in morning cause for late days working."
good,Ok job it depends on what your looking for when it comes down to a job . A learn a lot amongst working at this job the last four years. It taught me a lot
good,"Cintas is definitely a fast moving company. You gain a ton of experience around managing your team and working to successfully meet your revenue goals. This business is all about looking at the income statement and understanding each line to ensure you are running a profitable business. You are responsible for all aspects for your team starting with recruiting, on-boarding and training, as well as safety and training. In addition, you have a ton of metrics to help you succeed such as Key Performance Indicators. As a manager, you are in constant contact with your scheduler to ensure you are maximizing team productivity. Additionally, you drive customer service and ensure you are route riding with your team in the field as well as visiting customers to ensure customers receive the highest level of service and maximize cross-selling opportunities."
good,As a service sales rep. I serviced customers on route. They preach safety all the time which is great. But their vans have no a/c and very poor heat. When it is 90degrees outside. The truck interior about 110. It is the most unsafe situation I was in on any given day
good,"Great place to work if you already know someone who works there. Usually on hire from within, and if you are one those with a connection then it will be a great opportunity."
good,"Cintas has both highs and lows. On the positive side, it is a very stable company that offers competitive salaries and benefits and the opportunity to advance your career. On the other end of things, the nature of the business is very demanding, which can make finding a work/life balance difficult."
good,The company has good opportunities for all to move forward . The employees who work there are great people and would help when you need. The days could be long and demanding.
good,"A good place to work with great job security and decent advancement opportunities. However, I found that it was rather difficult to maneuver around and they do not value education."
good,good place to work even though I hate it but sometimes its good but most times its bad even though I hate it I do like it from time to time but overall the job is awful
good,"As a SSR you work 4 days a week which is great. Your are suppose to only work 10hrs a day but a lot of times its longer, which 12 to 14hrs isn't to bad when you only work four days a week. When you get your own route you lose money because its a base pay then the rest is commission."
good,It was a great company very easy job just management is all younger and a lil unorganized always came in with a great attitude eager and ready for work
good,"But they are working on heading in the right direction.  They hire lots of former military, but tend to rely on them to shoulder the heavy-lifting that past leaders tended to ignore in favor of immediate revenue, so it feels like a constant battle for accountability.  I think it will get better as more time passes and we have stabilized from so much recent change."
good,"At Cintas, we have step van trucks where we load and unload uniforms. We have them delivered to big and small businesses and plants where employees need uniforms to wear. We have their dirty uniforms picked up where we can take it back to the Cintas plant to have to wash. Then have them delivered the next week. We also deliver mats, bath towels, shop towel, etc. it is a physical labor job where heavy lifting is require. In order to drive step vans, we must have a chauffeur's license and a DOT medical card which I already have. I have 5 years of experience at Cintas."
good,the job was promising until the attack in new york on 9/11/2001 and the economy got worse and things begin to fall apart at the job fue to fears people had and especially the management
good,The moment the economy dropped I was asked by my service Manager to bill products and services that were not being delivered. after refusing to do this I was getting a warning everyday. most I could fight. I was fired for something my GM asked everyone to do 6 months earlier. The management in Calgary is a joke.
good,"My day consists of checking and replying to emails, printing aging report and call customers with past due balances. Arrange to have drivers pick up past due payments, or process payments via credit card or check by phone. Resolve any invoices discrepancies, shortages, pricing issues by first reaching out to the drivers to ask if they are aware of any issues with products at time of delivery, then advising Service Managers for approval of credit. Receive approval from General Manager and Service Manager on those accounts that are sent to collections, submit adjustments for write offs and bad debt. Also post cash on a biweekly basis. I have had more hands on experience, which has allowed me to key credits, apply cash and unapplied monies. Management is very helpful, and takes time to explain in detail reasons for credits, or pulling or product due to non payment and pricing. The hardest part of the job is having to pull the customer products due to non payment. The most enjoyable part of the job, is building a rapport with the customers and fellow co-workers which helps make my daily task go smoothly."
good,it was ok. Management was slow to move and implement. Worked extremely hard and was not payed for it. Hard physical work day to day
good,Very friendly partners.  Conservative company with strong financials.  Growing office with constant and urgent demands.
good,"This is an overall good company to work for. One of the things I always appreciated about Cintas and their management, was that if you want to grow with in the company and develop your skills you definitely can accomplish just that. I also respect that they strive to keep true to their mission statement in everything they do."
good,"Cinta's is a great company to work for, but it is not a company you can really build a career out of. I think that the company is great, but they need to advance more as well as pay more for what the guys do on a daily basis."
good,"A Typical day at Cintas consist of first we have our morning meeting, witch is only 5 minutes. We close with our stretch and flex. this gets us up and ready for our work day to began. I learn a great deal of safety and how the company works. My co-workers are fun and kind. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather in the winter its very ,very cold. When summer comes it's extremely hot. What I enjoy most about this job is the perks we get great deals at amusement parks, restaurants, etc."
good,"Company is know for being very spartan, also known as cheap.  Demands long hours and weekend work from management.  Best job at company is probably being a SSR, the person that makes deliveries in the truck.  Working in the plant is a low skill and low paying manual labor job.  Sales can be lucrative, but demanding with weekly sales goals."
good,"·	Regularly performs management level responsibilities, including mentoring"
good,"Nice transition for a summer intern, although management wasn't always sure what tasks for the interns to complete so days could go by very slowly."
good,EMC was a great company with excellent management. Incredible technology. Layoffs is a big part of their culture.
good,Job work/life balance is a challenge.  Very conservative company with multiple core values and a corporate culture that is driven and a prerequisite to employment.
good,"CONS:"
good,"very nice place,"
good,"I'm not going to lie to customers with invoices or other companies. "
good,"handling customer accounts"
good,"High expectations, high pressure atmosphere. Team dynamic.  Good training."
good,"its a typical warehouse/plant job. long boring shifts, learned how to operate 1 ton trucks, management is too soft. give every1 days off at the same time and screw the people left working over. good mix of young/old coworkers, hardest thing is the hours"
good,"4 day work week is cool. Besides that... LONG hours so the work week you are a void in your family life. However, they are very good with covering your route if you have something to do that cannot be moved during the week. Service Managers are great at their jobs."
good,"The people I worked with at Cintas were nice and easy to work with, but the pay was very low and the benefits/vacation were lacking compared to other work experiences."
good,"Everything started out great but quickly learned the GM was not an honest man, he was holding payment to vendors. There was complete chaos in the plant, the employees could not stand the plant manager. The GM had a few favorites and was deaf to new ideas that were not his own. They were both fired shortly after I left. From what I hear it is now a better place to work.  Cintas corporate values are wonderful and with the right leadership adhering to the rules, this establishment could be a good place to work."
good,Industry not compatible to my skill set. Do not enjoy early hours
good,"I am a Service Sales Representative with a garment route in the Kent valley.  I love having a 4 day work week with lots of incentives, but I would rather work for a company that promotes from within more often."
good,Good company to start with to build your career goals. Co workers are great and help the day to go by. Learned how to interact with various personalities. Hardest part is no overtime. Most enjoyable part is your co-workers.
good,"With my time at Cintas, I have learned a lot about accounting and how certain systems operate, to what it takes to run an effective business, to understanding that management is there to lead people and follow principles set before them. What I enjoy most about my job is 99.9% of my customers. Most of them I have gotten to know personally and have formed a bond to where they can call for anything in knowing that it will get done in a timely manner. Another asset of my job, that I enjoy, is the flexibility of hours and scheduling. However,the hardest and most frustrating part of the job is the lack of management skills across the board. The micromanaging and more worried about a certain number of outbound calls to customers, rather than making sure the percentage for the Accounts Receivable sector is accomplished and low. The transition from my initial start with Cintas, was from A/R Clerk then transformed in to a call center partner. Also another downside, is there is no cost of living raise built into the job. As of now, I feel no potential growth and as my time is extremely limited with my career path with Cintas First Aid and Safety. "
good,It is an okay place to work for but they misrepresent the positions.
good,"Flexible work hours, multiple jobs and training, loaded and unloaded trucks using hand trucks and fork lifts, used cherry picker to place stock in proper location, drove delivery route"
good,"Run a uniform delivery route and maintain all business aspects of each customer. I learned to develop better time managment skills, the importance of clear communication, and relationship building."
good,My work days were very busy everyday which I loved! I worked so well with the partners on my team and was always willing to work in other areas that needed help. The management was absolutely horrible. A new manager was brought into Cintas whom immediately targeted me as a threat. At Cintas I felt it was definitely not on my side that I am a woman who was trying to get to upper management level.
good,My day starts at 4 am when the alarm goes off. I get to work before 5am. I usually hit my first stop by 8 am. I finish my route by 4 pm. By the time I finish my paper work it is 5pm.
good,"trucks were usually loaded correctly, job was what you made of it."
good,Cintas has a very good culture and opportunities for advancement.
good,"Service Sales Representative, responsible for route and customer growth."
good,"I typically worked 10-12 hours per day, 5 days per week. I got along well with co-workers and management staff. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,Cintas is a good company to work for.  However if you are in sales  the location of territory will heavily depend on the success you can achieve. they offer a competitive base salary and good compensation plan.
good,"The job was easy, fun and my co-workers were enjoyable to work with. However, the management was not the most put together and the shifts were not coordinated with team cooperation."
good,"Days at work can be long and unpredictable, management had great people but a lot of change. Culture includes good people but lacks events and a sense of unity. A lot of room for growth within the company."
good,Just OK Executive MGT no respect to others. Grew too big. Salary was decent. Abuse salary employees hours. Pretty much on call 24/7 Would not recommend.
good,"I had never planned on staying, but I was able to hang in there a year with some decent Size sales. Unfortunately 75% of all orders are incorrectly sent out."
good,"Cintas is a very physically demanding job with long hours, they say it is from 1:30-10 but the truth is you leave when the job is done. I have worked numerous days that were 12hrs+. They have a short staff to do a lot of work but they pay very well and have health benefits. If you want a job that pays well has health benefits and you don’t need to be home or do anything but work then cintas is for you!"
good,"I think was good, formal, I was trying to learn, and improve there, but I feel discouraged, and a little discrimination for my English with the coworkers or no collaboration."
good,"Very disorganized but working to make a change. Customers often get over promised based on timelines that have been rolled out from the company. Enjoyed most of the people there and they were actively trying to improve their warehouse and workflow."
good,The work is good but product stock needs work. Organization of work areas need improvement. Production Manager positions need to be tested on qualifications of position.
good,Cintas is customer- driven organization which requires the utmost in professional integrity to achieve success .  Management should allow employees more freedom to enhance the customer experience.
good,Good place to work you learn lots and are helped with anything you dont know. All the training is given to you to do your job correctly. Benefits are good too
good,Delivery of uniforms and sanitation supplies. Lots of walking and moving around. Pay isn't that good. Management is ok. Some places are union and some aren't depending on location.
good,I would rather not give a review.  The company gave me a great opportunity for a career and for work early on in my career.  Not everyone will have same experience and it depends on the local leadership you have.
good,"Nice co-workers, people, not very flexible...."
good,"Cintas is a strong company that has grown exponentially over the past decade. Depending where in the US/Canada will greatly influence how happy you are with this company. It all comes down to local and regional leadership. Some are great, and some are not. However, no matter where you are in the US, it will always be a huge challenge convincing business owners to sign a 3-5 year contract for uniforms, floor mats, and bathroom supplies."
good,"During my time at Cintas, we had a fun group of people to work with that made working so much easier.  We had BBQ party whenever the team accomplished a goal."
good,"Upon arriving at work I would do a crossover with the previous supervisor as to the status of things. Equipment issues production issues if any. What are the priorities for the day. "
good,Good company but entrenched management with bad ideas and managerial skills. They do a lot of events to appreciate their employees but pizza parties don't pay rent.
good,"After you settle in with the company things begin to change. The people you work with are great, but the way the company does business is not. More focused on making their money than providing good customer service."
good,Worked at this company for over 6 years they raise and pay are for high school kids .poor management very high turnover rate this company only care about numbers
good,Was excited to work there after the interview. Ran the overnight shift wth lack of retaining workers because of the fast pace and pressure of work due to having to work equally as 1st shift with HALF the team. I pushed month thru every month due to the few employees who appreciated and saw how I pushed myself and worked alongside them and tried to make it work despite the lack of support.
good,Decent enough pay if especially for a young single person always ways to make money only problem is the company never has products so you constantly upsetting the customer and they lie about renewing contracts and constantly upsetting the customers with trying to get more money they even create fake contracts if the customer doesn't officially resign with them so the moral compass is bad
good,"Is a work place where you are relying on others to do their job, but they only make things harder. DirtyDirtyDirty! Sales Sales Sales! Customers don't really seem to like Cintas, but stay around for some reason."
good,I enjoy working with the employees.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management.  Working 14 or 15 hours a day is typical for the drivers.
good,"Come to work everyday not knowing what your going to be doing, stood over and watched the whole shift can't use the bathroom without a supervisor following you. I'm sure they could keep better staff if they would offer more money as pay rate not incentives. Understaffed the whole time I worked there."
good,had great health insurance and other benefits. Stressfull working environment due to unqualified personel having jobs they were not qualified for. Had several months wher I qualified for bonuses that I was never paid.
good,many different jobs you are expected to do and not enough time to learn each job.the lack of communication could be a problem as a lot of times you do not know when something happens til after it has been done.
good,Not a good job besides the pay mangers were racist and played favorites would not recommend this company to anyone very dysfunctional would not recommend
good,Coworkers are full of high school drama. Been there for about 2 weeks and people are already talking behind my back and spreading ridiculous rumors about me.
good,"The company has changed so much. Being a driver you are expected to do EVERYTHING. In meetings with management they say one thing, but when it comes to do it, it changes. Very frustrating! You get great pay, but it's not worth the stress."
good,"Overall Cintas is not a bad place to work. However, the fire division has doubled in size in the last four years and in turn management has had to make a lot of policy changes that they can’t keep up with themselves. As a large corporation it’s hard to work somewhere that can’t fire the employees that should be let go, and can’t hang on to the good ones that should be recognized. Being an employee at Cintas is like being a cog in the wheel. While there is a lot of room for growth and advancement, you might just lose your mind trying to get there."
good,decent paying job for the area. get sick leave upfront just an all around good job. hot during the summer time a cold during the winter be prepared to work
good,Learned a lot but started to not feel valued as team member.  Management often showed favoritism and wasn’t willing to let others prosper.  It was a learning experience
good,The people I worked with there are the ones that mad it a good place to work. But the managment there was not good. They say they are family and there all about family but there not.
good,"got burned out as a sales rep for their facility services department, likes car allowance. benefits pretty good and well known company. Too early of starts with sales meetings though"
good,"Varied as our product and service offerings, a typical day on the job will include developing and maintaining relationships with customers, replacing used and/or outdated products, servicing any equipment that requires periodic maintenance and helping identify additional services."
good,"My time in Cintas is just right - 3 years, I believe. Helpful and friendly staff and management."
good,"Cintas has a very strong and reputable Sales Training program. The job is a very blue collar/grind it out sales type role, but even after you leave Cintas, the training that they provided shows very well in interviews with other organizations."
good,"a lot of support from management at other locations, not so much at mine. a lot of confusion and lack of communication."
good,"Be ready to work hard and get rewarded for hard work. They pay well and train you well, but be prepared to earn these perks. If you are not ready to work to the bone this is not the company for you."
good,"I worked there for a month busted my bum off for the company and I got let go a month in because they claim they couldn’t see it going far in the future!?!? What’s that mean? "
good,"best part of the job is working 4 days a week"
good,Far to many managers and not very knowledgeable about certain areas like the trucks. Not very organized and lack of communication with employees particularly shuttle drivers.
good,Learned on the job at the entry level position. Had to multitask and work as a team to complete jobs. Hours varied and some of the coworkers were extremely hard to work with.
good,"Its great to start and get experience. But after when you plan to move up with the company, you are told and welcomed to do so. But hardly are able to"
good,"This job was okay. Good physical work, never at one place for too long which is great for people who don’t want to be cramped up in a office at a desk."
good,"Great companie, with good benefit package, and very good market of jobs."
good,"The NM location needs a lot of improvement in multiple areas. Sales leadership, customer service and daily procedures needed to provide a happy, positive workplace."
good,The company was overall good to work for.  My territory was based in the Boston vicinity and Southeastern Massachusetts.  I drove a van delivering medical supples.
good,"the company relocated "
good,Management means everything here. You have to hope you have good leaders and managers in your location or it could be a very challenging place to work for.
good,"family oriented work environment, room for advancement, available overtime, fast paced work environment. Takes care of their employees with good benefits."
good,"I have held 3 different positions at Cintas. There are opportunities for promotion, even if you do not get the job or promotion you apply for you may be offered something else. I have worked for both excellent management and poor management. I would suggest reading  ""The Spirit is the Difference"" to help you understand the culture Cintas strives to create. "
good,"Cintas was a great place to learn and grow as a sales representative. If you are looking to get into a low risk sales environment, Cintas is a great place to start."
good,I was young when I worked for cintas and I was too immature to understand the new pay scale. I left when they changed our commission rate. The benefits were great but at the time I was young and didn't consider the pros of that.
good,Worked evenings loading and unloading stock. Not a lot of career advancement opportunities. It was steady and honest work though. It was a good company to start out working for.
good,"Good organization for those starting their employment careers with potential to grow with in. Location affects each location differently. West Texas competes with the Oil Industry, hard to hire quality employees are the wages they offer."
good,"I was not happy with the position at Cintas. Most of the technology provided to me, did not work properly. I also ""broke down"" in one of the vehicles I was provided. This was very unfortunate and made me want to leave."
good,"Cintas was all number driven, most of the routes were over worked and service sales technicians were not payed for there time they were payed by commission on their routes.  With some accounts adding a lot of volume but little pay."
good,working with company helped to learn to work fast and efficiently .i learned how to get thing done correctly and in a timely manner.team work was key. one deptartment working together with another.
good,They really don’t care about your personal life business always come first .It is to far  of a commute for city people but overall it’s a decent job more for younger people not older.
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is that time went by quickly as an result of the production demands. The hardest part of the job was during the summer when it was extremely hot for the atmospheric conditions.
good,"Cintas was a great company that had many benefits for sales teams.  They had a strong culture that sometimes made it difficult for those that were not ""like-minded"" and was often times off-putting to diverse job seekers."
good,My overall thought is that some managers had that different bond with other workers and treated them differently even if they weren’t even doing their job.
good,"left to figure out things on your own, need to push every item on every customer even if they dont use the product.  More concerned about promoting products than getting to know the customer and their needs"
good,"A typical day required us to unload the dirty uniforms off the trucks then replace them with clean uniforms. Learning which company uniforms goes on what truck, and how to separate the different material to be properly washed. The management team was very professional and was very helpful. The hardest part of the job would be the weather effects the temperature in the warehouse, so some days could be intense, but water was supplied. The most enjoyable part would be that all employees enjoyed working together and the team work that went on in the warehouse."
good,Days are always busy.  Which is a good thing.  They are very concerned about the safety of partners.  Management sometimes lacks communication with partners.
good,Fast paced environment. A typical day was running around picking up paper to be shredded from different locations. Worked 4 10's which was nice. I got to spend more time with my family.
good,Fast paced and demanding.  Physically and mentally challenging. A mixture of very interesting and at times painfully boring. To be successful you'd better be ready to be devoted to the job.
good,Cintas could be a great place to work if the local management treated their partners with more respect.  The local managers have a habit to talk at their partners vs talk to the partner.
good,"Management can make your life and job stressful. Therefore, it depends on the management how your happy you are with your job. Management can be terrible. Benefits are good, and pay is pretty good."
good,Good job definitely a company that cares about making sure it have time with your family so if that matters a lot to you great company...............................
good,Good company with great benefits. Work life balance is important to them. Management can micro-manage a bit. Good culture. Having a territory is nice but the overall income is limited.
good,It was good working for Cintas but I had to leave due an injury I had on the job. My family was also relocating so i found employment in another industry.
good,"n	Managed cross-departmental tasks to ensure production met established goals and daily productivity"
good,"Work experiences differ from each Cintas location. Each having their own culture whether it be one of family and friends, frugal spending, or fun and frequent events. It all starts with the General Manager and works it's way down."
good,"It worked for my family for some time; then I needed to be closer to my daughter-when it was time to move on. i moved on."
good,It was a friendly environment. I was a temp for an employee out on maternity leave. I don't recall much about the environment or management. The hardest part of my job was leaving.
good,Great benefits but not enough money hourly for me to work 8 hours everyday comfortbly .  Attendance is important.  Safety then quality was the order and they are Great at both
good,If you are an early bird then the morning shift would work 5am start. Great culture and very diverse company. Many opportunities for advancement if you are willing to relocate.
good,"Pros:  Work/Life Balance, Benefits, Culture, Team Build Activities such as quarterly outings, Spirit Day, Charitable contributions. Monthly Location Meeting where breakfast was provided."
good,Good place to work. Inspected fire alarm systems in apartments and industrial facilities through our the Milwaukee area from Fond du lac to Madison Wi.
good,Fun workplace however owed back money and i never received it. Low pay. Hard work and long hours. The type of work required does not match with the pay given. Management was helpful.
good,"If you're looking to build a solid foundation Cintas is the company to start your journey. Stable company; but, it will consume a lot of your time. Perfect for young upstarts just graduating college."
good,I do not have any comments regarding the company in itself. They only need to hire people as  office managers that are professional and educated. No further comments.
good,"New manager was not fair, did not treat me as well as other employees, for which I had the more challenging position and time consuming, therefore I did not bring in the numbers they wanted"
good,Work was hard everyday when you were the only one doing the housekeeping and no one helping you. I have to clean everything by myself. I learned that working by myself isn't good even when you have a big building to clean inside and out by yourself. the management there was always on everyone's case about nothing. there were a lot of different people that worked there. the hardest part of the job is doing all the work in a short amount of time that they give you. and the most enjoyable part of the job was when they did party's  for us and games and contest. like when I got an award for a safety contest.
good,"It was a good opportunity to network with people of all walks of life. It promoted communication skills, sales strategy, and persuasive tactics to accomplish goals."
good,Decent place to work.  Four day work week was nice.  Benefits were decent.  Pay was decent but was looking to advance in my career.  Could use additional on the job training.
good,"a typical work day was working in a warehouse that was cold in the winter and hot in the summer, I don't remember much about it because it was so long ago."
good,Everyday the only thing that matters is finishing the quotes.  No matter how long it takes.  Poor truck conditions and lack of product makes keeping the customer happy very difficult
good,"I do not feel it is necessary to write a review of a current job. I would not be looking if everything was perfect. "
good,"Fun environment with most co-workers, not flexible hours and wasn't guaranteed a break most of my shifts. "
good,"my typical day at work would begin in the work vehicle to drive to the customer and check there first-aid supplies and access their needs. i would then go to the van and load the supplies from hand held device to the van's wifi system that would then print out an invoice to be given to the customer.  one thing i learned about cintas first aid selling was that there were items that needed to be forced onto the customer, that was not the case with zee medical or mr. first aid.  i didn't always agree with the management rules, but they were the boss and i needed the job.  the work place culture was very military and most decisions seemed to be based on laws set forth.  selling really wasn't that much of a skill as it was with other companies such as zee or mr. first aid.  the most difficult part of the job is that the company has taken control of your work day and the creative selling part is gone.  the most enjoyable part of the job always and will be the people you come in contact with."
good,"Monday through Friday work schedule with 40-45 hours usually invested. A lot of driving between customers, but the customer base was good quality. Unlimited portfolio to sell from, but small portion of the revenue goes to SSR."
good,Cintas offers good benefits to it's employees but their anti union stance is a little much. Of the hours of training videos I had to watch roughly half of them were anti-union videos.
good,"pretty good benefits , paid vacations and holidays , good work place , not to stressful , physically demanding , you need. the ability to work in extreme weather conditions"
good,As a Fire Sales and Safety Representative you have many different things to do such as selling fire equipment and keeping up the maintenance for what you do sell.
good,Work-life balance is something that they struggle with maintaining. Plenty of opportunities to advance it's just very stressful to get to that point. A lot of good coworkers and managers. Can sometimes be a bureaucracy when decisions are made.
good,"It was stressful, but loved to make sure my tasks were completed on a daily basis. It was competitive, but the benefits were worth it. Management could have been more personable."
good,The typical day starts early with deadlines that must be met for ordering early in the shift. Each day has a different set of variables that set priorities for production in that day. New account setup often dictates the need for production partner placement. Client turn over and uniform replacement must be forecast in order to maintain stock of uniforms
good,"Company is not bad, however, the people are a different story. Departments are put in a scale, for example high class, middle class, and low class. It is very noticeable. Communication is not the greatest."
good,"You run routes all over between Hernando and Sarasota. They have a strict time crunch daily. Expected sales goals for each driver. "
good,The Job was easy and the people were great but no room for job advancement. You had to have known the managers personally to be able to move up to different positions which is hard because the managers were always changing. The culture was great there and the benefits were worth it but the pay in general for production was awful. There were a lot of safety hazards and the company cut corners on a lot of things.
good,Knew that after the merger I was a goner.  They are looking for low paid delivery drivers. Less than 20 percent of pre-merger employees are left with the company.
good,"Weekly pay, good hours, on cold days outside it's very cold on the inside and hot days outside it was very hot on the inside.Off on weekends with overtime."
good,"Cintas is a relatively laid-back, stress-free environment. Your job/life balance is excellent, and you can get a lot of work done without feeling like you have to live there. However, as great as that is, if you start out at a lower level then don't expect to move up, at least any time soon. Instead, expect a whole lot of empty promises of advancement, which will never happen. You have to basically hope and pray that you get a manager who actually cares enough about you to want to see you succeed. I would definitely recommend this job to somebody who's perfectly content to make $12-13 for the rest of your life, but if you want to work your way up from the bottom and see your full potential utilized, look elsewhere."
good,"productive, fun, educational, rewarding, safe, exciting, busy, fast paced, ethical, good management, good pay, good team, great customers, challenging work, good vehicles."
good,no room for advancement if you did not have a college degree. People were nice but pay was low and hard to make my bills with what they pay. Very strict place to work
good,unloaded trucks and got all the uniforms ready to be washed right away. organized all uniforms to avoid any mix ups and to ensure proper delivery to be made to the customer
good,"I didn't enjoy the sales part of the job as I was younger and inexperienced.  Good pay, good culture and seemed like a very viable and stable company."
good,To be discussed they were a lot of things I loved working at Cintas but my department winch was the Shredding department got sold and it was never the same after that
good,"Cintas morning shift started at 6 a.m. and ended at 2:30 p.m.  Cintas is closed most major holidays. It is a production line type system, it can be really hot in some areas."
good,its a great place to work fun and really laid back. a wide change of things to do... there is very little overtime but not much :(..its a Monday-Friday job with no weekends
good,"My schedule varied, I would work all different shifts throughout the week including weekends. I learned a lot about teamwork and floor care, and it gave me a greater respect of other people's property."
good,"Some Cintas locations were great places to work, some were not as engaging and supportive between departments. Difficult in the plant to find work/life balance because hiring is so difficult and the interview process takes a long time."
good,"pfair compensation some good benefits i would work for them again but they tend to be money motivated and did not have a family type atmosphere ,,,,,,"
good,good people to work with but management needs to communicate more.  I have learned quite a bit since I started here. A little faith and respect goes along way.
good,G&K Services was acquired by Cintas in March 2017. Rapid changes for employees and customers. Only time will tell if the new culture will be a good fit for the old G&K employees.
good,"The insurance and 401k are decent.  Solid company, but goals are driven by the share holders and management is weak across the board.  You have a lot of flexibility but also have a lot of responsibility as far as your customers are concerned. Somehow you are responsible for more than just the duties of your position."
good,"It was an okay experience. I would recommend it if you like to be constantly under stress. Overall I did learn quite a bit, but I think they are more interested in easing investors than customers at times."
good,"All revolves around how much money you can make the company. No one cares about what you have done. What you are doing right now is never enough. Any effort is quickly forgotten and insufficient.  Management pretends to care about partners.  The pay is not compensative for the effort put in.  Positive discontent means that you are never satisfied and always looking to better things.  The concept is good.  The way it is implemented in the company is not. I put in over a decade with the company. When I left, I felt like everything I had accomplished over the years was meaningless."
good,"This company can be very stressful and may require to work at the early mornings of the day, depending on what position you get. Over all the management staff are sometimes not very helpful."
good,Its an ok job im just going back to school and need stable hours. If you like being out of the office then my department is great for you. But if you dont like sporadic hrs then dont apply for deep clean.
good,This was a good experaince as the culture is great and people understand the importance of people time and value for their contributions overall. Good time spent here
good,"Calling on a variety of businesses for uniform and facility services needs. Typically begin with facility services, such as floor mats, towels, restroom supplies, then moving to the uniform operations, where there is an increased opportunity for sales/commissions."
good,Productive and fun place to work. Great products and marketing material as well as friendly staff and ssrs are very hel[pful. great product lines as well.
good,"Working at Cintas you will have to stand on your feet for 8 hours a day in the same spot doing the same thing over and over again. The hardest part about this job was, making sure the machine you worked on was functioning properly."
good,"A very busy environment, it absolutely required to do as much multi task. Sometimes it was overwhelming but learned to adjust and manage day by day. The hardest part of the job was not enough time."
good,"To even get notice in this company, you'll have to pull weight. It may take some time but with hard work and consistently, they will definitely notice you."
good,"You must really have to know someone to advance with in the company! it doesn't really matter how well you do at your job unless you are ""in"" with the management"
good,Overall a good place to work that offers advancement if you are willing to put in the time. Political culture at times that gets in the way of business results. Good benefits to go along with a competitive salary.
good,day-in day-out job functions serving customer base are an enjoyable mix of hands-on physical work and building/maintaining relationships with customers.  Frustrations come about when other departments don't serve you as well as you are expected to serve the end customer...
good,Unitog was bought out by Cintas. Cintas was over aggressive on ruin charges on old garments. I had little to no authority to make decisions on my route.
good,"unless you are becoming a driver, your not going to make any money if you work in the warehouse. no room for growth just a good job if you have no other choice management some are cool others are not as friendly."
good,"Sales ranking the top 35% of the company, 46 out of 515 sales representatives."
good,It is great to have a stable place to work .The Managers and coworkers are all very good to work with.It is very nice to work for a top ten fortune 500 company.The available training is second to none and keeps all of the employees at the top of there skill levels.
good,"The hardest part of this job, was being stuck on the road in storms which sometimes was difficult to operate a big truck. The co-workers worked together as a team and the atmosphere at the job decent."
good,This company is a huge corporation with good pay and great benefits. I found them cold and impersonal to their employees and left because of their treatment of fellow employees.
good,"Cintas expects a lot from their employee-Partners, but are willing to compensate accordingly. The people are great, but some of the management is a little delusional about what goes on."
good,"Daily deposit, submit for invoices, printing of daily reports, customer service, phone calls, audit process monthly. Help potential employees fill out application online. Post payments of invoices from vendors."
good,I enjoyed the work when we had some but they could have done a better job of making sure second shift had more bulk to work on and the hours made it hard to schedule anything else around.
good,You have to be willing to work hard and fast from the minute you clock in to work. You have sale quotas you have to meet and work hard to get them and is a job requirement.
good,"Well a typical day would be loading dirty garments into slings at a very fast pace. Working with wash bay attendant.Sorting dry linen into bins. The hardest part of the job was working in damp and wet surroundings, the most enjoyable part were the free garments if needed while at work."
good,Typical day at work would be to get whatever needs done for the drivers in the morning and work what needs to be done for the next day for the rest of the day.
good,Cintas puts the clients first and makes sure there is harmony and cohesiveness with each division of labor from the sales department to plant production to service reps.
good,"Hours is okay. Pay is not as good. Poor management, heavy work. A lot of walking, trucks breaks down many times. the enjoyable part of the job is going home."
good,The company is basically like a family. The work environment was awesome. everyone has a job to do and does it. no one hovering over you. open environment.
good,I was with Cintas for one year.  We were there to do the transition.  Everything went well. The management was good.  The co-workers were nice to work with.
good,"I learned and grew a lot in my time with Cintas. I had to think on my feet and problem solve constantly. I thought I was great at customer service before, but my skills were pushed to a whole new level in my time with Cintas."
good,Cintas offers a 4 day work week for some positions. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. Service vehicles can be uncomfortable in the summer and winter months.
good,"everyday was something different I learned so many job skills also had various warehouse skills.Over all I learned a whole lot about the customer service,retail, warehouse skills."
good,Cintas was a very large company. But even with such a large company I had my place. The workers and staff were very friendly and our jobs all went very smoothly. Staff and management were friendly and easy to get along with as well
good,"Getting to work by 4:30, mentally and physically preparing myself for the day and the customers. Fueling my truck every morning and starting my route."
good,"Good company but near minimum wage."
good,Cintas has great benefits and the salary is good overall.  Hours are long.  The only real issue I had with Cintas is that they hire all young people and end up with high turnover.  They do not hire any older employees who are qualified/experienced and who would probably reduce the turnover rate.
good,"Multi tasking , working with partrners daily to ensure customer satifcation, managment has high turn over reate because of the pay and hours due to properly do the job"
good,"This was an ok job. Provided good stability and possible opportunities to move up. If you only speak English, there are some language barriers as most employees English was their second language."
good,The typical Cintas work day begins at 4:30A.M and ends around 5:00P.M. You are off every weekend and most holidays. It is difficult to move up in management unless your willing to relocate. It is a very physical job lots of climbing and walking. Great medical and retirement benefits.
good,"good company to work for, but division was sold. new companies benefits were lacking. would gladly work for Cintas again"
good,"It's great to have the sense of being free and working at your own pace with no one watching over your shoulder. I had a lot of respect for all of my co-workers and most of the management team. Dealing with customers was my favorite part of the job. I just feel like for the work that you do and all of the responsibilities that you have, the compensation isn't very reasonable."
good,everyone is a hard working individual. the environment is fast pace and very accurate. everyone works as a team so no one gets left behind.. very good job too work for
good,"Researched and helped to resolve open items such as unapplied funds"
good,"I wish there was a push for 2nd production partners moving on to service,first shift, or other opportunitys. I have been here for less than six months and moved to a lead on 2nd. Which is practicably the same thing as before but more responsibility."
good,"I spent almost 1 1/2 years with them. It was better compared to what I've had in the past but poor management. I was a rout driver for the Sanis division of 14 months spent there( 1 of 3 drivers for Sanis). I had an unfortunate accident with my ankle back in February of 2015 and they kept me working despite my restrictions from the doctor. Pay is great if you can sell things like a sales rep can. If you enjoy talking to people then you may want to stay away. Then I became a custodian because my numbers were not the best. I learned a lot about my self while being here. Had some soul searching moments at times when I thought that I wouldn't make it to see another day. Some of my coworkers were not the best bunch of the company. I only had a coworker that was nice to me at the end of my employment. Hardest part of the job to me was, when management wants 20 different things done in less than hour when visitors are coming to tour our facility. The stress and anxiety come home with you at the end of it all! Not much room for advancement unless you have a trade skill/a college degree, or military background. Job security- NEVER a LAYOFF in the company's history!"
good,"Cintas overall is a great company but this particular branch was a misrepresentation of the company. The management was immature and the atmosphere was not professional at all. However, when I visited other branches I found them to be very helpful and professional."
good,"Clean, beautiful building. Everyone is well dressed and polite. This company will even offer overtime work in the factory area during the holidays to give extra spending money to the employees."
good,Management was lazy and not willing to help you become better.  Culture was horrible everything was just pawned to the driver.  Management never took responsibility when things were not done properly.
good,Great company to work for and they are nation wide so you can easily transfer to anywhere in the U.S. if you need too.  Most of the current employees are tenure and love working for the company.
good,"Cintas provides a environment for young professional development.  great opportunity for a young professional to make over $100,000 if willing to work hard."
good,"For a lot of the workers, English was not their first language so it was just difficult to communicate with each other. Other than that, there was a good atmosphere, we had holiday parties on site for each holiday, and everyone was friendly."
good,"good atomsphere, good place, good managers, vacation, good hours,   medical, dental, 401K, vision, good team, good people"
good,Good hours but little work/life balance. Management is kind to your face but dont mess it or everything changes very quickly.
good,"The people are great.  Pay not so great for the volume of work load.  Sometimes due the lack of experience of teams, easily avoided mistakes happen."
good,"Wash alley Operator "
good,"All in all Cintas was a good company to work for, however some of the routes required more than one person to complete the job in a timely manner.  Some days you could expect to work 12+ hours.  Hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day.  Most enjoyable part was meeting new people going to new places as well as working Mon-Thurs."
good,"Review Daily invoices, Provide service for all Bulk, uniforms, and product deliveries, resolve any daily issues and provide feedback, and ensure Customer satisfactions. Daily check out and reconciliation of accounts."
good,"The objective when I started to work at this company was to get in and get the knowledge to advance.  Since I've been here, I've realized that it isn't your work ethic that gets you promoted but how well you rub elbows with the top executives.  I've never been affiliated with a company that operates in such a manner and it isn't a company that I would like to continue to experience complacency with."
good,Dramatic work experience. Plant manager does not support employees. Needs union. If you are a women and they promote you to a predominantly male job they will harass you and sabotage your work area in hopes that you will quick or jump at the opportunity to work in the office.
good,"Cintas is a fast pace working environment, very physically demanding. We service businesses that needed uniforms, mats, paper towels, and other restroom services. Each day coming in I would log into my handheld computer where they have a list of job sites I have to go in and service. Each place typically dirty towels and uniforms we would switch out with fresh clean replacements every week, two weeks, or monthly depending on the customer preference."
good,"Good company to work for. Equal opportunity employer. Extensive training for different position, and requires attention to detail. Great learning experience."
good,"Juggernaut of the industry - good support for personnel."
good,A typical day was contacting delinquent customers via phone to secure payment.  Management was excellent to work with.
good,"Operate and manage your own route on a daily basis. Learn on the job through working with others in your position as well as learning as you go. A flexible yet inconsistent training period before taking over your own route. Aside from the initial training period you will scarcely work with your ""co-workers."" Mainly deal with the management team assigned to you. The hardest part of the job is balancing corporate standards as well and the wants and needs of your customers without tarnishing the current relationship between them. The best part of the job is the flexible work schedule (4 day work weeks)."
good,"good place to work"
good,I don't know if any amount of money could get me back working with this company.  In my three years with the company must have witnessed a revolving door of managers.......around 4 different ones being fired and new ones hired.  The place is a joke.
good,Nice breakroom; Plant manager talks to partners like they are children
good,Work day consisted of dealing with employees and customers and managing the location budget. Was in charge of 160 employees and a budget of $15 million dollars. The hardest part of the job was staying staffed and managing productivity. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of clients and the relationships that were formed with employees.
good,"This would be a great job for a teen or young adult still living at home. You cannot live off of 8.00 an hour. Co-workers and managers were nice, warming and welcoming but the pay is not worth staying here."
good,"A good employer, maintained a positive environment. Pay and benefits on pace with industry averages. Management is a good balance of instruction and coaching while allowing for individual responsibility and achievement. Customer service is a focus."
good,Early morning and late nights. Very unstructured programs. No system of who is promoted very political and lots of brownnosing.
good,"Loved working here, but you where never heard from the higher ups. They did not like if you were to talk about issues that you would like to have solved, even if you came up with many ideas, they would be shot down or not even taken care of. I liked it because I moved around a lot and I learned a lot in my time there. My direct manager was amazing and she trained me well. Loved meeting my customers but could not stand how higher management treated me and others. Co-workers where awesome. Felt like no matter how well I did, it was never good enough."
good,"Great company that has a variety of challenges on a daily basis.  You will work hard, but you will be exposed to every facet of the company very fast if you are looking for a challenge."
good,"Contact customers for payment"
good,"As a route driver, I don't have a boss with me on a daily basis.  This means that I am not being micro-managed.  I go about my business and get my job done, then go home.  As long as I am taking care of duties, I don't hear much from my boss at all.  If I do need my boss's help, he is always available."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cintas and meeting hundreds of new people on a monthly basis.  The work is very hard and dirty, You work in all kinds of weather conditions and come home worn out. Customer generally appreciate you efforts and that make it worth the hard work.  Management seems to be more concerned with the bottom line than the loyalty of it's long term employees, If you get up to a great rate of pay watch your back. Over the years I saw many long term loyal employees let go with little reason. When my reviews went from the honesty, hard work, and the integrity I brought to the Company, to about how I made more money than others in my position, I saw the writing on the wall and was soon let go with sketchy circumstances.  They even went as far as sending a ex coworker to invite me to lunch, basically to find out if I was planing to sue.  They were involved in many lawsuits while I was there. The only one I saw come to settlement involved overtime for the drivers. Many of them got settlement checks. I am not a litiges person and just took what I learned and moved on.  They do have excellent benefits and still hold my 401K."
good,what a great place to work with lots of great people. everyone's always open to help
good,"Training is awful. The culture was great of partners in my location, but not all upper management were willing to help. I was new to the company as an office manager and felt that a better training program would of saved my job."
good,This job was okay consider but it was very hot and hard but I work there until I found something better with higher pay. The best part of my job was working with my coworkers because we had fun while working and everything was done. The hardest part was the heat in the building and a typical day for me was to inspect uniforms for defects and management was confusing because the supervisors would quit at the drop of a dime.
good,"Productivity improvement industrial engineer / rental locations"
good,"Just not the place for me. I do not enjoy my days there and production is treated like the ""lower class"" of Cintas. It was great for a first time job but that's about as far as it goes for me. Time to move on."
good,had to do certian amount of clothing inspections per hour. it takes time till you get use to it but fun.
good,"Gained valuable experience as a new business sales rep. Learned the basics of cold-calling, phone blocking, and creating a pipeline."
good,Unloaded and loaded trucks. Ran high bay forklifts. filled picking area. did shipping
good,"It is an okay place to work, depending on your position.  Higher level managers tend to have more flexibility."
good,"Early starts 4:30-5:00 am. The management is good will go out of their way at times to help you, if they are not on a truck working. Cintas is really into safety, which is good, safety meeting once a week. The people that work there a very nice / good people. the hiring process is very long , 3 to 4 different interviews. The hardest part of this job is not really the job its getting your truck losded with the correct produ"
good,Collections Calls/Resolving any questions/concerns regarding the services performed and the bills customers have received. Also work on unapplied cash and resolve if a refund is required and/or apply to the correct invoice/account.
good,my daily task includes doing multiple inspection and critical daily test on machinery and boilers
good,"You would got to the shop, pick up your truck and paperwork. Then head to the address you have on the paperwork. When you get to the job, you go over what your job is with the contact to make sure you clean the right area. You then run hoses from the truck and clean what ever it is that needs to be cleaned. "
good,"I had many different jobs there"
good,"Where do I start first, Cintas is a company for freshman students looking for employment. Otherwise if you are not you will need a second job to survive and pay bills."
good,"in work everybody should hear uniform of cintas partner. I learn to work fast, to respect partner, respect the time. I worked with my co-workers, we help each other. the hardest part of the job is in the beginning, and the most enjoyable part of the job is when I realized the work is dine."
good,"A good company to work for but pay is low."
good,"I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a position right out of school, unless you don't want a life."
good,I show up for work  check the amount of trucks to be loaded. Next  we pull them in loaded according to the the load sheets. After they are loaded I clean up around this time its normally time to quit. The people I work with are good people we all have the same goal as far as work to get the job done. We all get alone. The hardest part is around holidays we have to load twice as many truck to make up for the day's off. The most enjoyable part is that management allows us to do our jobs if we need anything or assistance they are there but they don't feel a need to continually hover our us as we do our jobs. 
good,"Everyday is different such as it being slow or sometimes once or twice week we would get real busy. Start everyday by checking entire warehouse to ensure evrything is in place and ready to start up. Depending what we have I would either drive a forklift/clamp truck for most of the time or stand in front of conveyor and pick white paper. I've learned how to be more organized due to us makig sure we fill work document periodically. Learned a lot more about safety, monthly training either of something or as reminder to past safety topics. Management is great there. They will work with you in anything you might need. The same goes for co-workers, they are all kind people and willing to help if they you need it without asking. The job is fairly easy going but you do once in while where it becomes a little stressful because the machinery is not working properly. There's only a couple things I dislike which are the hours and the pay."
good,sold new products as they came out. Great training and great bennifits. They worked with you.
good,"Billing, answering phone calls, making copies, filling. Billing has been the hardest due to no proper training."
good,Growth driven organization with a very structured environment. Great opportunity for some sales and account management experience. Co-workers are very helpful for newcomers as well as veterans.
good,"My experience with Cintas was very humbling, It was a very fast -paced sales position that did not allow for realtionship building. The management was like a dictatorship and was intrusive at times and hostile."
good,"Work day starts at 6 am. I fill garment orders from stock, enter results into computer, and maintain emblem inventory. I have learned nothing in this position. I work mainly alone. The hardest part of the job is the physical requirements: clothes are heavy, I am on my feet all day. I enjoy working without much supervision."
good,"Each day was a series of supervised employee functions, payroll, inventory, vendor relations, and daily problem solving."
good,A typical day starts with making sure that all Service Sales Reps. (SSR) have everything that they need to meet the customers needs. Also through out the day field phone calls from customer to address their needs and concerns. Also the service supervisor is in charge of training for new and tenure service partners. Then from time to time we are required to get on a route to cover vacations if there is no one else to cover the route.
good,"A typical day for me was to come in seperate shirts and press them to meet deadlines. I learned how to work with lazy people who feel because they have been there 100yrs that they dont have to do anything....smh. Nevertheless, I still did my job. Management didnt have a back bone. Most of the coworkers acted as if it was High school. Way to much foolery at this plant for me, so i had to move around and find something else."
good,"I went through and completed a rigorous Management Training program at Cintas which was an excellent source of management experience. In this program, I rotated through and managed every department at the facility. My last rotation was in the sales department. I instantly took a liking to sales and decided I wanted to pursue that field further. We had weekly phone sessions which we would make one call after another to set up appointments for the week. Between those appointments, I would make ""cold calls"" which is randomly walking through doors to try and generate business. The management at Cintas was good but I felt like they were not set up for success due to a lack of training which is why I decided not to take a management position with them. Overall, Cintas is a good company with great people. I still keep contact with many of my co-workers and I left Cintas over 5 years ago. In the end, it was not the type of industry that I wanted to remain in."
good,"A typical day at work involves me doing my job then when I am done with my job I help coworkers do their job. I learned to do more than one job at a time and I also trained 5 coworkers in a 4 year time period. Management does not reprimand or correct certain employees for incorrect work practices so it makes our job more difficult because we will have to do what they were supposed to do. The hardest part of the job is trying to efficiently do my job when equipment breaks most of the time, and when products are mixed and not labeled properly. The most enjoyable parts of the job are break time, time off, and pay day."
good,A typical day at work was filling all orders on uniforms in our company database. I worked with a lot of friendly people. The hardest part was shipping the orders out.
good,Help drivers prepare their trucks for the route
good,Fast growing company with growth potential but takes lots of hours and will burn you out quickly if you don't have good time management skills.
good,Good place to start a career.
good,A typical day consist of ten to twelve hour days. Dealing with customer face to face. The people there are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job is the physical and manual side of working.
good,"Very good place to work, but like anywhere it does have its pros and cons. Overall, it is truely upto you on how you make your mark with Cintas."
good,"I learned alot from this company. Was a great experience to start working fo Cintas,"
good,The partners that work at Cintas care about their coworkers and certainly care about their customers. However upper management is all often disconnected from reality. I recommend working for Cintas but not the Nashville Rental location.
good,Great company
good,This company is a good company to work for if you enjoy driving trucks and providing excellent customer service. I like to be in front of customer and servicing their document management needs.
good,They are very organized and well staffed. I was given a great opportunity to become six sigma certified.
good,"Great place for a young professional to start their career. Work life balance can be non existent at times, but overall it was a great experience. Cintas helped me grow and I appreciate the company!"
good,"Co-workers and wages/benefits made going to work bearable but management made it difficult. Although I was there for many years and built a good rapport with customers, management forced to into handing in the 2 weeks' notice."
good,It has great benefits and amazing place if you want to climb the ladder but if you are just looking for a job this is not it. Work life balance its non existence as supervisor
good,If you are motivated and not afraid to work hard it’s a fun place to work with a great culture . They do recognize hard work and there are ways to make good money.
good,Position I held had a great work schedule.  The trucks used could have been more updated. The trucks consistantly breaking down. Management was good to work with.
good,Lots of demands put on the employees...qork load is unfair each driver should have a partner...lots of overtime but you wont get paid for it. We worked on getting a union it got voted in but they waited til it fizzled out.
good,"Not bad. Can be very stressful due to labor requirements. Work area is very warm, nice in winter terrible in summer. Management tries but depends on Manager. Very multicultural staff, can cause issues with communication due to language barriers."
good,Cool place overall but don't expect great pay. managers were available but always very busy because we were always loosing a representative. turnover rate wasn't good.
good,It’s an okay place to work. The people is what drives you to come to work very friendly. Can it be some changes to the company ? Yes it can be but that’s at any company. Good place for the weekly and weekend to be off
good,Overall a decent company. Not always the best as far as advancement - especially if you are a woman. Very male-driven. If you are a female you better be prepared to work in the office or in the plant.
good,"Unrealistic expectations from contracts secured by sales.  Continually loss of accounts due to the inability to meet these expectations.  With the exception of one female manager, very little management support by male managers. Hourly paid and overtime rarely allowed, thus almost impossible to stay on top of accounts during a normal 40 hour work week."
good,"There are long work days, with little time to eat. The company use to be great, but there main concern on sales,  sales, and more sales. The pay and  benefits  are great, but you have to work long days."
good,"Great place to work if you have the motivation and work ethic."
good,"This division seems to be well behind the other divisions based on pay, company focus, and employee satisfaction/retention. Every MAM is focused on the rental division. Meanwhile the fire division is over half a million behind on projections and no one is getting bonuses or getting a fair opportunity to get fair commissions based on the market price for inspections being over half of the Price Level one price that allows for highest opportunity to make full commission. Each sales rep is lucky to get in on the lowest price level commission payout just to win the business. This includes a bidding process on all major target accounts that will never be paid out on a full commission based on market pricing."
good,It's nice to go out and talk to people (customers) and learn something new almost everyday. The hardest part is probably dealing with a new customer that is just mean and rude.
good,"nice work place, safe to work in, the company is very good with the benefits but just the management need to improve a lot especially with handling people"
good,"The people were nice to work with, more concerned with making phone calls than having to be off for husband's surgery, was told by manager filling in for my manager on maternity leave, ""that when I get back I had better jump on the phone."
good,"Good environment to work. Close to home for me. Very busy company with lots on the go. Good people working there, friendly and helpful. Would have preferred more advancement opportunities."
good,Great Outside sales organizations great way to figure out if sales is right for you. you have the ability to advance your career and learn from the best.
good,"A typical workday was fast paced and competitive. There was no time for slacking, it was hard work. The managers were good at their jobs and made sure things got done. I learned how to work in a more fast paced environment. The workplace was hot and everyone stood the majority of the day. Most employees were nice. The hardest part of the job was working against the clock. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly environment."
good,"Great environment and people to work with. Not much room for growth, which is the main reason I am looking for another position. Management is really helpful and involved with each and everyone"
good,Cintas is a ok working place but it is very stressful because they do not take the appropriate steps to train new employees. The office manager was not friendly and tried to over work you with the appropriate training.
good,"Cintas is a fast paced work environment with safety as its number one goal.  The management is great and approachable.  Lots of different cultures throughout the plant.  Lots of opportunities to advance to.  Friendly people.  Occasional celebrations for birthdays and anniversaries, along with company picnics."
good,"This was my first job out of college, and it offered me a great opportunity to build the foundation for my career. The company knows what it's doing to be successful, but you don't always feel like you're a part of that plan. "
good,"Great atmosphere and great place to learn. They have quite a bit of room for advancement within the corporation with room to relocate if you wish. "
good,Cintas its all about who you know if you do not know anybody. its going to be a hard time climbing up that latter. all in all the team is great the partners are great. Management needs a little help because you have someone telling you want to do that has never been in the jungle.
good,Work/Life balance was very poor. On an average week I would typically work 58 to 60 hours a week. Trying to have a life outside of work was tough throughout the week.
good,"Very result oriented company, great place to learn and get your career to the next level.  Opportunities for advancement are minimal unless you are ok with relocation."
good,"If you are not a true believer in the Cintas way you will struggle, you better drink the koolaid if you want to advance. If you do you will do great but you better be open to relocating...."
good,Typically a very fast paced environment always moving very hot not an air conditioned building. People are very friendly however coworkers do not like the fans on due to living in hotter environments so if you like to sweat it is the place for you.
good,"It was a position for me to be able to provide for my family. "
good,"Overall, a strong and growing company you can find a long term career in. However, size is also its downside as the company has grown exponentially over the past 10+ years with independent locations controlling their share. This has caused increased stress within the locations with management having difficulties adjusting to the increased volume."
good,"Willing to help you, support family values, Some personal are able to lean on & trust. Go in full steam. The training is top-notch,you're well educated on all the services that they provide for their customers, Be prepare to be challenged."
good,"company pays well but can be a very stress ful environment"
good,"Not enough grow for me, but it was a fair paying job and the rules made it so everyone learn couple of different things."
good,Job is high activity and can be stressful. You can make a ton of money but you will earn every penny doing so. Not family oriented at all and make sure you and the manager get alone because that can be the difference in you staying.
good,"I enjoyed working there as a temp and was offered a job to become permanent, however I missed two days in the 1 1/2 Months that I was there, and so the job offer was revoked and I was terminated. The environment itself was friendly to me the work itself is a piece of cake but the management needs more stronger personalities, there was only one strong manager and it was the newest of them all. It can be a dangerous environment but they keep it as safe as possible with the help of everyone. They focus on safety first 24/7 and that's awesome!  From stretching to safety gear!"
good,"Unless you are a manager or work at an office, you aren't likely to advance. Managers show blatant favoritism toward those that work in the office. Hope this helps."
good,If based outside of a corporate location you have a better opportunity to learn.  Some divisions are treated poorly as they are not as important to the bottom line.
good,Tough work. Very physically demanding and a lot of alone time. A typical day at work is working your daily route and delivering clean uniforms and picking up dirty uniforms.
good,"Cintas offers excellent benefits. However, the Shuttle Driver position does not offer enough hours as the position started with two drivers and two shift and was split into three shifts requiring the drivers to clean the warehouse in order to complete 8 hours of work each day."
good,"Getting a job is easy and the pay isnt half bad."
good,"Work days for drivers were longer than expected with lower compensation. Goals were provided, but sometimes unattainable. Learned about management of production staff and equipment. Enjoyed interacting with customers and managing employees."
good,Very strict corporate environment. Somewhat of a boys club but overall a good place to work. Company is slow to advance & the annual raises are small.
good,"Entering orders for internal sales team and tracking them to completion. Filing documents, printing and copying. Answering incoming calls.  Stocking and doing heavy lifting."
good,"you have several stops to do a day pending what location your in. you have 15 stops that you pick up laundry and fill up dishwashing chemicals into the bottles and charge the customer/ Some customers have Mats that you change out every week.the laundry bags are heavy pending on how much you put into it. your allowed to pace yourself, Management only gives you a call if a customer is in an emergency and needs you to come back cause there service was cancelled due to no payment of the garments. Workplace culture is good people get along but at the same time your return from you route. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the smell of dirty wet towels and the uniform and selling renewals for price increase yearly. The most enjoyable part of the job is being outdoors talking to customers and being supportive of you clients. Your salary depends on how much commission you sell on your own."
good,"What I did love about this company was being able to meet people in various fields of experience. Network, network, network, you meet professionals that are willing to help."
good,Commission based pay scale and poor hours.  Inconsistent knowledge level of new hires.  Benefits started out as good and coverage decreased year after year
good,"Coworkers are awesome, GM not so much. Management does anything she says so they aren't on the chopping block. Would be an amazing place to work if the management changed."
good,"Cintas if a fairly good organization to work for.  However, being in a position of constantly collecting is not my ideal cup of tea.  Besides, the company was moving and I thought it was time for me to work elsewhere."
good,"Cintas is a great place, as far as pay and benefits. My boss is great, people I work with are great, no complaints. But I was placed in a lead position for nearly 2 months and not payed as such, even after being offered the position. I was brushed off every time I asked about this. Hours are decent, depending on your preference."
good,"Repetitive job that you can manage yourself day to day."
good,"Busy job, I learned to work well on my own and manage my time. I would drive upwards of 2000 kms a week so i am comfortable driving. Typical day would be delivering various products and services that Cintas would offer, and managing my customers accounts and inventory levels. The hardest part of the job for me was staying over night out of town. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and growing lasting relationships with my customers."
good,Safety is very important to all partners and being safe at Cintas is rewarded with free breakfast. Management really cares about partners.
good,"•	Working independently or in a team to maintain warehouse work area;"
good,"Very fast paced position. High activity and phenomenal training program for sales. Co-workers engagement overall poor at my branch. Hardest part of the position would be the ability to take no for an answer every day, all day. The most enjoyable part of your job here is installing and getting paid on a very lucrative high volume account."
good,"Coming in early, we would get our job or jobs for the day, set up our work truck, and head to our work destination. I learned floor cleaning skills like cleaning tile and carpet floors, as well as concrete and stripping and waxing. Management was great, easy to talk to, and very understanding. My coworkers were excellent. Everyone had the same mindset coming to work, coming in on time, work safely, and lets all get home to our families. Hardest part of the job was not being able to complete a job to the customers understanding. Most enjoyable part of the job was exceeding expectations."
good,great company very fast paced. great schedule with good pay. keeps you busy and managing time. good managers with great h.r. that will help and support you with health and benefits. Good company overall.
good,"Very past paced, great co-workers that are very helpful. The hardest part of the job is not getting all tasks completed in one day."
good,"i was a strong minded, faced paced worker. who cared about getting the jobs done efficiently and safely throughout  the whole plant. i award cintas for teaching me the skills to move forward onto bigger opitons. Gaining leadership there made grow even greater confidence to overcome any obstacle in the work world. fellow coworkers were also a big part. whothout them, timely production wouldnt of been met."
good,"great company to work for, the people weren't the greatest, gave very limited room for error!! Management tended to demand respect but didn't want to give much or any at all!!!"
good,You work hard but are compensated accordingly.  Strong emphasis on the company's culture will require most people a period of time to adjust.
good,driving around selling first aid products is hard not a lot of training to be able to excel in the position.  management was terrible new manager in place as of 2015.  nice to have a company vehicle to take home
good,My typical day starts at 4-4:30am and goes until the job is done. I enjoy the nature of the work but the hours (50-55hrs/week) just aren't worth it. The people are what have kept me there so long.
good,"Management tries to screw the employee over. They will lie to you about your pay, making you think that your going to make this much then you look at your check and its nearly as close as they promised."
good,SALES SALES SALES. The money can be good and bad at times. Nice if you are fresh our of college
good,Good company but the bureaucracy is VERY annoying and its an old school company which can be very frustrating. Its a great job but I would not recommend this company for someone who wants a career.
good,The pay is pretty good here but if you are salary you will likely put in long hours. If you want to be a driver for the company you will have it made with good pay and an easy 4-day work week.
good,"A good company, and great co-workers. Management isn't the best."
good,"A typical day would include performing assigned duties. I learned many things about the production process, customer service and safety protocols. My co-workers were generally nice and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with inadequate management. the best part were the relationships with other employees."
good,"The co-worker that i work with was a very good goup. The hardest part of the job was working in the rain and cold, and do not have the right equipment."
good,I learned valuable time management skills. The hardest part of the job was running the sales office almost single handed upon just starting in the position.
good,Cintas is a challenging company with a lot of rewards.  Not only do I service my customers but I manage there account.  As an SSR I am responsible for providing new product knowledge along with customer service and contract negotiations.
good,"Good place to work, easy to get along with everybody for the most part. Communication with management and employees was lacking at times. This place is like most warehouse environments when its hot its hot when its cold its cold."
good,not a lot to do when machine was running good I like working their
good,"A typical day at work was pretty busy. The phone call volume was huge. I was hired as a hard copy speciliast but, I often found myself filling in for just about every other position. The management was decent at best. It took a lot of surveys to begin a change in the mediocrity of the management. The communication between shift managers was horrible. No one really knew what was going on at any given time. The bad communication practices between shift managers caused problems quite often. The co-workers there were ok. I never had any major problems with them. The only problem was the lack of help from one another. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with the job I was hired for. The reason for that was the fact that I would fill in for customer service(answering calls and taking customer orders), vault specilaist(pull orders from the vault), and deliveries. It got to a point where I was barely in the warehouse(where I was hired to be). Sometimes, I would be on the road from shift start to shift end. Ocassionally, I would work past my shift time to ensure that the customers got everything they ordered before the close of their business day. The most enjoyable part of my job was the company functions. It afforded us an opportunity to see each other on a more personal level, outside of the hectic work environment."
good,"Good schedule, 4 day work week, holidays off, free lunches often."
good,Good Company but with a lot of great benifits. But they want quick results no matter what.
good,Work hard and recieve rewards.
good,I like working there . I’ve been there for two years and I have learned so much ! Can’t wait until I can take what I’ve learned and grow even more in my career.
good,"Great corporate culture, but lots of lies and empty promises from management  having to lie to customers because we are short product that isn’t provided to us yet it is expect we are not to credit the customers invoices."
good,"flexible work schedule, favoritism from management, management stated i had a bonus and then stated they numbers were wrong and took the bonus stating they are human and make mistakes. Management doesn't have a clue so then your employees are lost as well"
good,"I honestly would go back if they were a bit more structured. There is no brains in the operation right now. They have so much potential to be better than what they are. I loved the benefits and workload, but the structure, scheduling, and management was awful."
good,Cintas was good I learned alot. I did multiple positions and help cintas out alot. Could of got paid a little more but it was fun while it lasted. The people there were great. I would go back if I had the chance.
good,"Cintas offers great benefits and a great training program, however my manager was never available to assist, never followed through on what he said he would do and they don't base goals on market trends, but you are compared and same goals are given based on tenure as an Orlando or Jacksonville rep for comparison."
good,Very misleading on details of benefits and day to day rules.  Rules changes as they see fit.  Benefits were good but not worth the hassle of dealing with management sometimes.
good,"Management wanting you to look up certain specifics when they have it all at their finger tips. If someone leaves their job title to move on, they give others pieces of their job rather than filling that job in."
good,"You will be working long hours every week. You are expected to provide results, the industry is cut throat. They get you with the pay and benefits.I average around 55-60hr weeks"
good,"You have to be able to multitask. Have done grading of uniforms, assembly of emblems on shirts, receiving  in orders, hanging garments and scanning garments into service. Had to keep work area cleaned after each shift. Fast paced and laboring work. Must be able to lift, bend, pull and stand 8 hours. Very hot in summer and very cold in winter."
good,"I've been an SSR for cintas for 5 years now, I actually enjoy my job servicing my customers on my route,they are honestly why I keep coming back everyday,"
good,Cintas is a good place to work at if you want full benefits and to meet new people. The job can get very heavy but they offer help at times to get the job done.
good,"Great benefits, nice incentives, & good competitive pay. I’m able to do my job in a timely manner & get off to have a great home life. Bonuses are competitive & not hard to obtain."
good,"Very long shifts, there is always more work to do and that cuts into your life at home. I had a 1 hour commute and this made it very difficult to work and have a life outside of work. The money is nice but it wasn't worth the struggle. The coworkers are fantastic though, very friendly work environment and plenty of people to bond with."
good,"Workplace culture was generally good besides a few managers. My role dictated it's own schedule which was nice, but that was at the mercy of how many accounts were sold. It was nice and refreshing to go out and be on your own and meet many different customers. The hardest part of the job was the pay. It was not really competitive at the time of my employment."
good,Pay is the biggest issue with this company. Time with family is great. You do have a work life balance. Typical work day would be 4 days a week. Not much advancement within the company unless you have a college degree.
good,"the job is 100 percent hunting, cold calls, very few call in leads. One point of contention from sales to service is that it's on the sales rep to coordinate all the working pieces of the install. It's a waste of time on sales, and if it's not done correctly, you won't get paid."
good,"A typical day at Cintas is very hectic, filled with endless meetings and e-mails. Cintas is very focused on developing their people which was a plus for me. Management is pretty good. The culture is great, the holidays are very fun at Cintas,"
good,the work culture took some time to get used to. enjoyed the freedom given to me to use my knowledge and experience to upgrade their systems. enjoyed the challenge that i was given.
good,"Account Manager position at Cintas. Great company benefits - awful workload, impossible to have work/life balance.  Managers are great but processes are over done and everything is sales focused with no thought of the workload on account management. The stress and expectations are impossible."
good,Cintas was a good company overall but they try to keep you stuck in a certain position when you ask to be moved to a different location. Nice pay though.
good,"great company, there are opportunities to grow. The workplace culture is really great. You get to meet a lot of great people, people that will help you get to where you wanna be."
good,"Pretty easy job "
good,Communication is very poor almost non-existent between management.  I have learned that if you are gonna have a lot of management that they have to communicate and be on the same page.
good,Sometimes it could be difficult to complete your day but once you got through it you never felt like you took it home with you. Which is not necessarily how it goes at all workplaces in my experience
good,"this is an ""ok"" place to work it just be hot but you do have fans to kinda keep you cool. The pay is ok depending on what all you have to pay and what you want your finance situation to look like."
good,"Learned how to negotiate contracts, increase sales by upselling, and improve on customer service skills. Cintas is a good company to work for temporarily but has limited advancement opportunities."
good,"Cleaning, fixing, and maintaining the PM’s of all equipment throughout the building. When I was done worked on other small projects that will help improve overall function of production."
good,"Cintas is a great company, what it does for thousands of companies is amazing; getting them ready for the workday. We have an excellent team working together to ensure that our plant runs well and that our customer gets the best services we can provide."
good,Great place to work. However recent changes after G&K merger have left a negative impact on company culture. What was once a great place to work is now a okay place to work.
good,"If you have the ability to support your family with about 40 grand a year - then this could be an amazing job for you."
good,Picking and packing merchandise to be shipped out. I learned the different type uniforms form different companies. The workplace culture is very diverse in the working environment. The hardest part of the job is keep up he percent's and enjoyable part getting off at 3:00 pm.
good,Good first time sales job. Learn good sales tactics and training. New product come with the market which is nice. Sales goals never stop increasing however and at a certain point they are unimpeachable. Large company feel and rigidness as well.
good,"The culture to me was not very friendly.  Most of the time people would walk pass without speaking.  The overall job wasn't hard and my immediate supervisor was a very nice person.  Some of the others should learn better communication skills, I felt like I was not appreciated."
good,My strengths are not sales.  I'm a very good people person.  Cold calls aren't my thing.  Lots of driving and cold calls.  Must be a must multitasker.
good,"Good job with ok life balance."
good,"Fast paced, daily quota, 3 shifts, off weekends, pto and health insurance upon hiring.  The employees are regular people who just want to work and go home.  Many employees have been there for over 20 years.  Many are still in the same position they were in 20 years ago.  The raises are small but the pay is weekly.  As long as you come to work and work hard, you don't have anything to worry about.  Some positions are more stressful then others."
good,"Cintas is a good company to work for, they try to take care of ell their employees, and for a large company it has a family owned feeling. Some drawbacks to being a large company, but overall a good place to work."
good,"is a good company but some workers are not."
good,A typical day at work is servicing your customer throughout the day. I learn a lot from interacting with different people everyday.  The enjoyable part of the job is working only 4 days out the week.
good,"This was my first post military position. It was a great opportunity to compare and modify military command into civilian workforce leadership."
good,Good place to work. Communication needs improvement. Bonus potential is nice but things happen all the time to ruin it that you have no control over.
good,A Fast Paced Environment with High Expectations. I Learned to be a Self Starter and to always have Strong Attitude. The Management is very Demanding. My Co-Workers are great. The Hardest part is making the Internal Sale and meeting the High Expectations. The most Enjoyable part is the Relationships that you build with your Customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me is very long, I usually work for ten hours a day, but I can't complain. Cintas is very respectful of their employees, my co workers are amazing. We are like a family there. Management is understanding and they try to help with whatever they can. The hardest part about my job is having to deal with people who don't like their jobs. The best part about  it is the work is extremely easy (for me)"
good,Typical work day was a lot of face to face with customers and teaching drivers how to make their day successful.  I learned how to negotiate with customers as well as demonstrate to drivers how to make sales and take ownership of their routes.  Co-workers were outstanding when it came to teamwork.  Hardest part of the job was having to explain to customers why we had price increases which was about every 6 months.  Enjoyable part of the job was having a lot of interaction with customers and ensuring that their needs were satisfied.
good,Your pay is based on your performance. The culture is very desirable and can sometimes eat you up. If you are willing to relocate and your numbers are good you will be promoted very quickly.
good,"First things first would be to catch up my emails and voicemail. Since I manage hotels I always have  to make sure there were no overnight emergencies, if so, have to make sure they were taken cared of properly. Create a daily spreadsheet of my teams work load for the day, from high to low priority. One of the hardest parts of my job is having to drop what your doing and start another project. Meaning never being able to finish what you start the same day. The most enjoyable part is getting genuine recognition from the customer when you get them out of a rough situation."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for. The initial position I applied for and interviewed for was not the position that was offered to me and later accepted.  Initially, I wanted to be on the uniform sales side of the company but ended up being a deep clean sales representative."
good,work with good people but must like up selling to customers. Manager try to help but are very busy. pretty good pay but some days can go longer then 10 hours.  some routes have a overnight day to complete day.
good,This could be a great place to work but the management is not very good and and feels like they do not care about their employees. Also once you get to maximum money of $500 per route volume you can not make more money.
good,"-Every day at work is a different type of job anywhere from Jupiter fl thru Fort Lauderdale fl"
good,You burn up in the summer and freeze in the winter. They expect you to put out lots of orders without making any mistakes. The management gripes every morning.
good,"Good company with strong corporate culture, management systems, and professionalism. Days can be very long and stressful so you need to have a positive attitude to make it by."
good,"Cintas is a fast place fun work environment with demanding hours, but they do compensate you for you're time. You have plenty of freedom which is always a huge plus. Management will only get on you if you do something to warrant them doing so. If you are good at doing you're job and flying under the radar then Cintas may be for you."
good,"Four day work weeks but usually last 12+ hours a day.  Work alone for the majority of the day, consistently shorted products you need to effectively run a route."
good,"Make Loads of cloths, wash and dry them"
good,I setup and prepare my area to unload the trucks . I unload 2 to 2 1/2 trucks an hour. We meet for a stretch an flex . 3 people on the unload team . The group I work with on second shift are great . It's only hard if one makes it that way. Management is fair in they're decision making and treat all equally.
good,The Corporation (400 locations) operations and expectations are commendable... the Lancaster location had very weak Management-large turnover rate in all Management positions.
good,I worked there for 11 years and was very well taken care of. The culture changed from customer oriented to bottom line oriented and Six Sigma made a ruin of the culture.
good,"I believe the 4 day work week keeps a lot of the guys here,a lot to be said for it.But none of the drivers are happy here,or view this as a permanent job.The guys I have watched go in to the office for ""advancement"" seem unhappy with their decision.If the workload was reasonable and the pay met the standard for 2014,it would really change things.Some routes really aren't bad,but the ones that are makes it feel that it's not worth it.The customers are the best parts of the day."
good,"If you enjoy a weekend without thinking about work, this position is not for you.  Saturday your thinking of the reports that you have to send in every Sunday.  Therefore, thinking of work everyday.  Comp is good and benefits, management will micromanage and they have very high expectations for weekly activity.  18 new presentations - 300 Phone Call Cold Calls - 50 Outside Cold Calls.  Even when I was working 60 hr weeks, I was unable to accomplish.  These are goals if you live in a huge city like Philly, NY ect.  If you work your butt off you will succeed but like I stated above...You are going to drive yourself crazy."
good,"I worked as many different positions at Amazon, if i only had one shift to work for i would have stayed with the company with better pay and stable suitabilities."
good,"Dealing with customers was always an adventure.  You had to be prepared for anything but ordinary. I learned how to deal with all types of customers from nice to angry.  I could make a bad situation "
good,Great company culture and i worked wit great people but there are alot of tedious tasks that you have to do and be prepared to put in well over 40 hours a week.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,I enjoy being off on weekends and holidays I just wish they would pay more.
good,"my time with Cintas has been a great experience. its provided me with a lot of training and culture i will take with me on whatever career path i take next and incorporate those fundamentals into my next chapter and become an even stronger, more valuable asset to any team. it hasnt just been a workplace, its been a 2nd family. ive worked beside and under some great people along the way. what ive enjoyed the most is the relationships ive developed with my coworkers, as well as the ones ive developed with my customers."
good,"Deliver uniforms, floor mats and other facility services products.  "
good,"A typical day includes mostly i.d taping new garments and unloading and loading the route trucks as they arrive. Ive learned to count inventory and load trucks according to load sheet. Great co-workers and managers, were are all very close its like family. The hardest part of my day is loading heavy cages full of dirty clothes onto semi- truck at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of my day is the second half of the day, it seems to go by fast after lunch break."
good,Make sure my truck is ready to go with everything I need. I learned lots of customer service technics. Management was very helpfull.
good,Enjoyed most of my time here. It was a bit of a travel everyday but good atmosphere.
good,A typical day for me starts at 2:30 i normally have a few trucks that i can start on right when i get there then after i get those finished our offloaders finish the trucks that were out on the route that day and i load my asigned trucks for the day. I have learned good customer service becasue our drivers are my customers they come to me when there are changes to their route and i always make sure i ask them feedback on how i am performing at my job. My co-workers and fun to work with i am on second shift so i only work with eight other guys and for three years running now we have been the best in the mid-west. The most enjoyable part of my job is how i get to interact with the drivers whenever they come back from their routes.
good,Overall a good company but some people are hard to get along with.
good,It was fun at times. Being able to run your route effectively was very fun. You finish on your on time not at a scheduled time so it's basically based on your performance and understanding of your route.
good,"As much as the hiring staff will tell you that it is possible to grow and move up within the company, they aren’t being honest. i know people who have worked there 10+ years stuck in the same position they started. The hours are consistent and it pays fairly well but don’t expect to move up any time soon"
good,"The people you work with are great, you deal with a lot of non-sense from customers. Just stay on task and do not fall behind and nobody will bother you."
good,We were currently under new management and everything was unorganized and stressful. I decided to stick it out but a year later nothing had change. Great company!! Bad management
good,"Good company, if you are in a bad opportunity/market, goals become unrealistic. Tech advances will help. Spartan mentality not attractive to new hires"
good,"Not the best place for people over 50 who make a decent salary.  A few run each division and rarely consider other points of view.  Get in good with upper management and work hard, you will advance.  Performance matters only if you establish good relationships with upper management.  You have to sell yourself.  And you have to make something for yourself to be noticed and to really know the strategy.  Pays well for entry-level and low level management and upper management.  Mid-managers are overseen unless they are stellar in leadership's mind and even if they are beloved and well-respected by front line and peers."
good,I liked the people I worked with for the most part. Management was fair. There is a guaranteed 40 hours a week and paid time off after you work there a year. The raises are small. And you don't make enough money to live on your own.
good,The job was easy and it can be fun but you have to deal with people sometimes that doesn't belong in certain positions. I enjoyed my time there despite dealing with people who that there position means to disrespect. My advice is to limit your encounters. Do your job then go home but don't make any friends but exact just enough for work purpose only
good,High turnover and not the best slinging mops and towels. However the training is known all over the recruiting industry. This gives you the opportunity to move to the job/ career you really wanted but were previously not qualified for.
good,"Punh in, work, take a break , work ,take lunch, work, take break, work ,punch out, that if you work inside. very easy!!!!!"
good,"Lock in rental agreements with clients for 48 months, then a few months later, they change the rates and fees, leaving the customer in despair.   Deception when it comes to rental agreement.   Great Customer Service and excellent rental product"
good,"Working  as a fire protection customer sales/service rep at Cintas can be a rewarding job. It gave me the right amount of work life balance I needed. The only problem I had is that when the new management came in on the local level, the employee moral sank and the overall companies culture was non existent. It became extremely political and personal agenda were being flaunted. As a company I give 5 stars, but at local level 1 star."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for with a great work/life balance.  It is a well respected company which opens the door for other opportunities.  Unfortunately, where it is a service based industry, the sales division is selling Cintas service which is obviously operated by people, and with that comes human error.  My main frustration with Cintas is the contsant clash between service and sales."
good,"great company to work for, great leadership, great at developing sales reps and a lot of products for customers to choose from. the company offers many benefits"
good,You should be prepared to sweet a lot for little pay. It's not terrible pay but they have room to improve. I am using this place to inspire me to get back in school. I am so anxious to get out it's killing me. And that my be more litteral than I would like it to be.
good,"The uniform and facility services division was great, while the first aid and safety division was terrible. Management was poor, which filtered to lower status employees."
good,"Trucks are not always loaded properly, and the managers don't always follow up with the customers. you are required to often times work longer hours than expected."
good,"Your customers were truly yours. You could increase/decrease pricing, add product, retain business with new agreements. Sell catalogue items to make a commission.  Also I could create new business if I came upon new stores or such."
good,"Ever changing goals, competitive markets, and collaborative strategizing were part of the daily grind. A good starter place to work with helpful employees."
good,"For the position of billing and collections specialist there is enough challenge to keep from getting bored and the management is really nice and supportive. It sounds like a good trait and mostly it is except that they keep on employees who do not pull their own weight for too long because they are too nice. "
good,Cintas a été une bonne école de travail. J'ai énormément grandi tout au long de mon expérience Cintas. Les valeurs et la culture d'entreprise sont excellente au niveau de cette compagnie .
good,"Cintas is the bread and butter service industry company. If you'd like a great management program, with semi lucrative promotion options then this may be a company for you. For me personally I like to have autonomy and some new task or new element to consider while i'm working. Cintas mainly being an employee uniform and facility service provider (rental department) can get a little mundane at times."
good,As a provider you are challenged to go out and service every customer on your route every day of the work week and not only grow your route with new products but keep the customer highly satisfied with Cintas.  If there is an issue on route it is up to you to resolve it and if not then the management team will assist.
good,Great company great hours loved doing shipping &receiving also learning how to apply logos onto uniforms never worked with a Heat seal got to learn a lot
good,The company is fast pace and  long hours. Must be able to do multiable jobs with little training. training is a let down trainer is not most of the time.
good,"Working with the documents is very physical labor tasking. Excessive walking, pulling, bending etc. Its a good job for the exercise, but the pay doesnt match the workload."
good,Good place to start in sales.  Competitive work environment.  If you are looking to expand your career and work towards along term job in a more rewarding environment this again is a good starting point.
good,"I liked it at one point but it's only busy during the summer, you're barely making hours after summertime. The benefits are really good but the hours just suck after summertime. If you don't like heat summertime, this isn't the place for you."
good,"A typical work day starts by clocking in and going to your designated station/area in the building. They do pre-shift stretching as you are on your feet for 8 hrs all day/night. You get 2 15 minute breaks throughout your shift. I learned that team work as well as individual work is a must in this type of environment. The factory is friendly, partner-oriented and big on safety. The hardest part of the job is hitting your daily numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the ability to work by yourself and challenge yourself daily to be more productive."
good,"great people to work with"
good,"I drove truck and made delivery and pick up of laundry."
good,ok job if you like to be micro managed. Hours not to bad. Training is quit extensive. A lot of room for advancement. A lot of pressure to hit sales numbers every week. Having to sale a lot of different products to hit sales goals.
good,Cintas is a good place to work. I have been with them since they acquired Zee Medical in August of 2015. My boss is great and very cool. I have learned to go the extra mile. My co-workers are nice and we work as a team. The hardest part of the job is when there are price discrepancies on inventory. I love coming to work.
good,"My experience with Cintas was actually pretty good. My only issue is with the new managers coming in being so dead set on corporate policies. It's frustrating that instead of someone who knows the business back and forward, someone off the street gets hired as a service manager because he has a degree. Great company honestly but some locations....like the one here in Frankfort IN has changed dramatically. I'm not gonna go overboard and diss the company all together like some people but it seems that in recent years quality has changed alot."
good,Cintas was a good company to work for.  The culture was very rigid however but overall a good experience.  The training they had was very useful and translated to the field.  Spent our days cold calling new leads or following up leads.  It was a hunter sales position with no residuals which was a negative to me.
good,"Overall had good experience working almost ten years.  "
good,"Public does not realize how rental services work, spend your day educating and objection handling.Good training and culture, often difficult customer engagement. Weekly tracking of business results."
good,"Love the People, Love the Culture. Long Days. Will walk through walls for fellow partners and customers."
good,"Meetings in the early morning. This would be followed by setting up appointments for retention, penetration and conversion sales calls for the day and week. Field work would follow."
good,"•Provide Safety and Health Management support to 19 facilities in the Central FIRE Region. "
good,i learned a few new things with this company but job just not going anywhere
good,cintas overall is a good company to work for . id preferr not to explain my problems with this company.
good,"Sold facilities services included mats, towel, clothes and other textiles to all companies."
good,work day would go by fast. this is a fast place environment. great co workers
good,Easy work .. Repetitive most days on the job.. Great benifits for working with this company.
good,"I would say a typical day at work for me is cleaning , loading cages and overall making sure the plant is clean. I have learned to work with others and form trust within a group. My co-workers are like me in some ways want to get the goal done and make customers happy. The most enjoyable part at work is working with partners that communicate and some respect among others."
good,if you are looking for a full time job this is a good start.it is a good place to work.
good,"Typical day starts at 5am, clocking in."
good,Overall the company is not a bad place to work for. The interview process is a little on the tedious side. End up doing three interviews but they knock them out in one day so cant really complain. I feel like I was well trained for the job. If you finish what you have to for the night you are able to go home if you want to. No complaints from me.
good,Really good company to learn from in the sales industry.  Very aggressive sales structure.  Really team oriented environment.  Growth in profits and sales catalog year over year.
good,"As a uniform sales representative the sales goals are very high, but if you can reach those goals you will be compensated very well for your work.  Overall a good place to work."
good,Weekends off are great paid every week. If the hourly wage would increase at least 1$ I would rate them five stars. The company overall is good but we definitely need more money.
good,Fast growing company. Ability to move around the company. They have a great management trainee program for recent college graduates. Great benefits...
good,Their corporate headquarters where I worked was combined with their largest distribution center. I felt that the DC workers were treated very differently than the corporate workers.
good,"I liked working there for the culture and the people - it really was incredible in that sense. However, it required too much of my time to meet the goals and the stress level was too high."
good,"The internship at Cintas sounded like a perfect fit, a growing company, a great opportunity for growth and an intern program that rotates around the different facets of the company, this, however, was not the case. Of my 12-week program, I spent over 6 weeks in the warehouse doing production, when it was stated I would spend 1 week there. The VP of the district told me that he did not have a problem with me being lied to and the general manager of the location stated that he ""did not like the intern program,"" to me, the intern. "
good,Tapes is good company that offers good benefits to your employees only that the work is physical and I consider that it should be better payment. they are constantly concerned about the safety and welfare of their employees
good,"Okay working at Cintas. Pay could be a lot better. Atmosphere is high school like and can be cut-throat at times. Most co-workers are friendly, and you just have to deal with the rest."
good,"This job was great until they slotted a new boss for our team.  He came in and within the 1st 5-6 months he had all 7 of us wanting to look elsewhere.  He obliviously didn't fit the position, company later found out after 5 of us quit."
good,"it is a good place to start a labor job, the workplace is multicultural what makes a really peace environment with high respect between employees. i really love the benefits that this company offers to ther employees"
good,Great people but a lack of formal training. The local GM understands this and is working or making it better. My hours were 7:00am on some days and 7:30 the rest until  to 5:00 pm.
good,"Working for this company you'll have independence, you control your salary, face to face with different customers and the management makes sure your doing ok."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for. A lo of great benefits : stock options, health insurance, 401k."
good,Good company fast paced work environment. Its all about shareholders and their confidence. The best of the best will find success. The rest will get ran over like a freight train
good,The job it's self Is very simple and the people I have worked with were very helpful and nice. This company has great benefits.
good,Good pay in service dept. Only work 4 days but those 4 days are going to be long. Management is so bad it is hard put into words. When you do get a good manager they usually dont stay very long. Very shady and cut throat business practices.
good,"I luv working with people who are good to work with others"
good,I enjoyed what i had done. The work was good and the people we nice.
good,"Cintas is all about numbers, the work is very tough but the pay doesnt match the work ethics"
good,"There is no typical day at work at Cintas, which keeps you engaged. Great people to work with and around."
good,This company can be tough. I have worked my way from the bottom to supervisor. If your willing to put in the work the advancement opportunity is there.
good,I didn't like how I was being treated and management was very poorly never did anything they said they were going to do  need better management at locate
good,"Wasn’t here long enough to properly review the company.  From what I could tell this is a solid company to work for, pay is good, management is passionate"
good,"The people are great to work for.  The company culture of calling each other partners holds true.  Lots of support when you need it."
good,All of the managers are young which is great and the work environment is great I wish the pay was a little bit more but overall it is a great company to work for.
good,It was a great company to work for. Work life balance was great. Wake up early and get your day started and usually are dont by 3-4 depending on your load. Benefits are great.
good,"I learned alot about Sales, Alot of driving in one day.Deliviering supplies to all of my customers.  Built a rapport with customers daily while I proecessed the accounts."
good,"The company has meticulous hiring standards. The job requires a lot , and the pay is decent. The hardest part is the price increases and renewal of agreements. The best thing about the job is a 4 day work week with weekends off."
good,It has provided for my family for 15 years and a family culture . Great people and I love my customers . I get along with every department and they have good communication
good,"i would get to work at 2 pm and worked till close which was around 11 i was a matt roller as well as a operator which i would have to do everything if whatever was needed extra or if anyone failed to come to work that day i would have too take on there position in which i liked changing up my schedule sometimes. i didnt care it was just something else to do and you could do whatever you wanted to do once your tasks where completed and pretty much take on your job at a slower rate knowing you didnt do just your job all day i was told to roll 800 matts a day in which i completed everyday 1000+ the most i could pump out is 1400  so those days as operator where sweet, managment was amazing my supervisor was great he actually got promoted and no one wanted him to leave he actually even cried when he left he was awesome and then the new manger was trying to fill his shoes so work was awesome until i found a higher paying job that was great untill they fired a few and then the competition got overwhelming and i ended up not liking it people ended up quiting aswell and then i just tagged along i was not liking my environment, hardest part of the job was not using the bathroom more then 3 times a day because at a rapid pace there really no good time to take a 3rd bathroom break at all like it was almost non stop.  the most enjoyable part of the job would be lunch because everyone got a chance to talk with everyone and find out how was there days going or how was there life or just small talk that was worth it since we could hardly talk to eachother."
good,"The office I work out of is amazing, good people that I enjoy working with. The issue I have is with the corporate culture of the company. It seems they care more about the other offices than that of our office in Worcester."
good,"I liked my job. However, career advancement was difficult to enhance and opportunities for advancement were very rare. I learned how to conduct myself in a formal business environment. Most enjoyable part of my job was the positive working culture and the most difficult part of my job was having to work with lazy employees and hold their end of the work so production could be maintained."
good,"Cintas is a organized in environment that has great hours and benefits, but the management and supervisors need a lot of work in listening to employes and understanding and taking the correct approach to those who are not working correctly are as a team player."
good,"The only reason I'm still working for Cintas is because of my awesome manager. He's a great team worker, very flexible and reasonable. "
good,"I over see a fleet of 60 plus vehicles also review all route sales sheet contain all changes made on route handle all cash. All sales   must show  all incoming cash and must show all garments. A typical day consist of calling vendors,entering invoices ,etc."
good,if your Mexican its a good place to work other than that its ok
good,"Work here if you like being on your feet constantly for 8 hours straight. I only worked here 6 weeks. The pay was great but it was fast paced, boring, repetitive, and stressful. This is not something i would want to do on a daily basis."
good,"$13.00 and hour as a mat cleaning operator in Port Washington NY"
good,The best part about the job was the people I worked with. Management was the least part I liked about the job as there was no support when you most needed it.
good,"Management was poor with communication and following through on statements made. Change was discussed but there was no initiative. No advancement in the location unless you were friends with the managers, skill set and previous experience was not considered."
good,"I think that Cintas was a good place to work. They had really good Christmas parties. When I was there it was really laid back and I got to come and go as I pleased. The management was great in my department, but as in any company there were those who were trying to move up the ladder and who would step on whomever on the way up."
good,"too many back biters, bad management, poor wages, minimum benefits,"
good,I would not recommend this company to anyone because there is no job advancement. Lack of appreciation for your overtime and hard work.The warehouse was full of pests.
good,fixing down equipment if something goes down but the biggest part of the day is doing PM on the equipment and cleaning keeping them looking like new and doing installations of new equipment
good,"  Fun group of co-workers, Employees are told when advancement opportunies are avalible. Though it is a service enviorment so the stress at times can be overwhelming, customer is always right, mantality. Constantly appolgizing for others mistakes, or even the customers mistakes. CAn be frustrating at times. "
good,"The onboarding process takes forever, the company doesnt know what it's doing. A typical day at work revolves around driving around in the van and stuff cabinets and hoping people don't ask about the bill."
good,I have grown with Cintas they have showed me alot.I always had a good pay check that made me want to go beyond what was expected of me..Always took care of the customers first and make sure they get what they need...I loved my hours....The hardest thing for me as being employed with Cintas was using a scan gun in my hand 7hours daily was something different for me but learned how to make it work.
good,"if you like repetitive work, making phone calls all day long, every day to the same customers and getting no where and being micromanaged every second of the day, then this job is for you.  You cannot save files with the name you want, there is a job description for that.  Even if the file is for your use only, it has to be named a specific way.  If you need help or trained, forget about it.  They're response is ""It's in your training manual, read it"".  Well, it's not always in your training manual, and if it's not, they'll make a page for it, email it, have you print it, then add it to your training manual."
good,"Give us your opinion about"
good,Co-workers are awesome.  Culture is very strong.  Not much work/life balance.  Very conservative organization. Management is always changing.
good,"Once you are hired, be prepared to do the job assigned, you will be there until they fire you, or you quit, don't ever complain."
good,"The Cintas I worked at was inside of a casino. The job was a great one to have and I really did like it, but the management there was very unfair with scheduling and there was clearly favor for certain employees. The management above her wasn't that great either. The compensation was great and I loved getting paid every week. The benefits were pretty great as well. There was no oppportunity for advancement really and when it came to certain things seniority took priority over work ethic. So, if you're a new person and you were always on time and got all your work done EFFICIENTLY, the person who was there the longest got priority over you even if they were always late and never worked."
good,"Great environment to work in. However, unless you're paid hourly payment plans are in the favor of the company. If your a route driver (SSR) prepare to not only do your job but six others while only being paid for one. Also, the goal isn't for the company to give you a raise but for you to give yourself one buy selling more product as you make commission off your route which is pennies on the dollar after cintas takes its cut."
good,"Generally a good place to work.  Some teams are very cliquey.  Some supervisors are excellent in their positions, and then others think they are God!!"
good,I am just trying to complete this review so I can move to something else but it keeps giving me an error message so I'm trying to complete everything in  here.
good,A typical work day consisted of arriving at work at sometime between 5am and 7am. There was usually some kind of meeting or sales training that I was responsible for. The rest of the day was used to bring in new business through cold calling and executing the manufacturing and delivery of orders that were brought in by myself or the delivery drivers.
good,"The job itself was good, easy, I was always busy, and I really liked that. My day would go by so fast. But if you weren’t part of a click you didn’t fit in. People were so rude. Never said good morning, even if you said good morning to them they wouldn’t reply. Manager had favoritisms , and for you to advanced you had to do major sucking up . It wasn’t based on your porformance. "
good,"When employed here reps were not treated fairly. Manager took favorites and was dishonest. After I was wrongfully forced to leave, I learned the manger cheated reps out of pay and ended up getting let go for stealing from the company by using company card for personal expenses."
good,Rewarded for hard work to a certain point. usually required to take a pay cut to move into a leadership role. upper management seemed more concerned with consolidating vendors than customer needs.
good,"At the time I worked for the company , they where going through a class action suite because of the pay structure. It was a dog eat dog atmosphere where you had to always watch your back."
good,"Great company to work for, however management changes in recent years has lead to high management turnover and lack of trust. The company is taking a completely different direction from what it's core values were."
good,"Takes care of bottom line employees and upper management, does not care about front line supervisors.  HR will always side on the bottom level employee and even though they claim an unbiased investigation that is not how it works."
good,Schedule is good you go in at 7:30 am and get off by 3.  As long as you get your work done you are pretty free in the field.
good,Overall a pretty good company to work for. Good benefits and open atmosphere. Company vehicle and provided uniforms. Only part I would comment negatively on is that the office seems to be always busy and bustling but when an employee has an issue it never seems to get resolved.
good,"Besides your 10 hour day easily turning into a 14 hour day cintas was fine. hard work, co workers pretty laid back, intense training program, needs more time off"
good,Not enough work. Workers get done with their portions of work and their workload within the first half of the day. The workers then can help out or if nothing needs to be done then you go home.
good,"Young managers that lack flexibility. I worked in remote location 2.5 hours from main office. Required to leave home at 4 am to get product and attend meeting, while still expected to run regular route day to stay on schedule. Not safe to drive 5 hours, attend meeting, load truck, and run route. While this was only once a month, there were also 2 other meetings each month that required 3 hours driving and the rest. An easy fix would have been to ship products and meet on phone or put me up in a hotel the night before meetings. Management shot down both ideas, thus creating unsafe working environment. No matter what ideas were shared to make things manageable, the. Management at this location refused and told me I needed to get on board or just leave. Management at this location sucks. They think telling is training. In 3 years, my manager spent 2 ride days with me, yet the expectations are to excel. Show me how, words are empty bulkshit. It’s sad, because it could be a great job."
good,"The company works hard to make money. They produce their own garments, Its a uniform rental program. Number one in the country with a loyal following and a tone of people that has faith in its success."
good,"Work load is huge compared to the amount of hours you have to complete your tasks"
good,"They pay okay but be prepared to work work work. The 4 days a week as an SSR is nice but you will work long hours, however they try to keep OT down somehow."
good,Unloading the laundry from the trucks is a dirty task. They make you work outside no matter the weather conditions and make you work outaide of your position when your done with your job
good,The work environment was great at the office very informative. Safety and customer service was their focus. a great place to work with room to grow within the company.
good,I really enjoyed my time working for cintas. The biggest complaint I had was the long hours and little pay. I was on the second shift but often would not be off until early morning and I was only working for $12 per hour .. I was also the only maintenance technician and wastewater operator
good,"Good company to work for, Very process driven. Very Corporate Culture based. Great benefits. Continuous and ongoing training. Growth is primary objective"
good,"Not what I thought it would be, I used to go to work happy, and excited not anymore, It's more like I have to go to work."
good,"Not a bad place to work for. Very fast paced. Always busy and have work to do, never boring. Multiple locations to choose from when looking for a job."
good,The company is a pretty good company but I was terminated because a coworker said some offensive things. When I said something to the coworker I was terminated simply because that coworker was there longer than me.
good,Over all the experience of working at Cintas  was not bad it was just the strange hrs they have u work u don't really have work life balance during work days
good,"Its not a bad place to work at. Tough, dirty work. Only work 4 days a week. Plus a chance for bonuses. Only problem is performance reviews and advancement opportunities. I renewed 98% of my agreements with rate raises, and still scored low on my evaluation.  When a better route came open I was told I could move routes because on else wanted my route..Route 90.  I would still be there if these  things happened."
good,Started in 2007 Cleaning restrooms. Worked through the ranks as a service sales representative then moved to sales. After almost a decade of working with the company it was time to move on.
good,"The pay was great, and the opportunity for commissions. Good benefits and travel opportunities. Employees were well taken care of when traveling. "
good,"I started as the receptionist but was soon promoted to Customer Care. The customer service dept that handled all customer calls regarding wrong or damaged clothes, and placing orders for service."
good,"Its a good place to work, however the expected daily output versus pay versus management personalities is a but much to differentiate at times. The diversity of people that you work with is amazing."
good,Strrong company culture. Challenging fast paced work environment.  Many training courses and professional development is offered to there management staff.
good,An employee must be willing to work hard and push themselves. Step out side the comfort zone to make sales and service a customers needs. Be willing to make a judgement call for a customer but be prepared to explain it to management. Happy customers do not always mean happy company.
good,"Great job if you are trying to lose weight. For what the job requires from its employees, it does not pay enough to be worth it. Great job for those who like to work harder, not smarter."
good,"Each day is the same but different in regards to workload and company culture and moral."
good,"At Cintas you will work for everything you achieve. You get what you deserve and don't get anything you don't earn, in other words its just like any weekly grind job."
good,"Performed overall maintenance, worked projects,helped team members. The management wants to keep everyone very segregated. Working together is frowned upon and there is a constant competition. You are not rewarded for your merits and promotion is based solely on management preference."
good,"Cintas is a hard environment to learn in. They expect you to be a weel-rounded professional without having any growing pains. It is 2017 and the women are still expected to ear heels and pantyhose with their skirts. Women are held to a different standard than men, and women do not typically hold executive positions. Cintas is a male dominated company that does not pay women competitively"
good,"Very fasted paced work, given new tasks on the fly. Ive learned to juggle and prioritize tasks when being distributed. Very macro managed. The culture is like a locker room. Mostly male crew who just want to come in and get the task at hand accomplished. Hardest part is when you are all set and done, you have to check in with your boss, and potentially get more stops, which i do NOT agree with. The most enjoyable part is when you are done and checking out with your boss, so you can go home."
good,Very good company to work for. Everyone is there for the betterment of the company and themselves. Great location and team.
good,"Senior management is not approachable and distant"
good,"Good company but hard to climb the latter, but in general is a good place to work at and for. Good benefits, but unfair salaries except for managers."
good,"4 day work week and often off early when route is done early with the same pay. A lot of pressure to sell and build up route. Great people to work with as far as co-workers. If your doing what your suppose to do on route, management usually doesn't bother you too much"
good,"I worked in the plant and was heavily underpaid for what I did. You don't make much in the plant, but the hours weren't too bad and it had good benefits."
good,Great place to work good people easy work just bad management
good,"i really liked working for cintas. it was fast paced folding,pressing,and putting things in order.some of the supervisors were good to work with others okay but overall very good to work for thanks cintas for the experience."
good,"productive and fun workplace with TV and foosball, radios on all day. always have some games and quizzes every monthly as employee celebrate there annual or birthdays."
good,"I did enjoy the everyday challenges that came from working at Cintas. We were told a quota for every hour that we worked, by the end of the day we had to have reached the final quota for an 8 hour day. It was a great way to learn how to better manage my time. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn so many different aspects of the company. The worst part of the job was, after learning more than one area, they could pass you around to those areas when ever they wanted, and without giving a raise or even acknowledgement of having learned several new skills. Overall the best part of working at Cintas was learning another skill."
good,"A typical day at Cintas is me opening office, mailing out invoices from the previous day. Going through invoices and contacting customers that are past due. Answering phones and faxes. I also do all of the accounts payable here at this location. I handle most of the accounts receivables calls and assist customers with understanding their statements/ invoices. I turn customers into collections and handle all of the A/R adjustments. Do all outgoing mail / UPS packages. I have learned to multi task and work well with my fellow partners. I do enjoy all of the people I work with, however I wish management would recognize the efforts I have put forth. I am crosstrained in virtually every position in the office here."
good,"I would like to begin at the first part of my day witch I had to check over the emails sent from the branches to make sure if there were any last minute items that needed to go out that am. Then I prepare the load sheets and go with the flow and getting all the product together to make the load. If the product was not there I had to find a way to get it there or I do it my self to complete the load 100%. There were 3 different locations, 3 different eighteen wheelers that were loaded and unloaded along with the clothes that was meant for the routes. I loved the motivation and the will power that I had to customize this job indeed, it has built me up in a way that makes me more dependent and management material. The people that worked there were considered family, everyone new the goals that they had to work together in respect to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is knowing that the strain of all this will take a toll on you, but the most enjoyable part is that knowing your job was 100% every time."
good,"Drove a truck to service regular customers. Heavy sales, customer service, heavy lifting. Was a great job, fellow employees were friendly and the hours were not long."
good,"Cintas is the largest company in our industry. They are a market leader with an excellent reputation. They are experienced, knowledgeable and committed. They are ownership-driven. Cintas is motivated by the long-term values."
good,Delivering material throughout Midwest states. Home every night and weekend.
good,Service focused industry with customer needs first. A great place to learn coporate culture and managament structure. Some service is required 24/7 and advancement may be limited with no prior experience.
good,Its easy to exceeds expectations. Easy to adapt to changes. Well under pressure with a positive attitude and detail-oriented. Workers are helpful and positive.
good,A good Company to work for along with great stock option and 401K program. Hours are great Monday thru Friday with weekly pay for there non management partners.
good,With right people in the fight places this could be a Fantastic place to work and would be a great team and pay people what there worth to the company then it would be Awesome
good,"I extremely enjoyed my tenure at Cintas. An unfortunate event in my life caused me to resign. "
good,I've been there for a few months and so far I've found that there's pros and cons to every job including this one. Benefits are good and work isn't difficult but you do deal with working outside somewhat. Management can have better support. Good company overall.
good,It as a good place to work everyone was friendly people did their jobs and it just worked they help out with needs if you have then also they do sometimes micro manage which sucks
good,"Cintas leads the industry in supplying corporate identity uniform programs, providing entrance and logo mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid, safety, fire protection products and services, and industrial carpet and tile cleaning.there was nothing really hard about the job. I mostly enjoy the people and the great company parties"
good,"My time at Cintas has been an ordeal of patience. I was hired with promotion in mind, so all I had to do was wait for a position to come open and work well enough to warrant said promotion. Advancement was something I had never experienced before, as my previous employers had no positions available, so I was hopeful that my hard work would be rewarded with an advancement."
good,"We work monday to friday ,6 am to 2pm."
good,A typical work day consisted of moving multiple truck loads of Cintas uniforms and floor ware until all trucks were empty. I learned that if you double the teamwork you double the success in a work place.
good,"Cintas is a growing support business assisting other business get ready for the workday.  Cintas partners provide products and services vital to the economy with a convenience service model for it's customers.  Partners enjoy full-time employment, benefits, and the ability to work both autonomously and with a team.  The operations are fast-paced and will hone your customer serve, business result, and problem solving skills."
good,"Pay is fair, but advancement opportunities can be difficult for some. Good health/dental benefits. Pay is better if you are a driver, or in management."
good,"Cintas is a great company that is striving to be the best.  SSRs do tremendous work, but aren't always given realistic goals while being asked to upsell products.  It is a very physical job.  You will lose weight in a healthy way doing that job."
good,"The office was closed shortly after the production floor was closed.  Corporate budgets changed, management changed.  Co-workers got along in both areas."
good,The hours were long for me specifically at cintas but it could vary depending on the specific route you seviced.  Drive time and distance were factors as well as route volume and number of stops per day.  I worked at locations0 where the Service/Sales Reps worked 4 days a week instead of 5 so we had more stops than 5 day locations.  The people are the best asset at Cintas.  I personally had the pleasure of working at 2 different locations during my tenure and I can honestly say that we were more like family to one another than just coworkers. Cintas structures their company that way. Each department at the facility has a responsibility but it starts and ends with the Service Reps. We were the face of the company and we were the ones to literally drive the company but everybody played a part. Culture was very important with Cintas. At the beginning of every service meeting we would start off by reviewing the Cintas Corporate Culture. I believe details like that are what creates the family like atmosphere and overall I believe that they are good company to work for and I was proud to be a part of there family.
good,I enjoyed the time I spent working at Cintas.  The employees were kind and courteous and there was a good workplace culture.  Management was helpful and fair.
good,"It was a great place except for the office manager was very dishonest and saw everyone as a threat.  she was stealing money from the company and mismanaging the office, so they closed that office down."
good,"Cintas pays you just enough that you don't want to leave, but not so much that you actually want to stay.Overall, not a terrible place to work. The four day work week is nice, but it does come with a cost. The four day work week is for the fleet, not the employee. Only downside is the more route volume you run, the less of a percentage that you receive."
good,"high sales activity and great compensation for new sales reps. strong sales training program. local sales, but no account management. sales management seems to really like the company."
good,I had a pretty solid crew and my manager was pretty laid back. They had several dinners a year and had a cake for all the birthdays in the current month.
good,This was one of my first jobs out of college so I don't feel it's appropriate for me to give a current review. I would management to be fair and largely looked out for all their employees.
good,Wonderful organization.  Wish my tenure could have been longer.   Great structure and operational processes.   They have very high expectations and provide the training you need on the management side to be successful.  Very competitive.
good,"It was a very professional environment, very friendly, i learned a lot about providing excellent customer service, always going above and beyond customers expectation"
good,"A set full time position. Entry level, great management. Great start and pay for those who are looking for a job out of high school. Can be beneficial after you put the time in."
good,"The boss that I worked under as an intern gave me rave reviews when I left due to my internship ending. After I graduated from college a year later, I could barely get a call back for the management trainee position. My boss was no longer there (3 different in 3 years). I didn't know what I did wrong to not even get a call back."
good,Nice company to work for. Great people to work with and enjoyable. Easy to improve yourself. Many different career paths you can take within the company.
good,"Fantastic training and place to work early in your career that ill lead to excellent opportunities outside of the company. The culture has changed greatly and does not value employees, more of a number."
good,"Great company to work for, but they are quick to let long time valuable employees go. They celebrate a lot and have many competitions to keep you engaged."
good,"Cintas pays you commission so you make more money the more you sell.  However, you are expected to sell and they will breathe down your neck for it.  Not bad if youre willing to work."
good,I very much in joyed my position that evolved from being and assistant to being a big contributor of the success of the Catalog department.  Making customers excited with the results and pricing from the many vendors I work with
good,Unloading soiled uniform garments from trucks. Sorting uniform clothes. Parking uniform trucks. Loading  trucks with bags of clean garments. Keepimg notes of uniforms.
good,Cintas is a good company that is always growing. The hours are somewhat flexible and the pay is pretty decent. Job can be stressful as a large chunk of my annual salary was based on performance bonuses.
good,hate to said it all in all I liked my job I worked up in the 15 years I was there ! I worked in the cage check in all promo items check in.!
good,"Very rules restrictive and overbearing.  Learned accounts receivable and accounts payable there.  The people there for the most part are good people, but overstretched in their work."
good,"The job itself is very hard paced and physically demanding, always busy and multi tasking, the compensation for the job did not séem adecuate for my performance according to my reviews"
good,"It was a culture shock on the first week.  The company is very conservative and lacks thinking outside the box.  If you work in the corporate office, you will be required to wear a suit and tie."
good,Good place to work because of people who are there.            The location iz easy to get to. They provide employees with good parking and safe wotk environment
good,Empolyees are great. Reason I keep coming back to work. If I have a problem or issue I can always rely on my direct management to help me take care of the issue.
good,Cintas is a very strong B2B sales job.  You can make a career at Cintas or use it as a strong stepping stone towards your long term goals.  Recruiters and employers  love to see Cintas on your work history.
good,Not much pay for all the work they put on you! don't expect any big raise.  about 25 cents annual raise if you hit the top tier.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"They love people that will do their job and shut up. If you're too good at what you do, they'll find ways to bring you back down to earth. The company overall is great, but at some locations they lack leadership."
good,I worked a similar job for 5 years with a few horizontal promotions but have hit a ceiling when it comes to salary. Most tenured drivers stay in the position.
good,"I worked my way from the ground up to National Accounts Manager with Cintas. Cintas taught me first and foremost that hard work pays off. The workplace is professional, intense with an exceed expectations attitude every day. The hardest part of my job was when I started on route delivering uniforms...hot, hard but very satisfying work. The most enjoyable part of my job...over 12 years with this company I was continually rewarded and advanced in position annually."
good,Staffing is fun to work with.  weekends and major holidays off are a plus. Management is cool. working 4 10s is awesome once you advance to the service department
good,it was a fast paced work place. stood on your feet a lot. heavy lifting. hot presses to put name tags and things on. concrete floors. a lot of walking.
good,"A very good company, but my manager unfortunately did not care about his employees. I was very disappointed with my time at Cintas. My experience could have been better."
good,Early morning starts and long days.  You are enticed with bonuses and when achieving them qualifiers and multiple qualifiers are then placed on you. A 4 day work week is amazing and when its all said and done great insurance and benefits.
good,"The job is not bad but, if you do not get long with your boss or coworkers you will be in trouble. The benefits are good. The job can be hard if your coworkers do not do there job right. If they do not do all of there work you have to do it. That is more work for the same pay."
good,I worked as a fire service tech working on kitchen fire suppression systems.  Performed my inspections/maintenance an hour or two before the kitchen opens.
good,"Great company, great employees, great management, great benefits with a very strong corporate mindset.  As with most large corporations sometimes there is a lot of ""red-tape"" to go through to get answers & approvals"
good,"I worked at Cintas for 10 years. I started out as a sanis rep and was promoted twice. At the time of leaving Cintas, I was an administrative assistant. They help you grow. They handle customer satisfaction and safety with the utmost importance. The SSR's work diligently to create raving fans."
good,Very inclusive and welcoming culture. Experienced management for the industry provides a good environment of growth for entry level employees. Competitive pay
good,I believe that Cintas is a great company in their field of expertise. One of the greatest things that I took away from them was their excellence in the area of training.
good,Great benefits 401k plan vacations bonus long hours high demand on drivers professional environment management ok must be patient and there is slow ad
good,If you are hired on the production side that's where you will stay. Several People on the inside applied for their Technician jobs and where looked over on every occasion.
good,"Typical day at work would be coming in and taking readings of the meters in the plant, then checking for any maintenance issues posted by any co-workers in the plant. Then attending to the daily light maintenance routine ie trolley repair, changing out chemical soap drums. The co-workers were great, management was great as well."
good,I started my day at 5:00 a.m and worked as a sales service representative.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and really appreciated being able to emphasize customer service.
good,"Constantly hounded to sell, add product and grow your route. Customers who go out of business hurt your numbers and your pay is affected because of it. Always a shortage of product which makes it difficult for you to ever COMPLETELY complete your job for the day. The product, such as the floor mats and linen, is often in poor condition at best, Customers complain even though its really not your fault and this makes it difficult to sell anything or add on new product. You constantly have to visit customers more than once a week to take them product that you didn't have during their time of service. Management says they have your back but you are often left to figure it out for yourself."
good,Nation Wide Company that provides uniforms for all types of work.  With 2 locations in the Houston location. Monday through Friday job.
good,"Bon travaille d'équipe "
good,"Every Thursday morning there was a morning training meeting, on new products, safety, and policy and procedures. At time the meeting would go long and we would start our routes late on those days. One of the problems most of the drivers would have on these days is shortages, with Uniforms, and cleaning supplies. But the reasons why the meeting would go long is that, the management team would honor the drivers for the great work they was doing for the company."
good,"Cintas is a good company with good people.  They are a leader in their industry and have been around a long time.  The Service/Sales Representative position requires good time management and customer service skill, along with a willingness to drive."
good,basically just work 8 to 10 hours shift co workers also management are easy to  get along with just looking for more opportunity
good,This is a solid company with great performance metrics. Lots of investment in training Partners of all levels. Most people really enjoy working there

good,Its a fast pace job. You have to be on your toes at all times. The job is very fun in fact the people are very nice and are willing to help.
good,"I would work from 2-10pm, most days. management were great and working there was fun on most days. my co-workers were great and the hardest part was getting the job done so we could go home."
good,"Temporary work - Responsible for ensuring customer carpeted floor mats are properly processed and stored.  Cleaned, dried, and inserted each mat into a rolling machine where they were rolled for easy storage and transportation.  Mats were stored according to color, size or customer logo.  Daily accuracy and productivity of work was necessary for inventory control and accountability.  Additional responsibilities include housekeeping and adherence to health and safety standards."
good,"Cintas cares about their employees (partners) as well as their customers. They emphasize health and safety, honesty and integrity, and provide very thorough training. I truly like and respect everyone that I worked for and with."
good,"Cintas is difficult to put into words, it is 100% a self driven give and take job. The more you put into it, the more it will give back to you. "
good,"A day at work would start at 4am. I would load a box truck with product for the customers I would see that day. I would have on average 30 customers per day. I would deliver product such as; uniforms, bathroom products, carpets. I would take care of customer needs such as; adding/ removing employees for uniforms, adding/ removing bathroom products as the customers use them, adding/ removing rental carpets as need for safety or visual appearance. I would safely control COD customers cash or checks until I returned to the office. The day would end after I serviced all of my customers for the day, usually around 5pm. "
good,"Non stop pace starting early and typicaly ending late, very rewarding but as with every thing, what you put in is what you get out of it"
good,"Very busy, competitive business,  in which there is no time to dilly  dally around. We spend the majority of our waking time together, so its great we all get along. Its imperative to be organized and focused in order to get the desired end result. i have learned many new skills and have grown in my position. At times, management is very engaged on endearing their employees."
good,Cintas continues to provide great training for college graduates and JMOs.  It was a fast paced culture with solid benefits.
good,"Became a ""Hunter"" and Presenter to A and B level Exec. Executed the ""Sale Process"" and managed people and a territory in very high pressure situations."
good,I would say that it is a great place to work at with no college experience.  Its a fast pace environment that allows you to work mostly without any supervision.  Its a lot more then just delivering. There is also a lot of customer service and sales.
good,Riding around different cities and met new people everyday. I learned how to advertise and sale more product for the company. Managed my own truck and work daily.
good,Driving for miles gets pretty boring but it is a pretty laid back job. Being independent with no one to answer to while on the road is great. You have one on one interactions with your customer. You solve the issues that the customer has and relate it back to your supervisor so that it won't happen again.
good,ok place work but after years of changing owners each time it got different some good and some not so good the co-workers were good people and the work was ok the hard part was to get people there every day
good,Good Company with great benefits.  Team environment.  Working with other partners was the best part of the job.  Great company to work for.  Good standards and principles.
good,Worked as a safety and health coordinator for over three years. Cintas was an excellent company to work for with great benefits.
good,"My typical day consists of a meeting or check in with management first thing in the morning, then off to my assigned customers for the day. The jobs that I would be doing would be anything from servicing/stocking their first aid kits, installing these kits or flushing eye wash units."
good,"I rolled mats in automated machine and placed them on cart to be put on trucks and shipped out to companies around the region.  I programmed and used electro-mechanical equipment to prep and stage soiled product including, but not limited to uniforms and floor mats with the objective of industrial cleaning.  Constant motion with "
good,This place keeps you constantly busy with new opportunities for learning new skill sets.
good,"Good company to work for, but the work can be physical and break you down over time. 4 day work week is nice, but expect long hours on those 4 days."
good,Loved going to work and interacting with new prospective customers. The challenge of competing with our competitors and co workers and yourself.
good,great corporate culture even on the worst days. Not enough over time.
good,delivering material to be destroyed using tractor trailer
good,Strong corporate culture. Safety minded organization. Always looking to improve the status quo.
good,"As team leader, my typical day at work starts with meeting my co-workers to discuss and resolve and issues that they have encountered, as well as evaluate the overall performance of these coworkers and work on different approaches to making the job more efficient.  Inventory and stocking is an essential part of an everyday task.  I travel to different business and perform fire safety inspections at each of these business to insure that they are up to all fire codes.  I have an outstanding working relationship with my management and coworkers and take an active role in training new employees and serve on the safety committee.  The hardest part of my job is that I am not challenged enough.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have developed trust with my managers and have permission and ability to act independently and make my own decisions when a problem occurs."
good,"its ok to work here,driving long distances,"
good,"delivering uniforms, picking up bulk towels, receiving money for products. The hardest part of my job is not giving the customer there product because it wasn't enough loaded on my truck. I enjoy going out and getting the job done safe and sound."
good,"Great Work, Life, Balance. I have worked there for 5 years and this is one of the best companies I have had an opportunity to work for."
good,"Very easy going, fun environment. Interacted w/ customers daily, management gave great detail about workload and what was expected of me."
good,"The most enjoyable part of being an outside sales representative for Cintas Corporation is the flexibility to create your own schedule and the earnings are limitless. However, it is definitely a sink or swim environment; with few good examples of success. The ""captains"" on our sales team were more often than not the worst examples of discipline and consistency. This position is designed for a disciplined PROFESSIONAL."
good,Cintas provides strong record-keeping security for medical and legal records.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with clients, overcoming project related hurdles, exceeding client and corporate expectations, and the team's collaborative efforts to achieve optimal success. "
good,"Days at Cintas were always busy and high-paced. I loved my coworkers! Management was there at all times for extra support, and so was the Manager Relief team. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was able to help our customers' and fulfill their needs. That really is a great feeling."
good,"Great for younger people. Lots of options for careers. Large company, great benefits."
good,I would get a fair amount of miles to run and also pretty good home time.

good,busy place i work almost 7 days aweek. nice people and awesome supervisor.
good,"good place to work"
good,"Good People"
good,Very rewarding job that allows you to be your own boss and manage territiory
good,"Cintas is a very good company however the low pay for hourly partners ensures that managers must work and manage the business at the same time.  This makes the day pass quickly, but limits the amount of time spent on areas outside the day to day tasks."
good,"Cintas was a nice company to work for. I would recommend it to others in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. I really enjoyed my time there and learned alot."
good,"Advanced very quickly within the company, due to my willingness and ability to learn new functional roles within the company."
good,It's ok. At times to much work not enough pay for the stress. It isa challenge which is good sometimes.
good,Pick up of documents to be shredded at facility. I learned the importance of being on time and listening to your customers. Management is firm but fair. Great co workers that believe in being team players. The hardest part is constant pushing and pulling containers over 300 Lbs. The most enjotable part is driving and customer interaction. Meeting new people and developing new relationships with your customers is a treat in itself.
good,"Managed by intimidation. Route guys generally see the same people once or twice per week, and are expected to have constant sales/growth with the same customers. If goals cannot be met, then managment will not let you check in at the end of your day, until you meet with your service manager, or general manager and feel like you are going to lose your job"
good,The work wasn't hard. Had fun talking to the people I worked with.
good,Nice place to work. People are friendly for the most part. I learned a lot in the office field and was able to cross-train and benchmark for other locations.
good,"Working for Cintas Fire Protection provided me with valuable technical skills of various fire protection equipment installation, repair, and service."
good,"I was a service and sales rep. for Cintas, and my duties involved weekly drop off and pick up of uniforms and various indeustrial service supplies for customers on my route. The staff and management were excellent and the company was very family oriented. My route was very large and it could get quite stressful at times, however Cintas was an excellent company to work for."
good,"A typical day involves performing testing in the lab and interacting with the people in the plant. I have learned to manage multiple projects at once. The hardest part about this specific job is the job security and the management that I've been under. My direct supervisor was changed without warning and is trying to get my main project rejected simply because he has an outside conflict of interest, however the project could be extremely beneficial to the company as a whole. The company is nice to work for, it is just this one particular person who has made things a little tougher in a work environment."
good,Responsible for the service team and office staff and daily operation of the location.
good,"as a general manager I was responsible for the day to day operation of the restaurant. duties included training, budgeting, Inventory control, staff scheduling, food prep. I learned how to effectively manage staff and how to motivate and instruct people to maximize productivity."
good,"My role involved picking confidential files as requested and preparing them to dispatch. When goods are returned, I was responsible to put them back into storage."
good,"Start early AM, check in technician, review revenue and sales."
good,My work day consist of prepping and filing mortgage loans for PNC Bank. I really learned alot about mortgage paperwork with this company. My manager and team leads were very helpful in assuring we learned the paperwork in memory and made quota on our daily task.
good,Cintas is a well known company in North America. Great place to work. Can be very physically demanding.
good,"Little to no support from management"
good,get set up for the day with list of customers. prepare product and begin day by seeing whats needed to be stocked and sales of other services. We make commission of sales on top of hourly
good,Its an alright job. The management team doesnt seem to want to follow through on anything. Corporate is way to slow to implement technology to make life easier.
good,"Not a terrible place to work, but lacking job advancement for myself. Looking for a place I can retire from.This is a job till I get to that place.I'm a home owner and live check to check."
good,"CAN BE VERY REWARDING. Will spend a lot of time from home, most suitable for single persons or head of household providers with stay at home partners. May be more beneficial working at another location"
good,"Outstanding and consistant onboarding and training. 1 full day per week of phone blocking, 4 days on the road selling in a hunter role. Somewhat of a boiler room culture but certainly a place where you will learn how to ask quesions, handle objections and gain confidence."
good,"Worked on a base salary + comission on a designated route servicing customers. I personally didn't enjoy the sales part of the job, but getting to work at my own pace, interact with different customers, and solve customers problems was very enjoyable. Very family oriented, gave away TVs and other prizes, even randomly sometimes."
good,"Lots of favoritism within management. culture is decent, management could use a lot of work. Other than myself, people felt like they were overworked and not getting paid their worth. I loved my partners, I just didn't agree with how management would treat certain individuals."
good,Company is great to work. No job or task is overwhelming. Time balance with family and work is the issue. New ideas aren't looked at with positive responses. Just rather keep running the same race. Over all nice place to start and have a career
good,Overall working with all the co workers was pleasant and enjoyable. I left the company due to a better pay offer with less hours a week and more time with my wife and kids
good,Good people at work but the pace of work is very fast and the poor salary the managers are friendly and you have one day a month that they give lunch to celebrate.
good,"management constantly changing, had 3 GMs in 2 years. Worst part of the job was how much was required of you to ratio of the day. The office girls were the best part of the job, however, also lots of DRAMA."
good,Good place to work if you are fast paced and self motivated.this job relies heavily on team work. A great place for coexistence and diversity. Honestly a good work community.
good,amazing 4 day work weeks giving lots of work life balance. plenty of overtime at the moment. management is not the greatest but they are working on it.
good,"Job can be really great or could be ok at best. It just depends on the work, or route you are given. Good bonus program, commission is nice too, and you work independently."
good,"Everyone will have their own opinions. However my goal was to have internal growth, I worked hard, and there were several changes in management through my time there. It was difficult and at times there were inconsistencies on what goals to achieve to obtain the growth. My peers were a joy to work with, however another opportunity became availbility. I have referred two other friends to the company and they still currently work there. It is a fast paced, sales driven, competitive company, but with the implementation of being home grown. A blue collar corporate company."
good,Fun job great people but management was horrible   You had to work long hard hours but overall it was fun just wish they were honest to their employees
good,Fast paced stressfull Do not wish to I cannot believe you are forcing me to complete this and not letting me progress further until I do. Not Nice!!!!
good,"Cintas is a great job for someone out of college. Work is less than 40 hours depending on the route you have and your paid salary for SSR positions. There are also hourly positions, most positions are 4 day work week."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working closely with 
good,The company SOP's come from the corporate office and should be followed in all locations.  You can be employed in New York and be able to go to any other location and the job should be the same.
good,Great place for career growth and advancement. Corporate culture is great. promotion for me was easy with just simple work ethic and a willingness to learn a new industry.
good,"Sure gets you ready for the work day. Provides the opportunity to learn multiple facets of first aid, safety and training as well as facilities services and uniforms."
good,"typical day is receiving stock and pulling stock for drivers routes, inventory of items, ship items to customers and companies, mark and stock items in correct places"
good,"If you aren't willing to beat the pavement, grind out cold calls, and hard close prospects-don't even apply. If you will, you can make real money. If you intend to advance, make your mark quick, close targets and you can make a nice career and stack some savings. The training you get is top notch, and if you can put a track record of success together at Cintas you will be looked at as a valuable commodity by recruiters and other business leaders. The company is growing, expectations are much higher, so come in ready to work, or you won't last long."
good,"I stayed very busy going after new customers, therefore, my days would fly by. They do try to make the job fun for employees. However, they do have a corporate feel to the environment."
good,"Good company with opportunity for advancement! Good compensation package/ Good benefits. Not a good experience with middle management. Large national corporation with opportunities to move and advance. Training was deficient, and success is correlated closely to assigned territories."
good,"I enjoyed the job with a established route , and the opportunity to get new accounts . But felt the training was insufficient, and was very stressful from the beginning with trying to learn mostly on the job by your self..but also upper management was very negative and not up building .. Only worried about numbers and not customers and employees....."
good,"My role at Cintas was that of a direct embordiery machine operater of 2 or 4 head cap machines or 6 or 12 head shirt machines. How many machines I ran depending on product demand. My responsibilities included the loading of product, setup of program, processing, and unloading of product. I also inspected finished product prior to shipping."
good,Operated forklift in accordance with warehouse standards in a fast pace environment.  Working with management to ensure the right products were load on each truck in a timely manner and offloading the return trucks and prep them for loading for the next day.  The hardest part of this job off loading 23 trucks and loading them for the next day delivery every day.
good,"Good Company, good Benefits. sometimes they ask for too much and then threaten people with their jobs when they don't perform ""There are a lot of other people out there that want your job"""
good,The best thing about cintas is they pay weekly.  It is a service company so it feels like your flying by the seat of your pants.  Keeps you creative and spontaneous.
good,"Well managed, good training."
good,"4 day work week with a meeting Friday mornings. Monday - Thursday has long and hard work hours. Not much room for advancement within the company unless you are willing to relocate. "
good,They are a top notch company toward for. You stay busy from the time your day starts to the time it ends. The benefits are fantastic and they are a well respected company in the area.
good,"Excellent Company but you need to be aggressive and hang in there past the hard times."
good,This was a great place to learn the corporate world and develop great skills and training.  The people were amazing and fun to work with. Cintas always felt they were the cream of the crop and took pride in their work and products.
good,Load my truck in the morning. make sure there gas for routes and destinations.Check in a outside of my assigned truck for any thing  usual light broke. Make sure I stock plenty of liquid soap for trips.
good,I was a Sanis service sales representative. I drove a company vehicle to and from businesses to clean their restrooms. Overall a good job except for cleaning very dirty restrooms. should have a strong stomach.
good,"Cintas is a great place to work as long as you are a hard worker.  They have a very strong and somewhat strict corporate culture. "
good,"This company has great benefits, and allows for career advancement/promotions. However, they change management very often, and new managers like to try to make their mark by firing people for no reason whatsoever. If they kept the same general manager for longer than 2 years, that stability would lead to a fantastic work environment"
good,Great people and a great company. Down side is that they don't think outside the box if you don't have direct experience in what they are looking for. They do hire from within and it is all based on your performance within the company. Nothing to do with previous experience.
good,Cintas is not a bad place to work.  The team of individuals are good to work with and the products are very good.  There is also room to grow and advance.
good,"Great place to work, with a family like atmosphere. Very professional workplace and very dedicated to their customers."
good,"Busy day form start to finish. Friendly environment. Garments must be matched correctly by man number. Good management structure. Most of workers are friendly and helpful. Starting at 5:00 am is somewhat difficult. Pay rate not so great, but benefits are awesome. Enjoy working with most of the partners."
good,"A typical day at work for me would start by checking my voicemails to see if customers called in to pay invoices or have questions on their account. Afterwards, I would check my emails for customer communication along with credit applications from the service reps or GM. If I have applications, I submit to our credit research team and wait for feedback on the new companies credit back ground. I proceed afterwards. The remaining day is spent helping my team of 16, calling/ collecting on accounts, and doing cash applications for unapplied funds. "
good,"big corporate issues, local management teams keeps you there, very supportive. most co-workers are close friends, summer time is rough but hey, its florida. management has its pros and cons.. over all enjoyed working there."
good,The work life balance is something that is preached but not practiced.  A 60 hour work week is a minimum when in management.
good,"Good national company. Strong safety culture, strong corporate culture, but management goals often conflict. Hours can be long, but weekends generally off."
good,"This was a fairly good job. I had a route that allowed me to be home by about 3:00 or so everyday, which I appreciated. I am not great at sales, so the pressure of that was not great. The management and the other drivers were awesome however. It was hard work but enjoyed interacting with the customers."
good,"Cintas is a good work place and they have great management . They are always focus on quality and quantity. I enjoy working here. I like my job, My job is very simple Wash Floor operator. My co-workers here are great. But the pay rate here can be a little better. Their raises are very poor and the distance is kind of far."
good,"Interesting place to work, Professional atmosphere where there very numbers driven.  Able to grow personally and professionally with many chances to train and travel to other locations."
good,"I enjoy many of the partners that I work along with. THe culture here is one that I have never experienced."
good,Cold call every business in your territory and show them why they should be utilizing your cleaning supplies and service.
good,"I work at two different locations as a supervisor and a manager, I learned most of my business skills from management in New Jersey where i recieved good support from management and communicated daily; as for the second location in Central Texas  there was little support and communication, however every location operates differently."
good,"No day was ""typical"". I learned the science of cleaning different types of flooring, Upper management was awesome. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. Hardest part of job was working looong hours, nights, and out of town. Most enjoyable part of job was the team."
good,A lot of supportive manager's who will go above and beyond for their subordinates.
good,Route drivers should be paid more especially for catalog sales.
good,Cintas is a nice place to work and they offer annual two weeks vacation.  It is a family type environment.
good,loading/unloading of trucks and servicing of customers locations.
good,lucrative if you apply self  self starters will do well  manage your route and do well
good,Complete industrial maitenance and performe inspection while interuppted.
good,The start of your day you would go your truck and check to make sure it was loaded properly.  Next while in route you pace yourself correctly so you can get to all 25-30 stops for that day. Once at the customer stops you make sure that all their concerns are met. If not then you take care of them and assure them that you will fix them.  the hardest part of the job was heat in the truck.  On real cold day you can barely feel heat. Your water bottle will become frozen due too the poorly insulated truck.  The most enjoyable part of the job to me is when you take care of the customers and they are completely satisfied. Another raving fan is what Cintas calls them.
good,"A typical work day consisted of phone calling to schedule sales appointments for each department of service."
good,Usually a one call close. Phone-blocks are a very important and have to be done every week.
good,"I was the ""jack of all trades."" I started working a general labor position but advanced quickly into the Wastewater area of the plant. I picked up a variety of skills very quickly and before long I was filling many different positions. I learned many skills: hand tools, power tools, welding, metal fabrication, repairs on pumps and motors, electrical skills, trouble shooting, maintenance on various equipment and how to safely lockout tag out machinery and I operated a forklift. What I enjoyed most is that I was a very valuable employee for the company and I solved many problems that no one else could.. I even earned the nickname ""Wastewater Operator Extraordinaire"" The hardest part of my job was that I was doing the work of many persons and when someone was fired or quit I would take the extra responsibility. Did not feel very fair."
good,"In this position there isn't really a typical day. This is because I serve as the front and back of the house employee. I am responsible for making the sales calls, selling the account, serving the customer, managing the inventory, stocking the truck, completing all sales paperwork, and keeping the showroom clean and professional."
good,Love the fact that you meet and see different places.Learn about people and there buissness.Co workers where fun to work with.The hardest part was making it on time back home since many people wanted more than what they expect.
good,"It will be four years in march at cintas, and I feel that I am taken advantage of as much as possible. My hours are changed at a moments notice without compensation, and being that our branch is short staffed I can be stretched too thin."
good,Starting of the day was as early as 4am. Every driver were to organize all paper work before starting their day on their delivery route. Very long days and a easy going enviornment. Managment was very helpful and allowed employee's to work in groups to solve problems . Co-workers were also helpful. The job was very phyical and demanding . Sometimes not leaving little to no time for lunch.
good,you may unload 20 trucks. some heavy then others.
good,"I would arrive at the plant and load up my bulk items, order my invoices, connect to my prc and head out to my customers locations. I built great trusting relationships with the customers and became apart of the well-functioning of their businessses."
good,"Everything was routine, always knew what i was getting into. Organization was a plus. Co-workers very helpful. The hardest part of the job was getting everything keyed in before it was time to leave. The most enjoyable part of my job was being in my comfort zone."
good,Thera are not apreciation for values just explotation for production. Plant Management does not give everybody the same treat. General management is ignorant about what is going on in the plant with the way of rewarding by the effort of people
good,"Steady job flow, repetitive work, consistent schedule, set kpis (some impacted by outside personnel); great health and retirement benefits.   Diverse group of employees."
good,"Cintas level of authenticity, at that time, welcomed the opportunity to have ideas, discuss how I could apply my energy and drive to work for the company."
good,management could have done a better job at recognizing and promoting their best partners.  the pay didn’t meet the amount of work that i did.  pay should be based on performance.
good,"I need a better work life balance. Lots of driving. Prepare to burn yourself out if you want to make any money at this position. Overall, great company."
good,"Service Sales Reps work a 4-day work week, no nights, holidays or weekends. Tons of opportunity to make money. Good mix of blue collar and white collar work. Tons of training."
good,A workday in this organization is very active and early.  The people there are nice and are willing to tell you about there experience and help you along the way.
good,"I truly liked Cintas as they were quickly expanding throughout the United States and in Canada when I worked for Cintas! However, as of today, Cintas is a globally recognized company that is definitely going to be one of the worlds greatest successes! If you get the opportunity to work for a successfully growing company like cintas, take it I promise that you will be extremely happy in the long run!"
good,Really enjoyed the culture while working here. Everyone was always on the same page and worked together to help each other out. Family oriented atmosphere.
good,Compensation and expense package is top notch.  Typical corporate incentive structure consistently changing to make it harder to reach bonus and higher commissions.  Good people
good,Cintas has great benefits. The work load depends on the route you are on. The routes run Monday to Friday with only four days of work so weekends are free.
good,cintas portland location provides friendly non confrontational environment with extensive safety training and engagement. they provide good healthcare and 401K benefits.
good,Awesome company to work with room for advancement. There are locations all over the world which gives you the opportunity for advancement if you're willing to relocate.
good,"responsible for manatee my area free of accident, roll all the clean mats, some time load routes. I been promise to get move to a 1st shift never happened. that and looking for a better pay rate"
good,They like to teach (for the most part from my experience) what you need to know there are some things they leave out but I'm not sure if it is on purpose
good,its a alright place to work just hot in the summer and cold in the winter. they have plenty of water stations so that you can stay hydrated. Monday thru Friday work week.
good,"Good place to have a career. Room for growth and promotions if you hustle and work hard. Not everything is perfect but the companies vision for growth and development will set up future partners for many years to come."
good,"Easy environment"
good,it was a wonderful experience learn a lot from this facilty. It was a relaxed but high paced environment with a very hostile climate in which you must adapt to.
good,There is opportunity to advance though it is difficult.  You have the opportunity to make a salary relative to your output.  The base is ok and if you do the minimal work you will be fine.  It takes alot of hard work to become a top earner
good,Great benefits and team work. Great culture. Good people. Great Benefits. Great pay. Opportunities to advance. relocation opportunities. personal growth.
good,"At the supervisor level, be ready to do whatever, whenever it needs to be done. You are the catch all in this position. It is a salary position so plan on working 50+ hours if need be. Benefits package is great but you can make more as a service sales rep."
good,"•	Manage and grow customer accounts in the Rental Division."
good,Cintas has many different types of services you could work for. Each of the different branches work differently however they try and work together when it comes to the customers
good,Cintas does a great job of getting new employees off to a running start. The management is engaged and willing to assist you. if you excel there id definitely room to advance.
good,"Management team is easy to talk to. I learned a lot about what people expect from you while you are working in a company which is quite different than a small town employer. We would start the day with stretches as a team so that we don;t get hurt while we are working and we get the important points of what the previous shift got done and what to expect with in the next week. The hardest part is the physical work, you are always using your muscles and the first time you do any task is always the hardest on your muscles, its like going to the gym and using the lightest weights but working out for a much longer amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, they love to laugh."
good,A typical day begins with an inbox filled with e-mails to be addressed. Many meetings throughout the day with cross-functional teams. I learned a lot about the uniform business. Great people to work with. Very demanding job with long hours.
good,"I ran my own business dealing with customer problems and finding solutions.  Being a commisison based job I controlled majority of my pay.  Unfortunatley, because management has access to your invoices and customers, instead of stepping up to back their drivers and associates.  It is easier to sit behind a desk and issue credits and never visit a customer face to face.  Being a commision based job, my pay was affected weekly and I had to fight for my pay at times.  It becomes harder to stay positive and focused."
good,"Cintas was a great first company to work for. The sales training they put you through is top notch. However, as a facility service rep, we are kind of pushed to the side. Uniform Reps and MDR get better treatment. The company tries to make you feel special with the ""car package"", which is where they pay for your car, insurance and gas. This, however, doesn't kick in until you get a territory (and they don't tell you that right away). It also doesn't make up for the very low base salary they start you at. The commissions don't pay out that much money because it is all based on multipliers and the things people buy the most are the lowest multipliers. The only real way to make decent money is by hitting the bonuses but they set the bar extremely high and most reps don't hit the bonus levels."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for but I just don't think it is for me. I came from a company where I was doing 5 job positions and only being paid for one. Here, it has become the same thing and the stress is just too much. Management is good depending on your department. For being in Mason, they do not pay the hourly employees a living wage. If you have a degree and can do a sales position, this is the place for you."
good,Paid weekly a plus. Checks don't bounce. Friendly fun place to work. Not stuffy. Thank you. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a great place to work
good,"Cintas was an excellent stepping stone into accounts payable. The environment is a call center environment since it is AR, The management is okay although it seems that to get a management position you have be pretty friendly with one of the managers."
good,Local management is excellent to work with.  Transition from GK to Cintas handled poorly by upper management creating a lot of stress in the workplace.
good,"The People working there are Great people, The Company provides Great Training, Cintas operates with a Great Employee Culture, The Company is Well Funded providing all the resources necessary to excel."
good,Able to go to management with issues. Extensive training program. The location manager and my direct manager were trying to help me with advancement opportunities.
good,"Long hours."
good,Cintas is a good company to work for.  Cintas offers unlimited opportunities of growth.  The Partner culture is amazing on a higher leadership level.  However; from my experience local Parnter moral is not practiced as much.  Managers have a tendency to speak at their Partners vs to their Partners.
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"Working with partners was a highlight to my career with Cintas, made several life long friends there.  "
good,Small office in a big corporation makes Cintas a nice place to work.  Management is not open to too many suggestions as they know best.  Once you reach the top of your pay range there is no other pay increases unless you move out of your position or across locations.
good,"enjoyed the years I was there. Good compensation, good career path, good culture. very high goals but obtainable if you work hard. Great PC trips, lots of recognition."
good,very good experience overall.  Gave a solid path to challenge and motivate myself to achieve.  Stabilized my career.  Heavily micromanaged and only so many ways to bring your own creativity to the table.
good,"Very fast paced and repetitive "
good,Had it not been for unforseen circumstances I would still be with the company. It really is a good company to work for. I was told I'm rehireable and if given the opportunity I would return.
good,"Fast paced sink or swim environment, definitely good for individuals that are self motivated and driven. Great training and then its up to you to put in the hours."
good,"Plenty of opportunities for advancement, need to prove yourself day in and day out. More and more responsibilities are added each week it feels like. Less time to talk with customers"
good,It was a temporary contract job there but the people there were nice. It was a nice easy going environment. It could have been a great contract to hire job position but they don't have the budget for full time position and not enough workload to do so.
good,"Good Company to work for.  Fast paced environment, good leadership training and very talented people to work with. Lot's of pressure to make numbers each month."
good,"Was a great place to work until Shred-It bought it"
good,Corporate vision is strong. Sometimes does not reflect in local location vision depending on the upper management's financial goals. They do offer great health benefits.
good,Cintas is definitely a job that requires you to work as hard as you want to be rewarded. And the multiple positions that I help with this company it was always at least somewhat within my power to earn more depending on how much time I wanted to put into my role.
good,Sales get all the good stuff all support or manual labor jobs are under valued. very culture centric. My particular position was on site at a hotel managing various accounts so it was a different animal than corp. positions.
good,"If you can handle multiple responsibilities and take pleasure in working with different types of business cultures, this is the place to work. The pay is competitive, on a lower level, but negotiable."
good,"The job itself was not hard. You have to pay attention to detail and work fast paced. The atmosphere in my opinion was not professional. I haven't worked here in 6 yrs, things may have changed."
good,"Senior management at Cintas was outstanding, my immediate supervisor was the reason I left. The location GM was one of the best people there. If not for my immediate supervisor i would have stayed"
good,"Fortune 500 company that is the leader in their specific industry. As a Service Sales Rep you are able to see different people everyday and the pace is always changing. The job teaches you how to handle multi-level sales as well as maintaining and building long lasting work relationships. "
good,It is a growing company.  When making changes to routes does not ask for or value the partners input or experience.  The 4 day work weeks are a nice benefit however the early hours and long shifts take their toll on morale.
good,"Fabulous career with sales and training of different safety subjects.  Great growth possibility but inconsistent leadership."
good,"A typical day in production can be a bit unpredictable, but all in all, seems productive and safe. There are a lot of extra responsibilities taken on by our location that can at times put a strain on efficiency and team morale, but most partners find a way to persevere and get the job done."
good,This employer has long hours and lots of travel for their drivers. You learn a lot while outings the field driving and is great for neyworkubg with other business owners. Driving can be strenuous in the winter with the snow and driving on the highway.
good,"not a good place to work of you don't handle pressure well. Great training program which is second to none. A lot of turnover among the sales people. The sales rep has to be put in an area to succeed. They suck when it comes to expenses . If there is a meeting , you have to buy your own meal . Very cheap company ."
good,"Cintas is a good place to work, you have to make sure that you are attentive to your customers and ready to work long days if need be, problems can arise at anytime, but if you go in realizing there are stressful situations that can happen at any second then you will be fine. you have to enjoy challenges"
good,"Very easy going environment, everyone there is very kind and willing to work as a team. The employees there are first class, very down to earth and kind."
good,"It is a great place to work. The benefits are good and the pay is decent. However, there is no organization when it comes to management on the second shift."
good,Customer Service and sales oriented company. Not having the products necessary for customer satisfaction. Meeting and establishing a great relationship with customer.
good,Very supportive place to work.  I learned a lot about manufacturing and assembly. Management was supportive. The hardest part of the job was meeting the budgets when equipment failed and needed repair. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with.
good,"Go on my assigned route daily and go from customer to customer and deliver items invoiced and while at each customer I would present items out of our catalog that are available to them for purchase and also to grow my route by adding additional line items of products to ensure we are a preferred vendor for all of our customers. The hardest part of the job would be handling objections to price increases. You have to show the customer value in the service and what all we do for them on a weekly,biweekly, or monthly service visit. The most enjoyable part is the freedom to handle your route as if it is your own business. Flexibility to negotiate service contracts in order to develop a long lasting partnership."
good,I am responsible for second shift operations. I am most proud of the lack of turnover in the highest turnover shift. I attribute this to my management style and the honest care I have for my employees.
good,"It was fun except i was in school and the schedule was related."
good,I got to drive all over the city.  I met a lot of people on my routes.  I learned  how to organize my daily routes to make it as efficient as possible.
good,"Very fast past, hard working individuals. The work/life balance is something that can be improved upon. There is alot of room for career development and growth withing the company."
good,enjoy working here fun people ok wages good bennies.  work can be hard 4 day work week with weekends off pay is ok company takes care of employees off the job
good,"Must be an entrepreneurial minded self-starter to position yourself for success.  If you enjoy relationship selling and managing your own territory, then an outside sales would be an ideal position.  Supportive team environment."
good,serviced over 300 customers while maintaining customer care and quality standards
good,"Service St. Louis and Southern Illinois areas customers providing First Aid and Safety items."
good,"Just a work study experience that helped pay for college, but it was fun, always something to do and got a lot of free stuff!"
good,"With the company Cintas, it is a great company to work at. Where you work as a team with great co workers assisting you with any needs. What I have improve on during my time at Cintas was my abilities to work with others. Cintas strongly enforce team work as a day to day basis and that is also one of the most enjoyable part of the job. To be able to connect with your co workers and feel as one."
good,"I start my shift by heading to the main office to pick up the account folder for that day and review it. I'll head to the parking lot to preform preventative maintenance on the truck (IE. check oil and fuel levels) then I make sure all the chemicals and equipment needed for that account are ready and in good working condition. I will then contact the account just to make sure the are ready to receive the agreed upon service. I will meet up with my team leader or fellow technician and make my way to the accounts location. I will check in with the point of contact, receive any special orders or request and begin servicing the account (IE. clean air conditioning units, tile or carpet floor) After the jobs completion I will clean and put away all my equipment and tools, check in with the point of contact to review the work and conclude any other business. After returning to the plant check in with my market manager to him know how the job went."
good,"everybody is friendly, u travel, good company to learn a lot of new adventures. Good company to grow in"
good,"Good company to work for, opportunity to see many places of employments and help ensure they are in compliance with OSHA."
good,Cintas is a good company to work for.  Management really helps you out and makes you feel comfortable during the work day.  It's great to work alongside others to reach goals and continue that success into the future.
good,Great to see a different side to an industry that you didn't even know existed. Hard work but fair pay and 4-day work weeks...
good,"The management trainee position is a unique position within the company.  As a management trainee you are expected to learn all aspects of the company in a short amount of time.  The MT rotates within the company to learn the different components of the company including going on route and servicing customer accounts, learning office administration tasks, managing and overseeing projects, and working in sales. "
good,Cintas offered a lot of prospects when they introduced the job. They discussed the culture and how amazing it was.They followed through with their promise.
good,Lots of traveling and meeting new people through outside sales.
good,"The job wasn't bad, just fast paced. Management was nice. Co-workers were sort of iffy. There was a lot of drama going on constantly. Otherwise, the job experience wasn't a bad one."
good,"learned about service and sales"
good,"On average, I have enjoyed the people I work with.  We tend to try to help each other out as the workload can get excessive because no overtime is allowed.  You are always busy."
good,"I had a see-saw time working there.There is some hard working employees and made some life long friends. At every job the company owners has created great cultures, policies, procedures, values, to form a great working experience for its employees. In reality, it all boils down to how dedicated the company is in finding the right management to carryout its intended business practice."
good,"Arriving at work early"
good,"Overall Cintas is a good place to work, for persons in supervisory positions."
good,"I am currently a Utility I worker and I work on second shift. My general job is that I sort the dirty bulk after it comes in on the trucks. Magagement is nice to work for but, if you are not in the intercircle, you get left out of alought of things. The one nice thing about my job is I work for a good group of coworkers. The hardest part about my job is that in my postion, the bulk bags can be quiet heavy and the pay does not match the hard work that goes in sorting the bulk.And if you want more pay you have to work overtime during the week. The nice thing about my job is the functions we have when we are not working."
good,Hardest part of job is physical aspect. Most enjoyable is the amount of family time.
good,At work I concentrated in answering the phone lines
good,good place to work.
good,very stressful company no team work involved lack of communication
good,Though I believe Cintas is a very good company they're reimbursement policies are behind the times.
good,"integrity, quality, customer focused, safety oriented and focused are some descriptions that come to mind. Lots of work to do to keep busy with. Productive people stretched to the limit. Good opportunities for people who want to work, and work overtime. Advancement options for those willing to apply themselves diligently."
good,Pretty good company room for advancement an a open door policy.
good,"The training was excellent. Compensation was more than fair. Great launching point for a new career right out of college. The hours can be very long, most times early rather than later whether you are on the sales or service side. If you are on the sales side, be sure to get a fuel efficient car because you will put some heavy miles on it."
good,"Overall good place to work. Nice people, good balance of work/time off, pay isn't great but have opportunities to make money if you work for it. If you're a hard worker and have good communication this job could be easy and likable."
good,Working here is fast paced while keeping a eye out for damaged garments.  Advancement is there if you are willing to work for it and better yourself.  While at work you must be engaged in what you are doing but when you are done with your shift you can leave the job at the door.
good,Buentrato regular salario  jente amable  buenos horario es muy limpio  buenos uniforme
good,"Monday and Wednesday phone block"
good,"Work in receivables. Not a hateful place to work - but there is some cattiness with the supervisors. Upper management sweeps a lot under the rug.  Otherwise, pretty relaxed environment if you keep to yourself as much as possible. Pay is decent and benefits are good."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for, there is always something to do and you have the chance to meet new people everyday. For the msot part everybody is super friendly."
good,"Cintas acquired our company in a buyout.   We went through a few management changes in the 4.5 years I was there.  My only real issue would be lack of communication from upper management.   The people I worked with were great!  Sometimes things get hectic (it's fire protection) but looking back it was a good place to work for, unfortunately I was way underpaid so i had to move on."
good,"I am fortunate to work for Cintas.  I am thankful for my job. I get a chance to use my creativity to be a solution-finder for all of the alteration, uniform needs.  I am trusted to be a supportive partner that keeps our shareholders in a position of success."
good,Cintas is a very good job just wish I got paid more money.. I love going to work every day good benefits and the hours are pretty flexible. I have two kids and in need of more money..
good,"4-Day work week, early start to the work day at 5am, nice management, bonus incentives and commission on your performance. Leading in safety and always promoting a healthy work environment."
good,Cintas is a good company to work for. Sometime the management makes it hard. The partners are friendly and helpful. Requires 8-10 hours of standing per shift and sometimes working on weekends.
good,"Worked long hours"
good,"It's not for me. Alot of contest to push new product every week without a break. Hours are good having Fridays,Saturdays , and Sundays off. Pay is okay."
good,Managers lack communication and there’s some favoritism.  Sometimes shortages of ready to use products affects your daily routine.  Loss of business due to customer stopping services affects your pay
good,Its was a good place to work. Learn a lot there. I liked that it was Monday-Friday work hours. It was a really organized job. I just didn't like the vesicles. I feel they needed new ones.
good,Good culture. Lots of areas of career movement and promotions. Continues to grow and expand. Demand a lot out of their partners. Reward people that go above and beyond
good,Working for cintas helped me build a work order and collaboration with other employees to get the job done. Cintas took really good care of me and employees and that was a plus to me and made me wanna work for them.
good,After working there for 3 years...I think that it's 1 of the better places of employment. The management is caring and understanding. Great 401k plan and stocks.
good,"At Cintas, accountants are exposed to all facets of accounting, from general ledger, auditing, forecasting and budgeting, fixed assets, lean  six sigma processes improvment and much more. It is a great place to work!"
good,"I believe the company culture is trying to move towards being more employee focused and many of the people there are good and a joy to be around. However, with management it's can be hit or miss at times."
good,"Overall a good place to work, but they exaggerate what you can make as an SSR service sales representative. If you hit everyone of your bonuses you can make great money at Cintas, but that is almost impossible"
good,It was always a race on different topics for employees. Made work fun if you have that type of personality. The drive of others doing well made you push harder.
good,"Be well prepared to push sales every quarter of the year. If you sale big then you'll reap the benefits, if you don't sale then your career may suffer."
good,Unload and Load trucks until done. We do around 30 trucks per night. If completed early we help in other areas that may need help to complete job. I like my job just would like to find something closer to home.
good,"Enjoy working at Cintas. Great people to work with, if you want to grow here there are a ton of learning opportunities. Inside sales position is underpaid and not given enough resources. You are only paid well if you make your quota at the end of the year you will receive a large bonus. The problem less than 15% of the team will make quota due to the obstacles we have to overcome."
good,"Cintas is worth looking into. Easy to apply for different positions. Easy to transfer. Cintas will match,  up to 10%, on your 401k. You will be fully invested in seven years."
good,"Good place to work if your dedicated to the work, some things out of your control, which affect you and your pay. You have to be good at ordering product maintaining inventories, customer service and time management. You have to be ready to work in all weather conditions. You have to be ready to be the one doing all the work and without much help if any. You drive and represent the company. The uniform industry is a tough and physical job which is hard to find quality  people to do the job. I have seen many people come in go over the years.  You start early in the morning which is nice, deliver the products in a company truck. You pick up the dirty laundry, you also deliver floor mats which vary in size up to 10 feet long. Some places have a small loads some are big, it all can vary on the account. You have to do service agreements with the customers and it is up to you to get them signed. If you lose customer s for any reason you lose pay, if you dont get customers to resign you lose pay even if you continue to go to that customer. The other companies are also out to get your customers so you have to keep this in mind while trying to make everyone happy. All in all its a good job but there are a lot  factors to consider and you dont realize what goes into you job until your doiing it on a daily basis."
good,"Cintas is a great company to launch you business sales career, usually 2-3 years on a sales role and you can go anywhere you want."
good,"When a Service Sales representative you have a great opportunity to grow a business within the work. Career advancement is not as great. You work out of a truck, and you service customers. Good for people starting out and can drive a truck."
good,"I'd say overall Cintas is a great company to work for but it has its share of shortcomings ----- as does any company."
good,I started as a route driver and worked my way up to become a certified Service Manager. It was a very rewarding job in that you got to met many nice people during any given day
good,"Overall company seems well run but i feel each indivduals experiance varies by the location they work out of."
good,It was a very good place to work. The staff was nice and everyone got along. Everyone did their work and helped each other out when necessary. I had no complaints
good,"Not sure why asking about Cintas, because it has been 4 years since worked there.  However, Cintas is a very good company and company to work for:"
good,"Cintas is a fantastic organization to work for.  However there were plenty of activities upper management focused on, that ultimately doesn't help our business."
good,"Do not apply through a temp agency!"
good,No shortage of help. Plenty of resources available to get the job done. The handheld computer is a lot to learn. If you have good communication skills you can be successful here.
good,"The culture at Cintas was give and take.  Being that I didn't take too many thing personal, my experience was what I made it.  My peers were great and the managers and GM were also awesome.  My only complaint was there seem to be no room for promotion.  Benefits were decent and so was the pay."
good,"Working for Cintas was a valuable learning experience and came away with many qualities needed for another job. Management was willing to work with you and teach you when needed. Hardest part of the job was some of the job positions, I enjoyed working with my fellow partners"
good,"I was very thankful that Cintas gave me the opportunity to become part of the team. What a great group of people I had the privilege to work with! If you are motived and hardworking, than this is a great place to either start a new career or continue one with the same company."
good,A nice place to work at and the benefits was great. We worked as family to make sure production was met. They did monthly drawings for prizes and we was rewarded when productions was met The supervisor was always there to help if need be. Had to worked extra if a larger than normal work load came up to make sure productions was met.
good,Cintas is a great company but you will work long hours. 10 hour days min. The company thrives on competition and you will do well if you are of that spirit.  The reward who produces often.
good,"Was able to set my own hours, maintain relationships with customers, and uncapped income potential.  Goals and KPIs continuously changed, making it difficult to meet goals."
good,Many great employees with outstanding dedication here at Cintas.  The Corporate Safety & Health team is totally devoted to achieving world class safety.
good,"As a Service Manager expect to be working long hours depending on area you work in. Some of your customers can located over 150 miles away. When an emergency occurs be prepared to be paying them a visit. Calls on the weekend are to be expected and they are never good ones. "
good,I enjoyed working there and I would like to get the chance to work there again. I think that this is a job that you can make a living off of and get ahead in life.
good,"I enjoyed working for cintas, there were some growth opportunity issues and i felt underpaid for the amount of work expected. The company has an excellent culture but it gets lost at the facility level."
good,"As a manager, they really invest in their people.  I have worked for several companies since Cintas and they really prepared me for future positions.  Numerous trainings where you learn how to be a leader."
good,The service/rental aspect of Cintas is cutthroat and has terrible work life balance. The Corporate side is fantastic. Great culture. Low end of the pay scale though.
good,Loved working for this company but the pay is grossly low for the responsibilities required for managing in the on site solutions division of company.
good,"If your a full time employee it's great. Great starting pay, benefits career advancement opportunities the works. For temps not so much just work hard to get a full time spot."
good,This was my first job out of school and i didnt have anything to compare it too. I learned alot of improtant lessons about the corporate work enviroment and appreate everything i learned from cintas . I still use the Sales and management trainning and attention to details tools from 10 years ago.
good,"My day would usually start at 4am to prepare myself for servicing my customers and to organize my route. Manage van and to begin servicing customers. My route consist of 194 customers whom are businesses and corporations. I arrive on site, meet the decision maker and convey that I am there to service their first aid cabinets, supply safety products or to implement a training program for their employees. After reviewing their cabinets and site for products, I manage, organize cabinets and supply area, place orders, suggest products and upgrade and fill orders on the spot. "
good,"The Customer Service Rep position allowed me to hone my skills in Customer Service, Accounting and HR and allowed me to use my position as a stepping stone to build my career."
good,"Buying rental garments ,buying cresting for garments,receiving  and scanning garments .keeping in mind  of customer service and quality of garments and do all of this in safe manner. There is much more about this position."
good,"this is a great place to work and the people are great to work with.. the benefits are great, but the management is up and down, no advancement. Th management will tell you or inform you on an open position, and then go and fill it in with the outside person"
good,"Great retirement benefits, very fun environment. Work hard and play harder style group of people. Lots of training in house and in the field. A really enjoyable place to work."
good,I would recommend joining Cintas to anyone. The day to day is great for those seeking to be out in the field and meet new company and get a first hand look at how they operate while uncovering some of the benefits Cintas has to offer.
good,"Cintas has a great culture which starts from the very top of the company. They are, however, slightly behind in the times when it comes to compensation and benefits, but I believe they will be changing this sooner or later. At the location I worked at, the management was a bit all over the place and there was a definite one-sided-ness for certain areas of the company over others. In my opinion, there was also a struggle between work-life balance much of the time. Despite all of this I would refer my friends and family to work for this company due to the great people and culture that make up the company."
good,"Management is very good and lets you run the operation out on the dock, will help if we are short people but overall they stay away and let the loaders and unloaders work"
good,They Fed us A lot of Food All the time and went on outings. A fun place to work. The schedules were great and flexible no weekends unless overtime when offered.
good,"Deliverer uniforms mats,shop towels to various customer every day. Grow route by internal growth threw sale and direct sales of various uniforms and restroom products."
good,Vary fast paced vary hot in summer cold in the winter is not for the faint stomach has to keep constant pace and be sure that all product is on trucks alot of heavy lifting and on feet 99% of the time.
good,"Sales and service calls on a given territory. Try and up sell all aspects of what the company has to offer.The first aid,safety and training components and materials. The culture is a personal as well as a team goal in sales. Building and maintaining solid customer relationships while driving sales. The interactions with different types of people and companies."
good,Great company with a winning culture. My manager truly fought for his people and I will forever take that with me. The acquisition of G and K will only present more opportunities.
good,I enjoyed working here and working with the people who worked here. When there was a change in management the whole job culture changed. Plus I liked building relationships with the customer and the new changes being made wouldn't allow us to build those types of relationships.
good,The downfall of working for Cintas is your work life balance in a management role. The local leadership and group level leadership lack support. as a front line employee the benefits and work life balance is great. Overall the company is a great company to work for. if your looking to advance your management potential I would recommend working for Cintas.
good,"A creative environment, lots of opportunity for travel, good opportunity for advancement. Well developed product offering."
good,"A dynamic and engaging workplace. Well targeted strategic initiatives. Plenty of opportunity for advancement, including globally."
good,"A very good company to work for, Many divisions to branch off to. You can make a long term career out of the company if you choose to  and opportunity permits."
good,Job security and good management. Working here comes with challenges but overall its a decent place to work. (Whittier location)
good,"Good place to work family oriented with helpful staff."
good,"I enjoy my Cintas partners, they are good people. Cintas is a very good company to work for. Very good hours and very good benefits."
good,"Great company. Excellent structure, training program and room for advancement. They have written their Corporate Culture in a book.  If you follow their culture you can do most anything.  As a supervisor you are expected to ""fill in"" where your direct reports fall short.  Good leadership and quality personnel are key."
good,mostly a good company had some trouble with how they charge customers but overall enjoy working there.  enjoyed the 4 day work week and pay
good,It was a great company to grow and learn business and sales basics. You do have to get your hands dirty. After the day you will have paperwork. The Atmosphere is open for comments and questions. They understand mistakes as a learning process.
good,"Good place to work, very competitive, must show results to last. Work-life balance good for front-line partners, not so much for managers."
good,"Day consists in customer interactions and service that could include Linen products, mats, restroom supplies and so on."
good,"Cintas can provide a stable work environment, but it can also be hard to advance.  The work is time consuming and often requires salary members to devote a significant amount of hours per week."
good,"I'll simply leave it at that: has the potential to be the greatest company in the world.  If management could stay level headed and not bounce back and forth on ""what it wants"" it could be the best company in the world."
good,"started at 4am on road to first account then to account etc "
good,".  Route service to a set customer base through pick-up and delivery of uniforms and facility services products and other ancillary products.  Increased sales to upselling additional products, services."
good,Work your eight and out the gate. High pressure production and safety compliance. Rental of uniforms and all things needed for your employees. Intense safety culture.
good,"Nice group of people to work with , weekly meeting to keep us informed of changes. Sales team nice and always willing to help you solve issues."
good,"On a daily basis there are a multitude of projects going on. There really are no typical days. I can be doing anything from contacting customers about concerns, negotiating agreements, resolving products issues, running a route, or visiting customers to keep up relations and keep an open Dialogue."
good,"Great benefits, little involvement from upper management. Delegate very well. Job security is always there, laid back environment"
good,"Overall Great, People are the ones who make it miserable.  Working with 2 horrible personalities made it hectic. Mon-Fri job 8-5 job great but people you work with don't work."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and start folding what was at your station to meet customer requirements. Everyday you will rotate to different table and fold something different.
good,"Very close to home. Job was very flexible. Good, interesting work with washers, industrial laundry, facilities management."
good,"Average to long hours, depending on job and/or route, many customer interactions and challenges."
good,I had about 20 stops a day. started work at 6:30 in the morning.
good,Decent company to work for in an ever changing and unstable industry.
good,At Cintas you are allowed to start as early as you need.  I was fully SMITH trained and Safety Certified.  Most co-workers are great and easy to get along with.  The job can sometimes be overwhelming and  stressful but is very rewarding.  We have team outing on a quarterly basis and a company BBQ once a month.  Overall its a rewarding career.
good,I have really enjoyed my time with Cintas.  They are very focused on training and developing skills.  Each location is vastly different in the culture and mentality of the employees.
good,"Cintas is an amazing company with superior products and service offerings. The pay and benefits are very good and there is lots of potential for increases in pay with effort. "
good,The company overall is excellent to work for. Although the hiring process is rather rigorous and extensive the job is well worth it. The management does their best to address your concerns and constantly looks to improve on everything they do. Safety is the number one priority and training is given in various areas each month to keep up with the company's safety standards. The hardest part of the job is the uncertainty of events that could cause longer and harder days. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make your own routine and having very little supervision.
good,"The position required daily interaction with customers. I enjoy that. However, management is not to friendly with its employees."
good,"Good company, learning opportunities are there.  No personal or friendly relations were developed. I guess you get to focus more on work than social issues that way"
good,deliver uniforms count and order inventory check rags soap and rugs
good,"A typical day with Cintas begins early in the morning with mental and physical preparation. I was able to learn time management, communication skills and scheduling as tools to make my days run smoother.  The management was great with Cintas as they communicate with employees and always helping when possible.  The co-workers I encountered were all hard workers with goals and motivation on their minds.  The hardest part of the job is the hours of your route and the tole of physical labor involved.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the 4 day a week work schedule, payments every Friday and the relationships you can build."
good,"The pay is great as long as you are willing to work even harder for it."
good,"This job is for team workers as you work with your partner to insure all exam document have been upload on a network to be examined. When working we had all mangement around us working with us to meet deadline, this was the hardest part of work but also enjoyable too."
good,"General Office Duties, accounting, personnel files, ordered supplies, upsold products, restocked, outside sales, outside route management"
good,President occasionally worked in plant. Great team spirit.
good,It is hard work if you have a big route because is heavy lifting but you finish fast and grow your route its good money. Your by yourself on the road selling and the bonus is very good.
good,Very good Corporation to work for. The Management Team is always available and their corporate culture is top notch.
good,My favorite part of the job was the creation of an actual program for a new hotel opening. You were able to design every uniform worn and create a cohesive look based on the property's aesthics. I had a wonderful team to work with that was supportive and great at follow up and we worked together without power plays. Hardest part of the job was out of stocks and a drop dead opening date that you had committed to your customer. I like to accomplish what I tell my customers I can do.
good,I loved doing the work there how ever the pay for the amount of work you had to do did not match.
good,It is a VPP site. Good Place to work. People are nice it is an enjoyable place to work. Everyone knows everyone. You are greeted every day to feel like part of a family
good,They are a rather good company. I haven’t ever had any issues. Very friendly. My manager is incredible. They value their partners rather well as far as making you feel you are appreciated by always having lunch and or breakfast. Just looking for something that pays more. I
good,It’s a great place to work honestly. I am not happy in my current position and not sure I have a way out of it. A lot of the pay is reliant on other people’s performances and not much of your control.
good,Advancement with the company is hit or miss. They are great company to start a career with.The opportunities for advancement are hit or miss. The mentoring there is not that great and it takes a strong individual to network within the company to seek advancement faster. I would recommend Cintas.
good,"I learned a lot working at Cintas, more than any other job I have had. Cintas was a fast paced corporation where you were valued highly on your contributions and ideas. Even as an intern I felt like I was an integral part of the team and they allowed my opinions to be heard and taken into consideration. I had to learn to move fast in the field, think critically in the office, and put the team above myself so that we could all achieve better things."
good,"It was fine for a job.  no real complaints, they were upfront during interview process what to expect from the job.  I did like they have you do a ride day before you get hired to see what the job is really like and to talk with other employees about working there."
good,"Cintas has a fantastic culture. It is a growing company, with opportunities to move up. The work life balance is similar to that of the retail industry, where Holidays become hectic and stressful."
good,"Great long term career, stable, great people.  Good opportunity for advancement if your patient.  For faster advancement you must be willing to relocate."
good,"Quick paced but fun place to work.   Plenty of room for advancement if you're a hard worker and solid performer.  Early hours and long days for most positions, but no nights, weekends and holidays."
good,Cintas is a great company to work for. Everyone is extremely helpful and the work atmosphere is awesome! You get to interact with customers on a weekly basis as well as make a great weeks pay.
good,"Overall great work experience and paid very well. "
good,"I like working at Cintas; the people are nice and fair. I get along well with my co-workers and my supervisor.  The work is hard, but I have an opportunity for advancement."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for as they treat employees well and have a wide range of positions available. They ask a lot of employees and keep asking for more. If you have sales, driving, or office skills this is a great place to work. If not you will need to be ok with working a hard labor job."
good,"Positive atmosphere always engaged to work"
good,"All the managers were professional and courteous. The hours were great, and the pay was worth it. It was fast paced and repetitive. Uniforms were supplied."
good,"This company keeps growing and growing.  Always getting into new industries.  Pretty much you can find anything in this company.  Might cost a bit more than competition, but you are paying for service and quality"
good,"I worked on the production floor at Cintas for two summers. During the time I was there, I greatly enjoyed the environment I was in. Cintas days start early, on time, and require strong effort from start to finish to ensure that things run smoothly. That said, not only does the company offer the appropriate amount of breaks and amenities to ensure that each team member is capable of performing every day, but the leadership actively fosters a culture where each employee feels important. Supervisors often jumped in to work the lines during tough periods, and the ones that couldn't made a point to walk the floor and greet each person they passed by. There's a reason Cintas is as large of a factor in the industry as they are; every aspect of the company is treated as a well-oiled machine, and they take care of each part of that machine. Like all large corporations, there are problems that come from incorrect projections from higher levels, but the day-to-day of the company makes things like that bearable."
good,"Cintas was a great place to work. Very family oriented, all my former partners was like family. which made it great because we spent most our time together working 55/60 hrs a week"
good,"Great company to work for however, the pay structure needs to catch up to current times. Great 401k benefits and change of Paid time off has been great. Promotions = all about the people you know and network with."
good,"Hard work, fast paced, customer driven business.  Good opportunity to interact with customers on a daily basis and learn customer service and sales skills."
good,it was a cool work experience. management treated you pretty fair over all my personal experience was ok just wanted seek better opportunity for myself. great job for someone who doesn't have a larger overhead in bills.
good,"Hot, dirty, but Maintenance was looked upon as a necessary cost. Good safety program. Good Maintenance certification program. TPC online training for those that cared to participate."
good,"Long days at work sometimes heavy lifting required"
good,Cintas offers the opportunity for career development and advancement. This company is very diverse and innovative.  Cintas will continue to grow as they follow the fashion trends and continue be a one stop shop for the healthcare and hospitality industry. They are definitely more than just Uniforms!
good,"Cintas completely believes that structure and following a system will make anyone successful. I have to agree. Beginning a career with Cintas comes with doable expectations. One that follows the initial 13-week sales training, which includes reading material for personal growth, will immediately succeed in a sales role. "
good,This is a nice job that pays well if you are interested in the company's work. Only thing that I did not like was the duration of time that was required to spend in each department before moving on to sales.
good,"This job will always keep you busy, definitely learned how to time manage. Staff is really nice, work is fairly easy. Takes time to learn the system.."
good,"I worked for Cintas for approximately 2 years and within those 2 years I had 3 positions, my last position ended as a Administrative Assistant for the Service Team, I enjoyed the job, office environment, teamwork and people very much, everyone worked very hard to ensure things did not fall through the cracks. Each department had their own process but ultimately everyone worked together seamlessly. I resigned for a better paying position  at a company that offered tuition reimbursement which at the time Cintas did not have. If you are on the fence about giving the company a try, go for it, what do you have to lose? If you are reading reviews to make your decision, remember, no job or company is perfect and until you are working for the company and in the job is when you will be able to make your assessment of whether or not you want to build and continue to build a future with the company. Good Luck!"
good,Pay is great but the hours are very very demanding its tough. You have to work so many hours and no family time unless you have been there for years but the pay is excellent
good,"Pull invoices and print reports . Assist cust. and (drivers). Team player,  spread my time wisely"
good,It was a good start for sales but the culture did not fit me so It was best that I find a role that gave me the flexabilty to grow the way I wanted.  I have nothing poor to say about cintas.  Great people strong work ethic and strong core values.
good,"I enjoyed working for Cintas, I enjoyed my customer interactions, Only problem i encountered was that you could not be promoted to management without a college degree at our location."
good,"Good workplace culture, long days, you are own boss, and threre's always a chance to make money."
good,"The job is not very hard but, there are a lot of issues that are out if your control. These issues do affect your job. It can be difficult to move to a different department. We are not cross trained like customer service. "

good,Solid company to work for. Performance expectations are extremely high for any and every position.Very good culture.Nationwide presence creates opportunities if you are open to relocating.
good,"good employees and fast paced work, gets busy at times and also has some down time. Hiring process takes entirely to long however. otherwise good management, pay, and benefits"
good,"As a Shuttle driver you have little direct supervision. The location I work at in Jackson, Ms. is a VPP location so there is a culture of safety in the workplace."
good,"Most of the job isn't too hard to handle. Being an older location it gets very warm during the summer and pretty cold during the winter. They care very much about your health and safety and would do almost anything to keep the workers mostly happy. Benefits are great, pay is decent."
good,"Room to grow and learn other areas of the company. Very easy to work for the leadership. Always training for new systems, and products. Very flexible in job."
good,Cintas has a great culture. Making sure workload is spread out for all locations is the challenge. I love working here but change management at all locations is not always the key which is a problem.
good,good company and many benefits. great training program if you want to advance in your career just need to be ready to relocate. Good communication from the corporate office.

good,"A typical day at work for me at Cintas was to make sure the customers and team member had everything they need for the work day."

good,A typical day consisted of pulling and processing customer orders from the Webflow Pool.  The enjoyable aspect of the job was the friendly environment and company culture.  The hardest part of the Job was receiving partial or incomplete orders which could not be filled.
good,"Co-workers were great, second shift managers worked hard and were actively engaged with what was going on. The first shift managers were not very well engaged.  The company would take three to four months to fill vacancies, which would put extreme pressure on workers to cover the added work load due to the extended vacancies. If you apply there expect to go through approx. five interviews and prepare not to hear back from them for approx. six to eight weeks."

good,"Very fast paced. Lot's of room for advancement within the company."
good,8 hour shift 5 days a week. Voluntary OT. Fast paced. Great employees. Not much room for advancement unless friends with higher up. Hardest part of the job was the 100+ degree days. Most enjoyable was the teamwork.
good,"Cintas was a great company. I did collections, so a typical day consisted of phone calls, faxes, emails, etc. getting in touch with past due accounts to make payment arrangements. I have good co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was hearing reasons why people were unable to pay all day. The most enjoyable part was helping customers that were trying to get caught up and seeing the accounts receivable percentages due going down through out the month."

I also helped to implement new and ongoing programs that would allow the company to excel in their ability to wow the customer making us different from our competitors."
good,"It started out as a great place to work, but with changes in management came changes to quality of work performance throughout the company. Everyone gets along and I believe that the hardest part of the job for some would be the heat."
good,"I work for a hug laundry facility. Management was easy to work for. Co-workers was great, we all helped each other out. Hardest part was it work was the same thing every day, most enjoyable part was the easy hours 6:00 am to 2:00 pm"
good,"worked with dirty uniform"

good,It is a great starting company to get your foot in the door with almost any other company out there.  people recruit out of Cintas heavily.
good,Its a typical work day at work. I pull orders for my drivers that are needed for their routes. I receive orders that are place by prc. Management is reliable when needed. My coworkers make it a fun place to work for. The hardest part of my job is the traveling to get to. The most enjoyable is that the co workers make it fun to work for.
good,Cintas is a good company to work for. Good benefits and a great work culture. I would recommend seeking employment through Cintas.

good,"The thing I like best about Cintas is..you know what is expected of you when you are hired. They give you so much time to get better. The hours are solid and breaks are reasonable. "
good,"I would start my day typically, at 4:00am. Check my voicemail to see if I had any call-offs and if so, get ready to run a route. If everyone was there I would set-up ride along with any of 12 routes. I would focus more so on routes lacking in sales or service index. On the ride along I would help the driver service the stop as well as source the main contact for any issues (objections). Once we arrived back at the branch we would discuss our day. Both positives and negatives to the day. It was always my goal to meet with approx. 3 - 4 SSRS each day, in my office, to check in on the job and build relationships."

good,Typical week involved two office days and the rest of the week out in the field meeting with potential clients. Everything I know about sales I learned at Cintas. The immediate sales manager was very skilled and invested a lot of time in training his team and supporting them in every way possible. My co-workers were great and it was healthy competitive team environment. The hardest part of the job was my commute to the office in MD from VA. The benefits and compensation were amazing.
good,"Great Place to work, you are held accountable for your sales goals, which can be stressful, extensive training."

good,Very free work environment. Able to set your own delivery route and pace. Get to work outside and interact with different people. Very physically demanding but rewarding at the end of the day.
good,When I started with the company in 1996 - great company. By the time I was laid off due to re-structering in 2011 the management team does not know how to manage their employees and a lot of harsh items are taking place. May not be at all locations - I hope not since Cintas is a great company.
good,"Fine Place to Work- they have a hard time retaining staff"
good,Management was great when i started but they couldn't accommodate my schedule to attend college. The job was fairly easy and organized at the same time.

good,I Worked here for about 4 years and pretty decent place to work. 3 days off is OK. Management was OK as everyone is willing to help. OK OK OK OK OK OK OK.

good,Good place to work. Good management. nice people to work with. Supportive management. Advancement opportunity is there if you are willing to work hard.
good,"I learned how to sew, hem, and embroidery.  The hardest part of the job was hemming. Making sure that when you hem pants they are even. The most enjoyable part of the job is sewing."
good,I worked at the Lexington location as a scholar intern. Great workplace and wonderful people but it seems that the intern position is used for busy work.
good,"A little more flexible to committed employees, would have like to still work there. It's great to have policy and procedure, but you can lose valuable employees without a little understanding."
good,its a good place to work for far as pay rate and benifits  stock and bonds too  real  good with hoildays and vacations bonus so if you get called in for interview its a pro move
good,this is what I was told in an interview and its what I did. I push sales. The more sales you made the more money you made. Overall a good company to work for.

good,Cintas in a great company to work for. They have a lot of opportunity for growth and the culture is very team oriented. The management team is very involved and supportive.
good,Great job security with plenty of concern for the partners from management. You're on your feet from the moment you clock in to the time you clock out so it keeps you fit and in shape
good,Cintas is a great company to work for. They really focus other mission. Growth with hitting projections year to year. They care about their employees.
good,Not a bad company to work for. Very labor-intensive. Do you have a base pay but your commission pay depends on your route. If your route does not bill out much you won’t make a lot of extra.  Your manager is very important to your route so if you have a bad manager you’ll struggle money
good,Cintas purchased g&k services bringing new challenges and ideas with them . Cintas is the number one uniform service in the world I do believe . Exciting to work for
good,"They were not always able to deliver perfectly on my sales. That is what led me to leave. Otherwise people were great, and so was the company. No regrets"
good,"Great benefits, holidays and weekends off. Management ok, Co-workers and customers are great, job is easy. Only bad thing is pay can be a bit low. Depends on route you get, some make great money others don't. Not very fair. Overall not a bad job just wish I could have made more money."
good,"Good training. Good management. Fair wages and opportunities to make more with sales. Great benefits. Worst part is working in bad weather rain, snow, heat."
good,"In my view you are promised so much at your orientation but most of same is not kept ,you are asked to work 7:30 straight with half an hour paid lunch break which I think isn't fair to partners."
good,Great place to start a young career at.  Pay was competitive and many different jobs to learn as you spend more time at the company.  All in all a very good experience when I was young.
good,Good job to wok for if you get a good route. It all depends on your team and service managers. Some customers are unruly and outrageous. If you get a good route you are good.
good,Cintas is a great company to work for. They operate a few smaller locations called Branches (not the traditional plant that the company is modeled for) so protocols are different and structure is limited. It became more stressful trying to fit the two types of locations together without the same amount of resources. I feel like there was a lot more work put on the small amount of employees trying to do the same jobs as a larger plant that had many more resources and employees. Ultimately why I left the company.
good,I enjoyed working there even though it was temporary so I could go to CNA school . The people are kinder than my own family. We where a family there and enjoyed our time
good,"Was a good experience working at the Cintas location. Upper management was excellent, especially the GM. Would highly recommend to anyone in the job market."

good,Cintas offers an excellent work environment.  All departments work well with one another to accomplish one goal.  Corporate Culture is what separates Cintas from their immediate competition.
good,"Cintas is a Fortune 500 Company.  They are a very demanding and professional company to work for.  I appreciate everything they have taught me. I also had the chance to learn all the way from service, to sales, to management."
good,This was a good job while i worked there. I have nothing bad to say about this branch in Montgomery it was a long time ago and the pay and benefits were good enough
good,If you are self driven the company will recognize that and give you opportunities to advance your career. I worked there for about 6 years and had 3 promotions
good,"great place to work, great training, excellent benefits and opportunities for advancement.  multiple divisions and chances to be promoted from within and move from position to position"
good,"Job was fine, never stayed in the warehouse that long to really communicate with other employees, unless I was in the break room having lunch. I delivered to different warehouses(Cintas)."
good,A typical day at Spectrum was to measure the pants first and then putting the name of the companies on the pants. then I started doing the same but to shirts.
good,"In this position, I was able to learn a variety of methods for recruiting hard to fill positions. I recruited for the South Central and West regions during my time."
good,"I learned to up sale  through this employer. Productive days and good co-workers to work with."
good,it was a great experience as a summer job. I would definitely recommend this job to any college kid looking for a simple job where you get the opportunity to work hard.
good,I liked that they had a 4 day work week that was hard work. But a company who took care of there employees. The management was all nice people who took care of their workers.
good,"I worked for Cintas as a Facility Services Service and Sales Representative in Toronto for a short period time. I regrettably had to leave because of my schooling schedule, but I enjoyed every day of my time there. "
good,very productive and fun place to work.a good and peaceful place to work i was .comfortable all nine years i worked there.my forty hours was guaranteed every week.sick day and vacation is always paid.
good,"I enjoy working at a challenging job, "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Cintas because everything moves at the speed of business, and you have a team to support your actions. Strong management structure with drive to make goals a reality."
good,Cintas is an awesome job to work for the job is very fast paced but it’s not overwhelming at all I would totally recommend working for Cintas to anybody
good,Workplace with understanding and no favoritism. Calling each other partners instead of co-workers as all are shareholders of company after 5 years of service with being 100% invested.
good,"Great Culture, Many hours worked.  In this position I worked with a team to service accounts as well as follow up with customers.  It was my job to ensure quality control."
good,"I’ve been in numerous roles throughout my time at Cintas. Each is uniquely challenging and fun. A lot of emphasis is placed on travel, which I am not a fan of. Some bosses micromanage your time. Not as much flexibility as I would like, being a parent of small children. Very charitable culture."
good,"Great Learning Opportunity"
good,I enjoy working with people. I am a people person and have been in the sales business for 17 years. Working at this company I meet various people in all locations.
good,"In a typical day there is a lot of work to be done, garment have to process for next delivery."
good,I enjoyed my time with Cintas. Again my work ethic gives me the skills to always support my employer. I was always available when Cintas needed me. The decision to work part time was the hrs worked well with my husbands work schedule but again if Cintas needed me more hours I was always available.
good,"Building loads for all trucks ,off loading transports, putting away all mats , cleaning work place , looking after all the drivers in the morning with their bulk request for soaps or mats and linen,"
good,tough job if you are in a small market. Must create relationships to be successful in this position. Great compensation but work/life  balance is not the best
good,"Nothing to report at this time, however felt the position was a stepping stone to other career paths that require experience provided by Cintas. The safety of the driving vehicles could use improvement"
good,"Cintas has a typical corporate atmosphere, but the people make the difference.  Peers are highly relied upon and helpful.  They make it a great job and great atmosphere.  There are many meetings/calls for direction on what to do.  Goals and expectations are requirements and standards of performance are set high, and results are visible at all levels.  Do well and you will succeed!"
good,It was nice working at Cintas.  Training was always available.  My manager was open and willing to share anything she could to help to succeed.  Plans for evaluating growth to establish your personal growth within the company methods were in place.
good,"My work day was somewhat structured, but I chose the structure that suited me best. I liked having things to do and welcomed any opportunity to learn. The corporate culture was very much focused on integrity, ethical behavior, and honesty, which I liked, It kept everyone accountable for their actions and honesty was an asset. The most difficult part of the job was having to sometimes make decisions based on very little factual information and to make those types of decisions quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone generally worked as a team. All of my work colleagues offered their support, if needed, to complete large tasks. There was a lot of camaraderie there. It did make work enjoyable. I like to get along with my work colleagues."
good,It was ok working at Cintas.  People were good. Management treated employees good (incentives/rewards).  Fostered a team working relationship and environment.
good,The mission statement and culture is what drives the company to grow. Expected to grow 15%+ from previous year and rewarded when accomplished. They have several divisions.
good,Honed skills in management and engineering. Cintas was great place to work. Had career mentor throughout my time there. Worked on several high level Engineering projects.
good,"a good place to work, working outside in all weather conditions, working on your own, daily heavy lifting, have to be a self starter with strong organizational skills."
good,Enjoyed having my own sales route and dealing and interacting with my customers and potential new customers on a daily basis. Customer service is a major focus with Cintas.
good,"Decent job, pay and benefits were ok for the time I was working."
good,"Incredible training and development with unlimited income and growth potential.Recession proof products/services."
good,"I have worked for Cintas for some odd years now, and it has been good to me. I started as a loader in the plant, to water, then i moved up to tile and carpet, then was promoted to HVAC, then i became a driver. Cents gave me opportunities to grow and prove my skills and value."
good,Cintas in my opinion is a great company too an extent. there good to there employees and everyone works together to maintain and produce great products. with that being said they lack in communication between departs when it comes to management relaying information to employees.
good,"I learned that the factory work life can be very challenging at times. It isn't for everyone, but it was okay. I loved the environment at Cintas. Everyone was extremely nice, and management was awesome."
good,Every day I contacted different locations to schedule their inspections or installations.  i maintained the scheduled for 10+ employees. I also input reports into the system.
good,"The hours are set and it's a good place to work. The only problem I had was with making quota, personally me. I'm used to working fast paced jobs but something about this one I couldn't get down."
good,"A great place to work, not an easy place to work. It is physically demanding. Also mentally demanding, so may customers to keep up with. The pay got higher the harder you worked."
good,"My work for the office of the regional VP involved all administrative functions.  As the marketing coordinator, I worked on developing monthly product promotions, went on routes with drivers, liaison responsibilities between customers and drivers."
good,"Cintas is a great company to work for. It is very inclusive and there are many opportunities for advancement and career planning. The hardest part of my job was the poor leadership that I was under at the time. The company as a whole is great, however."
good,Cintas is a very nice place to work. The atmosphere is conducive to achieving your goals that have been set by management. The typical work day involved troubleshooting network issues with the voice and data infrastructure. We would have to resolve some route and switch issues using SolarWinds. We were in the process of upgrading the Voice Network infrastructure in Mason and Chicago.
good,"I enjoyed working for Cintas and the coworkers. The salary was fair with room to grow based on your individual performance. No weekend work and if you are a CSR, your route is only a 4 day work week. I would suggest a career at Cintas to anyone who is not afraid to work hard and get a little dirty. It can be a very physical job and you must be outgoing and wiling to sell."
good,"Great and stable growing company. Good experience overall. Learned about the sales process, handling objectives ,building rapport and presenting new products to customers."
good,"typical day of work consist of doing a pre-trip of my truck , checking truck for all essential supplies needed to service all my accounts. Check with manager and supervisors any changes that might have occurred. once you leave the facility your on ur own to get the work set out for the day done."
good,"I felt very accepted and enjoyed working here. It was a good place to be and enjoyed every moment of it. I wasn't here for a long time but, for as little as i was there i loved it. It was a fast-paced environment and i loved it."
good,Not a job for weak people or someone not willing to try hard.  I have worked here many years and have become very good at what I do. you have to be willing to sell.
good,The people there are very nice and polite also fun to work with. Loading trucks will be a stressful job and I know and can be a stressful job just have to take it one day at a time

good,good place to work and good people to work with. management always willing to get in there and work with you . a typical day was making sure drivers had everything they need for their customers needed
good,"When I started with the company it was great. However, with the growth they lost a lot of quality making your daily job 10 times harder. Love the 4 Day work week, and pays excellent."
good,An overall good place to work as the company continues to grow in sales and profits. With the continued growth the company culture continues to evolve.
good,"Cintas is truly an amazing company to work for. You have absolute job security and there are various opportunities you could advance to or move around to. In sales especially, the pay is incredible. You have base salary, commissions, and quarterly bonuses. They definitely reward and appreciate your hard work. You are always taken care of. "
good,"Cintas was a great place to work.  The sales rep turnover was about 80%, but, there were a few of us that were successful and had a great time until the stock price plummeted.  Then.....everything changed.  Divisional managers became Sales Managers, and on and on.  It got so bad, they decided to hire two Management trainees to take MY sales territory knowing they would pay them less.  It happened across all states."
good,Great for a self motivated person. Physically demanding Job with lots of opportunity to grow. Great hours and family friendly. Meet with lots of different customers.
good,"Cintas can be a little hectic for most parts, but it is a good place to work. As long as you keep up, you will get better. Sure the pay is lower and there will be frustrations at times. The people there are friendly."

good,"Great culture and fantastic management support. Operations, sales and admin work well to support the customers and each other."
good,management is enthusiastic and continues to strive for good work/life balance. GK was purchased by Cintas corp. and ceases to exist now. Cintas is a different corporate culture
good,Good work environment.  They make you feel like a part of the team sas long as you are on premises.   any remote employee gets left behind. Better Managers needed.
good,G&K Services was a great company that sold out to Cintas.  Cintas is similar but had to eliminate a lot of dual roles between the 2 companies.  As a route driver you can make a great name for yourself in this business
good,"Cintas was a great job! I went from a entry level position to driving within a yr 1/2. Great company to work for if you move every now and then. They're nationwide. They have great culture, friendly partners, and benefits. The only thing I didn't like was, I had 3 different managers over a yr. I was having too many problems with my paycheck and the supervisor wasn't very helpful at the time."
good,Cintas maintained professional environment and kept a diverse group of employees. Cnitas is a great place to start a professional career. Cintas hold a variety of job opportunities within their company.
good,"As a first location to work, I don't know how other places are. Cintas is not a bad place to work. Benefits are excellent besides vacation, though the revised vacation plan is a bit better. Depending on your job, you are either relaxed or stressed out by having too much dependent on other people. Overall, not a bad job or place to work."
good,Manage the Marketing E-Catalog images to ensure they fit the new Cintas brand standards. As well as analyze data for direct mailers through tracking customer response rate

good,"If Sales if your thing, Cintas is a great company.  Great benefits, good working culture.  The sales process and quota weekly is tough, but a true salesman will do excellent"
good,its is a diverse place to work. almost every one knowns every one. they also provides continuous training. frequent meeting so we can all meet and discuss the way forward
good,Great company to work for. They had great product to sell and had access to many other products that many companies had. this business was great in providing customer service.
good,"I learned alot starting my career after the miltary with CIntas, I started off as a route sales employee and worked myself into sales and helped open a new branch in KY"
good,Cintas is a great place to work. great benefits. great chance to move up. The problem I ran into was they would come to me with a new responsibility. they would see I could handle it and add more. My plate was too full.
good,"Cintas was my first job out of college.  I started and was trained in their Management Trainee program for the first 3 years.  I was trained in Sales, Quality, Customer Service, and Department Supervision roles.  After my training was complete, I took over Quality and Customer Service for the Distribution Division.  I worked on many different projects that had to be tracked to show improvements.  I really enjoyed working within the Cintas culture and with the wide range of people at Cintas.  Every employee (partner) at the company was vital to it's success."
good,Good company to work for.  Management is very professional and fair to all employees.  Fast paced work environment that pays very well for the work you put in.
good,"Very great company to work for.  Fortune 500 company, Excellent benefits and management.  Typical work week is 4 days, no weekends. Paid weekly with bonus incentives."
good,"A typical day at Cintas would include 30-50 stops a day rain or shine and I worked in the desert with the scorching heat. I learned more about dealing with customers who own their own business and how hard it really is to run your own business. Management was inconsistent with policies which I feel was frustrating. The hardest part of the job was working in the weather conditions and the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours worked, 4 days on and 3 off."
good,Expectations and demands are high but fairly compensated for your work.  Very good training program.  Company culture is very important to management and expectations are high
good,"very caring manager , encouraging without micromanaging.  makes environment fun and inclusive. good team interaction"

good,base pay/commission paid position...it gets tough when the commission side is negatively affected by outside forces...economy.  4 day work week isn't bad.
good,Had to drive pretty nasty roads on my route. The fleet vehicles are a bit old. Got paid really well to sell Products to customers.
good,"pretty much manually labor job there are ways to advance but if your trying to start a career i would advise you to start off off as truck driver or working in the sales part of the plant other wise is going to most likely be a up hill battle trying to get any where overall, its a job you get weekends off  and paid holidays, I have found the hardest part for me working there was getting used the different personalities, because i work inside the plant im not working directly with customers so I guess that can be plus"
good,Enjoyed having the ability of working with customers and making sure their business needs were met. Management would do their part to assist you with the job.
good,Great place to work if your're not in management. Every shift is very numbers driven and everyone works towards a goal together. Great teamwork and great benefits.
good,It depends on where your at as far as jobs. I started a shop towel bagger and worked my way up to a truck loader . which at that time was pulling the orders in the stop order. and making sure the routes had the other materials they needed for there routes.  I learned what all the control numbers meant. and the ISO:2000 tracking system was for. Management and co-workers were like family. the hardest part of the job at the time was pulling the routs in order according to the customers numbers. the best part was making friends.
good,I enjoyed goin to work. Worked a 4 day week which gave me time to spend with family. long days but well worth it. Great bonuses and quarterly incentives.
good,"typical day requires you to post checks for customer accounts. Management is there to help you, very understanding. Co-workers are great. Very friendly."
good,A typical work day consisted of going into work early to make sure our truck had all the gear we needed for every job we had to do. each stop took at least 2 hours of drive time and another 3-5 hours to complete a cleaning job. I learned how to use every piece of equipment including chemicals needed for the job. My co-workers were very helpful in teaching me everything I needed to know. The hardest part of the job was learning what chemicals to use for carpet and tile. The part I enjoyed the most was all the different resorts I traveled to and had the opportunity to clean.
good,Love the people i work with! Management is very easy to talk to and really do care about you. It is hard work. Fast paced and lots of customer contact. Requires a lot of sales beyond what your route is running.
good,"Can go anywhere from Palm Desert to Ventura. Doesn't matter to them where you live in relation to where you go. The Technicians are descent, but are poorly managed. There is no communication from the top down."
good,"While only employed for a short time,  you quickly see that everyone is willing to help each other and have fun at doing their job."
good,"Overall Cintas, is a great company to work for, great company, culture, benefits and weekly pay. A few departments are newer than others and that should be taken into consideration by management."
good,"Great cultural working environment. Overall great company. Often times management is more involved with numbers instead of actually helping increase numbers in the field or assisting with quotes, etc."
good,"HR is very helpful, co-workers are easy to get along with.  The customers you work with are the highlight of the day.   It is a joy servicing their accounts."
good,"A typical day would include setting up the shift according to what the prior shift has done. Reaching a goal of hanging 12,000 garments. This jobs keeps you on your toes, difficult decision making is a must. Working well over 10 hours is typically normal here. As a supervisor, its a must to learn everything in the plant. it prepares you to make future tough decisions. the hardest part about the job is working with a new initiative called TruCount. before a route is finalized, it must be scanned out completely and then reconciled to make sure it had no missing pieces. this is extremely difficult because we process over 125,000 pieces of garments weekly."
good,Cintas bought Uniforms To You when I worked for them.  Cintas is a good company and I enjoyed working for them at the time.  It was a smooth transition when they took over.

good,"Although this company signature focus is on customer service and productivity, it is also very driven by sales competition and growth. The management team is very supportive and other staff members in differrent departments are always willing to help."
good,route driver was responsible for having garments to location in a timely manner. i learned how to balance physical work with sales. the most enjoyable part was seeing the customer face when they ordered things and they met there expectations
good,"Good place to work with supportive management, but always worried about the numbers.  Co-workers always willing to help you out when needed."
good,"Managed assigned territory developing long-term customer relationships through exceptional service."
good,Cintas was great due to the fact that you were pretty much self managed. nice to be out on a route during a nice sunny day. actually not that bad in snow either.
good,This job made me build speed and how to work in different climate controls. I enjoyed working at this company I just wish that I could have had the opportunity to move up.
good,"A typical day at Cintas was order pulling and more order pulling.  I really enjoyed my fellow employees, they were awesome people."
good,"It was a great place to work if you like loading trucks and moving fast.  Always something to do and it was pretty easy once you got the hang of it  Certain aspects of management seemed almost non-existent, however. Our production crew was solid."
good,good company - processed garments for clients by heat sealing and/or sewing client's company patches on garments with ID tapes. Most of the time clients did not come back into the stockroom so management allowed us to listen to the radio as long as the station was agreed to by all.
good,"Would like the opportunity to find a job who would be willing to train and with the possibility of long term employment.  The co-workers were great to work with.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep busy, not enough work.  I like to be kept busy and to learn new things that would allow for possible job advancement."
good,Cintas provides a great start to your sales career. Solid company with good training. This is a true salesperson job. The days can be long if you want to move business.

good,"Cintas so far has shown me a good work environment. My current manager is one of the best I've ever had. I think the only con I have is that there is a lot of work to do, so it is a pretty fast past environment."
good,"I am the Accounts Recievable Clerk. I call on customers daily"
good,"I am a hard working indiviual with my teammates. We work together to get the job done in any area of the company. I enjoy my job, my teammates and the company as a whole."
good,"Performed collection calls on delinquent accounts"
good,A typical day of work is starting work at 5 A.M. delivering uniforms to your first customer. I learned how to be patient with customers dealing with their uniforms and products. The management there was up and down. Sometimes you really didn't know what you were going to get on a day by day basis. I loved all my co workers that I worked with. The hardest part of the job was learning everyone's routes. What I enjoyed most about the job was learning different jobs to make myself a better employee
good,"From the Employees to the Clients and Accounts serviced everyone was extremely pleasant. However the mechanic in charge of keeping up with vehicle maintenance was rather rude to everyone but that was the only dark spot to the job. "
good,Great place to learn and be able to develop towards learning new things amongst an organization.
good,I have learned so much with Cintas. Mainly how to be more aggressive when closing the sale. Never taking now for an answer and being busy with activity in order to reach my quota.
good,the Service sales rep position can be challenging and it takes time to build/grow a route after you are assigned one. decent pay for the work you do.
good,A typical workday consisted of Sorts and updates. Seal and label press. Also manual hang line sort. I learned a lot about different cultures and that this company prides themselves in diversity. Management was very understanding and always open for questioning and any work related assistance. The most enjoyable part of this job was the diversity and unity.

good,Great place to work everybody is friendly and great with working in teams
good,scanning candidate exam papers onto the computer system and the followed by using web qc software to for corrections and matching their candidates details to their codes. The management was very strict employee performance .Hardest part of the job was working on the computer for a very long time. and the enjoying part of the job was scanning the candidates sheets onto the computer screen.

good,Good work environment. Good people to work with. Stable company that continues to grow.
good,"I was a team leader"
good,"Cintas is a great organization to be a part of. The only major issue is they heavily favor college degrees over experience. A person with a 4 year degree and good work ethic can move up pretty quickly, but somebody without a degree can expect for slow moving career and to settle in a middle management position."
good,Great Work atmosphere great management and work place. learned to drive a commercial truck. meet alot of great coworkers and had an overall good experience with this company
good,"Managed a large sales territory originating out of Lexington, Kentucky with prior responsibility for managing a "

good,overall a good place to work. Hardest part is the weather 20-110F.
good,"The day started at nine a.m. the trucks started come in off the street for maintenance, managemant was a great help in getting things done. I worked with a great group of hard working people. The hardest part of the job was that there was not enough space to work."
good,Data entry for a temporary job. Nice employees and fun to be around .
good,Cintas is an amazing Company. Some of the supervisors need more training to be able to lead their teams the way they should. Not all procedures are followed across the board. The people I get to work with I enjoy. The hardest part of the job is the communcation between AR and the locations.
good,a day at work at cintas has its up and downs i hang pants the hardest thing is probably hanging coal mine cause they have so many employes and they wear coveralls so it makes it a little difficult to hang.my co workers are great and hard working!
good,"Everyone got along. We enjoyed cookouts, family functions at the plant. On break we could actually sit with supervisors and not feel less than."
good,Interacting & meeting people on the daily bases. Keeping customers satisfied is the main objective. Always be focused. Everyone must work as a team. You have to take on all responsibilities. Making sure your customers are completely satisfied.
good,I run the maintenance department and the hardest part in my job is scheduling work around plant operations.
good,Cintas prides itself in keeping its partners (employees) safe. It is a great place to advance and has great benefits.
good,very team based service company that depended on quality and speed.
good,"The selected individual is responsible for general duties throughout the stockroom department as needed, including break, vacation and absence coverage for all stockroom positions. The partner will also assist with stockroom duties based on work volume. The jobs the Stockroom Utility position will cover are physical in nature, and require repeated bending, lifting, twisting and stretching throughout the course of the day. In addition, the Stockroom Utility partner is responsible to cover jobs where standing on your feet over the course of an entire shift is necessary. Daily accuracy and productivity of work is necessary for inventory control and accountability. Additional responsibilities include housekeeping and adherence to health and safety standards."
good,At Cintas we were like one happy family. We had policies and procedures and they were followed and enforced on everyone. My bosses would work with me on any family issues that might of arose. I loved to go to work. I liked what I did everyday and I liked the people that I worked with.
good,The shift hours were good. My duties did not involve much heavy lifting. Certain areas in the plant were a bit warm in the summer even with airconditioners. The wages weren't too bad and they offer great benefits. They provide uniforms and will even clean them as well. They play music over head that could sometimes get very annoying if it isn't a genre that you like. If you can not stand on your feet all day this is not the job for you.
good,Great place to work for somebody out of high school looking to grow with a company
good,"Overall great opportunity with a Fortune 500 company. Salary is above average with uncapped bonus potentential. The only drawback was number of sales professionals working within a small territory. You do have your own ""zone"", however, there are some that consistently do not produce. This job would have been ideal and financially rewarding if sales team was reduced to 2 or 3 professionals. Cintas does provide industry leading training and support throughout your career."
good,"Cintas is a good company to work for, with a pretty good work environment. Work hours can be flexible and they really value their customers and their partners"
good,"My first location with Cintas was the best place I’ve ever worked.  Great management, good friends.  Was there 10 years.  Second location, terrible.  Petty, filthy, very poor management and working conditions. Lasted 6 months. Made up the rules to suit them.  Just shows the difference in every large company."
good,"Loved the job, pay should be higher for the work that’s required to do why needs to be done. Staff was amazing, unfortunately I had a surgery that made me unable to do the job anymore."
good,"Great benefits,10hr shifts ,3 days off,one during the week and weekends.bonuses,"
good,"Wonderful company to work for. You get to make your own schedule and work your own hours. Not the easiest place to get a job. Only downside I've seen is advancement within the company. Cintas always wants to hire from outside for all of the ""good"" jobs."
good,"Cintas is great company too work for, they could do a better job of training a partner on proper business practices."
good,"Design department"
good,Fun place to work with a lot of hard working people. Dedication to the overall success of the location is always out front. Management takes care of the driver the absolute best way they can on a daily basis.
good,The company is very dedicated to its spartan approach. There is nothing exciting about the office but the people are great and the benefits are good. Great place to get experience!
good,Cintas was a fast paced work environment with friendly co workers.  The Management was excellent and fair.  You also have quota that you have to meet each day which pushes you to do your best.
good,hardest part of a route sale  is keeping the time schedule base of distance from plant to your first delivery for the day and working with traffic situations
good,"4 10 hour days, work in elements. Build relationships with customers. Adding growth and resigning accounts. Lots of new products which you have to sell a certain number."
good,"I worked here as a labourer. The pay a bit more then minimum wage for the position I was in. The facility I worked in was really nice but I heard that isn't the case everywhere."
good,"I love working for Cintas, they are very friendly and open. Management is very open to talk to, willing to listen and will help you if you are struggling. "
good,It was a temporary job Unloading trucks Of dirty laundry Which was pretty enjoyable They have great associates to work with The pay Wasn't that bad...
good,I worked on a MOD with 6 other women making pants for Cintas. For the most part I enjoyed my job and got close to the others that I worked with. I didn't like the fact that my pay depended on the production of the whole group so if someone came in not feeling good then everyone else would have to work harder to make up for it.
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,"I learned a lots of things, like to do inventory, handle my customers by myself and make my own decision. I'm happy when I'm working with my co-worker's, specially working with my Supervisor or Manager."
good,"It was good to work for the company at the time. Competitive pay, great benefits and cost of living. Holidays were great as well. Once you learn the ins and outs of the job it was fairly easy routine."
good,"Cintas met most of the expectations I had for them other then management help lots of room for advancement and friendly atmosphere, customers were in love with cintas so I hope I did good for them."
good,"The SSR position is a unique one to say the least. You have the support of the Service Supervisor as well as the Service Manager, but you are basically out there on your own to service customer accounts and meet with owner's/managers to update Service Agreements and offer new products that the customer may benefit from."
good,"Took me almost 6 months to get through their 4 interviews, but well worth it, and very stable. I only left for what I thought to be a better opportunity."
good,You travel a lot around Atlanta and to many various work places and collect  confidential papers. You will always run into new people and different environments
good,I had loved this job I go back if they ask me but I choose to move forward ...this job was to put linen thru machine.. Counting the line and they ship it to restaurant  it a lot of standing and movements but I had loved that job
good,"Great Culture, Team Atmosphere, Everyone is considered partners not employees, Very limited weekend work, Holidays off, Leadership down to earth and willing to help"
good,A typical day is a early start on the day 5:00 to 6:00 in the morning get started with paper work and computer check in see what else is added for that day. Everybody for most part including management are nice in helpful. The hardest part of the job is being put in kind of bad situation such as bad whether or rude people best part is being out in public in interacting with people
good,"Cintas has a great corporate structure and is a great company to learn what is expected for a personal to succeed in a Growing Fortune 500 Company.  It was an amazing job to get at 20 years old.  It taught me time management, sales techniques, and how to be a leader."
good,"Great place to work at my location. My co-workers were great people to be around and work with. All my managers were awesome people to know, talk to and whenever you needed something, they were there to help you on or off work. If I needed a day off for whatever reason, they would help me out, it was always an open door policy for all managers there."
good,"Since day one with this company I have been very happy. Opportunities presented themselves in such a way that allowed me to climb to my position in a relatively quick time. Unfortunately once positions were staffed it became clear that advancement would not be very realistic."
good,I would recommend Cintas for someone looking for competitive wages and guaranteed hours with a great health care package. The 4 day work week is very nice.
good,"good place to work "
good,"I worked in several production positions at the company and enjoyed the fast-paced production environment. While that work was fast-paced, it never felt dangerous and it was apparent that the company cared about the safety of it's partners."
good,"I love cintas but the pay should be higher, the management if very understanding, the workers are nice fun individuals. The work is out of this world crazy!"
good,"Overall good place to work, Only complaint is the hours of work (Evening/overnight shifts mostly). Staff are super friendly, hang outside of work often."
good,"Cintas is a productive, fast paced and challenging work environment with a quality goal orientated management team in place. Some days are geared toward sales and others may be more physical days. Training is always ongoing and management does a great job helping their partners get to where they need to be as far as sales numbers go."
good,"My experience has been a 4/5 overall. My management team seems to be easily stressed, quick to point the blame and slow to seek their own error or improvement opportunities, but really fun to be around most times. I'm not happy about the pay structure. I feel I should be graded on my sales growth measured against the actual opportunity in my territory and not a flat dollar amount compared to larger cities."
good,Very fast paced and demanding work with lots of opportunities to make money and advance yourself.  Management is excellent and provides lots of support.
good,"Cintas is a very fast paced, challenging job that is also very secure. I have never had a more steady job in terms of my hours. There are also many opportunities for advancement."
good,very good company to work for. low level employees have fair pay but no room for advancement. management has its inner circle but overall great company!! Nice office enviroment
good,If I had a chance to go back and work for them I would . People got along with each other real well and people were always friendly and cared for one and another like family.
good,"I can definitely say I like my job at Cintas. The people are great to work with, as is the management. I find my overall workload satisfying, whether I'm running the dryers, rolling mats, bagging scrubs or filling orders. Job security isn't as well as I would like it to be, but overall, I can say that I find my work satisfying."
good,"Cintas is a great company that offers many positions.  The workplace is clean, and friendly.  The location is fast-paced and growing consistently.  The benefits are great.  The hardest part of the job is keeping pace with the several requests - not enough support, so tempers run high.  The most enjoyable is the fact that there is never nothing to do, and there are always opportunities to do more.  Management is good, but like in every job - could always use improvement especially in the realm of communication."
good,Great company and wonderful people to work with. There is a large turn around which was hard to work with in management. Overall i loved what i did and the people i worked with daily
good,Cintas is a great company to work for. Great benefits and a set schedule. The management is wonderful and takes care of its employees. Good on work hours.
good,The only reason i quit working at this job was due to the fact i lived so far away and was driving over 800 miles a week to work.
good,I enjoyed working at Cintas. It gave me a base foundation on how to help a corporation run its business and be profitable. The skills that I developed at Cintas have helped me tremendously in my personal life and in my professional life as well. I would recommend anyone to apply at Cintas that is looking to grow with a company that has great potential for advancement and leads the industry in what they do.
good,"This company hires great people and is a good place to work. They expect a lot in terms or activity and results but you are well compensated for your efforts and they have great benefits. It is a large corporation, and as with many, it can be hard to change things. Good culture."
good,work 10 hrs days and off 3 days including all weekends.  Get Holidays off but still will work 4 days out of the work week regardless.
good,Cintas is an excellent place to work with a strong focus on safety for their employees.  They have an extensive training program that sets you up for success.
good,"Cintas has an excellent corporate culture and benefits program. Their pay is slightly below industry standard for management positions.  You will receive a lot of opportunities for training and career development depending on your managers.  The work life balance is not very great and you will have some long hours.  10 - 12 hour days are the norm.  There is plenty of room for advancement, which is awarded based on performance and not seniority."
good,"As a Service Sales Rep(Driver), you have a set route with weekly, bi weekly, and monthly customers servicing various industries such as auto body/mechanic repair, pharmecutical, restaurant/hospitality, power/utilities, machinery, etc. Responsible for delivery of clean uniforms/floor mats/linens and pick up of the same items. Also deliver hygiene products such as paper towels/toilet paper, hand soap/sanitizer, cleaning products, etc. "
good,"Very high energy and fast pace job, if you follow the job training guide you will become successful. Cintas give you the best training for Outside sales."
good,"great company with benefits. The hardest part of the job is fighting the weather. Co-workers are very friendly. "
good,"First thing in the morning I get all paperwork needed for the day, make sure my truck is loaded correctly for the day, and get my personal route computer with all needed information for the day.  I then head out to my first of 20-35 customers for the day delivering uniforms, mats, towels, direct sales, and speak to my contacts to see if anything else is needed for them to run their businesses successfully.  My job is every bit of physical as it is mental.  Overall, very rewarding job."
good,"Cintas is a fast pace environment with lots to do. On Tuesdays (meeting with the Boss) and Wednesday I start my days off with a corporate meeting. Monday, Thursday and Friday it’s all paperwork (Making copies, filling copies, submitting copies, sorting copies). There is always something new to learn here, whether it’s a new product rolling out or a new promotion for the Service Sales Representatives. On a daily it’s a distribution of emails, the normal check in and balancing of the day, taking accountability of the product that is being brought back and or exchanged for better quality. Some partners might call me the Gate Keeper. Not a bad name to have when you want to drive locations profitability by managing your department.  And in closing, I am an over communicator to assure everyone is on the same page on a process or procedure. Thank you."
good,"-servicing customers heating and a/c units"
good,Cintas is all about safety and work life balance. They pride themselves on proving safety on and off the job. We have constant trainings and updates proving us with safety issues.
good,"I've given Cintas 4 years and I've made my fair share of mistakes, But I must say that the management at location level can be awful  If you challenge them on something that they are clearly wrong on and need to improve on they will hold grudges and wait for the first chance to bring you down."
good,"I would come in and separate my invoices and grab my route computer.Driving to various accounts taking care of their needs."
good,"I left due to personal reasons. If not, I'd still be there. I worked at 2 separate locations and both were full of great managers, hardworking veterans and a fun, warm environment. I really enjoyed my time there and would go back if given the chance."
good,"A typical day at work included pressing cotton and executive pants and shirts. I was also required to fix any bottons that had fallen off or patch up any holes that were in the clothes. Management was an option if you were educated in the neccessary areas. My co-workers and I worked together to make production. If I had no work to do, I would go help out in other areas and they do the same. The hardest part of the job was the heat. It was very hot during summer months. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. They made the day go by faster."
good,Setting up personal to the area needed to work in. I learned all the areas in the plant that was in the rim in which my work flow had to follow. The management team is fairly new to this location but not the company. The hardest part of my job is having the product needed. Being able to train and work with my fellow coworkers.
good,"Worked for the company for almost six years.  My co-workers were very helpful, fun to be around and polite!  I started out as the head receptionist and later given the A/P job and ""other"" tasks due to other positions being consolidated to other locations.  I became the ""go to"" person and my workload tripled without much help which made my job very hard!  Temp help was available but didn't do much to relieve the stress.  The company needs to hire more experienced people in upper management especially at the GM position and help for the front office!  This wasn't the case when I first started!  Overall, it's a good company to work for.  It all depends on who's running the show as they say!"
good,"Typically, I phone block twice a week for half a day and the rest of the time is in the field. I usually have anywhere from 10-15 new presentations a week while cold calling over 50 accounts a week. I am in charge of bringing in new business for Cintas. I do so by constantly building relationships and expanding my funnel."
good,"Good company. good pay, good people, good learning environment."
good,"I held two positions during my time at Cintas."
good,People are great partners. Very good atmosphere. Getting to do different things within the company. Learned all aspects of running a fortune 500 company
good,"I would have continued to work at Cintas Corp, but as I moved back home to Kansas City, MO a Cintas hiring freeze came into affect. They had planned on creating a possition for me, but this was rejected by corporate during my move."
good,"The company expects a lot from you, and in return they will reward you for your efforts. Good company to work for!"
good,Great benefits offered.
good,"It was the best job I ever had. I had a good job, boss and manager for 5 1/2 years. That all changed when I got a new gm. He didn't like the fact that I was making as much as 2 sales reps and made it very clear to me that he didn't. I was a top performer nationally for Cintas and wish I was still there. Times change and so do companies. I have nothing bad to say about Cintas. They were good to me while I was there with the exception of my last gm."
good,"8 to 10 hour day, rewarding environment."
good,Great Company to work for. the biggest downside to this company is the pay.
good,Cintas was a wonderful place to work. It provided for my family and gave me lots of opportunity to move within the work place. It;s easier to move up if you have the College Education. Not moving up is what made me have to make a change m=for myself and family.
good,"Job, was overall good. Lots of traveling and seeing new sites/customers. Ability to work on your own throughout the day with manger support if needed."
good,Cintas is a great place to work. Management is very approachable and if you need anything to make your job more safe or easier they will gladly and promptly help you any way they can.
good,Great corporate culture. Company cares. Customer service oriented. Imparts decision-making capabilities at the lowest level possible. Hiring process is strenuous. Managers are well-trained in hiring and interviewing skills. Safety is paramount. Every employee is provided opportunities to be involved as much as each employee chooses. Early mornings and late nights.
good,"Cintas is a great place to work. Anybody has potential to move up in the company. Management always makes it known that is the goal they set themselves for their employees, is to succeed and move farther up in the company. The compensation for the company could use some improvement, but overall it's a great company to work for."
good,"The sky is the limit if you are willing to relocate. The culture is the best I have worked in personally. Some routes pay significantly better than others and are often left for the longer tenured employees. Unfortunately, you get what opens first and are often handed down a mess left for you to clean up. The job is secure but the pay structure is terrible. There is a pay plan which depreciates in commission value as you deliver more product. Essentially, the more work you do, the less you make later in the week. Upper management cares far more about adds over stops than whether or not the customer is satisfied."
good,Good company to work for  and great benefits. You will have chances to Advance in the company..Job culture is a great and the managment  is awesome to work for..
good,Overall the company is great to work for. The only drawback is the company really pushes contracts and numbers. If you have a local manager with any shady tendencies the stress of meeting these goals sometimes leads to the local manager asking you to do things you are not comfortable with to help numbers.
good,"Cintas made me feel like I belonged to the team since day one.  The culture is amazing! If you are young, energetic and a self starter, YOU WILL SUCCEED at Cintas!"
good,"The work consisted of sorting pre-packaged uniforms and putting them in boxes for shipment to customers. I learned how to make orders and fill out  the proper paperwork for each order. The management was always willing to help explain duties and solve problems. The staff was very diverse, and everyone worked well together with respect. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the time difference (it was an overnight shift job). The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my finished orders go on the trucks and out to customers."
good,"Hard work and dedication pays off with this company , I had a great time meeting new customers daily, the partners stuck together and overall all if I were given an opportunity to not travel around so much I would loved to stay with the company."
good,cintas is the best place to work for. the management is great the benefit is extent. most of all the hour is great. if you have any issue there is somebody always to help you.
good,Cintas is a great company to work for! The management and all the partners are nice and willing to help in anyway. The only downfall or me was all the driving (I thought I could handle it)!!
good,Cintas had a great culture and with excellent benefits. They offer training and guidance from managers. An overall great company to work for. I would recommend them.
good,"If you can navigate the ups and downs of an unpredictable GM and hang with office politics you can have a great and lucrative career. Bring your ""A"" game or don't apply."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phones, assisting customers and/or transferring to the correct individual who can assist them better. Help walk-in customers and take payments. Help technicians on the field with any information they may need. "
good,I started this job at the beginning of my college years. This company was flexible with my school schedule. The jobs are not hard and the pay is competitive.
good,when you get to work and usually load and verify that the trucks loaded with necessary products you need for the day. When ever you feel satisfied go ahead and start your route. Definitely learned about time management will running your own work.
good,"Great management and benefits, supervisors are extremely helpful. Great team enviroment, I would recommend Cintas to anyone who is looking for employment."
good,"This is a great job for people with no college background to still be able to succeed, great company. Benefits are excellent as well, alot of perks with 401k and insurance."
good,Lots to do and never a time to sit still but the best one to have.  People are nice to work with and help out needed.  upper management creates fun times to build up the culture and spirit of the company.
good,Cintas is a great company to work for if you're comfortable staying in one position but I don't recommend it if you desire to move up in the company for advancement.
good,"Hustle!  Work hard, be goal oriented and driven. High energy goes along way. Strong company culture too. Great compensation plan as well. You’ll get paid what you’re worth."
good,I loved the partners and the environment was so family like. Once you find the balance and stick with the job for a year you can easily work less then 40 hours. My only issue was the lack of communication with changes that impacted my family schedules. Money was great and benefit as well. I work on average 30 hours for a great salary.
good,I sort the clothes and put them in dryers and once they have dried i ship them to the folders.The mangers and co workers were great to work with.I would go back if given the chance.
good,"Very structured company. Great training program and ongoing training to ensure your personal success. Opportunity to make a lot of money."
good,"I really enjoying being an Account Rep here. I enjoy the people in my group, i like that no one is over your shoulder all day and have the confidence in knowing you will get the job done. The fast pace makes the day go by, especially when we have lunch-ins. I need something with more money and more hours"
good,I enjoy working here. I am looking for something with better pay in order to start my life on my own. Cintas has a welcoming atmosphere and i would reccomend working here to someone.
good,"I been at Cintas for almost nine years have experinces. This job taught me lot with training in other areas. Other I train was bulk area, shakeout, stockroom and cleaning."
good,Cintas has a great work culture and they are constantly trying to be better than they were yesterday. It has wonderful benefits and they appreciate their employees.
good,Great place to work. Plenty of opportunities to move up and great people. Management can be touchy with so many policies. Take care of employees. Ask a lot to do.
good,"First Safety Aid ,  put any new  material in any type of bag, cabinet, emergency bag  before send out to any business , shelf at any store place and game"
good,"Working at Cintas was fast passed. A typical day was meeting in the lunch room for morning stretches, then going to work at my work station, we had daily breaks. It is low pay; there is ability to move up within the company."
good,"love my job, it keeps me healthy, detail orientated, always learning about new aspects of the business and how they are all linked together. Love it here"
good,"Great corporate culture overall.  Pay was sufficient, but could have been better.  The incentive pay can seem unattainable due to lofty goal setting and unreasonable expectations.  Management is engaging, competent, and wants to do right by all employees."
good,"Company offers outstanding benefits, great culture, and excellent work life balance. local office culture can be better but overall a great company to work for."
good,"As an SSR (Sales Service Representative) there was a new experience every day, from personal interaction with customers to satisfying customer's needs. My main goal was to find the best possible outcome that benefited both the customer and Cintas. The job also gave me an added benefit of dealing and interacting with a vast variety of people from all levels of the workforce. Since every customers is unique and had specific needs, I was able to adapt to a multitude of scenarios to achieve customer satisfaction."
good,"Cintas is a major corporation who appreciates their employees. With bonuses and incentives and a true sense of seniority and teamwork I would recommend Cintas to anybody who is interested in Base + commission pay and likes numbers. Company is so team oriented they do not refer to employees as employees or coworkers, they refer to them as Partners because everybody is in it together as partners."
good,I worked directly for the GM and he was one of the best bosses I've had the pleasure of working for in my entire working career. The culture and office spirit is great. Overall the company is an awesome place to work. The only thing that could be improved upon would be compensation.
good,Great Company. Hard work but good people. you have to be able to multi task.  very fast pace if you want to do well. Culture is very good.  Best part of the job was the people you worked with and the interaction with customers.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. Many jobs available. Fun atmosphere, good management. Always room to grow if you want to. Plenty of stock options and pay Pac."
good,Company has great benefits  and equal opportunity  for everyone.All employees  must do their share of work per day and provide help to others if needed.Management helps out when needed.All employees work hard to meet costumers satisfaction.Cintas is #1 in being safe at work.
good,I really liked working for this company. They were very flexible with what was going on with my personal life. Was able to make up hours missed. Very understanding mangers and teamleaders as well.
good,"Cintas, specifically the location where I worked, was a fast paced growth minded company.  The culture is second to none and allowed partners to grow and move up in the company with the support of management."
good,"I honestly love this company. The culture is unmatched by any company I've seen. As long as you are self motivating and hard working. Never the same thing, it always changes."
good,"Cintas is a good place to work. For the most part, you get to work at your own pace as well as getting a 4 day work week. Makes it easy if you want to have another part time job or extra time for family and schooling"
good,"If I could get my position back as a Service Sales Representative, I would. Four day work week, salary plus commission and bonuses. Great benefits too. If they offered tuition reimbursements to employees or had an education initiative, they would be considered an elite company. Due to this, advancement is difficult and lower level partners become static in their respective positions. If they discover a way to motivate their lower level partners then employee morale and productivity would increase."
good,"The team is very productive and always seem to go above and beyond to meet goals and standards. The management team always finds was to reward us for our hard work (contests/cookouts) There is also good communication between supervisors, partners, shifts, and departments."
good,"Good job with great benifits but the pay itsnt good, they do provide the uniforms and clean them but thats it. they tend to show favoritism as well."
good,"Fast paced, career and customer driven team members, always striving for excellence and helping the location become successful in all areas of our business and culture"
good,With everyone as a partner everyone cared about the service and work they provided.  You were reworded for hard work and I was able to work with a very diverse group of people.
good,"Driving around in a box truck for a textile, uniform supper. Its a hourly plus commission job. Customer service is important as you deal with clients on a daily basis. Be prepared to handle hostile and unhappy customers. You will often have to deal with the companies shortcomings face to face."
good,"A typical day a Cintas is like your everyday factory job except all the people you work with know each other. It was nice to walk in everyday and people call you by your name and ask how you are doing."
good,"Great Partners to work with. Typical day started with checking work orders for the day, uploading to scanner, and then loading up vehicle with proper items. Perform daily safety checks on vehicle, and proceed with daily route. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the elements, ie. too hot and muggy or too cold. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work alone."
good,"Usual day starts with the client calls, including the status check, number of escalations, cross training of the existing employees on multiple domains."
good,"Cintas was great place to work. Great people, great training and great culture."
good,Every person who I either work with or communicate with at Cintas is very friendly and that is what makes my job enjoyable.

good,"Great place to work"
good,Invigorating company to be associated with. Very goal driven organization that promotes safety and values.
good,Distributed uniforms and business supplies
good,It was fairly laid back as long you got your job done. The management left you alone as long as you were productive. Overall it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"The production I do can be very tedious, but the environment around me is what kind of keeps it fresh. The coworkers overall are pretty friendly as well, so long as you are."
good,Great company. Strong Management. Opportunities for advancement. Good compensation structure for farmers and hunters. Solid admin and support staff at most locations.

good,Nice company to work for; low stress and freedom to do the job at your own pace; excellent company culture; great schedule for driver; decent pay; friendly atmosphere
good,"I enjoyed my time here and thought it was a great place to spend my time."
good,"The workplace culture here is awesome. Management does a great job at incorporating and recognizing everyone within the business, no matter which department you're in. Even though the corp office is in Ohio, the communication with all the staff there is at your finger tips."
good,Fast Paced Growing Company with room to Travel and Advance.   Learned to Cold Call at a higher level.  Perform Phone Blocks at a high rate.  Go for the close on the first meeting.
good,You have many chances to move up in the company. JUST LOOK FOR IT. It’s easy to work here 10 + years but you can always want more. Hopefully I’ll be a production manger .

good,"I worked in Cintas for one year, the company is great the down side for me was the kind of work I chose to do: Sanis Ultra Clean. (Sanitation of restrooms and Kitchens). I really tried hard to do that job because the company was great and the benefits were excellent but how I said my line of work there wasn’t what I wanted to do."
good,Full control over hours and workday. Could use higher commission structure since low base salary.......................................................
good,"great company to work for. people listen and work well with others."
good,Currently working as an assistant and have read the recent post. I have been promoted and find that this company offers many opportunities for personal growth. They do not rush you into a position for you to fail and ensure that you have the time and experience ready to take on the next roll.
good,"I had to move when my father passed, there was no position for me in Southern California. I was the top salesman they had and my customers loved me. It was great."
good,I have worked at Cintas for 6 years. You can easily start at the lowest position and move up quick. They create excellent work environment. And listen to all they're  partners concerns.
good,The SSR position is an extremely desirable position due to its flexibility and compensation for most routes. Career advancement is available but not many to choose from when moving up from your direct role.
good,fun pace to work at good and frieny people staff willing to work with schedule load and unload rucks from began to end working  holidays when needed good atmosphere
good,"Team oriented atmosphere, middle management very hands-on, very helpful. Very good training. computer-based and also a lot of role playing geared at overcoming objections in the field."
good,"My work day would begin arriving  20 minutes early  to prepare for the  work day. I would gather the necessary  garments  and tools  needed to fulfill  orders and  then I  would walk around the shop to find my supervisor and  greet him  ""good morning"".   I liked the fact that I was allowed to work unsupervised  knowing that my supervisor had faith in me to complete my work tasks daily.   I love working as a team player."
good,"Receive all incoming calls for 2 locations, resolve issue, oversee 20 route drivers at the end of day to confirm all issues were resolved. Cintas is a Military based hiring employer, they have very strict compliance company rules. I like that, you know where you stand. "

good,"If you are into kissing major you know what and driving on a dirt track, then this job is for you.  You will advance fairly quickly if you know how to kiss you know what.  You can even pass up seniored reps if you do it correctly and if you know how to get wasted on watered down american beer and drive in a circle on a dirt track then you are definitely a shoe in for supervisor.  Your wages will be less then sub par for the amount of work you do.  The managers will push numbers and sit behind a desk and tell you how to do your job.  They are so busy that they will lack in helping you.  So if all of this sounds great by all means apply away."
good,Cintas us a great company to work for its just in my recent experience tgd management is the WORST I'VE EVER SEEN! Tge management was almost fully ex-military and tried to run it as a base or training camp.

good,"I did my Ride along recently (SSR) and was absolutely impressed. Everyone I have come in contact with seem sincere, honest, and hard working. I have had three interviews, a test, and now a ride along. Reading these reviews it seems the culture/experience at Cintas is very dependent on your location. I have been in sales very many years (inside) and the opportunity to work outside servicing and adding sales is very appealing. Not to mention the four day work week."

good,"a job is a job the pay isnt great, the people are nice but the schedule is not flexable"
good,"Great company to work for.  There is plenary of opportunity to move around or move up if you’re willing to learn new things and go into a different department.  There is a lot of tenure at the company with employees that have been there up to 25+yrs, so job security is awesome.  Like many corporations management is sub par, not lower level management, but upper level."
good,Tried the job out straight of college and got a good taste of Herat the real world had to offer. I worked there and was able to maximize my potential.
good,The job itself is easy. I love the work that I do. However the pay rate could be better considering the amount of work you have to do. The manager's are nice but some of them show favoritism. Over all it's a nice place to work but the pay isn't great at all.
good,Overall! I love how diverse the work place is and how they keep the place clean. I appreciate how they allow you to job shadow every position available for you to try.
good,The benefits are phenomenal and the people who work there are very friendly. The Partners are like family. They have a lot of tenure in the company.  If you want stability and structure this is your place.

good,"They took over another uniform company. Everyone kept their time, pay...etc. The only downside was no picnics, no honorary club to get nominated to...still a great place to work."
good,If you can get into this place to work I highly recommend it.The manager is good and is out for his employees taking care of them and such. Ther is an open enrollment within this company for benefits and such that follow in October. Do not miss this day because you will have to wait another year.
good,not too bad its overall a good company. good culture and management. just a lot of work hours they tend to over work you a bit. but overall still a good company.

good,"Great company with a culture that embraces you from day one. Exceptional focus on safety and proactive when something happens to try and avoid it happening again. "
good,Decent job... managers could use more work. Some were rude and seem careless .. others cared and remain nice. Pays every week but not much if your starting out.
good,"1. Cintas is a great place to grow your career if you fit with each manager they promote. Some egos are large, & are not to be confronted, be proactive, stay ahead of new manager ego. you won't win.  Don't get emotionally hijacked."
good,"This position requires travel daily and requires some weekends and night shifts, but is typically fairly flexible. "

good,"Great job, team and great corporate culture, excellent pay & benefits.  There's a great deal of competitiveness amongst locations. You MUST meet your projections, and even if you do you will be mini micro managed. Showing initiative growing your client list, and exceed your expectations will not save you from being micro managed."
good,"Expectations are very high. Good pay, benefits."
good,"While working at Cintas, I have learned all different kinds of traits. I have also learned that Cintas treats their employees like family. I very much enjoyed working there and would love to work there again"

good,"Most Accounting positions at corporate, in Ohio."
good,"They were moving my job to corporate, which is located in Ohio and I was not in a position to relocate.  There were other jobs available for me at the time and the location I was working at."
good,Going to look at a local location to see if there is anything available.  Cintas helps it's partners to look to the future to see where they want to go not just to see what they currently are.
good,This is a great company for people coming out of college to work for. Their management trainee program is industry leading. They have phenomenal training programs and classes.

Overall this company taught me a lot of valuable skills that I will use for the rest of my life.
good,Working for this company has helped developed my professional skills. Being provided the opportunity to work with a broad range of experienced co-workers.
good,The best thing I can say is that I would work there again.  I left because of a ministry opportunity and took a large pay cut to do so.  They do a lot to train and compensate.
good,"Amazing sales organization to work for. World class sales training. Tough work life balance due to demanding sales expectations, however you will be well compensated when you deliver on those expectations."
good,"Being on time was a must,most of the employees there were good about being on time.The work assignments would be ready so when we arrive we could get straight to work..I thought that was cool.Cintas was very structured.Everyone new what their job was and we did it. Sometimes we would have potlucks which was fun because we were from different cultures,so we got to taste each other foods."
good,"The job was nice and all but the management was unfair Never was at the work place but maybe 2 Times out the week or leaving early. I felt like I was always there working 8-9 hours. Management took vacations more than anything. That was unfair.  Took off just for no reason. And where Cintas was located Inside of a hotel , the hotel employees were rude , just didn’t care about the uniforms and always was reporting you because u had to tell them about the policy"
good,"good place to work. Managers and supervisors were laid back and friendly. Enjoyed work first shift, enjoyed working Monday thru Friday. Managers were positive."
good,Easy job but you must be competitive and try to stay ahead of the curve. They do have high standards and each part of them must be met even if you are exceptional in one area.
good,"i enjoyed my time at cintas i have nothing bad to say about the company. They take care of their employees , located in great locations for easily moving state to state."
good,Great Company that continues to grow! The path to promotion is a challenge with this company. You always know where you stand from a performance standpoint.
good,"IT Was a great job. i liked the fact i could listen to my music as i rolled the mats up. i learned that majority uniforms was made and washed there. i did not really see too much management but the manager i had was a cool guy. The workplace was fair it had its long days but everyone said that when i started the work was done faster and everyone went home a little earlier if possible, so i felt accepted. It was never a hard part for me honestly i liked and enjoyed going to roll the mats everyday. I most certainly like to matt roll because i had my music hyping me up to work faster. i do wish i could of drove routes!!"
good,"- Go on 16+ self generated face to face appointments per week."

good,great company to work for very friendly. strict on rules safety is key.
good,"I would get to work around 0430, grab the load list and load the truck with the uniforms, rugs, and other items for the day. I would then drive the route for the day delivering clean uniforms, rugs, etc.. and picking up the dirty ones to bring back to the factory. I learned a lot about customer service and managing a work load. I drove with one other person and we split work between us. It was a very physical job and had many different customers and routes. I enjoyed being out on the road and dealing with all the customers."
good,come in to work and stretch.. management was great when I first started.. coworkers were great to  worked hard everyday off on weekends and the pay was every week

good,"Work hard play hard, always pushing you to do better.  If you put in the time the juice is worth the squeeze.  Market 460 is an incredible place to work."
good,Maintenance Tech is a very fast and demanding job. Plenty to learn and implemented in future project with little supervision. As long as preventive maintenance is done in a proactive way there should be little downtime. Waste water was a very demanding job that you need to keep up in an hourly basis
good,"Cintas as whole is a great company, benefits were great especially the stock option. Location management changed which changed the culture, more profit driven than taking care of the partners."
good,Overall no complaints really enjoyed working there. Would love to work there again Given the opportunity. Great company great benefits. Management was easy to work with overall great experience I have no complaints at all and would love to work there again.

good,"Set customers to see every month with ability to refer new customers for your route."
good,"Working at Cintas was a very enjoyable experience. Like all other corporate entities, there is the likelihood of getting lost in the great sea of employees."
good,"My review is base don a time when the GM for the location was near retirement, and stuck to the ""we done for 30 years"" attitude, and decide who and how your career advanced. Since the GM has retired and I have remained good friends with a number of key management I worked with during my time, and hear great things about the new leadership at the top."
good,"Productive, great people that I worked with,good job to have.Once you have a route, and get to know your customers everything gets better. Keeps u busy"
good,"Great company, great pay and benefits. Unusual industry but fast paced and competitive. Work life balance tends to struggle at times. Career advancement opportunities in a growing organization."
good,"Management was awesome, the inspection department has a great group of guys that were like family. Willing to assist each other at the drop of the hat, not (1) negative thing to say about Cintas or the Partners. It was awesome to be apart of a great group of people. Truly will be missed"
good,Cintas has been a fantastic employer throughout my near 6 years of Partnership.  Time came to mutually part ways. It’s very easy to move up within the company.
good,The culture at Cintas displayed a lot of care and appreciation for the workers and their safety. I was on safety committee when I worked at Cintas and they even went to the extent of training everyone how to perform CPR later becoming CPR certified. They always encouraged their workers to help with making the workplace a safer environment by rewarding those that had great ideas. They always made you feel like a part of the team.
good,productive and fast paced work environment. good place to work with excellent benefits. weekends off very friendly people and i would highly recommend this company
good,"Start the day early and make sure everything is working and properly loaded. Go to each stop and deliver uniforms, mats, ect. Come back after route drop off trucks check in and clock out."
good,"Great company, Good benefits. great Corp. Culture(At location level)."
good,Solid company with a great vision.  Falls short on work/life balance for service managers. Compensation is a mixed bag.  Great opportunity for the right person.  Expect to work hard everyday.
good,"Working there was a great,  Vehicle were badly used and felt unsafe at times.  but unfortuanetly I had a death in the family and had to leave the state."
good,"A typical work day at Cintas, includes a lot of driving, lifting, and paperwork. You deternine how long or short your workday will be based upon the pace that you work at. You have to very detailed and safety oriented. The hardest part of the job is working and driving in all types of weather conditions. There is a lot of room for growth."
good,"The company itself is very good. "
good,I enjoyed the company and would go back and work anytime its a factory that cleans uniforms and service different companies around the world they are very professional. The company gives paid vacation time and you get sick hours as well the benefits are amazing.

good,fun place to work.love having evenings off. can get pretty tough during price increase times but overall terrific place to work. great pay and benefits too!
good,"I love my job and my coworkers! I've learned that the customer comes first. My day starts by hanging shirts, pants and jackets then I scan them in for them to be processed and ready for them to be delivered to the customer. Management is great. Wonderful place to work."
good,Awesome place to work. Excellent training program as well as leadership. Each year leadership sits down with you and reviews your individual development plan to advance your career within the organization. Training program focuses on the sales process and the necessary steps in order to get the desired outcome. Hardest part of the job is hitting your sales quota but they give you all the tools and training you need to hit it every fiscal year. As a sales representative they give you quite a bit of freedom.
good,"Fast paced, not for the lazy, pay is decent, but work is back breaking."
good,"As an SSR I work a 4 day work week and service our existing customers.  It is very physical, fast-paced, indoor/outdoor position in which the SSR delivers and picks up uniforms, shop towels, chemical cleaning products, and other rental products. SSRs are the face of Cintas to the customers and must work to build rapport with key decision makers, ensure quality standards, and pro-actively solve customer concerns."
good,"Company was great to work for. Start at 1:30 pm, finish at 10:00 pm. Lots of driving in bad traffic. Management was great. I enjoy my co-workers a lot. The best part of the job is pay day.The hardest part is no over time. I learned how to work as a team."
good,This was the best employer that I've ever had.  CEO and COO would eat lunch in the cafeteria with the production partners at the corporate location and treated them as equals.  Cintas knows how to treat the people that work there and that it is a team effort to get jobs done.  My only regret is leaving for a job closer to home that treats their employees terrible.

good,"The global supply chain is organized around strategic sourcing, planning and new product development. Training and continuous improvement are priorities for the organization. Management is very professional and capable. Co-workers are among the best in the industry due to meticulous hiring practices.  The most difficult part of the job is trying to create a more competitive supplier environment among many sole source suppliers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers and suppliers."
good,Great job gotta love to work learned to work in a warehouse and learned to run all machines and work with great co workers the hardest part bout my job is they don't pay enough for employees so they leave alot so keeping workers is hard the most enjoyable part of my job is working with a great crew.

good,"Here at Cintas, our workday starts early but gives us an opportunity to maximize face time with our valued customers. While working here I've learned the true definition of customer service and what it means to put the customer first. The hardest part of this position is time management and prioritization. It definitely takes a bit of trial and error but in time, it comes naturally as it is a vital part to do the job successfully. Once you find your way in the roll, the advancement opportunities are endless and the sky is the limit in terms of what positions you may seek."
good,Company provided great benefits and good pay.  Managers weren’t always responsive and it is hard to promote  in general I wish I had never left this company

good,"Working at cintas was a good experience i say to learn what a big company job is, the people there are nice and everyone stays productive . Being at this company you have choices to move up in positions when your working at the warehouse .

good,Conservative company and slow to make decisions but amazing culture! The culture and mission drive the company and they are very intelligent about strategic decisions.

good,Liked working there. Super nice people. Work hours were the best with most weekends off. I liked the fast pace of the job with the department I was in.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Cintas, the only thing I would say that could improve would be the work life balance. I will take some blame for my not balancing it out myself as I was very driven and was working towards advancements. The most enjoyable part of my job at Cintas was working in a true team environment and with a great group of people! The hardest part of my job there was managing a team that I once was part of as a representative. I did know I was working towards the manager position so I was sure to maintain a professional and positive relationship with my co-workers but there were some who probably felt as though the promotion may have belonged to them versus me."
good,"out going, energetic, enthusiastic, proactive, before punching out on Friday to go home we had some fun by shooting a basket ball through the hoop, and win some small prices."

good,"Great place to work.  ""Family"" type environment.  Great benefits.  Was purchased by Stericycle and most of the local office positions were eliminated."
good,There are definitely great benefits to this job.  Even more so if you get lucky enough to make it to management where they get paid expenses and money for their cars etc.
good,"Excellent company, excellent compensation - poor decisions are consistently made regarding local leadership selections. This has been a historical issue for the company and they do not seem to have the vision to address this concern for the benefit of the working partners."
good,"Is a great company that you can work for, definitely flexible with your schedule. The service side of the company gives you one day in the week off and you work for 10 hour days, and if you work in the plant you work five 8 hour days but you start early in the morning and are off at 2:30 leaving leaving plenty of time in the afternoon for personal business or other means. The culture is very professional and theres a frown upon bringing in personal problems into the work place, although some might find this a problem because they wish to have friendships with their coworkers, sympathizing and empathizing I tend to personally wanna leave my really personal business at the door and arrive to work with only work in mind. Most are this way and watch their demeanor for the most part at work making it easier to deal with one another keeping a professional environment."
good,"●  Van delivery service"
good,Cintas is a great company to work for but when they say that they only promote from within it is a lie. They would always say that they wanted to promote people from the warehouse to a route driving position and they would interview the people interested from the warehouse and then hire someone from the street to do the job. After 2 years and being almost the last person left in the warehouse from when i started who had not quit or gotten fired i was always getting the run around about being promoted. I interviewed for a route position 4 or 5 times and they would always tell me that I was needed in the warehouse more at the time and if I left then they would get behind. So they never let me move up. After a year of this I grew tired of it
good,Growth opportunity for the right person. Executive leadership courses are second to none. You must be aligned with senior leadership to succeed
good,"Just image what your laundry smells like on your worst day after sitting in a garbage bag in the sun for a week. Now times that by 1,000 and that is what to have to drive with in the back of your truck all day. Each day you were in a location and meeting new people. Trying to collect money from unpaid accounts was one of the hardest thing to do. The only way you were able to get a bonus in your check was if you were able to convince an account to add more to there order or to buy an extra floor mat, logo jackets or promo items. It was all about sell, sell, sell. You were a golden employee if you were able to get a definite sale lead or ever convince a customer of one of our competitors to switch their services to us. You had to live, breath and bleed Cintas. They encouraged you to miscellaneously walk into businesses while you were off the clock, on vacation, hanging with friends or family and use there bathrooms and scope out possible new customers. There were companies that would rely on us bringing their uniforms or supplies to them but because of issues with the early morning delivery to our facility, we would be short or the clothes would not be up to pare.  Dealing with the disgruntle customer that you needed to collect money from was not easy."
good,"During my time with Cintas I was able to work my way up to lead person, which meant that I was responsible for the route trucks being loaded perfectly. I also was in charge of keeping a safe work environment which included housekeeping."

good,it was a new learning experience and they gave me the chance to grow more as an individual. the management and co-workers always worked as a team.

I wasn't necessarily trying to advance that quickly but my work ethic was noticed by management and positions were offered to me. I may have lucked out at my location because I think all the managers were fantastic with the exception of one, but I didn't work on his shift. They really care about helping the employees succeed as long as you show the desire to.  The benefits are better than any company I've worked for by far. They adhere to a meticulous hiring process so expect to be interviewed 4 times. Everyone is like a family. The turnover is low. I can't think of a negative thing to say."

good,"Cintas has its ups and downs, like any other job. it can become very repetitive, however you are often faced with new challenges to complete your work of the day. I've learned to always have a solution for any problems whether it be shortages or a customer being closed or even covering a shift. This can be a tough place to work at when starting, but it does get easier as time goes on. The staff are very welcoming and easy to get along with. The management team can be very helpful and are always open to discuss any issues or concerns."

A great company for the career minded person. I highly encourage anyone wanting to grow with a company that has a family atmosphere approach, to apply there."
good,"Cintas is responsible for getting my career in management off the ground and has shaped me into the professional that I am today. If you don’t want to work hard, this isn’t the place for you. Cintas challenges its employees to get the most out of the talent they have. The culture is specifically defined and they do well to ensure that every partner lives it. Cintas rewards excellence and works with partners who need a bit more coaching to reach their full potential."
good,"Nice place to work  good people to work with   Great friends too.  Love my job "
good,Typical day starts with ordering daily work and checking for new items coming in. Checking emails and starting audits. I enjoy checking the garments for defects and problem solving.

good,Cintas is a safety first clean working environment the employees there treat you with respect and make you feel appreciated. They taught me a lot about caring for other in the work place and how important safety is. Management was very helping and showed appreciation to their employees.
good,I worked at the plant in etobicoke for nearly 2 yrs and only left because I moved home. I  loved my time there. Great bunch of lads to work with. Really supportive management team. Great opportunities to earn extra money through promos etc. I would strongly recommend Cintas to anyone.
good,"Although it takes a while to get it the door, the job and benefits are worth the wait. If you focus on the job at hand and putting the customer first you will have no problem. In my department, putting the customer first didn’t set well. That means late lunch and missed breaks, which I where willing to do, but you can’t out due management because that makes them look bad. In conclusion when you start, stick to yourself because at the end of the day, they don’t really care. I’m"
good,"Cintas has a tremendous work life balance, and phenomenal benefits. The people you work with are great everyone is working towards the same goal. Company culture is what makes Cintas so successful."

good,Delivering uniforms to customers. Also other products that are needed and that cintas may sell.  Helping other departments as needed. Very safe and healthy
good,"From my experience, Cintas is one of the few true meritocracies out there: you get promoted based on your record, although corporate politics does play some role in some cases. It's hard work, but rewarding.  Not being a college graduate is not an impediment to advancement; ex: my division president did not have a degree. Cintas does try to strike a work-life balance, but customers always come first. There are plenty of opportunities to max your pay though uncapped commissions and performance bonuses."
good,"nice place of employment, great people, nice location, great environment. excellent culture. good hours, breaks, with lunch breaks  .  understanding management"
good,I enjoyed my job with Cintas.  I learned a lot about safety.  I learned a multiple parts of the job in different areas.  I enjoyed the culture and the people were friendly.
good,"My typical day at Cintas is great! I recently received the lead production position in Sorts. I've been with the company now for three years on June 28. I've learned that some decisions that you make or implicate as a leader, other coworkers will not like, but that's just apart of being the lead position in Sorts. Management awarded me the lead position because they said that they could definitely see me being more than just a worker; as in they see me doing the manegerial position. I would have to say a hard day of work at Cintas would be having a heavy workload of clothes to sort and to manage while making final decisions on how things will be done. The enjoyable part of my job is accomplishing and exceeding my productions goals for that day and the week."
good,"Good place to work, great benifits, great work/home balance, promotes within the company, very professional. Management is fair as well as understanding."
good,Great place to grow with. Communicatii. A pkus. Great environment great staff understanding team learning to the max would recommend this job to anyone

good,Cintas was a very helpful for me and I learn a lot of skills as being a sales manager I would recommend Cintas to anyone that wants to be employed with them I just had to pursue my education and put the best foot forward and keep moving forward with my career.
good,"I enjoyed working at Cintas and wish I never left. The work was at times very physical and heavy but since I learned how to do different jobs, I enjoyed the ability to move around and not do the same thing every day. I got three raises in a year and overall I liked the people I worked with and I liked the job. The only problem I have is that I put in my two weeks and stopped working 3 days early to go work at another job that was promised to me; the owner of my new company would not answer his phone the day I was supposed to start. I never got the new job and now I lost my good job at Cintas that I worked hard at but now I can't go back since I didn't finish the full two weeks when I quit there."
good,"Great and fun place to work and very hands on and is very enjoyable every day you enter the building, and safety is one of their keys to success and I wouldn't consider leaving"
good,"Long days at work sometimes heavy lifting required"
good,Cintas is a great place to work! I love working here. Management is incredible. You can move up the chain very easily.  They have a wonderful training program and upper management is so helpful!
good,Staff and management were so helpful and even gave me great reviews when I had to abruptly transfer out of state. Yet the new team was just as awesome!!
good,The culture at this company is unbeatable. People are always nice and willing to help. it's a professional environment with down to earth people. perfect balance.

good,"Outside sales representative responsible for acquiring new business and maintaining an elaborate database profile of all prospects in the South Dallas Area.  I was hired to utilize my diverse military leadership abilities, customer service experience and bilingual skills to gain market share in a niche market. I conducted both formal and informal presentations for small, medium and large size customers.  I was responsible for marketing to both my small and mid-size markets with mailers, ad campaigns and referral awards."

good,I loved my time at Cintas. The hours and days I worked were best for me and I would love to be a part of Cintas again. I enjoyed everything about Cintas.
good,The Cintas culture is unlike anything You’ve ever expierenced before. The management team holds you to high standards and helps you get there. They do list of their promotions from within. The train you well enough to leave and treat you good enough to make you want to stay. They are such a big company which leaves tons of room for advancement and relocation.
good,Everyone was a team player. Easy job to do. Management was the best I have ever had. Very clean and well kept housekeeping. A lot of work passing through but no problems to meet goals.
good,"Cintas is a great job to work at. Management is extremely friendly and patient, The employees are helpful and the hours are always set so you can still spend time with family."
good,"a typical day for me would be going to my work area at Cintas collecting any garments that needed to be repaired, and after that was done i sorted other garments that needed to be repaired load and unload along with various other duties throughout the warehouse."
good,"good place to work and grow your carrier , provided me good experience with various aspects of a corporate environment, i would deffinately work for them if i have a chance again."
good,Great work life balance. Awesome opportunities for advancement. Cintas offers great medical benefits and retirement 401k. I have very much enjoyed my time here at Cintas.
good,If had the opportunity for another supervisor position would take it. As long as it didn't pertains to office work. I have more skills in that area to conduct business.
good,"Great Experience and training.  Great sales training and leadership.  Fun, fast passed, exciting work environment that rewards hard work and success."
good,"The goal is to make 55-65 unique customer contacts per day from your own list of assigned accounts.  Bi-weekly you work the top ten accounts in the 120,90 60 and 30 day buckets and then have a conference call every two weeks with the sales managers and your direct supervisor to discuss the progress of those accounts that have not been resolved and what is needed to move the accounts along to getting resolution.  The work is not difficult and you are not micro-managed, but the biggest challenge is getting the accounts set up with the correct contact information and making sure the customer is using the correct remit-to information for our division as each Cintas division has it's own remit-to address and bank account even though the our name may show the same on the invoices.  This causes a lot of confusion and customers who have many different Cintas services tend to pay for all of them under on address which causes multiple payment researches that have to be done.  I really enjoy managing my own accounts and knowing that if I I need time off or I run a little late due to an accident or unforeseen circumstances that all I need to do is call my supervisor and then just make up the missed time."
good,"Very rewarding company to work for. Demanding schedule but manageable. There are plenty of opportunities to advance but you have to be willing to relocate. Headquarters is in Cincinnati, OH if your looking to make it a career."
good,"my opinion is always start your day happy and ready."
good,"From the salary to the 4 day work week to the free benefits to monthly lunches and most importantly the amazing people that made everyday working there one of the most enjoyable work experiences of my life. You'll be hard pressed to find a better work environment with a first-class organization that really cares for their employees (and shows it everyday) like Cintas. I worked at the south Etobicoke location for almost a year but had to leave for personal reasons. Otherwise, I would proudly still be working and looking to retire there."
good,"Fun, team work, hard workers, open door policy, management easy to talk and understanding... incentive program jus a fun company to work for...I enjoy"

Followed by Policies and Procedures that are implemented and constructed which are applied by Management right on down to the employees ( which are referred to as ""partners"")(How inviting is that?!).

The managers really care about every partner that works in the plant.  Hardest parts of the job are initially learning how to do the task you're assigned to, but once you get into the swing of things, it's very simple.

good,My duties at the beginning of work bring in all dirty product and start throwing dirty product in washers. Management is nice and helps with any questions i have about work. My coworkers are very hard workers. The hard part about work is when it's holiday schedule. I enjoy work everyday cause i get along with all my coworkers and supervisors.
good,"A typical day at work started at 6am, first thing me and my coworkers did was stretch and flex and I was the garment grader so I put back the graded garments so that orders can be filled. I learned a lot through this company, they take care of their partners on a daily basis and make sure that we know what's going on day to day. Management was a good group and Supervisors as well. I really cant say their is a hard part of the job because its not a hard job, fairly easy and understandable. Most enjoyable part would be when the partners got together once a month at Cintas and we had a partner luncheon.  I have received partner of the quarter twice in one fiscal year, I was recognized by trophies and a newsletter with pictures and a little bit about my work and what I enjoy to do outside of work."
good,"A typical day always had data entry daily from the SSR's with customer request's including changes to existing supplies; ordering uniforms for new employee's; any changes needed to assist the customer's daily. Other data entry would come from the corporate office to be in compliance. Keying in New Accountants, giving an install date for when the customer would receive uniforms and supplies, depending on what the customer needed. Daily worked with all departments: Service team; accounting team; all management; sales team; on occasion would discuss matter's with the GM. I was the all around. Depending on the minute would depend what hat I wore. I would assist co workers and customer's in solving matter on some days. The company did except two of my implements in organizing one being the files so co-workers would be able to find the contracts (assets) with ease. Assisted in organizing the truck files. Helped with the audit process. The hardest part of my job was leaving work on my desk for the next day. I really wouldn't say any part of my task's were hard more along the lines of time consuming, Throughout my day I would assist co-worker's and customer's which to me helping was the most enjoyable part of my day. Having the ability to assit in someone's day to make their day go smoothly. No problem, I'll get right on that, I'm here to help, these are statements I would make throughout my day to those who asked for my assistants."

good,"Being appointed to this environmental protection position inspired me to further my career and become a full-time EH&S professional. Responsibilities included but not limited to being the plant liaison for design and rebuild of more safe and complaint wastewater distribution systems and install safe work practices. This recommendation would require Cintas to maintain water-use data on at least a monthly basis, and to make that information available to TCEQ staff upon request. Water contamination findings in terms of fines ranged from $50 – $25,000. Basic steps to develop technically based local limits (TBLLs) were determining this included determine pollutants of concern, collect and analyze wastewater data, calculate maximum allowable loadings to the wastewater treatment plant, calculate maximum allowable industrial loadings, and allocate the resulting TBLLs according to parts per million gallons. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance documents show how to complete each step. I would meet with the safety department three times per week to identify concerns associated with the newly appointed plant safety committee concerning inspections, equipment maintenance schedules, LOTO, and risk assessments. The safety committee would meet with client personnel guided by preformed safety walks throughout the plant to ensure compliance with project safety goal of “ZERO INCIDENTS, RECORDABLES OR HARM TO THE ENVIORNMENT.” This was accomplished to encourage training and retraining to reduce turnover."

I learned how to work in production and customer services such as invoicing, accounts receivable, bookkeeping, and collections. Management are very professional and willing to help. Co-workers help one another by doing hot shots and working closely with Sales department.

good,"This is a great company! Good people, good bussiness. Really cares about all of their employees and clients."
good,"A typical day was going to work and Unloading/loading 30+ trucks, I learned that this kind of job is extremely physically demanding and you must be willing to work hard at all times to gain the respect of your peers and fellow employees. You must give 110 percent at all times in this job because its swing shift from 2 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. but you cannot leave until all the trucks are unloaded and loaded because the next morning all the trucks have to leave and go deliver all the products so if it took you 15 hours to get done then thats how long you have to stay to finish. The management was ok they had two very young leads run the shop there which was not a very good idea because they picked the employees they liked and didnt make them work as hard as the employees they didnt like, I tried to tell management a couple times and it never really got fixed so I just minded my own business and worked hard at all times. A majority of my co-workers were very nice and some werent such as the leads of the company which they had alot of power to make alot of the co-workers rude to each other. The hardest part of the job was the whole job because we were unloading and loading 1000+ pounds of uniforms and garments each day and it is so physically demanding on your body that when you go home your whole body hurts so you have to stay in shape and eat right when working at this job. The most enjoyable part is that the management is very good about giving the employees free lunches alot of times, they have employee appreciation week where its a whole week of activities such as throw a pie in"

good,"start the day with a little morning workout, write out your route tickets, the hit road. management were awsome people"
good,"While working at Cintas, my managers gave me multiple opportunities to prove to them that I was a great addition to their company. I found that the management staff was always willing to listen to what I had to say on any topic involving the operations of the plant and the people who worked there. A typical day at work would start with setting up my area for the day, talk with my supervisor to see if their was anything special that I needed to do during the day, and then going about with whatever job needed to be done that day. While working at Cintas, I learned to develop my ability to manage my time on a project, to manage the people that worked under me in regards to what they were to do on any given day."
