rating,review
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Arrogant management & employees.  In constant cut back mode.  Stay away. Benefits keep getting worse, raises are minimal if at all etc"
bad,Taking a job at ATI has been my biggest regret.  This company only wants employees that will keep doing everything the same way its been done for 30 years. There is no consistency in any HR policy.  Employees are not treated fairly.
bad,"ATI has shown that corporate greed is rampant in the United States . The workers agreed to keep one old strip mill running while working overtime to get a new one up and running . After working ridiculous hours to help the company out , they locked us out. While claiming losses which caused their demand for raping our contract , they gave themselves millions of dollars in bonuses . If there was a zero rating for what this company has become I would have chosen that. What had been a great place to work has been so corrupted by greed that the union AND salary workers are disgusted !"
bad,My memories of working at the ATI helpdesk were not good. There was 8 workers shoved into a closet with no windows expected to not talk and work. The problem was that there wasn't enough work to go around.
bad,I worked an X-ray where I did not said in with my coworkers I had plenty of experience previously and after false accusations And finger pointing I was let go Management did nothing to look into whether or not what was said about me with true
bad,"Stressful environment, management cares more about safety numbers then the employees, the morale is terrible, management pushes down changes without accounting for how it will affect employee morale or if the changes made will hurt productive. The insurance was good but has been replaced in the last few years with a high deductible plan that requires you to meet the deductible prior to any portion being payed by the plan."
bad,work was hard and long rotating shifts in virement was always dusty or Smokey had constant disorder the work was straining  the hours were long with no respect for how hard you worked or the quality of work you tried to pass on to co worker
bad,"ATI are fairly good payers, however beyond that I cannot recommend working there."
bad,"A good company name to have on your resume and that is it.  Expected to and forced overtime.  The culture is throw you under the bus while walking on eggshells. New Upper management has no idea how to turn around company creating a high employee turnover at every level throughout company.  Favoritism and nepotism are ruining the company.  Will probably be bought out.  Would only recommend short timer looking for a couple years experience to pad resume.  But beware,  put your armor on be ready to defend yourself everyday while being micromanaged."
bad,"Terrible culture based on fear, in an all boys club old school thinking.  A cut throat environment.  Systems are from antiquity, literally still using matrix printers on green lined paper!  Management spends all day in meetings"
bad,"I have learned a lot working in raw materials; however, I do not like working night shift and there are many differences between my work ethics and other's work ethics."
bad,"The job itself is stable but there is a major lack of management and organization with in the company. My particular department has little to no supervision, little to no guidance, and equipment that never seems to work right. Not a horrible job or place to work, great if you like shift work, just not for me."
bad,"Very hostile environment. The jobs are not bad, but the managerial staff is horrible. Favoritism and discrimination abound. Contractual agreements are viewed differently in different situations."
bad,"Looks and sounds like a great place to work. The absolute opposite of a team environment. I am paid fairly but that is the only pro. Management is clueless, nobody follows any procedures, lack of training is the worst I have seen in many years. You have to beg for training which shouldn't be the case but it is. Also the information flow is terrible. Nobody passes any info and then just plays the blame game. Apply at your own risk!!!!!!!! You have been warned!!!!!!"
bad,would not advise anyone go there to work they do not care about older employees. Fired for making a mistake on the computer said I committed fraud let me go because I made a computer error
bad,I was forced to resign because the air quality was poor and made me ill. I got occupational asthma from working at ATI.  I had several doctors tell me I needed to resign.
bad,"Only way to move up is to suck off someone. If you are in a union better learn to deep throat. Because otherwise, you will have no work life balance, and they will hold a better schedule above your head and talk down to you like children."
bad,"Been working here for about 3 years. The job is not hard to do if you have common sense. What makes it hard is the management team/supervisor they have in here. Supervisors do not comunícate properly between each other so they do not know what's going on with the shift. The schedule can change at any time. There is alot of favoritism. No chance for career advancement but the pay is reasonable. Like I said the job is not difficult to do but, management needs to be managed possibly properly trained."
bad,"There is rampant discrimination between management and its hourly employees, so much so that most are afraid to speak up about this and is only said in whispers. Upper management and at the executive levels have no idea what they are doing yet publish flowery rhetoric to fool everyone that business is good. Waste and inefficiency are common place."
bad,"2 tier contract creates animosity. Most new hires in maintenance leave within a year. OK if you need a job while looking for a better one. Not a long term place. You will have NO VACATION and no life while having Teir1 guys that are paid way more than you tell you ""What a great place its is"".."
bad,"long days, long hours, pay is below market status, healthcare went down the drain, if your looking for someone to give them a great review that will not be me...they bring in these young managers that have no people skills or respect for the actual works."
bad,"I was an intern at ATI, and within my first 3 weeks my mentor and about 30 others were laid off. After that I noticed the high expectations from the President that didn't match the reality of being able to produce quality products. During our ""Summer Celebration BBQ"", we were given 45 minutes to cram some cheap and cold hot dogs and hamburgers down before returning to work. Never felt safe after the lay off, and watched multiple people leave the company as a result."
bad,"Good money for the work, however long shifts, disorganised from the top down. No respect for employees or recognition. Very little progression from lower level roles. Too many middle management types. Blame culture from senior management down to shop floor"
bad,"Company has the ""old"" mentality and will never change. All aspects of the company cycle with the market, along with the employees' careers and pay."
bad,ATI treats its employees very poorly. The environment is toxic. The turnover rate is very damaging to the company. I do not recommend ATI to anyone. I don't know how they manage to get product out the door.
bad,3 rd shift management ruins this place. They act like your lying when something breaks. And like your stupid when you mess up. They older supervisor cusses at you and the younger one talks to you like you are dumb and with no respect.  There are known drug addicts. Who they like better then the employees they do there job. It is job if you don't have one but not a place to make a career out of.
bad,Over the last few years management has decreased some salaried employee benefits and increased costs to salaried employees for other benefits such as health care.
bad,"As a electron beam operator hired off the street, I was expecting what management and had said, a professional, safe, team oriented environment. Exactly oposite, worst case of the inmates running the asylum I've ever seen. If your not a loudmouth drunk don't expect to fit in"
bad,Could be a good place to work for some but not a place to work if you enjoy time with your family.
good,average place to work in a small town company work enviornment is ok not that good
good,The only way they believe they can make money is by taking it from their employees.  Very sad and disappointing.  They are taking an excellent facility and removing all the incentives to work there.
good,"There are lots of good people that work at ATI."
good,"you never know if you are going home when you show up for work.  Scheduled typically six or seven days a week, and usually forced to work at least one double a week."
good,People on the shop floor production staff and workers  were easliy approachable and easy to work with.  Mamangement is changing to be more organized as ATI
good,"There is consistently work to be done, so I would consider it relatively free from lay offs, but the company does not allow for work / life balance."
good,"Needs all new management ,the place could have been good ,but it set up to fail ,not  a bad place if it was ran like it should be ,no one cares about the workplace ,cause management don’t care"
good,ATI is not for everyone.  The training was slim.  If you don't have previous experience in the metal business do not apply.  Make sure you see industry salaries before accepting offer.
good,"12 hour day rotating shifts."
good,Culture is changing.  Beginning to be very difficult to maintain work/life balance due to recent staffing reductions.
good,Learned to be adaptable in moments of crisis. The ability to work with people with different experiences and knowledge background was a great learning experience for me as i learned different methods to approach a problem
good,very long hours and little to no family time. Management was very horrible they played a lot of favorites. the on the job training is also horrible management pushes employees to train as fast as possible which could in turn cause injuries or worse.
good,"Overall a pretty good place to work if you have worked in manufacturing. It’s hot and dirty but the pay scale isn’t terrible. However they continue to cut benefits and wages, and personally i don’t think they value their employees."
good,"This was a great place to work.  Unfortunately the Midland plant was closed and hundreds of jobs were lost with it.  I thought I was going to retire from this place but now it is deserted.  The corporate management is awful.  They crammed their hot mill into a little town in Brackenridge, PA where they had to spend millions more than if they would have just built it in Midland, where they had over 100 acres of unused land right next to the Ohio River.  Instead, they bought a bunch of single family homes and leveled an entire neighborhood to cram it into Brackenridge.  The dumbest decision anyone's ever made."
good,"Good benefits, Good people little direction, lack of future vision constantly changing, lots of continuous improvement opportunity, interaction between multiple depts. and division is a daily task"
good,"No job security, many layoffs, and plants shutting down. Great coworkers what is left of them.  I would not recommend working at ATI due to the poor business conditions."
good,"Grueling schedule and very intense atmosphere with lots of production deadlines. Safety really wasn't priority, very dirty and noisy environment."
good,ATI is a very innovative company with lots of growth potential. They are constantly improving their footprint in the aerospace industry an also in the healthcare sector.
good,Viel gelernt über die amerikanische Geschäftskultur
good,"Specialty metals company headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA. Overall a good company to work for. They offer competitive benefits and depending on the department you work in, there are opportunities for growth."
good,"The GM was a good guy to work for, but the organization is growing rapidly and reorganizing.   The veterans were not open to change, making for an uncomfortable work environment for the new hires."
good,Very fast paced environment but also very rewarding...  From the time you arrive until you leave you need to be focused. Very rewarding when thing go well.
good,ATI is a conglomerate of companies swallowed up by Allegheny Technologies. where i worked increasingly got worse every year for the twelve years that i worked there.
good,Good pay. Company is pretty much ran by Human Resources. They have no real knowledge or understanding of how the manufacturing process takes place so they are basically incompetent due to this fact. You're just a number at best.
good,I work 12 hour shifts 9 to 9 days can be long but productive.  I learned a lot when it comes to safety and performing my daily job duties safely and accordingly.
good,Great company if you are looking to stay in one company. Quality and safety are mainstays of the company and management. Continuous investment in new equipment and new technology.
good,Great company if you are looking to stay in one company. Quality and safety are mainstays of the company and management.  Continuous investment in new equipment and new technology.
good,It's union so be careful and make sure that you save up enough money so if the go on strike you can live till you go back to work. A strike is the reason that I left.
good,Its a good company to work for but it is union so you never know if they are going to go on strike. If that happens you do not get paid and that could be very bad for some people
good,"I worked at the Coon Valley facility, in the quality assurance department. It was a laid back place to work, but was not for me."
good,Unilateral displeasure with how the Labor Dispute had a trickle down effect on all employees.  Difficult place to be employed over the past 12 months.
good,ATI is a great place to start a career. Sales at this company is fun and teaches an individual team work. A typical day starts off with free breakfast and coffee and you're already motivated to start working. Throughout the day you make calls and send out e-mails.
good,"Great Leaders at the plant level , the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know a lot of people. typical work day 8-5"
good,"Great people and management, but the schedule can be a lot of hours with little extra compensation. Overall enjoyable work environment."
good,Used to be a great company to work for.  The environment has gone south.  Much of this is thanks to government policies.  The people who work for ATI are excellent.
good,"Hard working environment, Early starts centred around 12 hour shifts Nights and days.Worked predominately on my own as part of a team."
good,I have enjoyed my time working at ATI.  I love my job and have a great relationship with my fellow employees. I am responsible for a wide range of duties and enjoy what I do on a daily basis.
good,"Good company to work for, but not much room for advancement"
good,"Great place need raised bonus , need a training team, and list more to the associated about their concerns.."
good,I hand grinded big steel slabs. The pieces were so big I had to pick it up using a hoist. After I hand grinded I sand blasted the pieces getting them ready for sale.
good,Working to return to profitability.  People are hard working and it is a good team environment.  Compensation and benefits are good.  Overall a good experience.
good,"The company was a steel manufacturing and finishing facility.  I had the opportunity to learn many operational and maintenance skills."
good,"Company provided me with a wide range of experiences during my career.  I started in finance, then spent time in IT, production planning, operations and finished by career as an executive leading commercial operations that included procurement, sales, marketing and business development.  "
good,I absolutely loved the job until it came to current labor agreement where the company locked out all represented employees
good,"Overall it’s a fun, but hard job. A lot to learn out there and good benefits. The job has pros, but probably more cons. You get a decent amount of unaccounted time and good insurance. A lot of jobs to do. The main negatives are the tier system and that it’s dangerous"
good,New Management has begun to place the employee last. No investment has been placed in R&D for years and they are struggling to be profitable.  Don't know what direction they are going and made a $1.2 B expenditure at a time the market was shrinking. This should have been initiated 15 years earlier.
good,Great people to work with but substandard health benefits.  They however do have a great 401k Plan. Recognition for achievements not present.
good,"Teledyne:"
good,a very acceptable job for the most part; great co-workers; enjoyable but challenging and demanding job at times; upper management a bit to be desired; good pay and benefits with plenty of overtime (at times a bit excessive).
good,"Depending on the division or section for employment, the job has been very challenging and rewarding.  Working in the project engineering group has had a constant influx of new projects that span across all engineering disciplines."
good,Aggressive work schedule that meet our safety goals.  Sub-contractors were observed for proactive safety and compliance on a daily basis.
good,Good Company to work for. Manufacturing Co. making Oil & Gas & other metal parts for Baker Hughes and other large company's 
good,"Portland Forge, ATI, was a relaxed-but-constant setting for work. Work included reviewing and creating customer RFQ's by modeling parts with CAD software based on provided drawings."
good,Great place to work. Many CI tools available to improve in any area. The company is truly on a mission to zero injuries. The site I work at has high employee turnover which makes everything harder to achieve.
good,"nice job, no flexible schedule, nice people. I just found a better paying job.   no complaints regarding people, job requirements, schedule or company.  would recommend"
good,"Close knit team and very helpful to adjust. It was a short period, but I think I would have enjoyed more time there."
good,"my typical day consisted of corresponding with engineers to ensure accuracy of the traveler.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at ati greatly, need to settle labor disputes. I thought ati was a great place to work, the employees kept the plant running efficiently and turned out quality products. i  was proud to be a member of the team."
good,I got my start here right out of college. Everyday there is a new challenge to conquer or teaching moment to be had. Going through these challenges with friendly hardworking co-workers is valuable and makes it fun.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some wonderful people who were like family after so many years of working together. "
good,Pretty much an underpaid technician. Good work environment and awesome coworkers. Forging equipment is top of the line. HR is good at communication. Good overall
good,"Good work force, learning constantly"
good,"Typical steel mill environment, long hours sometimes.  Good culture and co-workers.  Compensation is slightly above average and benefits are average."
good,Biget challenge was to overcome limitations of computer system. I was able to provide leadership with the implementation of Oracle software which really became implementation of Oracle culture.
good,"I worked at ATI for 17 years.  I moved up steadily for many years in EHS, but they were not interested in moving out into production.  Eventually after reducing injuries by 98%, they told me I did not provide any value any longer.  Not a nice company."
good,Great CEO but a couple of old time leaders who will change if CEO makes them otherwise they can treat employees poorly.  Great company positioned in a great niche industry.  Profitable due to their unique products.
good,"Great pay for the area. Certain jobs could pay more because you have to learn multiple things pertaining to that job. The work place is friendly  and you get a sense of family. I also feel that you spend a lot of time at work, more than you do at home."
good,Long hours most days hot dirty working conditions pay was good benefits not bad. The company has made a lot of changes over the years with not having the best interest for the employees.
good,"A typical work day for me consist of getting the paper work from the supervisor letting you know what jobs need to be done that day.  Then I'd get with my Teamster/tow motor driver to get the job. I'd have the driver dump the box of billets that go with the job. I'd load the billets, heat them up, and give them to the next process."
good,12 hour day of hard work.  No reward for working hard.  Profit driven company.  Horrible work schedule.  Days off constantly are rotating.  Decent benefits.
good,It's a good full time job. You move up fairly quickly. It pays above minimum wage. Benifits are nice. It does take a while to accumulate paid time off.
good,"Everyone here is kind and respectful. Not a stressful environment compared to the type of company I worked at before. Turn around in administrative and technical jobs is low probably because this is a good place to work with good pay, so there's not reason to leave. I'm very blessed to be employed here."
good,The money and benefits are good but the work experience has changed over the last 5 years. There is no loyalty to older employees and especially to lower management.
good,Once you are on board and certified it is the best paying job in the area. You can get hired with no previous experience. Most workers are lazy and condescending but you can keep to yourself. Upper management is very nice. Hours suck 530-530am/pm
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Good people, good leadership for the most part but going through some difficult business conditions now."
good,Great place people are friendly money is good would recommend it as long as you don’t have a problem with work and learning as you go overall good plce
good,"ATI provided a good work atmosphere, with plenty of opportunity to learn and advance in both position and work skills."
good,You have to have tough skin to work at allegheny technology inc. Plus you have to have some smarts too! Overall it's a very decent company to work for!  We make some of the best stainless steel in the world. I loved my job! I worked with a bunch of great guys.
good,Strong Growing Company. Needs updating. management could use a good cleaning. over worked. no set start time. very laid back place to work at tho
good,Place to earn a wage where you will put in a lot of hours.  Benefits are good.  Co workers are great.  Sometimes it is forced overtime.
good,"We produced quality Titanium. Everything from standard to rotor quality. I loved operating a 5 torch Plasma furnace.I welded scrap sticks, then advanced to plasma operations where I became a supervisor. The Gas system was the hardest, but I got a good understudying of it now. Melting creates H2. O2 was added to the furnace gas to keep the inlet H2 in MI specifications."
good,Typical day n R&D is run melting or forging schedules on the pilot plant and receive lab reports.  Learned in depth on a few sophisticated processes like vacuum induction melting or ingot breakdown forging and also metallic structure progression.  Management is solid and effective.  Co-workers very friendly and helpful. Hardest part of job is having patience to wait for common lab results.  Most enjoyable part of job is hands on and discussing with many good teams and customers/vendors on process or product improvement.
good,Challenging work schedule with supportive management.
good,"Great place to work! Great organization people are great very helpful."
good,"I was an intern here at ATI, and it helped me progress in my field of study. Friendly staff, and also very helpful. Would recommend anybody in the field looking for an entry level position."
good,The dirty work environment is a plus actually because cleaning excessively is pointless. Its a steel mill after all. Safety is a high priority and that is great. Employees are supported with multiple levels of help for whatever goes wrong.
good,"I've worked at ATI for over six months and find the work challenging and interesting. My colleagues are respectful and ready to assist new employees. There is a competitive nature to the culture but that is what makes us strive for excellence."
good,It is a positive place to work. The people are great to work with.  I have been with the company  for two months  and hope to advance my career in the future.
good,"As an intern, things can sometimes be slow paced. Daily tasks included CAD, 3D scanning, meetings, presentations, and other small jobs. I really like my coworkers and ATI has been very flexible with my schedule (even allowing me to take summer classes). "
good,Great place to intern for the summer. Worked in IT and had a great time learning under very capable people. Also very well compensated for and intern still in college.
good,"This company really molded me into the manager that I am today. ATI is very demanding, and management expects only the best from its team. This is where I built the foundation for my future with lean manufacturing, reliability-centered maintenance, and six sigma disciplines."
good,"It was a great place to work for the past 32 years.  Unfortunately, the company and its union workforce (salary union included) are unable to make any headway in a contract negotiation and has resulted in the company locking out all union employees.  As a result I am looking elsewhere to utilize the skills that I have learned throughout the years."
good,"Could not ask for a better job while still in school. Complete flexibility in work hours while taking classes. Management is not ""micro-management"", helps you chase your goals and learn. From my experience, we failed fast, learned fast, and succeeded fast. Working with a wide range of ages, backgrounds, and personalities. Had contact with everyone from the bottom of the ladder to the top. Relaxed working environment and perfect for those wanting to gain experience. Very glad I was picked up for the role ATI wanted me for and I will always be thankful for that."
good,It was a good job if you can deal with a mill environment. Hot temperatures and dirty working conditions. High emphasis on safety. Great pay and good benefits.
good,Good place to work good benefits and good hours but job security was not to good management and co workers were great they took me in straight out of high school and showed me everything they knew
good,Daily Broad Meet at shift change to give each other pass on. I sign document to make sure sample plan has not change. My work area is Marco Prep I make sure the CNC Manchine is running good and do my check lists to make sure it pass it inspect.
good,"Everyday I check in and inspect equipment, making sure everything is running and in safe condition preforming any maintenance that may be necessary, doing any repair work as required. I've enhanced my maintenance experience as everyday there is something new to learn. I have a great work team and management to help. The best part of any day is when all machinery is up and running and people are able to safely do their job. There really isn't a hard part to this job, I enjoy this type of work so it makes it better for me."
good,"Working with the Human Resources team you are quickly viewed, valued and entrusted with responsibilities like a full-fledged employee. Intern or not, you will be working with multi-disciplinary teams to push continuous improvement and Operational excellence. "
good,"I have been very pleased with my time at ATI. I believe that I am being fairly compensated for my work and that I am appreciated for the work I do. The bonus program is also very nice. Being in an admin position, a typical day is filled with either tasks that have an approaching deadline or a ""side project."" I'm free to choose my own projects to pursue (within reason) and there is no micromanagement which is something I greatly appreciate. The workplace culture is great. It fosters growth, collaboration, friendliness, and respect."
good,"ATI has great leaders who demonstrate the company's values and make them a key part of the culture from the top of the organization. It is truly an atmosphere of safety, teamwork & respect."
good,"Great pay, Employee run Safety program and room to advance. Medical is really the worst thing about working there. Its a high deductible plan. Allows for lots of training"
good,"Great on job training, easy working employees, wonderful 401K, full benefits. Paid time off was fantastic and the 401K program was easily accessible with employee benefits."
good,"Company is progressive always looking to get more effecient continuos safety training employee training in each individual field"
good,A very collaborative organization and allows for autonomy. Provides opportunity to grow and show leadership skills throughout the organization. Great experience.
good,"I learned alot about heavy industrial field, such as trouble shooting problems with hydraulics and electrical. Enjoy being responsible for a major producing unit with limited supervision."
good,Good initial experience with real world problems. Increased my knowledge of the science.
good,"Allegheny Technologies (ATI) Huntsville is a great company to work for.  I personally like knowing that I am part of an operation that plays an integral role in regards to our economy and country. "
good,"Since starting I really like the job it's a job you don't mind coming to work for every day. Wish I would have started much sooner in life. Great work environment, great fellow employees. Pay is pretty competitive and benefits are great!"
good,Great place to work but idled the plant due to economics forced to retire due to this most enjoyable part of the job was troubleshooting problems
good,Management treated their employees with dignity and respect and the employees reciprocated by doing their jobs to the best of their ability to make the operations run smoothly.
good,"A fast paced quality oriented work environment focused on meeting & exceeding customer expectations while maintaining a safe work environment for yourself and your teams."
good,"With the aerospace ramp and a new executive team, there is plenty of opportunity to mold the future of this company.  This is a great time to join and make your mark."
good,I am so blessed to have this opportunity with ATI and foresee many advantages to working for this company for many years to come. ATI seems to be willing to help people succeed and advance in their professional life as well as providing a balance work/personal life.
good,"ATI is a wonderful place to work. Everyone is so genuine and nice. They make you feel like family the moment you walk in. They care about their employees. The employees are encouraged to help improve their process, maintain safety, and speak with management about anything. The company as whole does some pretty amazing things and it makes you proud to be part of it. I am honored they chose me to be part of their process."
good,"I have been employed at ATI for less than a year but I can say I enjoy working here. For the most part, the group of people are enjoyable to work with and management has an open door policy. The only drawbacks to me is rotating shifts, lack of career advancement opportunities, and life/work ratio is not good. Plenty of 6 day weeks with rotating shifts which means no family life at all. "
good,Was my first good paying position in a local manufacturing steel mill producing thin rolled metal. I was able to buy our only home with my wife. The management was very fair when I worked for Teledyne Rodney Metals for 20 years then they were bought out by Allegheny Ludlum. In came new management and laid off half the work force and the Job culture was changed and we were forced to unionize with the Steel Workers Union. After this it wasn't so bad at all but the workforce still stayed at half staffed because now work was outsourced to their many other plants around the world
good,I learned a lot about how to work in a group of engineers and the sort of day to day tasks that would be expected at a company such as ATI.  The management could have a been a little more prepared with the tasks that I was given but overall it was handled very well.  I liked most of my coworkers and learned how to approach difficult coworkers well.  The hardest part of my job was relearning what it meant to be an intern and the most enjoyable part of my internship was getting to know my coworkers.
good,"A better understanding of the manufacturing processes would help. Just about every role interacts with that core business model that we are, that we are a manufacturing company. One that is ready for some 21st-century changes in making it better."
good,"I recently started here at ATI, and I love it. The first week I was here I was introduced to everyone in the company that was in the office, and that immediately made me feel extremely welcomed. Here at ATI, they encourage to try other departments and jobs throughout your career instead of just sticking to one which was exactly what I was looking for to gain knowledge and experience across the board. Also, everyone I've encountered here has been incredibly friendly and helpful. Not to mention, the benefits at ATI are a huge perk, too, especially compared to my previous jobs."
good,One thing that makes a job satisfying is the knowledge that you are making a positive difference. As an engineer there are lots of opportunities to have this satisfaction working at ATI. The processes and materials the company uses and produces are very interesting and the possibilities for improvement are many. The company encourages making improvements to the processes because of this ideas are taken seriously. This applies to operators and engineers alike.
good,"ATI has been a rewarding and supportive company to work for. They have good healthcare, competitive pay, and a great 401k policy."
good,I've been employed by ati for 3 months now and i can honestly say this is the best job I have ever had. Thed pay is great. The work is not to demanding. The people I work with are great. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a career and not just a summer job. I am able to support my family now and live happily and comfortable.
good,Long hours working over to resolve production demands.  The environment involves large equipment and machines. Working in maintenance requires a strong aptitude and critical thinking skills.
good,"I started in November 2019.  It took a while for HR to get back to me on interviews.  So I had to be patient, but it was worth the wait.  The salary they offered was decent, and the benefits were better than previous employers.  A lot of paperwork at first, but HR and my manager were more than helpful it getting me settled in and making me feel like I had a part.  Management is focused on innovation and profitability, but really seem to put an underlying emphasis on caring about the employee.  They are definitely in the business to make money.  The proof will be in the annual profit sharing check.  If you feel like you want a job that will make you feel a part of something great, this is the place to be."
good,ATI is a great place to work. They are always looking for ways to improve.Safety is the biggest part of the operation. Co-workers are helpful and encouraging. I am thankful for the opportunity and encourage anyone looking for employment to give them a shot.
good,"My work varies each day from support to project initiatives, co-workers are great and knowledgeable.  Management is supportive and respectful of family life, people are friendly and professional.  I love the variety of my work and the people I get to meet and work with."
good,"I enjoy working with all my co-worker and managers, they all care about the people here.  They don't have much to advance you in unless you have a lot of schooling."
good,"Mhealth reasons is the only reason that I'm seeking other employment. This place is top of the line with communication, training, benefits, and all aspects of the job."
