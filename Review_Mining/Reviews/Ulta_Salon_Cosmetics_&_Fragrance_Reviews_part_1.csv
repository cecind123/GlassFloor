bad,"Not a good company. Managers are rude, HR reps are none helpful, random OT with short notice. They company only care about themselves and not the workers."
bad,"My experience at the location I was placed at in Las Vegas, NV:"
bad,Everyone acts like highschool drama. Management acts like they are your friends but flip on you quickly. Gm sits in the office all day eating and on her phone claims she has work related callls but why is she texting
bad,When I worked at Ulta all my of coworkers including managers were not only rude to me but customers. All my coworkers did was gossip all day and did not really help out on the floor. What made me quit was I had told my manager before I was hired about my sisters wedding and she ensured I’d have that day off since I was in the wedding but didn’t allow me the day off. So I quit. Do not work here.
bad,Ulta preaches culture however Sr. Management does not lead by example. Sr. Management supports favoritism with all associates in the building. Sr. Management does not listen to the team and or contribute to the team's efforts. They only make commands and don't actually do work.
bad,"lies lies lies "
bad,"They train you horribly, throw you out there, and then when you make a mistake, fire you instead of merely correcting you. Pay was minimum wage.miniwage.wage"
bad,"Horrible place to work, they’re unprofessional & there’s a lot of favoritism.The managers talks about each other & are racist.Environment is draining."
bad,"The warehouse is not fair to employees who want to learn more than one department. Also, there is no room to move up. Managers are not helpful and play favorites. There is free products but they may run out before your department is allowed to get them."
bad,"I tried for a long time to fit into the environment at Ulta. The management showed me every day that they did not care about me or my time at all. Very cliquey environment. I had to leave on bad terms because they were not treating me how I deserved to be treated. One manager offered me a raise while the other manager was trying to demote me because there ""was no room in the budget for me to work my position any longer"""
bad,"The job was very fun and a new learning experience but the management team there made pushed me to the decision of leaving. Ultra is very big on sales but my manager would get angry and aggressive when sales goals weren’t met, she would make employees cry."
bad,I came in happy ready to advance my career. But salon culture was not practiced by Salon management. All of the Staff and managers were young and full of drama.
bad,Don’t work for this company! The management gets worse and worse every year. It’s a very toxic work environment to be in daily. The pay is very low for single parents to survive.
bad,"Wouldnt have been such a terrible job if management wasn't such a nightmare. If you're working as a cashier, all they care about is harassing customers about credit/loyalty."
bad,"The management was poor and we were constantly understaffed. Sometimes I wouldn't be allowed a break because there were a lot of guests in line waiting to get checked out, but with only two cashiers."
bad,The biggest mistake I ever made in my career was working here. The store manager is a joke & caused many people to quit. She talked badly about customers & other employees constantly.
bad,Terrible place to work. The managers do not care about you. You're just another number to them. Their advertising is terrible so no one really knows they have a salon. And you get no benefits.
bad,"terrible company to work for, does not empower like they say and they will always outside hire management. also its a large company they do not care about you as an individual"
bad,"The management is absolutely unprofessional and will not give you any hours!! They hired many people and became ""overstaffed"" and won't give no one hours, but complain that no one is there to work. AND only gave me two days out of the whole month of December to work. therefore, no money and couldn't afford gifts for the holidays. I tried speaking to the management several times to get more hours and to ask if I got fired since I couldn't access the app. And no manager can give me a real answer. The workplace is just as bad while it played favorites and that's why no one can get hours. I absolutely was excited to work there especially when it was a new location near my hometown. I learned my lesson and the discount isn't all that great."
bad,"Management is awful worst  . Sadly everyone thinks there above each other . Very depressing  extremely overwhelming and not enough credit given to"
bad,No appreciation for their employees at all. They would rather you risk your life getting to work than be understanding that there is a foot of snow outside and you cannot get there.  Have to take your sick child to the hospital? Forget it. You’ll get docked and receive a written warning or they will just fire you. Licensed professional in the beauty industry? You’ll never get paid for being a professional. Your talent will be wasted. They don’t care about anything other than pushing product
bad,"the Keene, NH location is filled with middle-aged crabby-talking arrogant women with nor regard for the lives of lower level employees. they have nothing better to do than to shame you for not getting enough credit cards and push you to get sales without letting you engage too long with a customer. they want the store to do well but dont care about any one else's feelings or personal life or if they are happy to come to work. that have a crazy high turnover rate. the do weird petty things and are like 30 years old with terrible skills. i would rather die than ever work for these people again which is a huge shame because i love makeup and i love people so their loss i guess"
bad,"Management does not care about its employees. Whether you're pregnant, physically ill/injured, or you have a family emergency, they still expect you to work and deal with it. They will ensure your shift doesn't get covered and if it does, they will tell you you were in the wrong for getting it covered. Medical restrictions, even filed with HR, are not honoured."
bad,Worst job ever !! Manager was a racist and the credit card system pushes you to con others into making poor decisions with their credit. I was told to lie to customers constantly!!!!
bad,"When I was newly pregnant and having morning sickness they were not understanding whatsoever, and fired me right after I learned I was pregnant.  Never applying at ULTA again, but I still shop in the beauty section, I just stay away from the salon.  The manager at the time was a total nut job."
bad,Omg stay away I’m trying to tell you now!!! GHETTO they hire everyone and the roaches. Stay away no employee appreciation horrible I’ll do telemarketing before this lol
bad,I have worked at Ulta for a while now and let me tell you management is the WORST. Manager are basically useless and don’t know how to work under pressure. We were unloading a truck and the manager just kept getting mad and annoyed with everyone like ma’am this is your job if you have a problem with how your employees are doing their work then HELP THEM. They don’t notice your hard work with completely sucks. I worked 12 hours shifts and my manager would praise another worker calling her a hard worker just bc she asked to stay late and help ONCE. I am  for sure never working here or shopping here AGAIN.
bad,Very unorganized company. Little to no opportunity for growth/advancement. Employees come and go on a monthly basis. Poorly run and overall not a good experience
bad,"Worked here for about 6 months as the MSC, my training for a management position consisted of a week. My second week I was fully left to run a whole floor by myself, thefts were consistently happening making this a very UNSAFE job to work. Manager never made the schedule till the week of and would change it without any notice"
bad,"The only reason I hated this job was because of the general manager. She is not nice. The job was ok, but definitely not the best environment. There is a lot of judgement and rudeness from the employees."
bad,Management Horrible Very Racist and never have enough coverage on the sales floor. Pay rate is not good either. Always cutting hours at first thought it was a great place to work after a few months I got to see more not as friendly.
bad,Employees are treated like thieves.  clients  have to sit while we take mandatory breaks. Employees have to mop floors and do maintenance things that should not be part of job.
bad,it was awful. worst couple months of my life.everyone there is so self-centered and rude. i would not reccomend working for this company. ever!!!!!!!!
bad,"Ulta is impossible. The biggest thing I don’t like about working here is the loyalty system numbers. They have two numbers they “grade” you on: sign-ups and data capture. The company wants you to get 90%+ customers to sign up and give you all of their information. The loyalty system is great, don’t get me wrong, and the employees can take advantage of the perks of it as well (but, you can’t use coupons with your 25% employee discount. You also can’t give your coupons to someone else.) So, if your numbers are low, expect to get fired, have your job threatened, or be taken off the schedule for an entire pay period. Management isn’t rude nor have I felt targeted, however I do know that if they choose to put an employee on the schedule that has a record of downing the numbers, their job will be threatened too. They promote within sometimes, but turnover is insane. I’ve only worked at one location for over a year now and I’ve seen 3 different store managers. Some managers will come in, stay for a month, then get promoted to a position in another store. The company is disloyal to their employees, and expect their employees to be completely loyal to them. If I could go back and told myself to not apply here, I would."
bad,"This company will suck you dry and kick you while you're down."
bad,"Not enough space here to tell my story. Supper management is full of conspiracy and the biggest bullying types of peope. When I brought to my district manager’s attention, she made me feel as though I was the problem.  Clearly I wasn’t.  Ask any employer I worked with that is still there.  Many are  are In agreement with my statement and have also"
bad,No manager support . Manipulative till your terminated if your not in the click. No one cares if you stay or leave. No appreciation.  no special treatment to anyone who does a good job unless your in the in.  In 2 years I’ve been one off 20 stylist 4 managers and 2  general  managers and 3 estheticians  There is wrong there.
bad,Ulta is the worst company I’ve ever worked for. Danielle (salon manager) doesn’t care for her employees and uses scare tactics to get things done (such as threatening to take away hours/whole shifts if you aren’t performing up to her standards). I finally decided it was time to leave due to the fact that I felt emotionally/mentally exhausted after EVERY shift I worked.
bad,Ulta is the worst company I’ve ever worked for. Upper management doesn’t care for their employees and uses scare tactics to get things done. There is absolutely no work life balance and zero communication and their expectations are unrealistic. Save yourself from working here!
bad,At one time Ulta was a wonderful company. But as its grown it has lost sight of the guest service. Both external and internal. There is never enough associates scheduled to assist guests to the level of service that should be.
bad,If you need HR to help you with a manager that's attacking you & trying to take your job away don't evaluate each employee to put them at the proper positions forces you to do services on people that could go wrong when I 1st started I said I wanted to make it to corporate I was told that there are no blacks in corporate
bad,"I always regret accepting this job. The pay was terrible, management was catty and hateful, and the overall environment could be very hostile. You're always in fear that you'll lose your job, the hours are terrible and I was lucky if I could get 10 hours a week which hardly paid for the gas to get to this job. In my opinion, the benefits were not worth the mental and emotional stress this job created."
bad,"Worked there as a vendor in the Waterbury location. Employees weren’t allowed to talk to me or they got yelled at, managers were horrible and did not help at all."
bad,"Legit one of the worst places I’ve worked. The management was terrible, the other employees were a bunch of caddy individuals. Everyone is super fake and will backstab each other just because. I only lasted a few months before I had had enough. I will never recommend anyone to work for Ulta."
bad,Management is terrible they have and will fire you for something you don't know about. They give you no chances or warnings for termination. They will fire you just because. The whole management team is Guy Men!
bad,"This was the worst experience I've had in a ""professional"" work environment. The atmosphere is toxic. I was working in a location that was a very hostile environment. The General Manager was allowed to behave like a tyrant. I was subjected to her bullying, harrassment, and unprofessionalism daily. I reported the issues to the district manager and there were no protections for me or any other associate who was brave enough to come forward and report the the ethical violations. This was an unfortunate experience, no one should have to endure abuse in the workplace. I was fresh out of Cosmetology school with a strong management background and excited to combine the two passions at Ulta. Heartbreaking. I have records to support my review."
bad,I felt this store was very racist. Barely gave me any hours. Bad location because around a very racist neighborhood. Prices is high but didn't work there long to receive any discounts.
bad,Don’t get me wrong I was excited coming into ULTA thinking I could make this a career. Hard work and dedication. No. This company takes a fat shat on you. They don’t give a dang. Fulltime is 30 hours at ULTA but they kept me right at 29. So no I got no good benefits. And I could paid a wack pay. For the amount of STRESS and UNREALISTIC expectations it was not worth it. This job literally made me hate makeup and anything beauty. “Endless possibilities are  beautiful.” My a**. They wouldn’t give anyone the proper training. We were called us broads and idiots. It’s a double standard  place.
bad,This is not the place to work if you dnt have clients willing to pay their prices and if you have clients you serve outside your normal working hours. There is no additional compensation for selling clients products.
bad,"A typical work day? Let's see, first you stand outside pounding on the door for 10 minutes because the door is locked and the managers (all 158 of them) are too busy stuffing their faces with donuts in the break room to let you inside. Then you spend the next hour trying to get one of them to adjust your time card because you've been marked late (even though you were really 10 minutes early). When you finally get hold of one, they roll their eyes and sigh and tell you to go find another manager to take care of it. The next manager will invariably sigh, roll her eyes, and tell you to go find yet another person to take care of it."
bad,"I was miserable from the beginning with this job, The hours were SO long and the pay was terrible. You would end up at the register for 6-10 hours on end and if there was nobody else scheduled and the manager did not want to cover your break then you did not get one. The reason there is such a high turnover at Ulta is poor management. They will make you feel terrible about yourself by talking about you behind your back or even in front of your face and laughing about it with other associates and managers. The general manager does not feel the need to do her job because she lets the other managers do it for her, she was consistently 15-25 minutes late to every shift and god forbid she actually manage to resolve an issue. Do not work here unless you are mean, emotionless, and dramatic or else this place will turn you into something you won't recognize. I worked her for 3 years and would come home crying consistently because of how toxic the environment was. Customers were amazing, same with vendors, but the staff and mostly managers are some of the worst people I have ever met. Don't work here, no matter how much you love make-up because this place will destroy your passion"
bad,"very stressful to work at. When I first started, I got 45 hours a week and then faster and faster my hours were dropping to the point of only working 1 day a month. I had to get another job and my boss or managers would call me at my other job saying I had to come in and work and they would last minute redo the schedule. it became very stressful for me to handle the job and also some of the management. The dress code was constantly changing and sometimes I would have to clock out and drive back home to change. I personally purchased a new woredrobe for this company and felt like I had to keep buying new clothes to fit the standards of each managers dress code ides even though the handbook said differently."
bad,"The manager only cared about her hours, she was very rude when you came to her with any concerns or customer complaints. The assistant manager was very nice but he let the GM walk all over him as if he was lesser than her. The shelves were never followed by the planogram, nor were they ever stocked because someone didn't order materials that week."
bad,"After taxes, I made maybe $6 an hour. They never wanted to schedule you more than 10 hours a week, there was one manager that thought she ran she show when she was literally just a shift manager."
bad,"This company doesn't see their employees as humans, but rather as numbers. If you value your worth in any way then don't be fooled by the fake smiles and phony act. Managnent will low ball you on your wage even if you're over qualified. They ask you to perform tasks outside of your pay scale and once confronted of doing so, will lie and make their own rules(even though its stated in the handbook)."
bad,"The company overall is only focused on numbers which at times is understandable but at some point they need to stop & look at the employees. The employees are suffering because all they care about is hours. No people on the floor to serve customers, people coming in to steal constantly because they know we cant do anything & have nobody on the floor. The stress level of this job for what I was getting payed is absolutely not worth it. I was basically pushed out after I put my two weeks in my GM had my number made inactive and expected me to use someone elses number and password to do my job when that’s against policy to use someone elses #. So I was not even able to finish out my last two weeks because my number was inactive & I refused to use someone elses number. This job is"
bad,"There’s something wrong company wide. Very few ppl I know enjoyed working here. The only things that was good was the gratis, discounts, and brand trainings"
bad,"I would not recommend working at Ulta, they were very unprofessional and did not care abut their employees at all. favorites were picked. It depressed me going to work everyday. 0/10 job."
bad,"I was so excited about working there because I thought it was going to be an amazing job. However it ended up being one of the worst places I’ve ever worked! Very unorganized management, they consistently were cutting hours, there was absolutely no stability here. The high school drama was unbelievably bad and it’s like they all had their little cliques and everyone talks bad about one another. Yeah the discs are cool I guess but don’t waste your time."
bad,I think if I had better management It would have been a great place to work. There was no encouragement and the manager was quite rude and honestly should not have been doing hair. The people I worked with were great though. I loved the other stylists and the education that they provided.
bad,They need help with management. They did not have any time for people to sit down and talk about things. There was no time for change or to grow in this store.
bad,"What there was of any ""training"" at Ulta was very disorganized. Selling techniques or customer service were barely discussed. Management was not very knowledgeable about how anything worked in the store, such as taking breaks or using the register system. Scheduling was confusing and there were many scheduling conflicts."
bad,"Ulta was the most unprofessional place I have ever worked, they don’t want people to succeed and move up. You can never ask for days off without manager getting angry even though u have paid time! I would never recommend anyone to work there and I won’t even shop there!!!!"
bad,horrible. worst job experience I've ever had in a 23 year career doing hair. I would never recommend anyone working for that company. they do not know how to treat or pay their employees.
bad,"I would never be Salon Manager for this company. They bully people and except you to know every area of hair, makeup, nails, when I brought it the company I was being bullying. They dismissed issue and made it impossible to return to work."
bad,Nothing good to say. They were long 10 to 12 hour days. Management didn't show any praise in my work. I was a temp who was let go with out any notice for reasoning why.
bad,I do not under any circumstance recommend working at Ulta. You are replaceable no matter how hard you work. Management is awful and non-supportive. Corporate makes all the decisions without any consideration of the practically of running a store . Run far away from this place and do yourself a favor and seek employment elsewhere.  If you are looking for a holiday job to get a discount on make up then this is for you
bad,They did not tell me it would be a temporary job. I opened the store. They stated that I would have a chance of working in their salon once I finished school.
bad,This store used to be the Port Richey location but got transferred to Trinity. Bad hours and no benefits aside from store discount. You’ll get thrown to do too many things at once which can get super overwhelming. You’re expected to push customers into signing up for a rewards program wether they want it or not and you will get talked to if you miss people as they expect that you sign up every single guest. No room to grow with the company because the GM doesn’t like promoting or helping employees. She yells at employees for absolutely anything and everything. She gets mad if you try to pull a used product off the shelves because it’s a “waste of money” and will make you put the product back out. HR doesn’t care to do much about it. Try a different location.
bad,You will be over worked and under paid if you move into management. They literally treat you like scum. What's acceptable for one person is a write up for another person. Save your sanity and don't work there.
bad,I hated this job the managers sucked the GM was rude and took all of her frustrations out on employees. I was harassed about shoes and clothes. They take hours from there employees.
bad,management sucks not a positive environment I worked there 4 a year b4 she started it was way better.high turnover and fake atmosphere not worth it !!
bad,This company is solely in business for themselves . Very selfish company they hire anybody that will work. Not many qualified to provide cosmetics and hair stylist entry level. This means they are straight out of school and most of their work is a mess.
bad,"I worked at the Gastonia, NC location of Ulta Beauty for right at a year. The store itself is a nightmare and management is a joke. It's constantly a game of favorites and catty drama. There is no where near enough necessary training. Hours are either very scarce or you're overworked without enough floor coverage. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere."
bad,"This is got to be one of the most unreliable jobs I never had, five years working for Ulta.No guaranteed hours,biased managers,never made more than 20 hours a week.Managers always have an excuse as to why hours are being cut.Not willing to work with availability.If you have children or a life,good luck their.Bunch of collage kids and brand reps stand around talking and doing nothing,while you bust your butt with guest and task,to still make nothing.Work culture is a joke and no security,people were constantly stealing every day.Someone really needs to go in there and clean house.Give the hard-working employees and mothers,what they deserve."
bad,"The worst job I have EVER worked! All the employees including management are so clicky and snotty it’s ridiculous. NOBODY follows protocol, NOBODY does what’s they’re supposed to. There’s a Team Leader/Assistant Manager that TREATS PEOPLE LIKE DIRT, and is BFF w the store manager so it’s literally funny to them to treat people badly. I will never spend my money there again after the experience I had let alone work for the company again. I’m gonna say it again save your time and effort."
bad,"Management, co workers and training. All were unprofessional and I didn’t get proper trainings that were required, but still got written up for not knowing how to work the register. Also they would accept returns of opened merchandise, clean with a q-tip and try to resell it. Unsanitary. This was my very first job ever. Would not recommend at all."
bad,"If you’re looking for a part time job, they will definitely give you that. Apart from being over worked, there was a major lack of management that was in desperate need of major help. Plus side is the discount you get and the friendships you build."
bad,"I have years of experience in sales, hospitality, make up artist, management and the Ulta I worked at was awful. The GM was cold and enjoyed causing drama. She never communicated vital information to me the Prestige Mgr. And made it look like she would constantly set me up to fail. Corporste wasnt any better, they were threatening and condensending using tactics that are the lowest of humanity. This company also doesnt believe in ethical ways . They cut their employees hours without notice, change your days without telling you, no guidlines they just slung all the inventory in drawers and in shelves messy while breakung product and making more work for the salespeople to clean up. did. So I would get the blame. The training was rediculouse and I never had time to finish it. I quit my job because the manager"
bad,"Was not treated fairly at all. "
bad,The upper management was a joke! They treat their employees like garbage. They lie from the 1st day of your employment to your last. The area supervisor was a tyrant. And the general manager an inept fool.
bad,"Ulta Beauty does not promote salon. Salon employees do not received any training. Refunds are given to customer who disagree with the price of the service, not the quality of the service. Salon services are not priced to compete with market prices which result in low or non-commission pay. Hours are often reduced with short notice. Low quality haircare products."
bad,"I along with approximately fifty other people were hired at the Ulta in South County, Missouri. As expected, we all were excited to be involved with the opening of this store. The majority of us (I included) were promised a set amount of hours. When we were hired each of our availabilities were discussed. We were ensured that this would be sufficient and appropriate with the store's requirements, but shortly after being hired this proved to be false. Some of us were penalized or treated poorly for not being able to attend shifts that were scheduled during times that were outside of our availability. After the grand opening of the store (that not everyone was invited to despite the countless long nights of labor in order to put the store together) many of us were ""silently"" fired and never scheduled to work again. This store had the most unorganized, juvenile and incompetent managerial staff I have ever encountered. I would never recommend being employed here."
bad,"Ulta is just like high school all over. Like most companies, their main objective is to make as much money as possible and they enjoy putting unnecessary pressure on their employees. I left due to a very unprofessional encounter with my manager."
bad,"The DM was crazy and never promoted from within. Always listened to this ex employees opinions of people for hiring opportunities, after the employee already quit. No hours, no communication"
bad,"working at ulta seemed like a dream job for an amateur makeup enthusiast, however it became increasingly obvious that this company gives no thought or respect to its employees at all we are pitted against each other constantly, hours are never guaranteed for anyone under a management position there were weeks when i was given one shift and there were still times when i was called 15 minutes before my shift and told not to come in because they had gone over their budget. this is a toxic workplace especially for a young person going into one of their firsts jobs."
bad,This company micro manages at a level that is unreal they expect blind and unflinching loyalty to the company they want your entire life to revolve around your job with the company
bad,"Terrible Leadership, not a place to recommend to anyone. Gm would bully employees in areas that had no cameras. Gm would also make racist comments and contributed to a low morale. Never demonstrated Core Values that company wanted employees to have."
bad,"Worst company to work for as a hairdresser. You don't really get to do enough work with your customer without having to tap into their wallet at every second, pay was horrible."
bad,I’ve worked at ulta for a year and it’s been the most stressful time of my life. The company is selfish and they only care about making money. They don’t care about their employees.
bad,"I was so happy to get a job here thinking that I would be able to apply makeup and engage with customers. As a beauty advisor, all I did was stand at the register and stock items close to the register. I occasionally put back items, but I got nowhere near the prestige side (with high end cosmetics). My coworkers always seemed miserable and loved to gossip. The breaks were short and some shifts were just incredibly pointless (for example I would work: 4pm-8pm and 12pm-4pm). Management would always push our goal to the extreme knowing it wasn’t even possible. I did not enjoy harassing customers for a stupid point cards and credit cards."
bad,"I had to leave Ulta suddenly because it became very apparent that no one care about the safety of our staff. Police were called to the store so many times a week that the police staff actually sat down with some of the Ulta workers and suggested we quit. "
bad,Management and Human Resources are a joke at this company. You file complaints and they look the other way to protect certain employees. You get threatened there and nothing is done in your favor.
bad,Awful place to work and everyone there does not want to be there. I would have left sooner but I couldn't find a job. They were bullies and never helped you with anything. I would never recommend working here even if my life depends on it
bad,"Cliques, poor management, they didn't give breaks sometimes when you were supposed to go on break. Working there was trash. The management was also immature."
bad,"When I started to work here which was January, I was super excited to be able to work at a place that I'm fascinated with but out of all the days I would work there was horrible. I would ask my store manager a simple little question and she would look at me crazy, mangers had their favorites and treated everyone else like you were nothing. Store manger was always an hour late to work, everyone just sat in the parking lot early in the morning waiting for her and if someone didn't show up because they got tired of waiting they would write us up."
bad,Horrible horrible management. They can be crooked and shady. This company does not care about its employees and all the hard work they do. Raises are horrible. Overall terrible experience.
bad,"Management is unorganized and not very approachable. The wages aren't competitive for the work they require to do.  Salon supervisor is very rude to employees.  Besides management, everyone else is great to work with."
bad,"Pay is terrible not enough hours no room for"
bad,"They work those associates to the ground for minimum wage. The leaders in the building are getting paid $13-$17/hour and expects everyone to get credit cards, do customers makeup, prevent theft, front face and laser line everything, and meet budget.. with 500 hours of payroll? It didn’t make sense. They give boutiques 40 hours each but those associates can’t help at the register? It’s just an odd structure overall and they need to seriously think about the workload put onto those teams. You have General Managers getting paid over $100k and never show up to work? But lead cashiers making $7.25 and working extremely hard."
bad,"I loved shopping and working at Ulta, unfortunately they cut my hours. Unless, your are part of the management team, your hours will be very few. "
bad,"I do not feel comfortable going into detail, but my experience with Ulta Beauty was the most unpleasant job I have ever had. Do not recommend. Most of it has to do with management."
bad,You literally have to be on the gm good side in order to get more then 1 day out of the week and more then 4 hrs per shift if you are not some sort of manager the most hours you can get are under 25 because if they give you 25 hours their responsible for health benefits so they won’t do it for regular employees
bad,"had the worst experience working here. the managers are terrible, you get the shortest breaks. are expected to do too much work for the amount you're being paid"
bad,"If you love being a hair stylist, stay away from this company. Managers here treat people miserably no matter how good you are as a hair stylist, or sales person."
bad,"This company is terrible. I worked there for almost a year and got no promotion, promotion of people who started after me, and got a 20 cent raise. This job is so stressful because I never know when I'm supposed to come in and have gotten written up multiple times for not showing up to shifts that I did not know I even had! The supervisors think they are above everyone else and don't apply to dress code among other things. Unless you get credit cards you don't get any hours. Overall would not recommend this job it is not worth the stress."
bad,"They don’t care about there employees. It was a toxic environment and when management was told about problems, it was disregarded. Would not recommend working here."
bad,"The managers are racists and show favorites to who they feel fit in. MAC is very diverse and that’s something ulta in Cary needs to learn. Also they need to hire people who know how to do makeup, not idiots who they show favoritisms.  Seems like the only thing that matters to them are sales and that’s it. They don’t care about you as an employee, they’ll replace you in a heartbeat."
bad,"You think, what a great company.. Empowering women and inner beauty. Wrong. They are crooked, and treat employees awfully. "
bad,"This is nothing more than a job for kids in high school.  Theres no hours,  horrible scheduling and they play favoritism!! Most workers there are rude because they are unhappy.  And it's only $11 an hour"
bad,No chance to advance and never scheduled. Worst place I ever worked for. Not enough professionalism nor direction. The only good thing that you get when working there is the employee discount.
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal beauty advisor promised at least 20 hours a week, I was put on the schedule one or two days a week for maybe 4 or 5 hours a shift, but would always get sent home early. One day i had not even worked an hour before getting sent home."
bad,That whole store is a mess ulta is stressful do a lot for a little pay store manager is a pain disrespect belittling employees district manager useless says she will help she doesn’t horrible
bad,"seriously, don't work here. this is the most unprofessional work place I have encountered. managers are mean, catty and most of the time racist. it's so disorganized, upper management does nothing then blames it on us lesser peons or other managers they don't like (usually ones who do everything for the store). upper management is also a joke and completely disconnected from how the store is actually run but will yell at you if you don't get things done in an unrealistic time frame. managers constantly threaten job security if you don't meet credit card goals. the only positive is the 25% discount but it's really not worth it to put yourself through it."
bad,"Supervisor's weren't very cooperative when problems occurred in our work areas assigned.  When boxes were backed up on the conveyor belt line, they argued with workers and said that we should not worry about the work backing up in our workstation areas."
bad,"I loved the Ulta atmosphere and customer base. I thoroughly enjoyed my job and all that it included. I hated to leave but management is poorly organized, condescending to employees, and retaliates if problems in the work place are addressed."
bad,"The management was extrememly manipulative and had little to no respect for the employees or their well being. The amount of drama that goes on inside that place is ridiculous. It’s like being back in a high school cafeteria except for everyone is in their 20’s. Associates would quit regularly because of the toxicity of the environment. We weren’t allowed to carry water on us, especially if you’re at the cash registers because the regional managers see it as ""clutter""... they’re also extremely bad about giving breaks (even if you ask during your scheduled break time), so one could go 4-6 hours without water. They’re also extremely obsessed with loyalty. If a customer gives their phone number at all, the managers see that as the customer consenting to signing up, even if the customer asks to have their number taken down after the fact. Also, working here, you are supposed to receive a 25% off discount, and that was never applied for me."
bad,"The Managers/TL's will never work with you. Your schedule is never consistent. They keep you around long enough so you won't look for another job, then they will let you go for no reason. They never work with your schedule. Everything is always put off on someone else. Nobody can tell you who you need to talk to. You work EVERY holiday with no holiday pay. They always claim that it was an error with your paycheck but can't tell you who to speak to to correct it. Overall it's a horrible place to work. I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I worked here for two weeks, and it was officially the worst job I have ever had. I am beyond passionate about makeup, hair, and basically anything beauty-related. I worked here while I went to a cosmetology/vocational school, and of course on the side of this job, interned at a local salon (in order to get hours required to graduate school. Keep in mind, this is not the Ulta salon I interned for). They said because there was a salon in the store I was working in, it conflicted with the non-compete agreement and that I wasn't allowed to intern. I wish I could have been told this when I applied. "
bad,"Very clique environment. Too much gossip, dirty store."
bad,"I really don't know where to start with this company and the position. I took this job out of necessity and ended staying longer than I intended. I almost never do services because the location I work at is SUPER SLOW. I am the lowest paid licensed professional in the store. I almost never have what I need to perform facials properly. My salon manager never orders the right stuff for me or doesn't order the items at all. Both my magnifying led light and steam towel warmer have been broken for 4 months. I've been working like this almost the entire time I've been here. Since this location is so slow and I don't have much clientele, managers are always asking me to do things on the sales floor. Things that aren't in my job description. Seriously I hate working here. I should have never worked. It is a waste of time and energy. Customers are cheap most of the time and I never get tipped. "
bad,The attendance policy needs to be changed! I witnessed employees coming to work sick or on the verge of giving birth because they feared losing they’re job due to the ridiculous attendance policy. Employees were unable to use going to the Doctor as an excuse for missing work. I personally missed work for medical issues that started to occur during my employment at Ulta and was later fired.
bad,"When I was hired on, no one told me about picking up the schedule, I wasn't aware of hours that were changed, I was hired on as full-time and ended up only getting 4-8 hours a week due to them owing back hours. Poor, unorganized work environment."
bad,"Violated labor laws, advertised full-time position and gave you less than 20hrs a week, you would not get lunches or breaks, management were disrespectful careless and vengeful, if you voiced a concern, you will be harassed and intimidated by the click of mean girls."
bad,I would give a 0 if that option was available. the management was horrible. do not work there. they will promise you everything and give you absolutely nothing
bad,"Needs to work on management. They are racist. Race base channeling not only experienced for myself but seen apon other employees as well. I love the idea of working in this field, however, they made me feel uncomfortable and unacceptable!"
bad,"Management and staff were childish and immature. Going to work was like visiting my middle school all over again. Played favortisim with scheduling hours for others, meaning I got 5 hours a week working part-time while another part-time employee was over 30. The manager didn't even notify me that I was let go. I had to call and call to speak to the manager and ask why I was not getting hours. She could never give me a straight answer. Childish and petty environment, definitely not worth the low pay."
bad,I was treated like garbage by management and basically forced to quit by making working conditions unbearable on a daily basis. I’ve put my 2 weeks notice in due to the amount of stress they are causing me. One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had
bad,Bad bad bad . Poor management all the way up to regional managers. Yes you may get a discount but all in all not worth it.. Make you do duties outside your area of expertise
bad,I hated working there. The management and communication is awful. Do not recommend. They management are childish and talk rude thing about you to customers and to employees.
bad,Everyday at 1004 you never know what kind of  gossip you were walking into..it was mainly from management.the gm sm and in between.the points system is messed up and the store shelves were a mess and they do re sale used returned makeup..at a discount..its basically a bunch of mean inmature girls in management that hire their girlfriends that are like minded.. They also gossip and make fun of the customers that come in as well..its disgusting ill never reccomend anyone to shop there or work there.
bad,"I am almost 5 months preganant and my general manager is well aware of this. Yet she schedules me one day a week for 4 hours and then takes me off the schedule without even letting me know. She blames it on the store not having hours, yet every time I go in there to shop I see the same exact people working."
bad,"First I was shorted hours on my paychecks. Which took 15-17 days to finally be allocated the hours I worked. And when I talked to the General manager she told me “Ulta isn’t a pay your bill kind of a job” “this job is just for the discount” I had to threaten getting a lawyer to get paid. Then I was told by the general manager that “ I’m bringing drama into her company. ( I just wanted to get paid for the hours I worked) so I finally got paid for the hours I worked and I asked to transfer somewhere else because the management there was beyond poor, she told me not to worry about it that I was terminated. But I was so done with all of it I didn’t want anything to do with 1490 anymore. Then a week later I got a call about missing a shift I was scheduled for which was weird since the GENERAL MANAGER said she was going to terminate me anyways. But she didn’t have a valid reason for terminating me so she told me I was fired so she could schedule me until I no called no showed enough for her to have a reason. "
bad,"I was harassed everyday while out on bereavement after my mother passed and when she was sick in the hospital. The manager at the time asked if I would go check on her grand-daughter that was born, since I was at the same hospital. STUPID"
bad,"From the moment i was hired i was treated so poorly specifically by the managers. they where rude to me about any questions i had, when i was never trained for the register before they made me stop stocking duties. I was belittled and verbally abused. they slipped notes on my register to tell me to stop telling customers about their unused points to get discounts on the purchase, because they said it was loosing them money. which is morally wrong, the customer had a right to know about their own Ulta members account benefits. I cried every day after work until i finally couldn't take it anymore."
bad,"worse place to work , im full time n they keep cutting hours after 3 hours if its slow they send u home "
bad,"A typical day at work is the Main Manager and Salon Manager talking negatively about employees and even customers loudly in the back of the store. Odd favoritism would be in place sometimes as certain girls would never wear makeup and its not a problem But when someone else doesn't wear makeup they are threatened with a write up. Girls who couldn't color match or do their own makeup were promoted to high beauty positions without the skill. Harassment from managers towards certain employees, the list goes on. I don't know if its just the ULTA I worked at or if its all of them"
bad,Kinda had to kiss tail to move up and Waaaaaay too many employees for a TINY store ... No way to advance with a company like this and very double standard in who gets by with what  ..
bad,"ULTA’s demands are ridiculous. They expect a million things from you with little pay and they barely let you take a break. They even expected me to come into work once during a snow storm. They don’t care about their employees, only making their sales goals and being the top selling store in their region."
bad,"In short one makes more working for the retail team then they do working for the salon team. Schedules shift constantly and management is not very LGBT friendly. Insurance is sub par and all hairstylist must claim their tips. "
bad,Management was very condescending and showed poor judgement. I stayed there because I loved helping people but not the job. The lack of respect for employees and the extremely low pay were the deciding factors for me. Horrible place to work.
bad,Working with Ulta gave me the tools so I can advance in my career.I worked with Ulta for 2 plus years until I had my daughter. It was a great temporary job but not long term. Unless you make it into management.
bad,"They kept sending agency associate home ,poor communication, making promises they couldn't keep and they enjoyed waisting our time. The supervisors were just disorganise"
bad,There were too many managers who didn't know what their actual position was or who they were really in charge of. They were very rude and unprofessional.
bad,"ULTA is a horrendous company to work for, They changed managment and District Managers very often, the turnover its extreme and they will wrongfully terminate you if your personality does not match with your District Manager, extremely unethical. They have various cases against them in the EEOC, you been warned."
bad,"management needs some help. the job itself is great to work for, it is a very fun job, wonderful employees, typically pleasant customers, but the managers really don't treat you like they want you there."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. They did not have opportunity for growth. My mangers did not communicate with us well. The overall company didn't really care for  us
bad,"Need better management, better work life balance needed, turn over is a huge problem.  Overall culture was terrible.  The District at the time was terrible, late for her own meetings, did not drive or encourage at all."
bad,"Retail "
bad,Truly just a selfish company. Dont get sick because they'll fire you. They act like they care but will drop you like its nothing. Will hire anyone as manager
bad,"You may not be paid by commission, but they will definitely schedule you based on commission. Their sale goals are impossible for their demographic..."
bad,"I didn't last long working HERE. Esthetician for 5 years now and even though i didn't knew the products in less than two weeks i knew alot,but the lack of material and only having a room for two Skin Therapist was very uncomfortable and sharing on her part wasn't a good experience to begin with,and also i just find out that online you can book your pro but i only had two services under my name and her name was on ALL the services ,no wonder i didn't had clients.Never working for this place again and the salary for and license Esthetician is to low."
bad,"Management at this location was terrible, no one knows what they're doing. They also play favorites, they hardly gave me any hours. Never gave lunches or breaks on time. Even had some girls work on their lunch and breaks with no choice. The store is also a mess."
bad,Worst company to work for management is corrupt and does not recognize true talent!!! Too high expectations versus not enough clients for all the stylist they employee
bad,"If you think you'll get free makeup you're wrong. I've been there almost 4 years and work my butt off and maybe ONCE have I gotten gratis. They don't work with your schedule even if you have RELIGIOUS restrictions. They give no hours, no paid time off and no paid sick time."
bad,in the beginning ulta was great! then as i started working there for a few months i noticed after all it wasn’t. managers pretend to care about you when they don’t. plus if you are NEW beware you will feel left out and unwelcomed all the girls worked together for awhile so they were all close and wouldn’t include u in anything..
bad,Comfortable environment  awesome Great nice friendly people   Team work  work with schedule. Learned a lot  like helping people.  Great experience.  Gave me experience
bad,"Not a good place to work, no support. The management is young and inexperienced. We did not have a salon manager for sometime because the current one we had stepped down to make more money as a stylist."
bad,Horrible management and stuff. Not a place for someone fresh out oh hair school. They do not like helping or training you. Racist and rude management. belittles staff
bad,"There were many empty promises. During hiring the Manager talked about how employees get ""gratis""...which is free product so that you can give accurate/truthful recommendations to the customers. However, the manager would only give gratis to specific employees and would keep the rest for herself."
bad,Ulta was a social place to work you gain great customer service skills. You learn about different products. Management was not the easiest to deal with. Hours were flexible great if you are going to school and need a part time job.
bad,"the management was hired by friends, so there was no open door policies. There was a lot of favoritism in this place. The staff had no idea what was really going on."
bad,not a good place to work at.  didn't like how they ran things and it was unorganized where at the point where customers didn't like coming back. it reminded me of high school.
bad,They do not care about their employees at all they do not value nor appreciate you they will cut your hours send you home early and so much more. The managers are also quick to throw anyone under the bus just to save their face.
bad,This is the worst place I’ve ever worked! One week was working 30 hours only to have them cut my hours to 12 hours. Made it almost impossible to get my bills paid!
bad,The starting salary was random for different people (2 people could have the same experience  and one would get minimum wage to start and the other $9.25). You get treated better if you're friends with the manager. Rules depend on how much you are liked and they are bended unfairly.
bad,"Ulta treats their employees bad, there’s favoritism, nomopportunity , and management is terrible , numerous incidents have happened with the managers and no does anything about it , for $8 in Orlando you Don’t even have enough to pay rent"
bad,"unfairness, no paid vacation, poor management, nobody cares, no room for advancement, big turnarounds, always dealing with new people and training,  Managers work for their managers and only care for their pay raises. Unfairness is the worst part and not hidden."
bad,"They hire people based on looks, the discriminate everyone who walks in the door daily. Management is caddy and childish, a lot of bullying goes on behind closed doors. No one supports you fully. They talk trash behind your back. Ignore you just because, push other peoples jobs onto you because they don't want to lift a finger. They are always on their cell phones and constantly talking bad about employees on social media along with guest who would frequently visit the store. I would not recommend working here to my enemy."
bad,"Management is terrible, high overturn in staff, terribly inconsistent hours, lowest pay ever. Just don't work there, it was the worst job I've ever had."
bad,Manager actively discriminates based on age. Wages and hours were poor. One of the worst jobs I have ever had. The culture was absolutely horrible and mean.
bad,Mangers would tell stylist how to run the salon and they have no experience with a salon . Making stylist do work displays and mangers on the floor would try to make you stock shelves .
bad,"wow, the people are terrible, the coworkers are terrible, you get 15 minutes to eat, you rarely get hours, no benefits, and you have to promote subpar products"
bad,"Working at Ulta was a horrible experience. Everyone talks behind everyones back, constant drama with everyone, management is a joke, management treats everyone like trash and takes advantage of them. They play favorites. This is definitely one of the worse jobs I've had because of the environment."
bad,Management is a bunch of catty women. No one is appreciated. Lots of favoritism and who you know. Horrible hours. No vacation time or holiday pay. Rude customers and employees
bad,"There's no room to grow or learn, management is very bad , miss a day for good reason you don't work for a week. They don't try to get to know you and there is a lot of gossip and favoritism."
bad,Was hired in at the brow bar and was told I would get 20 hours a week which was a lie. My hours were constantly cut and shifts changed without my knowledge. I was lucky to get 2 shifts a week. Did not feel like an actual licensed professional. I would have managers telling me how to do my job when they are not licensed and can’t even legally do my job. They treated you like a regular store associate and not a licensed professional. All they cared about was budgeting for hours and making money. Did not care about individual employees and how they can make ends meet with low hours. There is no opportunity for career advancement.
bad,"Compared to where I am now, Ulta pales in comparison. They didn't give me an equal opportunity and didn't provide proper training. Management made me feel like it was all my fault. Also commuting there was an ordeal at times. Other colleges felt that too. And we got little in return in terms of perks. They seem to hire too many contractors. And it seemed like only after a year they would be hired on permanently. Which is not good for morale. Life seemed depressing being there, to say the least."
bad,The staff picks on you and management is very rude. Not all Ulta locations are bad but my location at arrowhead sure was. I was given false promises and it feels like high school all over again.
bad,I would never recommend working at ulta. The management is awful. The company is awful. They’ll tell you you’ll be in prestige but you won’t ever be there.
bad,"I wanted to love this job so bad! If things were different, I would. First of all, it's the loneliest job I've ever had. The employees are very cliquey and make me feel like an outsider. The employees and the managers talk down to me in such a condescending way, they act like I'm an idiot. The pay is terrible, the hours are even worse! I'm lucky if I get to work two 4 hour days a WEEK! I can't survive off of that. They said they could have us work up to 30 hours a week, but evidently only the managers get to have that. They base our scheduling off our Loyalty sign ups. If we don't reach a high percentage of getting customers to sign up for the loyalty rewards program, not only can we get our hours cut, we can also be FIRED. Um, most of the customers I ring up are ALREADY signed up. I manage to get a few people to sign up, but if I'm not able to sign up someone who flat out refuses to sign up for anything (regardless of it being free and getting free stuff on occasion) I get punished for it! And sometimes I'm not even on the register, they would have me run go backs the entire time! How can I possibly get my percentage up if they won't even schedule me? IT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. This is a terrible way to run a company, it's completely unfair, and clearly this is why I'm having to look for a new job."
bad,"I worked for this Ulta for over a year. The management in store, along with upper management was terrible. Many managers were fired or let go. The yearly raises are ridiculous, I got a grand total raise of 17 cents. There is no room for growth with this company because they always turn to outside hires. The only thing that is good about this job is the discount. If you love makeup or frequently get your hair done then the 50% off services and 25% employee discount (with occasional extra discounts) then this would be a good part time job for you."
bad,Nobody properly trains you. If you are in school then you can forget about working much because they will not work around your college classes. They do not care about their employees so if you ask to work more they will not let you.
bad,"The management was biased, rude and unprofessional.  Management scheduled me every weekend for 5 straight months and wouldn't allow me any time off, however the managements favorite employees often received time off.  My numbers and sales were  higher than my co workers and they still gave my position to them."
bad,"The managers are bullies. I do my job well, I have a great clientele, my area is always clean, I sell a lot, there is so reason for management to treat me the way that they do. I'm constantly picked on."
bad,"Would not advise to work for this company. Extremely political, favoritism moves you forward and having your own voice will get you terminated. Ulta is an unhealthy employer."
bad,I worked there for 4 1/2 years and they treat you like garbage. No benefits. No paid time off ever. Even as a manager they don’t respect you whatsoever.
bad,"Was never trained, educated myself on products prior to working here. Any benefits or compensation were a joke, and they were completely unable to work with my school schedule when that school schedule was known and acknowledged at the time of my interview. No opportunity for growth was offered or discussed, granted I was only there for a short time, it was still something that was never brought up."
bad,They're racist and rude. I would never recommend for anyone to work here. I loved my job at first but quickly began to hate it and they clearly show favoritism and love to accuse you of stealing!
bad,Ulta has a retail side and salon side. The retail is all they care about. They make fake bookings for the salon just so the salon looks busy. They send you home when not busy. Pay is below 200 a pay period. Ulta expect their stylist to live off $200 for two weeks until you build a clientele.
bad,"The only good thing that came out of my job at ULTA was meeting some pretty amazing people, other than that I was underpaid, overworked and it is INCREDIBLY difficult to move up with the way they have their whole spa pay deal set up especially as an Esthetician. I was the #1 Esthetician in sales in my area and after a year was still making minimum wage. I literally couldnt survive. Only take this if you are in need of experience in general but just know you will be getting paid very little and you will be expected to work the floors/ fill in for other people and such."
bad,Definitely one of the worst companies that I have ever worked for. Poor management from the top to the “bottom”. No room for growth. Management plays favorites and If you’re not a favorite then you’re out. Working 50 hours a week and still not good enough for the company expectations
bad,Don't waste your time working here. The pay is not worth the trouble. The schedule is never correct. Management is horrible and rude. No room for advancement.
bad,Not a good work environment. management at this location is very childish and verbally abusive to employees. Its a nice store and location but overall the management makes or breaks a job and this one is horrible.
bad,"This company has so many bad qualities. It is completely about favoritism, very small room to grow! No health or any kind of benefits even if you have full time hours. Very bad with scheduling and having enough staff on busy days."
bad,I think this place has really bad managers who don't take care of their associates and have a difficult time communicating with the staff they also have a ridiculous amount of rules that don't really make sense.
bad,"I really did not enjoy working for this company it was very clique-y and the management was almost non existent. This is a wonderful place to shop, tons of awesome products but staff/management is less than that."
bad,"I was lied to from the get go! I applied ONLY for a lancome beauty specialist. I was told that I got the position that I applied for. and was guaranteed $16+ an hour. So I put my 2 weeks in at my previous job when I received that information. That was double what I got paid at my other job. Well Ulta would not work with my 2 weeks at my other job. I had one week left of my 2 weeks, when I finally got to start my ulta job. They wouldn't allow me to work my other job. After 3 days of work with ulta and having to work ungodly shifts. 6pm to 3 am?? I was told oh you actually didn't get that position and this is your position, and you pay is only $9. I had 2 days left on my 2 weeks with my other job and I made pretty much the same at my old job but my other job filled my position and I already did an exit interview so there was no staying at my old job. Ulta management wouldn't take my direct deposit for ANYTHING! When I got my check they skimped me 2 hours of pay for work that I did do. I was LIED to from the get go!! I have worked retail. I have worked in beauty. I have worked in a better retail and beauty position in every way. Management at Ulta was the worst I've ever experienced. So bad that after my 3rd day of the management lying, I quit. After I quit I got harassed for 2 weeks after by management. I am honestly scared to even walk into an Ulta anymore because of the harassment that I received and the treatment I received from management. I have resorted to shopping at Sephora, and I HATED sephora. but sephora has never treated me like ulta treated me. I can't believe a huge"
bad,"*Stressful"
bad,"terrible hours, poor management , okay pay, rude coworkers, dont help work with your schedule, ZERO training, not fun at all and no makeup training at all, basically you only know with what you walk in with"
bad,They don’t train there employees and management is a joke no one knows what’s going on in there if your a favorite you can do whatever call in half the week play on your phone all day
bad,"Horrible management. Raises are not common and promotions are not based on how hard you work. Regardless of what your scheduled shift was, they would still require you to stay after if they wanted more done. If you did not stay, they would write you up for shift abandonment. I once stayed from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. during a truck shift. The worst place I have ever worked in my entire life."
bad,"The Manager at Ulta would schedule me on days I specifically asked off and I had to remind her constantly that she was mesing with my other job, so I ended up having to quit because of this."
bad,"cutthroat and competitive, unfriendly coworkers, high school like drama, unreasonable hours, hours cut, extremely stressful inventory and truck days ."
bad,"That's literally all I can say about it. I was so excited to work there. I love makeup and I'm a huge people person so it was perfect. But I quickly realized that the job was just awful. The hours were inconsistent, you have points stacked against you if you call out sick or for an emergency. I was in a hit and run and called in. I was immediately ridiculed for it. It is a very hostile community. It has no sense of friendship or community. I soon found out that people quit for the same reason I did."
bad,"My last manager was horrible. Was never there, took every weekend off, never closed and expected the rest of us managers to do her job but she would take credit for it. She was  lying, conniving, and manipulative. She would lie to each person and say that no one liked them and that everyone came to her to complain. I also found out that she bad mouthed me to the DM and another GM to a store I was trying to transfer me to. One girl and her boyfriend were actually harassing me and she laughed about it and said she couldn't do anything about it  at work and through text. HR is rude and won't do any extra work to find something you need. And when I took my exit survey, they asked if I would liked to be called about my answer and I said yes, yet no one called. Shocking... They do not care about their employees. This is a HORRIBLE company to work for."
bad,"You’ll want to find a better place to work. If you’re sick and you call off, you’re made to feel bad. You show up to work sick, you’re also made to feel bad. No gratis for the employees, they end up being testers or someone else in the staff gets it. They don’t really care if your commute or the weather gets in the way of you getting to work on time, so be prepared to get written up. In the winter it’s so cold in the store that I feel sick in the store and perfectly fine when I go home. The aestheticians, I feel, are treated unfairly because they are asked to do waaay more work outside their normal role and on what I assume is the same pay grade a beauty advisor is on."
bad,the company does not care about employees. they are underpaid and overworked. there is no room for creativity or artistry. There are little to no benefits for associates.
bad,Let go due to new management clique. My entire life was this job and I am heartbroken. I love Ulta but  upper management needs more checks and balances. Write ups were processed without my knowledge and HRs ‘investigation’ went nowhere. At a loss.
bad,I worked at Ulta part-time as a college student. The manager was horrible and emphasized sales of the roller lash mascara so that she could get a bonus. I later found out she was fired for denying girl's their lunch.
bad,"Managers were high school girl mean and created high school drama. The girls that participated in the drama got decent hours. The girls that didn’t got 4 AM truck shifts. We were constantly threatened, and not getting enough customers to sign up for the rewards program in a day was worthy of a write up and could ultimately get you fired. Dress code was heavily enforced for some girls and never enforced for others. How kindly you were treated depended on who you made friends with."
bad,"hated it."
bad,"Worst job. Never again. Thank god i got out of there. Poor management. So disorganized. Horrible pay for all the work they have you doing. Never call off, and if u do expect to get yelled at."
bad,"awful manager for store 374 - I worked my butt off and new hires who were 10 years younger than me where making at least $1 MORE than me - never got a ""yearly"" review or raise while I was there and was constantly treated like I was replaceable. Not a good company to work for."
bad,I could never work for this company ever again. It is very unprofessional and quite frankly a very closed minded company. They do not respect their employees and take advantage of them. Management style is not for me.
bad,worst job ever I would never ever recommend this job to anybody management is horrible and pay is even worse no possible way you could ever meet impossible goals
bad,"Management was very much unprofessional and did not offer the team support. Most of the team had never worked with makeup or retail making it a great opportunity to train properly, offer support and coaching however; this was not provided at all."
bad,This company really has a way of sucking out your soul.  I wasted my life there because for some reason I felt trapped.  Almost like an abusive relationship.
bad,"They really take advantage of new employees. Those who stock are scheduled to work from 8pm-12am and have new employees work that shift for the first 2 weeks. However, there was not 1 shift that ended at 12. We typically worked until 2, sometimes even 4am and then they scheduled me to open at 9am and we weren't allowed to leave until the work was finished. In my case they had me work that shift my entire span of employment. I requested off and they scheduled me anyways. The management was very disorganized and unfriendly. The pay was terrible for the treatment and schedule. I have not stepped foot in there since I have quit."
bad,Management was difficult to work wth. Lost many hours due to their policies. not very considerate to their employees.Would never go back to work there
bad,Ulta is a very untrustworthy company to work for as they base everything on favoritism. I work for the company for over a year and don't feel equal. All manager are lairs and don't stick to their word.
bad,"When I started working at Ulta, the hours were great. But when I would talk with one of the male coworkers, the management not only scheduled us on different days and docked my hours. My managers were all women at that, so there was too much estrogen flowing. After two years there, I didn't even make past $9.00 hourly. No benefits or paid time off."
bad,be careful of management who are racist and bully. the work place was too and it was very hard to advance at all if you were someone who a manager did not like.
bad,"I was a salon manager at altar for six months. They are all about numbers and not the people. Due to payroll issues I had to cut stylist hours down all the time. It was a brand new store and Stylists had a hard time getting people In their chair being it was so slow. Instead of helping them higher management made me cut their hours to almost nothing. Upper management lies..  they would tell you to do things, then smack you on the hand for doing them. When they are confronted they try to twist and turn it on you and make you look like the bad guy. I would never recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,Too many broken promises not enough support Communications terrible employer does not give employees the benefit of the doubt employees are always wrg
bad,I worked as a Prestige Beauty Advisor and cashier. At first I was so excited to work for Ulta but quickly realized that the management played favorites and had no concern for my personal advancement in the company or in life.
bad,"the manager does not care about you at all. most girls there get stuck with only working 4 hours a week. if you're wanting to work there, make sure you have a steady job as well."
bad,Pay is poor and management is difficult to work with. GM is extremely judge mental and has no compassion for her employees- only cares for her own gain. Would not recommend this Ulta location
bad,I had a horrible experience. One Manager made life bad for me and only gave me 3 hours or less and would put me down or say little comments to me. Would not recommend it
bad,Terrible Management at my location.. lack of sympathy for their employees. Care more about making money than looking out and listening to what their employees have to say.
bad,Hated working here. The people are super rude there and working for a corporate business like that is awful. They pay the mangers so much but they don't do anything for there employees. Truly disappointed.
bad,"Management will put out the schedule (with your 10-15 hours), then change it the next day and not tell you, or will text you telling you not to come in or to come in 1-2 hours later or even more annoying, will text you to ask if you're okay with switching your shift to a different one. They will send you home hours early as well. It basically can feel like an on call job sometimes. All management cares about is how many stupid loyalty and credit card sign ups you get. You can be amazing at customer service and selling, but if you're not reaching the stores quota on signing people up for the dumb cards, you're a failure. Definitely the most unorganized, stressful, messiest job I've ever had in my life."
bad,"Ulta needs to stop opening new stores and start working on the internal problems of each location. I also recommend the CEO to call to get on the show ""Undercover Boss"" too!"
bad,My experience as a manager there was terrible it's a very click place if you have an in with someone on top you can do anything you want including  discriminate people And nothing will be done to you
bad,"horrible management, even worse hours. constantly cutting hours. favoritism. fellow employees are friendly and make work place enjoyable but management is terrible and pick favorites and passive aggressively do so."
bad,Poor management . A typical day was doing all the tasks the managers didn't want to do while they sat in the back talking about the other employees with out any assistance.
bad,~ The salon management put down work of the stylist in front of clients when the work was exactly what the client wanted and loved.  ~In my opinion a manager should never make negative comments regarding a stylists work in front of the client.
bad,I spent three years of my life with this company for nothing. I was promised a raise then told I couldn't get it because of a wage freeze... so three years later I was still making minimum wage. The manager they had filling in fired me right after I put in my two weeks notice. We never received gratis while the makeup girls did alllll the time. We were made to stock and do floor employees job when we were only salon. Awful. I have nothing good to say.
bad,Do not work here if you want a life or have a family. Terrible at having compassion for employees or training at all. Would never go back or refer anyone
bad,Horrible place to work. Everyone fights and it is a hard place to work. The GM sits in her office 40 hours of the week. Guests bully you to get their way.
bad,Zero operational knowledge. Company fails to help any of their employees other than General management. Company should be working on their operational aspects of the business instead of focusing on new store openings
bad,"Typical retail; however, if you like retail, then this would be perfect for you. Long hours, weekends, and mandatory holidays. Management does not care."
bad,Honestly  the worst company I've ever worked for.  Company doesn't care about its employee no one is full time except for GM so no one get benefits. Nothing like what you expect it to be .Pay sucks.
bad,I worked in the salon and it was horrible pay is bad and the girls i worked with acted like little highschool girls. It wasnt a good plave to work especially if your looking for something to pay the bills there hardly training and there so much Favoritism.
bad,"I don't have anything good to say about ULTA. The company favors certain employees, they overworked there employees for low pay. I was treated horribly, worked long shifts, no breaks or lunches, ridiculous expectations for tasks to be done."
bad,"Manager is terrible. All over terrible place to work. They don't work with your schedule, very demeaning. Overall rude people, management is even worse yet"
bad,Ulta does not take care of their workers. I am not happy working for them. Very structured and micomanaging. I loved my guest and what i do. Just not where i work.
bad,"The turnover is high and the fact we went through three salon managers should tell you something. All of them were horrible .From being belittled, dealing with petty drama, micromanaged and having being put on the schedule when requested time off, it's not worth the stress. The skin pod is a joke and not spa savvy.  Also, there were times when I was interrupted by guests and even some co-workers during a service.(This is why you should have a room, take notes Corporate)  I also felt I was more of a Beauty Advisor than an actual Licensed Esthetician because I had to help with color matching and stock products. Overall, working at Ulta is ok for getting experience. If you are looking to grow with in the company as an esthetician, don't do it."
bad,"You are expected to build a business with no support , no supplies, and little if any training. This review is for store 721 Midlothian only.  Constant turnaround in this store especially salon manager had 2 managers in 6 months there. This store is very slow and Management is constantly sitting in back doing nothing and expect salon staff to stock retail  and clean if not with a client. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!! Hand and Stone is a much better place  you are treated like a professional not garbage."
bad,"Working here was the worst. They have the worst way of communicating with you. Everyone is always stressed out and cranky. I tried my best to  work with the managers but it took them three months just to tell me i was doing a bad job. How hard can it be to sell makeup?? Three months of no communication, and three months where they gave me 0 hours to work. I called in every week to ask, and even went in store to see what was up with my schedule. They suck, probably the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"A typical day at work involved me stocking shelves, front facing products, and cleaning around the store before customers arrived and we opened for business. Once the store was open, I performed typical cashier duties. "
bad,"Ok, so i decided to pick up a part-time seasonal job just for fun. What I didn't realize the magnitude of work and compensation you'll be getting. So know I just really work there for the discount. However, it ain't all that great either. The reason why I say don't waist you time because:"
bad,the salon is ok if you already have a base clientele. coworkers were great. most were willing to help. level jumping is pretty much impossible. training is pretty good
bad,"I thought I had Found the Prefect Job. Work with make up, everything smells good, Bright and beautiful. But it wasn't. Under that make up is a cold, harsh company that cares nothing for its employees or customers. There are never enough hours. There is no work life balance. If you make more money through raises and promotions they will find something to fire you over. I lost my job two days after Christmas. They made sure to completely dominate my holiday season before they ""let me go"" because of the gift with purchase program. Just don't fall for all the glitter, It will suck the soul out of you."
bad,"You do a lot of work for little pay, the only full time jobs include management, the discount is ok and the management needed improvement in communication"
bad,I was very disappointed with this company and how they treated their employees. The pay for their styists was disgraceful.
bad,"I was a salon manager for 2 1/2 years. They Constantly belittle you and talk down on you. Talk bad about your staff to you and don't want you to say anything. They pay their stylist minimum wage even though these women went to college. They only care about their salon so that they can sell the high-end hair products. They also throw away hundreds of thousands of makeup and hair supplies that they feel is damaged. They also don't recycle and throw away hundreds of boxes and palates every single week when truck comes. They are extremely wasteful and extremely hateful people to work for. The upper part of Corporation is by far the worst. With everybody in the upper Corporation feeling they are above and better than the staff in the stores. They never try and get on the same level or do the things that we do to see what would make it better or right. They fired me for a made-up reason, when I had had zero disciplinary the entire time I worked there. I was the longest-standing salon manager where I worked I was the only one to get a stylist to level jump and I was the only one to retain the salon staff in the location I worked for. And the funny thing is, their upper management reached out to me within a week of losing my job telling me I would be a perfect fit for Ulta, and had I ever thought of working there. Lol!! I could have made the ulta where I livr something amazing, and I put my heart and soul into it. But they didn't see that or care. One mistake and you're gone."
bad,"Hire to many people "
bad,"If you can drag someone to your chair to pay $40 for a haircut and maybe $140 for some color, by all means, ulta is the Place for you!!! "
bad,The atmosphere stinks there! They think because they work at Ulta they can treat people like garbage. Soon as you walk in you get the higher than thou feeling. Manager there is backstabbing and doesn't care about bit about her employees and the fact they have families. Do not apply if a parent.
bad,Worked very hard over the seasonal times for this company. Management didn't know how to use every employee to get the most out of the 12 hour shifts we were there.
bad,"There was no support from our district management even when we were short staffed in our store and didn't have enough managers/associates. It might of just been our district but general managers kept quitting like crazy. I got very sick from working so much and being so stressed out, there is no training, company does not follow any Human Resources policies, and employees can't get a hold of hr because hr puts them on hold or makes them wait for a ""call back"". Work here to learn WHAT NOT TO DO in a business and how to not treat your employees. Work here to learn everything you don't ever want to be (management) This company will give you all the experience you need to be a strong business person in the future. "
bad,"They only gave me 4-8 hours at week, which, granted, is what they said they'd do until you proved your worth basically, but I was there for several weeks and they continued to only give me the bare minimum of hours even though I worked my butt off from day one. I also received no breaks. I have a new car I have to pay for, so I decided to find another job. When I quit, the store manager was extremely rude to me. So, yeah, if you're in high school or if you are someone who doesn't have any bills to pay and just want $70 a week, go ahead and work here."
bad,"Ulta was really nice to work for at first but the longer I worked there they switched up management. And the new management they brought in was one of the worst managed places I have ever worked. The managers were mean, rude and often had different opinions on different things (so no matter what you did it was wrong to at least one manager). You could never win. Got in trouble for talking to other employees on the floor and they often took away our breaks, which I'm pretty sure is illegal after working a certain amount of hours. Also, when you don't have clients you stock the shelves and don't get paid hourly cause your commission outweighs it, I had days when I would stock shelves for 6 hours and didn't get paid. Awful, awful place. I hated it. 7 people quit in one day and they didn't even have enough people to keep the store running so had to bring people in from other stores."
bad,"I was hired in thinking this could be a great stepping stone for my future career in a Medical Office, just something to put on my resume.  I could literally only take working there for 3 months.  You only get minimum wage, you only make commission if you reach Ulta's corporate goals they set for you. Having a $1000.00 goal to reach when you first start is impossible.  And with only given 20hrs a week how is it even possible?? I was literally making less then some beauty advisors."
bad,ULTA is run by part time employees! dms and corporate won't do their jobs and investigate allegations but will come in and separate quality managers based on part time employees false accusations.
bad,This was a horrible experience. There is no support District management or the HR dept. Told them it was a hostile work environment and they did nothing. You can't get promoted no matter your qualifications. It's all about whether or not they can manipulate you. They will promos you the world to keep you there but not follow up on any of it. They will promise you one salary and give you another. Cut throat unprofessional people
bad,"Sell beauty retail products to customers "
bad,"The management does not care about you as an employee or a person. You will have to defend yourself endlessly and fight for them to do the simplest things they are REQUIRED to do for you. As a previous beauty advisor, I can assure you, you'd rather work anywhere else. It took them about a month to get me set up for pay and by that time, I quit just a month later. It also took me 5 months to get pay I was supposed to receive for training and helping at another location under a different manager. You get better deals being a beauty insider here than the discount anyway"
bad,"I feel that Ulta is definitely an ambitious company to work for, promotion opportunities are prevelant throughout the stores, but so is the turn over rate. They still don't have fully developed processes and procedures, which can make it confusing for new department managers. They don't have fully formed training programs for their new managers either, so not everyone receives the same or all of the information needed to do their jobs efficiently. The hardest part of the job was trying to do the best that you could with only half of the information and training to go on. I do not recommend this particular location, as the store manager is very new to the position and the company. In my opinion the treatment of the associates is poor and regards for their own personal lives isn't taken into account in everyday business affairs."
bad,"The hours are 2-3 shifts a week. When I scheduled an interview, the managers wouldn't communicate with each other. I wanted to be prestige beauty advisor but they had me as a beauty advisor on the cash wrap. Very very poor management and the communication sucks. They don't care about you and it seems like they don't want you to succeed. They just want you to work."
bad,Had to quit short after I started because I was getting scheduled 10 hours a week. Manager also talked to the employees like dirt
bad,"The most unethical place to work. RUN from Ulta."
bad,"Let me start by saying that I am by no means a novice when it comes to the beauty retail business. I’ve been in this industry for over 28 years and have had jobs as mangers as well as sales associates; therefore I know how this industry runs at every level."
bad,"managers are unreliable, they cut hours like crazy, customers are rude. they dont hire anyone fulltime unless you are a manager because they dont want to give benefits"
bad,No communication between employees and management. You will be asked to be your own receptionist and book other peoples appointments. Which wouldn't be bad if they were more organized. Unrealistic sales goals. Very little continuing education.
bad,The job started off OK in the beginning your promise the world working there as a salon team member only to be given the shaft the management plays favorites and helps out their favorite employee just leaving the others to struggle to level jump there then if you want to give your two weeks they kick you out right there on the spot and refused to give your license to you in fact The manager decided to threaten to call the cops because I wanted to leave with my cosmetology licensethey're not there to let you express your creativity they're there to have you make the millions of dollars they use you and try to take your clients from you they also call your clients after you quit and offer them a really good deal just so they won't follow you I had several call clients call me and let me know what they said
bad,"everything about the job was great, but sometimes it was very long hours an I would be missing my daughter. but overall the management was ok the staff were great to work with."
bad,"Every day was always a great day to assist customers with their make up and hair needs."
bad,I was a General Manager for a short while. The company values pushing product at the expense of the employee. I ran a single free standing store that embraced difference and valued ongoing development. The corporate culture valued pushing sales. They gave limited payroll and asked me to fire employees to cut hours only to hire new ones a few weeks later. I ran a very profitable store with double didgit increases yet had staff cut constantly.
bad,"not very organized, not much payroll, pay is not competitive. very little brand support or training, little to no support from superiors. the stock was a mess. the backroom standards were unrealistic. the turnover in employment was ridiculous. the store was beautiful."
bad,This company is a joke when it comes to a salon They pay you less than minimum wage and expect you to bring them over 30 new clients a month and you only get 20 hrs or less per wk. The Salon manager was not even qaulified based on her poor skill level of doing hair she's very unprofessional insecure and down right rude and plane nasty. The store manager is just as dumb and unprofessional she walks around watching and spying like she's the cops for no reason other than to avoid doing her job. Shes rude to customers and will try to avoid answering questions because she is lazy!!  Any Hairstylist new or experienced don't waste  your time with this company you won't advance but you will be expected to bring them money in the door. Sorry excuse for a salon!!
bad,Ulta does not care about the advancement of their hairstylists. The only reason they have a salon is to allow them to sell professional hair care products and it doesn't matter if the salon creates any revenue.
bad,I had a lot of trouble with the HR department they made me feel very singled out and helpless. I do not wish to disclose much information about ULTA because the company truly destroyed by thoughts on managment in a retail environment and I would highly recomend for people to steer clear of this company
bad,"Cosmetics Store!"
bad,"I was thrilled when I saw that an Ulta was coming to my area. I applied as soon as I could. I was thrilled when I got the call informing me that I got the job. They promised everything I'd want to hear, great hours, job security, gratis and a job doing what I'd love. They had us come in the work 40hrs a week to set up the store for them. We were all happy to do it because we were so excited to be apart of this store. Unfortunately, after the set up half of the girls were cut. Even those of us who were left were stuck doing a job that we didn't sign up for. I was stuck unloading a truck in the back and only got 4-10 hrs a week TOPS. They said that the only way to get more hours was to sell the most stuff, yet they didn't even give us a chance to do that. Only the freshly 18 yr old girls with little to no experience were actually given hours. Not only did I have retail experience, but I have also been a makeup artist for 7yrs. I don't think that my store manager was a fan of my tattoos, even though there is nothing regarding tattoos in the employee handbook and Urban Decay (a top selling brand at Ulta) adds and social media posts display tattoos and self expression.. It was like high school all over again. The manager seemed stressed and out of place. She has no experience in the cosmetology industry and only has managed a Bath and Body Works store before. She acted like that teacher in school who tries to fit in with the ""cool kids"". She was very rude, unfair and unprofessional. It's a shame, because the store could be an awesome company to work for, under better management maybe."
bad,"I never would go back to this company! Unstable hours and management is unreliable and very unprofessional. The fashion island location especially! Management there is very unprofessional and there is favoritism in that store! Take my advice this company you will never grow! I would sometimes close late nights (which would be 10 pm) and the next morning would open at either 6 am or 5 am. There was one time I ended my shift at 9 pm and came back into work at 2 am. The store never had coverage and yet we had multiple tasks to do but not enough hours which didn't make sense! And in the two years I worked there I never really worked a shift of the position I was hired for. I wore multiple hats in that store that I was not granted a raise or a higher position until there was no staff left but there was so much stress in the store. From experience advise people be careful applying here this place might cause anxiety and stress, lots lots of stress. I am currently glad I am not working here my life has been a lot better since."
bad,"RUN from this place, management will work you to the bone and want to pay very little, also management will stab you in the back as soon as they can to make themselves look better.  They will also promote unqualified people over people with degrees, I don't understand their policies on how they can do this."
bad,The company has a good corporate structure if you like corporate salons.
bad,The first month I started working seemed pretty nice but they don't train you on anything before they throw you on that floor! With crazy customer's who steal and belittle you all day no payroll to hire cleaning crew so they slave you to do the job they hire you to do plus all the extra like a house maid  the worse part the salon and the benefit girls had to work double people would interrupt all the appointments they had because no one would be on the floor to help the customers who were shopping for cosmetics I rarely get hours so every prestige sales person works like two days for abour four hours ..........and are very random days they do change the schedule with out notice ... the management at my location was horrible the GM was so rude to the employee's and never was  leading by example she actually would be late take extra long breaks have a  nasty grumpy face all day never wore make up and her dress code never looked porefessional she then never corrects everyone on policy or procedures only the staff that she didn't like ...... I started noticing a pattern on the all the woman she had let go they were all beautiful bubbly personality kind a gals!  The other managers just kinda don't say anything or do anything because they all kiss butt to her and agree with her to stay in good circumstances ......... they lack foundation so the store as a whole is a mess favoritism through management causes the employee's to lose interest in the work place hardly any incentives ...... no where to grow no motivation no raise ..... no hours ......dead end job
bad,"Ulta Beauty Chicago  is not in touch with what happens on the west coast . Leaving managers at the mercy of District management that displays favoritism and unprofessional  tactics, demanding favoritism and loyalty that does not match professional business practices and is derogatory and demeaning when you do  not agree."
bad,"Sioux Falls location is terrible, the management if full of liars and lazy , the GM messed up the store with her terrible management skills, left and proceeded to go to Sephora. I made many complaints to corporate but of course nothing was done."
bad,worst job ever. I recommend that no one ever applies for this job . This company should be closed.
bad,"not a happy place to be, very stressful, Iwould not recommend this business to anyone"
bad,"Worked there for lil over a year and did everything from truck, cashier task and prestige makeup artist. Horrible management who only looked after each other (all 7 of them .....yes 7 managers) , very deceitful making a lot of promises that were never kept. Thought that it's ok to schedule girls who've worked there for over2 years only 8 hours a week and always saying corporates makin them cut hours. Then when getting a second job (cuz no one can live off that) manager bluntly says I don't work with other jobs ... "
bad,"I worked in one of the Charlotte, NC locations and was very excited to sign on and work with a team. The manager made it seem like a wonderful place and that there were so many tools to bring in clients and that you would get paid an hourly wage when you didn't have any clients. "
bad,I worked at the dc for 4 years all they care about is production no matter how hard you work they dont care about their employees supervisors date their employees and give them preferences Fif you dont flirt with the supervisors you get miss treated no matter how much you tell management and HR things will remain the same untill you finally quit...
bad,"Your typical day at ULTA is being mistreated by your managers. in Missoula Montana they have no clue what they are doing and the one manger that did the Prest. Manager they forced out with lies I have watched all of this from the inside and as soon as I can find another job I will live, the GM acts like he knows what he is doing when he really doesn't . Co-Workers are all lazy and your hard work that you get done will be downgraded. The salon is a mess  I have counted 7 people return because hair color was done wrong and want there money back WORST STORE EVER IN MISSOULA  MONTANA"
bad,"Yes, You Can Grow A Lot In Your Knowledge And Artistry. The Trainings Are Great and The People You Meet From Other Stores Are Great. Management Is Extremely Fickle. They Have The People They Like And Those Are The People Who Will Succeed (And These People Change Week To Week)- Everyone Else Will Go A Little Further But Remain In Their Box. The Problem Is They Keep Hiring A Bunch Of Catty Twenty-Somethings Who Get Completely Unprofessional Because They Don't Know How To Separate Their Work Feelings From Their Personal Feelings To Manage The Store. Also, Search Cosmetics In Rockford And You Will See This Rockford Location Is Always Hiring. Not Just Part Timers But Management As Well. High TurnOver Rate  Means Something Is Not Right With The Place. And Usually It's The GM : ) True Of Anywhere. Final Comment - As A Company That Caters To Women And Is About Making Women Feel Good About Themselves - You Would Think They Would Have The Same Work Culture."
bad,"The Prestige Manager is currently & has been stealing products from the Prestige Department of ULTA at the Macon Store #350. As soon as other employees began to notice the theft The GM & Prestige Manager began to devise how they could eliminate the employees who were on to their illegal behavior.  The GM has been covering up for/concealing the Prestige Manager's illegal behavior.  After 2 employees shared their concerns (including proof stolen items by the prestige manager) with the GM, both of those concerned employees were fired without reason, warning or explanation.  Payroll has been manipulated by the GM & Prestige Manager, though the Prestige Manager, as outlined in the ULTA Policy Handbook does not have access to the office nor does she have access to payroll.  The GM is giving her keys to the manager over the prestige department, thus allowing the 2 of them to sit in the office and manipulate employees' time worked; therefore, employees and other parts of management are not receiving full pay nor benefits including paid time off and 401k.  Loss Prevention has been contacted and the store is currently under investigation for illegal activity."
bad,"The Management is unprofessional, disrespectful and not experience in dealing with the guest or the employees.  The management was stealing from the store,lying about the hours they worked, and stole gratis from the employees.  The District manager was also un-professional and rude.  There is no training on policy's or procedures at Ulta so watch out!  Upper management in this company is the same..rude, unprofessional and don't care about the people who work for them..and the pay is awful."
bad,"For a retail job it is better than most I think."
bad,"I decided to write a review, because my new best friend at Austin Peay, recently applied.  I wanted to tell her about my experience and maybe I can help someone else rethink working there.   I was hired in June.   They let me go in July (without notice).  Others left around the same time and none of us knew that we were temporary.   We were all told that we have nothing to worry about.   I was hired as a part of a team to open the Clarksville Ulta store.   I was told that my position was guaranteed/ full time with potential to advance in the company.  The hiring manager relayed that I would be given decent hours.  I was thrilled!  i love make up and haircare products.  I am a college student and was looking for a reliable job that could work with my schedule.  As time progressed, I realized that the managers were lying to everyone.   They were very unprofessional and disorganized.  The managers were always talking behind people's backs.   They would smile to your face and would make comments as employees walked away.   I could not believe that they encouraged that kind of behavior.  It became a belittling environment.  The managers had no experience in the beauty industry.   i had to ask the other girls on the floor questions, because the managers never knew anything about the product lines.  The managers would roll their eyes or act stuck up.  Some of the stylists left on their own will.   They were lied to about the hours that they would be given.   In the process they lost their prior clients.  I don't know if they went back to their old jobs but I didn't think that if was"
bad,"The workplace is slow and repetitive. There's an extreme need of client retention and enthusiastic people to increase overall morale. There are some great people who work for the company at this location, but sometimes others' dampen the mood."
bad,My time at Ulta started out as an ideal job but the longer I was there the more I began to notice it was no different than being in highschool again. There was favortism and was so unorganized you never knew what your were doing or who you were working for that day.
bad,"I didn't like how the sales leaders on the floor would lie to customers about pricing, and promise to give a lower price just to get the customer to by the merchandise and when they got their bill I would tell the customer that they were charged full price, and the sales lead said something different..That was very stressful "
bad,This company only cares about money. they tell you to lie to customers about results of the treatments (at the salon) and what the products give. The manager in okemos- she is an absolute fake. She pretends to care about you but in reality she only cares about herself. She has a major attitude problem. she rolls her eyes and inhales like its her last breath at you when you ask her a question. This is a job I would never wish upon my worst enemies. Do not take this job. In fact I pray you never take this job.
bad,I didn't enjoy working here
bad,"Way too much gossip between employees, you business becomes everyone's business."
bad,i have nothing to really say good about working here. i did like the fact that we had to dress nice i love to dress up. i approved on my people skills
bad,I worked here for almost two years and it was the worst job I have ever had. There were not enough hours to run the business properly. We had to sell customers magazine subscriptions which ended up with them calling us and complaining their credit card was charged for the subscription. The business ran off the comments on a guest survey. You could make 100 people happy in one day but that did not matter because the survey says your customer service is awful. The district manager of the Pittsburgh area is a horrible manager. She is a liar. She will smile in your face and stab you in the back instead of giving you advice and leadership. The general manager is just her puppet. She also is never there and depends on her other management to run the store. I have never had a manager who would call off on a busy Saturday and not think twice about it. Ulta is a mess. It may seem like a fabulous job but it is basically slave labor.
bad,"worked for ulta 18 months, I have nothing good to say about ulta or the benefit brow bar."
bad,"Ulta Louisiana,"
bad,"You should never actually want to work at Ulta, but instead it should be a last resort. Any place that has a 98% women employment is bound to having more problems than you could imagine."
bad,"Poor management, no incentives, do not appreciate the hourly employees."
bad,"The manager was a boss not a leader! there was no direction there, no thank you's for your good work to anyone. A lot of negative comments, a lot of rumors, its just make up it doesnt need to be that stressful!"
bad,"No hours go toward employees, only managers. Schedules change and no one lets you know. There is no direction at all. It's just a mess."
bad,"No breaks Lunch. Heavy workload, with no appreciation. Bullyed by Manager's.4 to 5 Manager's. Make more do less."
bad,"Was not always given the require 15 min, break"
bad,"The reviews here at Ulta are pretty much the same for every store. Absoultely appalling. This is a store for young women that need a first job and don't have anything prior to compare it to. I have worked in other high end retail stores my whole life and this one just happened to open up in town. I will never ever suggest anyone, even my worst enemy to work there. The constant VERBAL ABUSE that every store associate receives on a daily basis is uncalled for. You are constantly watched in the back office on camera and then called to the back office to be belittled by the store manager who acts as though she is drunk in a bar and trying to start a bar fight with you. The most unprofessional company that I've ever come across, the PAY RATE is horrible considering my position. Not a secure job environment, not a good work/life balance, unable to do anything in your off time for other jobs or with your family, there is no job security or advancement because they hire from outside the company because everyone has already left. The store's turnover rate is so unbelievably high because of the way they are treated, even the customers ask about it. The culture and values, well there is none. Compensation, benefits, I am unable to comment because after working there for over 8 months, I still never recieved my 90 day review. A company that has everything going for them, and they have no backbone to help the store associates, and we are the ones that make the store run. The store management is unbelievably innapropriate and rude and I finally wouldn't take it anymore. The gratis is despensed"
bad,"Very corporate, all about numbers before people. If the store doesn't make their unrealistically high daily ""goals"" then they cut employees hours. The whole schedule is based off of this formula. Everyone I work with was guaranteed a certain amount of hours and we are all working about half of the amount originally promised. The pay is bad, they start trying to pitch you at just above minimum wage. The only way you can make money in the salon is if you bring clients with you, and even then, you will get ripped off!! FYI- NO COMMISSION for sales people or arch experts! Do not be fooled!!"
bad,Very catty manager. worked hard no praise just more bs.
bad,"The managers are horrible! it is all about getting good reviews no good reviews no good employee review.really dont care if you get breaks, selling everything in the store when you work for a brand then they bug you all day about numbersin your area after you have been selling curling iron blow dryer shampoo polish tanning products, the manager are lazy,rude, unprofessional and disrepectful they all need updated management classes. And should learn how to speak to people in a professional manner."
bad,"I absolutely love doing makeup, but chose the wrong place to do it."
bad,"Some of the management have horrible personalities. They care about themselves and not of certain employees. They gossip in front of customers about employees, and in several cases, make employees burst into tears. They make fun of customers in front of other customers, and like to stand in a group gossiping about people on the sales floor. Managers concern themselves with numbers and often lose sight of what is important: customer service."
bad,"Management was unprofessional and prejudiced. They showed that they didn't like my appearance, even though I was dressed professionally everyday, and they were very uncouth."
bad,"Highly micromanaged, little respect for employee's, stale working conditions, no upward mobility."
bad,"All of the associates and even managers did a great job of making me feel like I didn’t belong. No one was willing to help me learn about products, and questions I had were often met with silence or catty answers. You are expected to have a full face of makeup at all times, which is understandable... but to be yelled at for not wearing makeup at 5 in the morning for truck is ridiculous. A very toxic environment."
bad,"Management team bullies employees and customers. No sense of teamwork, bottom line is more important than customers and employees. Hardly any training to new employees."
bad,"It is the worst place I have ever worked. Extremely petty and clear favoritism towards staff is notable. I would never ever recommend anyone who wants to make their career better, I would tell you work any place else. If you are not making them enough money your hours get cut, and your opinion doesn’t matter. Anything that is a problem in your work environment doesn’t matter at all. You are treated like just another number of the floor for them."
bad,I.   Love  ulta.    Worke.    Vary.    Relaxsng.   Ulta.   Or.   Evrey.   Evrey.   Prodakt.    Nice.   For.   Slime.      I.   Want.   To.   Go.   There.  Or.   New.   Think.    Very.    Nice.   Think.    Rely.  Ulta.   Osam.    Exsilant.   Oh.   Good.      Ulta.    Help.   Me.    Thank.   You.  Ulta
bad,"Management is AWFUL and i was in a management role. If you are lucky and get to be the manager that does the schedule you will get at least 2, 3 day weekends off per month. Unfortunately when you don't do the schedule you won't get a weekend off for 3-4 months."
bad,Look some where else. I'm a stylist and would never work for this company again. Worst job. Back stabbing. No team management.  Cut throat. All they care about is how much money you bring in.
bad,"I was extremely excited about working for this company and for the first few months under our previous store manager it really was a dream job; she encouraged a family atmosphere and work cohesion and a team mentality. Since getting our new store manager, we have no team work, the store is a shell of what it was, employees call out because they do not want to be there, management makes working almost impossible. The list goes on. There are supposedly Human Resources connections for employees to take complaints to but our issues fall on deaf ears and go directly to our district manager who does not seem concerned about employee satisfaction at all. She cannot be bothered or could not care less that people are unhappy and find no fulfillment at work. I do not know if working at a different location is better but from my experience, it really is just not a good company to work for."
bad,"It's all sunshine and rainbows during your interview, but beware!"
bad,Unprofessional.. They don't promote skillful people. You only move up if you know upper management. I don't have much more to say about the company. Please don't waist your time
bad,"After working at mutliple locations I noticed that concerns taken to GM/DM/HR are often over looked and pushed aside. There is very little work life balance due to the inconsistent schedule, anywhere from 5 am to 11 pm."
bad,Unprofessional work environment. Rude management and bullying in the workplace. No breaks allowed (even though required by law). Do not work here. Worst employer I've ever had.
bad,"was hired as seasonal, they hired WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE, and due to their ignorance they had to cut everyones hours.  i wasn’t told that and was on vacation at the time and had to text the manager and ask her why i didnt have hours. she then told me that since i was seasonal she only had to legally work me 4 hrs every 60 days. so i decided to quit. i then asked about a check for the previous pay period she said i shouldn’t have one nor did she see it. turns out that was a lie  and i had to go get one two weeks later. i am also pregnant and felt very not liked because of it. wouldn’t recommend this job. very shady."
bad,Awful place. Management all over the place. The pay is horrible. No real customer service support. They want you to do a lot of work with little pay to show for it.
bad,"I could write a book on how poorly operated and managed this company is. Just like most retail, they are very greedy with payroll hours. My store had so much theft because people knew only 2 people were working there in the evenings most often. On a normal business day, the average sales quota is between 5-7k. In 5 minutes or less we would suffer a theft of $500-$5000. Ulta’s response? Cut hours because we aren’t making budget. Really? We had a security guard at one point because in the first year of our store being opened, it had been robbed about 4 times after business hours. During business hours were no different. They didn’t want to include a security guards payroll in our budget anymore because ‘we had no theft’. Well, duh we had a security guard.... to prevent theft. What a concept, right? I was a ‘Merchandising Services Coordinator’ which is a part time manager/supervisor, I primarily oversee our truck shipment & stocking. Upon being hired, another full time manager had been terminated (reason unknown) & the position wasn’t filled for about 3 months. I had asked to apply and interview for the position because I was already working full time, my GM told me she would put me in the pool of applicants, but never followed through. Also, our GM was rarely ever in our store due to holding positions higher up in the company and working mostly remote. That left our store with 2 full time managers (one of which was never trained to close nor had open availability) and me, who was ‘part time’. Up until June, my hours were on average 36-39/wk. One day, my team had informed me that"
bad,Horrible management that micro manages everything you do. Annoying just a horrible experience with horrible people to work for. There is nothing more that needs to be said. Rainbow and lake mead location was just horrible.
bad,The job was fun because I love make up and making people feel beautiful on the inside. The management was not too good and I felt Lomé they could have paid everyone more!
bad,Bullied all the time.  People dont care.  Customers dont matter. Customers dont care mean anything but money   worst place to work if you have a brain and feelings.
bad,"If you are new to the workplace or really LOVE beauty this is a good place to start. Otherwise, keep looking."
bad,"I worked in the Ulta salon, first of all they don’t pay you enough!! The management sucks and coworkers are always out to do better than you. It’s a horrible place to work for the small amount you get paid and the hours you work are terrible. Some days your lucky if you get a full 3.5 hour shift and other days your doing overtime."
bad,"Dont expect to get treated fairly if youre not Hispanic!  Supervisors are very young and cluless! They have people training you that speak NO english and then complain when you dont understand. They over hire and send you home early. They do pat down searches like youre a common thief! Ive even witnessed one of the leads demanding to smell a mans breath because another employee saw him at buying beer before work! This place is rediculous! I was a temp to hire, I was never late, never complained and was very good at my job with very high reviews by thier company, and was told that i was on the hiring list and would be hired on permanent. I was very paitent even though they had me train new people and hired them on. And theyeven hired on a hispanic girl that was late almost every day and was repremanded for falling asleep in the restrooms multiple times. taking off her shoes, taking a 45 minute batroom break also constanly being on social media and taking selfies while no phones were allowed in the production area. When I finally asked when was i going to be converted, i was told ""we putting in your paperwork next week""  The next day, They sent a text 5 minutes before i clocked in stating that my Assignment  had ended!"
bad,Toxic environment poor management the General Manager there is lazy irresponsible and a bully she will curse you out for any little thing and she will bully you and hold anything against you
bad,"Whether you enjoy your time at Ulta or not really depends on management. Ulta however is really bad at hiring and promoting managers. The environment can be really fun and chill if you're working with the right manager because some managers will try and intimidate employees to being afraid of talking during their shifts. When I first worked there it was a very happy and exciting atmosphere especially if you enjoy makeup but overtime it can become exhausting and not worth all the hard work. However, it is a good job for part-timers and students. Hours can vary depending on store but towards the end of my time there I was only receiving 8 hours a week (20-30 hrs during holidays)."
bad,"I would only recommend to work here if your going to school...  very clicky environment the associates that are “friends” with managers get away with doing the lest amount of work are very rude and bully you .. the environment at times feels hostile and store management doesn’t deal with it. I work in the salon and i would say I’m pretty booked. I’m also expected to stop what I’m doing ( have one clean hand) to answer the phone, and let me say sometimes people call with the most random questions and just steal your time .  Do laundry , and clean those nasty restrooms nightly.."
bad,"As a manager, we spend the majority of our time under staff and doing task. While I enjoyed Ulta my first year and a half many policy changes and management have made it difficult for many employees. The raises are somewhere close to 14-25 cents after a year of hard work. You are underpaid, overworked, and no matter how hard you work underappreciated."
bad,"Not only does the company not care about whether you have a life outside of working there, they also don’t respect you. I’ve was harassed, belittled, and have experienced racism by the managers while working there. I don’t know if it’s all Ulta’s that are like this but the one on 86th street definitely is. There’s no room for growth there. If you apply to be a beauty advisor you could also be put on the schedule to work an overnight which is 9pm to 6am. Also because you’re a beauty advisor after working the overnight shift you can also be scheduled to work from 11am to 5pm ON THE SAME DAY. This is a bad company to work for so if you’re applying I hope your experience is better than mine. Good luck!"
bad,"Cons: Staff come and go here as the management makes you feel that you are interchangeable.  You have to carry a clear bag with all your belongings, so you can be checked out by a manager more efficiently every time you leave the store --- humiliating. "
bad,"They’re a lot of problems with working here but the main cause is POOR MANAGEMENT. I have worked in retail for 5 years and hands down this was the MOST unprofessional, stressful, and just down right horrible environment I have ever worked at. They hire managers who are unfit to run a store and have no sense of management at all. And good luck trying to voice ur opinion or try to make suggestions to make everyone’s job a little easier because it will go unnoticed."
bad,"We worked less than 15hrs a week,  poor management in the salon, and no communication with management whatsoever horrible location to work at (Rialto)"
bad,"They exclude employees from gratis, they have favorites, and hire more employees when they don’t have enough hours for everyone. I do. Not receommend this place."
bad,"Management didn’t make anything clear during interview. Once I began to work everything that was said during the interview was all a lie, hardly any hours were available. Management was awful at communicating, and the environment was very uncomfortable and I could tell that people were being treated unfairly. Managers had their favorites and only gave them hours. Very short breaks also made it a stressful environment."
bad,"I learned on my own basically you get a day or two of training, supervisors could care more about there people and when things tragically happen in your life, lots of gossip from Boss to Boss plus they also share your private business with employees as well, they also have there favorites . Its sad how things have changed somuch there for the worst, you dont have a life working there, and if you dont look like something out of cosmo then you wont get offered a chance to move up, they should fight for there employees and care about how they are doing"
bad,"Worst retail experience ever. No work/life balance. DM is not knowledgeable or supportive. Cattiness towards external hires. Unrealistic expectations. Payroll hours does not match work load and it continues to shrink. No follow up on concerns or confirmation if issues get bubbled up. Huge delay in essential supplies, critical items on back order or never received."
bad,"I was basically working to gas my car to go to work. I do not recommend, at least not at the branch I was at in Hyannis. I met a couple great people but other than that, I was not happy there. The discounts good though."
bad,"If you put the work in you will be okay. There are some great discounts and you meet a lot of great people. If you take trainings from prestige account managers, they give you some free products to try out."
bad,"Honestly working at Ulta would of been fun if i had better management but my management was horrible. Corporate didnt really care and they played favorites and it was constant drama at that company. I had to leave because of all the drama management caused, very unprofessional company."
bad,"When on payroll at Ulta in Cincinnati, OH there was always scheduling errors, poor management and miscommunications. I don't believe that manager is still there but was very hard to work there while also in school since the schedule was always incorrect."
bad,The lack of professionalism is out standing! Favoritism is completely obvious. The Store manager is incompetent while working here I constantly had to remind them of laws. They were super shady! Encouraged racism and harassed and bullied employees. Human Resources was also no help and constantly let the district manager get away with illegal activities. Worst place I have ever worked for.
bad,Lower management runs the show. Their work load is ridiculous due to poor upper management. This place is clicky. Hours are inconsistent. Prestiege girls run the registers even though they are suppose to be hands on with assisting customers with make up. This location is a disappointment to Ulta Beauty's name.
bad,"The management isn't even knowledgeable about beauty so that's a huge issue first off. It is a very hostile, cutthroat, gossipy, environment. I received no training so I had to ask my coworkers a lot of information in my early days and it resulted in it gossip about me not being as educated as the other employees that have been there (obviously) so I made mistakes which led to them cutting over half my hours. There is no room to grow within this company and when asked you are told they will train you on things (prestige beauty advisor) only to find out other employees have been waiting for months for the same training and a position to open which have been filled from the outside in. There is zero communication between management and staff and I feel like its very unfortunate for those who want to work at Ulta to grow and learn."
bad,I didn't care to work at Ulta I was only working 4 hours a week while being cut so only got to work two hours a week most of the managers were very caddy rude and clicky. The store was never organized and never had enough staff.
bad,"Not a friendly or fun place to work, for a very specific type of person. I knew nothing of make-up and applied just for some summer money between semesters at college, and these girls were all extremely high maintenance and I felt I was the only one willing to ""get her hands dirty"" to get the job done."
bad,"I haven't dealt with this much of a lack of professionalism in a long time. "
bad,"After several years I have seen the good and the bad. While the health insurance and 401k are awesome, the pay rate is not. Counter managers, stylists, and Estheticians are grossly underpaid. There are no performance based raises. Everyone gets the same pennies every year no matter how good or bad they are."
bad,This was my second job out of esthetics school. My general manager was fantastic but my salon manager was horrible. 10 hours a week was a joke. That isn’t enough to build a clientele or live off of. That and the pay was a joke. I had to have a second job.  You only got commission from services. I sold 400 dollars worth of product and saw nothing from it.  It left a bitter taste in my mouth.
bad,"I was a temp to hire, not clear training, and never hired because 'I asked if I was going to be hired after 4 months and it was a 90 day contract to hire'."
bad,"The managers did not listen to any schedule availability. They constantly scheduled me on my one unavailable day and made me find coverage to take off on that one day when they scheduled me to work. The supervisor was rude, and showed favoritism. There was a lot of gossip among the employees, which I personally find distasteful. I only worked there for a short period of time due to the poor management and scheduling. I do not recommend working for Ulta at this location unless you are able to look past that. And no, you do not receive free makeup, although the discount is reasonable."
bad,Working for Benefit the Brand is one experience and a quite pleasant one for the most part. Considering your are working within the walls of Ulta your obligated to follow the Ulta way before your own brand in my experience. This can go from good to worse simply with the change of management. Management can completely change the atmosphere and sadly turnover is quite high. The benefits are lack luster in comparison to Ulta em[ployees.
bad,"As licensed professional you cant make money  with this Coropation iits not designed for stylist to win althought during on boarding you sell that lie...impossible your mainly working as a retail associate to keep your hours. senoir leader DM is a complete idiot and very racist  retail managers are incompetent with salon life barely can function in their own roles completly out of elements with hair world but have plenty to say ..no structure very unprofessional with no leadership skills turnover with salon staff is terrible due to no support, and low wages i would t recommend  ANYONE to work or shop with tnis company"
bad,"I was working as Lead Developer at Ulta IT department. The environment is very hostile and micromanaged by non-technical managers who works as a technical dev managers/Director. They are never clear on any requirements and directions and expect you to work on a project which does not have any clear requirements. The project timeline is decided without requirements and ask to give estimates and prepare a design which needs to fit within the given timeline while project requirements are still not ready. HR department is just for namesake. Even if you perform good, gets good feedback from business stakeholders / cross-team you work with, if your director does not like you, he will interfere during the performance review. To work in IT department and grow, you don't need to be a technical person, the only thing you need to know is how to manipulate the things. If you have those qualities, then go for it."
bad,aweful upper management. no room to grow. work day consisted of high goals that no one could reach and if they were met no praise was done for anything!
bad,"I worked in the salon as a ""Designer"" (fancy word for hairstylist). Not only was this the worst salon I have ever worked in, but it is also  the worst retail store I have ever worked in. The lack in communication in management is unbelievable. They treat you like a thief from day one, you have to carry a clear bag and you have to get searched by a manager every time you leave the building. They are always watching from the cameras. I once got called on the phone from our district LP director telling me to ""stand up!!"" Cause he saw me sitting down. The pay is minimum wage. The turn over rate is incredibly high. They don't like you being ""friends"" with your coworkers. And they do training classes for the hairstylists that specifically teaches you how to over charge your client to get bigger ticket prices. No morals."
bad,Working for Ulta Beauty was a big eye opening experience for me. Your heart definitely needs to be in it. You can't work here if you are a slow paced moving individual. You've got to be fast on the feet and quick to learn.
bad,"Very very slow store, and sales expectations were unrealistic. Crazy stuff going on like management stalking associates on social media to try and get them written up. Doors were not opened for employees until exactly opening time, yet we were expected to be there at 10 minutes till, to be prepared for our day?  Morale was very low, due to management looking for something wrong with every employee every single day. It was too the point that many of the employees felt anxious everyday going to work. If you like being told one thing one day, and having another manager switch it up on you, then this is the place for you. No one is ever on the same page. Rules are made up as they go along. Promises are made to employees, and not followed thru on. For example if someone goes to training out of town, and is promised reimbursement for expenses, then they should be paid in a timely manner. Nope not this store, employees were made to wait months, to the point that a new training session would be approaching, and they still had not been paid! and I am not talking about $50 it was more like $200.  I could go on and on, but I think that anyone reading this will get the message loud and clear. These had to be the most unprofessional group of people I have ever experienced."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,I would not recommend this company. I had no life while working for this company. I worked every day of every weekend and every holiday and was given a hard time when I tried to take my vacation time.
bad,No hours.  Co. over-hired for grand opening and now has no hours to give their people. 3-5 hours a week isn't worth the time or gas to go to work.    We were told to apply at Charmin Charlie's next door if we want more hours.  Its terrible the way people are disregarded and the schedules come out at the very last minute as in the day before the work week starts!  Very unprofessional place.  I feel used.  Looking for another job!
bad,poor management. Hired over 40 people & did not tell employees they did not have hours available never when store opened. Employees laid off with no discretion
bad,"When I interviewed at Ulta, I made it very clear I wouldn't leave my current job for less hours, or less pay. At the end my interview the manager said she'd let me know by the end of the day if I would be hired on. She called, a week later. I was assured my pay and hours would not be a problem. After putting in notice at my other job, I still had not heard anything about training or orientation up until 2 days before I started. This should have been a clue as to how business was handled, but I was excited and chose to ignore the warning signs. I was hired on as a cashier, and also to help put the store together for grand opening. At orientation, a few of the girls found out they had only been hired on temporarily. The first couple of weeks were 38 hour weeks, working hard to get the store set up, products out, etc.We all worked hard and thought we'd benefit. After opening, everyone's hours were cut to anywhere from 6 to 12 hours per week, not just certain people. A manager who was leaving told me not to ever expect more, and that this was typical in the Ulta world. Shifts were 4 or 5 hours, not long enough to get anyone breaks or lunches. Schedules were not posted until Wednesday night or Thursday morning, so you weren't even sure if you had the weekend off to make plans until then. Also, they check you every time you walked out the door to make sure you weren't stealing. It became such a  hassle to get checked that I left everything in my car (purse, debit card, etc). Management questioned every little thing. One manager would tell you one thing, one would tell you another."
bad,"I've only been working here 2 weeks and I hate it! My manager is so weird, she keeps giving me negative feedback without elaborating so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. She was so unorganized and unprepared at orientation, its hard to take her seriously. I'm pregnant and sometimes I'm in pain, she tells me I need to be more urgent. I worked 7 hours yesterday and only got a 15 min break. She purposely scheduled me on the 1 day i told her i needed off for my doc appointment. She just keeps doing weird little annoying things. The store is unorganized and all they care about is sales. I'm a prestige consultant and my manager is always wanting me to focus on a particular brand to sell but that would be biased and unfair to customers, why do we have all these brands if I can only sell one? I asked her for training in Clinique because we just got a new Clinique bar, but I wasn't trained, instead she just stuck me over there for an entire shift without a clue about the brand. She's always asking me to do a bunch of things that no one else ever has to do. She makes me feel singled out like I'm the only employee there. I only have fun at work when she's not there. And since im new there are alot of things i still dont and when i ask they treat me like im stupid for not knowing. No one except one manager ever cleans, the break room is disgusting. I'm quitting as soon as I can."
bad,no benefits and poor management/ managers dont lead by example and they gossep amongs each other and too much drama and most of them are too comfortable. they are always hiring there friends or relatives......
bad,"If you like to be under appreciated, verbally abused and bullied then this job is for you. Otherwise stay as far away from this company as possible! The job duties were a lot of fun and the guests were wonderful, but the manager makes it unbearable. Unrealistic sales goals, constant harassment, and she forces you to make guests uncomfortable by stalking them. You are regularly reminded you are on camera, even though you are doing your job well, she just likes to let you know she is in control and watching you. I watched so many wonderful and talented co-workers leave because they knew they deserved more. The turnover was incredible! I recommend anyone considering working for this company, at least at this location, look else wear."
bad,just horrible. corpoate is a mess. they have no idea what is going on with anything.
bad,"Ulta is a joke. I was a key holder which is now a merchandise and service coordinator which had 80-90 hrs worth of work and I was only given 25-30 hrs a week. I would get cut or less hrs then asked why my work was not done. When I was there, I would be stuck doing things around the store and helping people on the floor because we only had 2 ppl in the entire store."
bad,"Warehouse work is not for everyone was not for me."
bad,"Management sucks, and it's all over the place. There really is nothing else to say... I think what I said set it all. But I have to keep on writing to make 150 characters."
bad,"In context, this was one of the worst places I have worked for but it is a paycheck. If you have a love for makeup/hair or even in doing sales of such, this place is for you. But at the same point, I have to point out that there are a LOT of faults with the Management at the store that I worked for."
bad,"I have always loved Ulta but working here left a bad taste in my mouth. The managers play favorites, they cut your hours and tell you last minute, and they never allow you to do more. All I’ve done is stay at a register. With only a 15 minute break. The environment is beyond toxic. Customers! These girls talk badly about you on the walkie talkies! And when you call out the behavior you become an outcast There’s bullying and they make you feel like you don’t belong there. I’m hurt because I loved Ulta as a company but this was a job that drained me emotionally and mentally"
bad,Very poor and unorganized management. Your hours were based on if everyone liked you or not. Management was very unfit for the positions and very immature and did not follow any guidelines. Newer people got offered hire salary than you even if less experienced. Always drama and unprofessional people. They mess up the hours and blame you for everything. Would not recommend at all.
bad,"I'm not sure that other markets were run as terribly as mine but the town over alone speaks for itself. No work life balance, border line abusive practices."
bad,"The manager knew nothing about Dermalogica or about the skin therapist role in the company. All of the products were expired, pungent, and sour. Things were dusty dirty dead bugs everywhere and nobody had clean this area of the store the hole for five months while they were looking for somebody to fill the position and then they expected me to still use expired things on people told me to do the best I could"
bad,"It used to be a wonderful place to work with energetic coworkers. However due to shifts in management and a terrible guest experience manager and prestige manager, the turnover rate there is astronomical. Also everyone feels like they’re walking on eggshells or have done something wrong, the culture there is an unfriendly one now. It’s sad to see somewhere so happy and bright turn into such a depressing place"
bad,"Worked like crazy at the holidays and was only paid hourly despite the clear amount of commission I should have earned. Management always had some excuse of why I didn't make commission-each time was a different made up issue. Made 1500 worth of business- my take home should have been at the MINIMUM 650 and recieved a check for my 40 minimum wage hours instead of what I had earned. Also my tips were somehow added into my overall earnings and the store took those as well. When I brought it to attention of the District manager she was horrified- said she would fix the issue but it never happened. I quit after the fourth wrong paycheck. My friends that also worked there had the same issue, only one girl held on and the problem was fixed SIX MONTHS afterwards and she never got any of the money she was owed- not one cent."
bad,"If sales goals are not reached, part time employees get penalized/punished by losing hours. Full time employees automatically gets the better schedule with peak business hours. Absolutely unfair management tactics. Management inappropriately communicated issues to me about other employees in the store. A harassment claim I made was not taken seriously and/or handled correctly."
bad,Words cannot describe the mess this company is. I worked at the Hoover 1396 store and it was literally the most awful experience ever. From drama to discrimination to poor management the list can go on and on. The only thing that kept me there were the other employees. Our hatred of management kept us together. If you are ever thinking about working there. Don’t.
bad,"Poor management, pay and lack of advancement. Upper management lacks field and hands on experience. Cut salary costs and increase productivity. Not reasonable."
bad,They were paying me $3 less than everyone else in the store because I had transferred from a different state. I told 4 different managers on 7 different occasions about my availability and it was only fixed on the 7th time. They only care about customers and couldn't care less about employees. Highest turnover rate I've ever seen in a company.
bad,Management knows nothing about skincare nor marketing for it and the tracking is ridiculous. They pay low and treat esti’s poorly. The IDI training can be beneficial.
bad,Management is horrible. Most of the sales associates are high school kids and it’s hard to motivate them to work. The location I worked in had a huge amount of grab and runs. Very aggressive shop lifters 😩 we never felt safe and would not get us security
bad,upper management on your back micromanaging and doesnt let you do your job to thefullest! when you have a salon and the manegement doesnt understand the buisiness you lose good candidates and staff yet you are held responsible.
bad,"* Was in charge of store operations both retail and salon"
bad,"Compensation not worth the toxic work culture, managers  are inexperienced,  being a hairstylist of 20 years my experience was under appreciated, also they make it very hard to level up"
bad,The turnover rate for this company is insane. Managers at multiple locations are bullies! You have no work like balance. If you have a issue with your managers and you call HR they find reasons to let you go. Overall a horrible place to work for. The salons new commission  is bogus and they make it impossible for you to move up as a stylist.
bad,"The worst and most unprofessional company i’ve ever worked for. The GM was horrible no customer service skills rude to not only customers but also employees and when i reached out to our DM he said he was too busy to address some situations happening in the store. Managers are very unprofessional and choose favorites, talk bad about other employees when they’re not around"
bad,"Worst decision I've ever made. Management is very uninvolved with employee development I literally got no training because I didn't( fit in). Workplace feels like middle school! So much drama and pettiness. If your not (popular) they will fire you or treat you like such an outcast you'll want to quit. Looks are very important there if your not a blonde Barbie the look down on you.they only like certain types of girls working there.unprofessional."
bad,General manager dosent know a thing about beauty!! Treible management!!!!!  All the good people left the store.. They dont pay attention to the customers. Self absorbed little girls!!
bad,Ulta is a very corporate company. Management is run so poorly and you get promoted based on who you know and who sucks up to who. They don’t see you as more than an employee number and if they don’t like you they will watch you until they find a somewhat reasonable reason to fire you without warning or they will make working so bad that you will leave whatever happens first. I would not recommend anybody to work there very rude in management and love to keep employees uninformed.
bad,"District Manager talks about other managers behind their backs. Does not follow thru with company policies and plays favorites with managers on her team. It is clear that you need to go against Ulta policy in order to keep her happy, because she makes so many exceptions for the store teams and other GMs that trying to speak up is a joke. Super unprofessional."
bad,"My coworkers at the time and even now were all stuck up. Basically if you were pretty enough or didnt wear a full face of makeup, had your hair dyed you werent ever invited to outings, didnt get enough hours, honestly everyone was fake."
bad,"Working for the company was stressful because they put a quota on the location as a whole to meet, in a town that doesnt have the community to make such high quotas."
bad,My store was really sloppy and gave me the least amount of hours because I was very young at the time. They never trained me or told me what to do or how to do it.
bad,Its a growing company and understand their demographic and how to retain sales but it lacks in support for sales team and management. Not a good experience. Managers are pulled in too many directions and it makes for a non productive work environment.
bad,Horrible upper ups. All are dishonest and retaliation exists if your not apart of the cult. Only good thing is gratis and tips from clients. Hr is a joke!
bad,"Exciting in the Beginning when you start makes you feel super welcomed. But that’s just the beginning. Mostly all managers have a attitude and barely communicate with the team. You never know what to do, especially if this is your first job. Beauty advisors are not allowed to do makeovers, only Salon Staff. Job description is pretty much stocking shelves before the store opens or you are put at the register during your shift. This takes the fun out of really enjoying working in a Cosmetics store. Hours were also a big problem here. You were lucky if you even got 20 a week. Most days 2-3 employees would be sent home due to the store being over hours. It’s not worth working at a place where your hours get cut and pay is only $10/hr. No type of benefits for part-timers only a store discount."
bad,"Im currently still employed with this company, yet I do not recommend it for others. There's a lot of workplace bullying. Its difficult to hit commssion. They dont keep their word. Our break room is actually a storage room with 1 chair. Theres roughly 30 employees. So we often have to stand to eat our food. And beware if you do hair. You arent allowed to have your water in the salon( even though all the other employees have their drinks out) and if you havent been there for 2 hours or have a BREAK on the computer. You get yelled at for being in the back drinking water or snacking."
bad,Would go into work and have coworkers come up to me telling me so and so said this about you and it was filled with drama. Management did nothing after I reported many incidents of it
bad,"It was like going into high school again, very unfriendly staff. Everyone was cliquey. The discount was decent but not good enough for me to continue working at this company."
bad,"Worst menagement ever. No respect, appreciation. That was the worst time work with the horrible  menagement..........................................."
bad,"As a company, Ulta has extremely high expectations with little to no training, no guarantee for hours, poor communication, always understaffed, and has no control over professionaism in the workplace."
bad,"I wish I had enjoyed it more bc I love the thought of the job and the actual job itself, but the management was terrible and we could never keep Associates for more than 2 weeks because they would drive them away. They have no appreciation for their employees whatsoever. No room for raises or promotions. They talk down to you like you’re a child. I’m sure this isn’t all stores, but ive heard a lot of stores struggle with childish management."
bad,"If I could give 0 stars I would. The only reason I worked here for the 4 months was because of the discount. They would schedule me 1-2 times a week and if I requested a day off, they would schedule me on that day specifically then tell me I had to get it covered. Coworkers and managers are stuck up, rude to customers and don’t work together. It was my second job so I had a specific schedule and they didn’t follow my availability."
bad,"If they got rid of their DM and promoted from within it would be worth it. But they don’t promote internally, raises are a joke, as a stylist we can’t keep product in, our schedule is never right, we get pulled from our paying clients constitintly to help people find a shampoo from the floor. Super unprofessional. Would never recommend"
bad,"Ulta had very poor management, and there was an extreme amount of bullying taking place, including towards myself. Management never did a thing except take sided which was my reasoning in leaving."
bad,"I was here on contract, and they released almost the entire team at one shot. It is your typical service desk, where we only supported Point of Sales devices."
bad,"There are never any hours to work, management unorganized. Not good pay.  Other employees are fun to work with. Ok discount. Overall find somewhere with hours."
bad,"This company in fresno at the distribution center is filled with drama,"
bad,"If you're a new cosmetologist, I would not recommend starting off at this place. They claim no experience necessary but they throw you to the wolves and expect you to know everything as a beginner hair stylist. The managers aren't really concerned with your job security nor are they worried about helping you make advancements in your career as a hair stylist. All the managers care about is what money you're bringing in and how many ulta credit cards you get people to sign up for.  The pay is trash, the hours are good until they find a reason to cut them at any given time. I gave this place a chance despite the horrible reviews and I regret it. You make the smallest mistake and you get bitched at about it. Instead of helping you succeed, they just treat you like damaged goods."
bad,"Managment didn't care "
bad,"There is a lot of illegal activity going on. Not only at this location. But at many. And if you speak up about it, they find a reason to fire you. The managers higher up are aware of this as well as HR."
bad,"Management wasn't great! They made the Salon Professional go on the Sales floor to sale product& be a stylist at the same time"
bad,Only benefit for working at ulta is learning products and gratis. The girls are awesome and sweet. the hours are terrible when working at ulta and you most definitely dont get paid enough
bad,I would never recommend working for ulta to anyone. I feel as though the management could be better at handling certain situations like favoritism. you have managers that are so far up each others bum that they don't see how negative one manager is to associates. I do not stand for bullying and that is why i left.
bad,"Sadly, management is not supportive of their employees what so ever!!  Instead of allowing their employees to actually work, management could usually be found in the office watching the employees on camera, while critiquing them in their headset on what they thought was wrong.  The management did not let out much rope for the employees to actually successfully do their jobs."
bad,"GM has NO clue how to schedule, for example will schedule 8 hours one week 15 the next does not know beauty products at all, cannot answer questions for customers, takes lots of time off."
bad,"Not only is the Hilton Head Island store messy and dirty all the time (because the workers their think it’s beneath them to clean) but the management staff is all young and dumb. It’s sad that to go into a store that was once a lovely place, so bright and cheerful! Has resigned itself to being dark and sad. The people who work there don’t like their jobs, and complain all the time. Never again."
bad,"no breaks given when needed, worked over lunches and always had to clock out late and not paid for it. the only thing that was good about this job was 50 percent off of hair salon and skin care services."
bad,"This place left a horrible taste in my mouth, although I worked in a call center instead of a brick and mortar storefront, I can honestly say that the stores aren't any better, based on the calls I was receiving."
bad,"Ulta st first seemed amazing, but the more I worked the more I saw how unfit it was. They would tell us to resale used make up. They had favoritism letting a managers family memeber work at our store and they would slack on the job, sleep, not show and show up on drugs. Sadly they gave him the most hours but not the people who would put in the effort and time for them. Will walk over employees sadly.."
bad,"The training I received here was absolute trash. Came back the next day only to be chewed out about not doing the job right. I got maybe 15 minutes of training the 10 hours I worked my first night. My supervisor was a lazy looked like fresh out of college good for nothing. The line lead had no intention to help either, she just wanted to kiss up on the sup. The co-workers however were great and all mostly agreeing that the training sucked. This was a job I needed for fast cash and would never make a career here. Lowest paying cherry picker job in the area. Also not to mention the check ins and check outs at the security kiosk, absolute waste of time, could barely make it out on my only break."
bad,"Rolling Hills Ulta is an unpleasant place to work. Don't work there if you are looking to advance or succeed. The managers there are cutthroat and will sabotage your advancement."
bad,"Most enjoyable was new products and teaching clients. Hardest part was managing lost prevention. Management was a lot of favortism, and purposely low pay."
bad,Ive been working at ulta since 2015 and its been almost 2 years since i started. this job has made me depressed given me anxiety and it is completely inconsiderate to your work flexibility. They don't know how to schedule properly or accommodate to your schedule.
bad,"I have never worked in an environment where there has been as much drama as there is at ULTA. It is not even the employees, its with the management and mainly the GM. She is very unprofessional, very negative, has favorites, and is never at work for events not anything major we have in our store. Last week five people put in their two weeks notice, if that doesn't say something I honestly have no clue what does. I think this needs to be addressed."
bad,"A typical work day at the ULTA in Frisco, TX consist of me doing three peoples jobs at once because they were never properly staffed. I often had to work 3 different registers just to keep customers patient(not happy), a job I feel I cared about more than most of my store managers. I learn many marketing and project management skills as well as enhanced my own excellent customer service experience. The hardest part of my job was know I work for people who did not even have the respect of their own colleagues. The upper management staff were more immature than the associates. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to gain insight into the many facets of the cosmetic industry I so heavily take part of."
bad,"Training was not sufficient, and asking questions more than once was looked down upon. My position was eliminated without any notice and the distribution center I was at was favored towards the male managers."
bad,"I worked there as a seasonal, I love the job itself except the managment is really unprofessional. They are really rude to customers and to the employees. No leadership what so ever and they always complained about one another and how they did not like each other. I received a lot of help and guidance through other beauty advisors whom had to learn everything on their own as well."
bad,"Very unprofessional work environment.  Management only care about who they are friends with and constantly talk down to everyone else.  They did nothing but sit in the back office and eat pizza, then never hesitate to criticize everyone else and ignore good work."
bad,"Human Resource says there is an open policy but there isn't one they take to 3 to 4 hours questioning you and tell you to write a statement which I didn't know its your right to deny writing a statement, they try to find any little thing to give you a final they are not honest at all. The head of Human resource even gives you dirty looks just to try to get information out of you."
bad,Don't waste your time going to work for this company although it's a great place to shop it's an awful place to work. They don't treat you with any respect and as a manager they couldn't wait to get me out of there and I assume because they had to pay me for my experience but didn't want to take anything I had to say into consideration and instead listened  to the Stylist who were hired and only wanted to complain. The first store manager we had didn't have a clue about what she was doing and said in her office talking about other people behind their backs. The next store manager came in and acted like she was going to change everything in a day and she was the all-powerful store manager but everybody was upset in the way she was handling things and within a week I walked out the door and never looked back. They treat their employees not like people but like grunts.
bad,"booming during holiday time, any other time it is hard to  make commission. The prices are extremely high so patrons are reluctant to come back into the  salon and patronize."
bad,I started at a really bad time. We had all new management and my week of training was completed in 3 days. The on boarding process was not very advanced.
bad,I honestly hated working Ulta. The best thing about it was the pay.. I was getting paid 10/hr. There was an extremely high turn over rate. I was only there for 6 months and i saw numerous employees and managers come and go. I will never work there again.
bad,"I loved my job but hated the management and the lack of professionalism, the racial profiling of customers and staff,also the favoritism between the district and general managers. This company would be amazing if it's staff followed the procedures set in place. And pay the associated better."
bad,"Management was not at all upfront with hours, responsibilities, or even a weekly schedule that was workable. After researching the company I thought Ulta would be a good fit for me, unfortunately I was wrong."
bad,"By far the most disappointing job I've had. I loved everyone I worked with but the management drove us all insane. They micromanaged every task. forced us to stay hours past our schedueled time, gave people 40 hour week periods without full-time benefits, and favored certain employees. And that's only the beginning of problems that occurred"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Low pay. As a stylist when someone brings in a coupon, it comes out of your pay. Worked to death and no pay. Since you are on commission, they will send hourly employees home and have you stock the front without pay. You only get paid if you are doing hair. If you are the last stylist there at night, you are left to clean the whole salon by yourself. Store front is filthy."
bad,"Management sucks, is very rude and has no consideration for personal life. They will cut your hours if you're not selling enough/getting emails. Not worth it."
bad,"Regional manager would come in and completely scold everyone due to his stress levels. I was working literally 13 hours shifts, because no one wanted to work for this company longer than a month. I was appalled at the structure of the company's methodology. I am one of the hardest workers I have ever came across, and I still was never able to accomplish 25% of the tasks that were assigned to me."
bad,"no communication"
bad,"I was responsible for tracking sales for the prestige cosmetics department. Training team members on new product and makeup application techniques. I  absolutely loved my specific job! However, I did not agree with the ethics or management style of this company."
bad,"The company and management does not operate in an ethical fashion. They preach their ""values"" although they do not exhibit the minimal behaviors through their actions towards their employees."
bad,"Of course you'll still have a social life because you'll only get 5-15 hours per week. NO benefits. Associate discount is great, but there is no job security. They randomly let people go due to ""budget cuts"" and the pay is unreliable. One week your check will be $300, the next it will be $15. Not a job to have if you have bills. Its a teenager job at best. The management is rude, condescending, and always on two different pages so if you do what one manager tells you to do, you will still get reprimanded by the next. Schedules are given out whenever management gets around to it so you can never make plans around work."
bad,working for ulta was a JOKE. the hours were scarce your hired on as one thing but end up doing another. It was so frustrating working for a company where there store hours determine if you will get hours the nest week. one week i would get 29 hours the next week id have 15 because i was been sent home almost everyday. The pay is alright but if you wont work enough hours its not point in driving in! i spent most of my checks putting gas in my tank. I did like the management for the most part and the employees but i didnt do my job. i was stuck either on the register or doing things in the back but we were expected to meet a very high sales goal every day.
bad,"I had no idea what my job actually was. I was working in two different departments, but no one else was. It was so confusing. I had no idea when I would get a paycheck, even after asking. I had no idea when new schedules were put up (again, even after asking). The employees all acted like it pained them that I was asking them questions when I needed help with something. They all constantly rolled their eyes/huffed and puffed at everything. I worked on truck a couple of times, which wasn't so bad, but no one would talk to me or help me. This one girl would literally point at something if she wanted it from me instead of asking for it. She would talk to everyone else. The way they all acted was extremely rude and hurtful."
bad,"The company does not care about the people who work on ""the bottom.""  This was the worst job ever!"
bad,A typical work day consist of one manager and one associate working through out the day. Management was unorganized with no communication them. Constant associate schedule changing without notice. Very unorganized company that does not stand by company policy and no structure.
bad,"Most the time i didn't get a break when i was at work. The mangers were really bad, they wouldn't stand behind the employees."
bad,The overall concept of ULTA is a great idea. They could learn a lot form Big box retailers. They have a good selection of cosmetics/hair care products that fit everyone's budget. Corporate executives made it impossible for a work life balance.
bad,I enjoyed the professionalism from the cosmetic vendors and learned a lot about business. It was a good company to work for when it was privately owned. I wish I would have left when it went public.
bad,I went here as my first salon after I graduated. I had a horrible experience. Management is typical retail and the salon manager at the time was unprofessional. Stylist reprimanded in front of clients all the time just no real salon value!
bad,"A very ""Corporate"" company. Management cares very much about themselves and takes care of each other. I have never been at a corporate company with so much drama, rumors and favoritism. Welcome back to high school, or maybe junior high. They rant and rave how well the company is doing quartery yet salary employees are expected to put in ""what ever it takes to get the job done"", and hourly employees do not get a bonus, everyone pretty much get a 2-2.5% raise not matter what you give them. All this means nights of not getting home to see your family. Minimum work day for most is 10+ hours."
bad,ULTA was def a stepping stone for an esthetician coming out of school. The hours were terrible and asking for a sat or sunday off was impossible. Its 40hrs in the location i was at but the GM would always send me home because ULTA wasnt making its goals for the employees pay. Still to this day have no idea why that was! My steamer was used when i first started at ULTA (I started when the new store opened) but the steamer would spit very hot water on clients and i complained many times and they would send in my steamer which would take a month to get back to me and then it i receieved my steamer back it was as if the package had never been opened and was sent back the exact way i sent it and sure enought it was the same steamer and it had the same issue. No one inculding the GM and salon manager knew nothing about skin care or dermalogica it was very hard for someone to help me out when i first started especially since i didnt know very much about dermalogica. It was not a great experice and for 8.00 an hour is not worth it. They tell you that you can commission which means which ever is greater they will pay you ONLY PROBLEM with that is that they constantly disount your services usually by 50% so you have to work that much harder to compensate your reg pay. I loved my co workers it was a fun girly place to be but at the end of the day it wasnt worth my stay of 6months. And the ulta in abq NM cant keep an esthi employed for longer then a month since i left.. I wonder why that is! Just saying:) I dont like to be negative and i am thankful ULTA took a chance on me coming out of
bad,"They don’t care about hiring from"
bad,"I strongly would not recommend working at the Ulta beauty in Concord,ca. The moment I told my General manager that I was pregnant my hours imitatly had been cut I was working 30hrs a week and they got cut to 9-12hrs each week."
bad,Been here for 3 years and only gotten a 50 cent raise since starting. General and regional manager are both 2 faced. Wont promote you when deserved. Been asked to be trained and they wont. There is a reason the turn over is so high and that's because they treat you like garbage.
bad,"Lots of promise for improvement and training, no delivery on promise. No schedule balance. Management is some of the worst. Low ethics and support from corporate management."
bad,One of the worst companies I’ve ever worked for. Our time cards were regularly adjusted to better fit company expectations of hours. As management we were to lie to customers about supply and product lines.
bad,"I met some really wonderful people working for Ulta, but also some of the worst. Yes my immediate co workers were amazing and the relationship I was able to have with clients was wonderful; the higher management was awful and it seemed they found joy in not helping us advance. They constantly use loyalty and credit card numbers against you. They will cut your shifts and not help you advance even if you are the best candidate. Or in my case...just let you go."
bad,"I love the discounts, the education but there are too much bad attitudes, favoritisms and HR didn’t care if you complained about management talking bad about their employees. To me that makes Ulta not a good place to work.  I love working with everyone there except some managers who are stuck up, disrespectful and Racist."
bad,I truly feel Ulta would be a great company IF you are brought on into the right store. You get the wrong GM and you will hate life. There is no work life balance and your life outside of Ulta doesn't matter to them. The free merchandise and discount is nice though.  You might just have to sell your soul for it.
bad,This place is the most toxic Warehouse environment I have ever worked in my life. And I have worked in a lot of warehouses in Indiana and in Wisconsin. I would never ever recommend working here. I worked here for 2 years and during that time I was barked at and told to  go faster but my supervisors had no idea of how to do my job and how to tell me to go faster.
bad,terrible company.terrible HR when reporting issues. incorrect pay. slave labor. when trying to report a problem HR takes managements side. when you bring a discrepancy to managements attention they start taking you off the schedule giving you 1-2 hr of work a week.
bad,"Talk about unfair favoritism. If you don’t totally suck up to the district manager you are most definitely going to have a hard life working here. Schedule is upside down at best, you won’t be listened to if you aren’t a favorite suck up, you definitely won’t get promoted, and the expectations for licensed cosmetologists to produce sales is insane and does not meet industry standard for them to make any money. Additionally they expect you to make money for them and meet a ridiculously high sales expectation with less than 20 hours per week and to top that off, they force you to sign a non compete so you can’t work at any other salon while you work there or after you leave no salon within a 10 mile radius. The ONLY perk as a team member is the free education and the ONLY perk as a manager is the benefits."
bad,Do not apply it is not worth it. Ulta distribution center is a joke. I got fired for production on my 30 day review and I hadn't even been there 30 days. The manager I had was terrible. He never spoke to me except to tell me how lousy I was doing. The training wasn't enough. They expect you to be perfect the first day they started me on picking the first night then pulled me off because they said I wasn't fast enough. The manager sat on a table and watched us work. It is like evey every other warehouse they treat people like filth and cast you dirty looks humiliate you. It's an unhealthy hostile work environment. I will never shop at Ulta again. I can't give money to their Godless organization.
bad,I am very thankful for my opportunity at Ulta. I enjoyed working with my co-worker and getting to help all the clients was fun. I learned a lot about current makeup brands and received some brand training. I was hoping to meet more brand vendors but did get to meet a few in my 6 months with Ulta. I think the managers mean well and are very nice people but they were not on the same page or did not communicate effectively. There was always a lot of confusion with in managers and shifts didn't seem to run smoothly.
bad,"This is not a good company to work for. They do not care about the employees so much so, the discount/gratis is not even worth what they put you through. Lousy management, unrealistic expectations, never received training, not flexible. Go up to the Ulta you would be hired at, and observe the work dynamic. All Ulta employees look dead inside for a reason. And don’t let them trick you into doin overnight truck, that shift will never be rotated and you will be stuck there until 5am with no breaks, lunches, etc. every week."
bad,"I worked at Ulta as a salon manager for just under a yr Hands down the worst work environment I have ever been in. Poor management,  bullying,, favoritism and all around lack of professionalism. I regret the day I accepted the position I should mention that the majority of associates and management are so consumed in drama they had little time to focus on their jobs"
bad,"It was super fun at first but then it gets super stressful and your hours are not consistent, problems do not seem to ever get solved, catty co-workers sometimes. The pay is not worth getting yelled at by customers."
bad,"The management was horrible. They were not supportive, would gang up against you, and sit in the back room and bash both customers and employees. I have personally seen this multiple times."
bad,I never knew this statement to be more true but people work for people. As I love the people I work for - at Ulta you are just a number the higher up. With very little support. Its really unfortunate cause the company draws true talent but their inability to pay people their worth and support their employees. It causes a high turnover.
bad,The management made it hard to move up regardless of how you worked or your work ethic; my co-manager was a family friend of my DM so she did nothing and still moved up. it is a hard company to work for regardless of how much you liked the pace or process and items.
bad,"going into this job, i was super excited to work around makeup. in the interview, i was told that the job was part time and very flexible. i was hired as a seasonal associate. it all sounded so good but I never knew that this job would be too good to be true. training was good but i wasn’t scheduled one day of training and i missed A LOT because of it. was basically thrown onto the floor and cash register with no prior experience or proper training because i missed the day where they went over everything. I usually learn as I go when working so I expect a lot of hours when I first get hired somewhere so I can learn the job. my first week, I received probably 10 hours while all of the other girls got 20 or more hours. managers claimed there was no favoritism but it was obvious that favoritism played a big role at ulta. if you don’t sell enough credit cards-you’re basically not good enough for the company. so during those 10 hours, i worked on cash register and i just shrugged my shoulders hoping I’d get more hours eventually. but three months later my hours kept getting cut to 4 hours A WEEK. sometimes they would call you up before your next shift and say “oh we don’t have enough pay or hours so you’re off for your next shift.” Well if I had bills to pay, then that would’ve been a problem. Also pretty sure that they cheated me out of some money because I was unable to clock in one shift and my manager said that it was okay when in fact she never clocked me in and my paycheck was lower than expected. Anyways, there was WAYYYY too many problems with working at this company. Part-time"
bad,I feel like ulta uses their employees for what they need and then throw them out when they dint need them anymore...I was told on a daily basis how good of a worker I was and how much they wanted me to get hired on and then one day I go in to work and they let all the test of the temps go. So I feel like they made me feel like I was going to get hired on so that I would keep working hard and then when it slowed down they threw everyone away...and they also screwed me out of money
bad,"Ulta overall does not produce good management, which makes for a bad team of associates. The girls become cutthroat when vying for better positions which makes for a really uncomfortable work environment. If you have a second job it’s almost impossible to get any type of assurance of a set schedule, then you are reprimanded when they go against your availability. The management tends to retaliate by not giving hours."
bad,During my time here there was a lot of turnover. Employees would go on their lunch breaks and never return. The management team that I worked with was awful. There was so much favoritism and they were very demeaning. I would never return to that company or let recommend someone else to work there. I even struggle shopping there 10 years later now.
bad,"Demanding ,overworked,  bullied on a daily basis . Disrespected by management and the entire HR department. when you report others for dismissing the policies and going against them just to bully and belittle you . Hr will do absolutely NOTHING they will dismiss you when you develop very high levels of stress from working for this corporation, that does not stand behind core values or their policies.  They will dismiss you, because you're replaceable  . They will find someone else to break and use and bully. Women should be empowering and empowered , but unfortunately ULTA beauty does not stand for that and they will NOT do anything if you are bullied and harassed at work or discriminated against ."
bad,"Upper management needs to wake up and stop all the bullying that"
bad,"awful place to work. fire veteran employees because they make too much money, turn over rate is through the roof, had to walk on eggshells every day because of poor decisions made by management"
bad,"I have worked as hair stylist at Ulta for almost 5 months. Uneducated managers, and unrealistic expectation. I personally did not appreciate the way managers were talking to the associates."
bad,"When you work for ULTA you have to also deal with Jealousy, favoritism and competitions "
bad,"On the surface and in the face of the public Ulta seemed like a great company to work for.  However after working there it is clear that is not the face.  There is little to no work life balance, company policies are blatantly broken and management has zero control of the store."
bad,The pay of $8.00 an hour is a slap in the face for licensed cosmetologist. The “beauty advisors”/cashiers and other positions are paid more.  The other employees assume we make our hourly wages AND commission but that’s not the case. It is either or. Tips are added to check and then taxed making your take home pay extremely lower. You are expected to convert customers from sales floor to salon guest but usually just end up doing the beauty advisors job. Commission on product sales is a joke at 2% and only if the person receives a salon service. No commission on sales made while trying to convert guest to the salon unless they have a service done. Terrible management with lots of favoritism and racism.  Some of the co-workers were very nice and great to work with others were snobby and rude. Management only cares about numbers and money not the employees or their issues. Lack of hours. Can’t get full time only part time and with every new hire there are less hours. No teamwork. Everyone is for self. Lazy salon staff when it comes to cleaning duties. Not the place for single parents.
bad,"At this time the Ulta Beauty I was working at did not have a manager. "
bad,Management sucked the interview process sucked the entire business model doesn’t make sense  the continued education isn’t even worth it the pay was awful and the location I was placed at had no traffic coming in
bad,you couldn't even use your sick time. You didn't get good raises are busting your tail for over two years. No appreciation for employees. Drama created
bad,"Veey slow traffic. Short breaks. Expect to do the work for the store manager and yourself because she sits in the back eating all day. You’re partially responsible for the salon sales as well but its awfully slow at this location, but it could be from the salon managers rude attitude. (All of the stylists, except the new ones, have quit or transferred). Also expect to learn everything on your own because the store manager does not train. She also yells at employees/managers when she’s upset when something isn’t completed, but then again, she’s never around to help. Her and the salon manager are best friends."
bad,"Nothing is more important than marketing.  Nothing.  There is rampant favoritism at corporate which is not based on skills or results.  There is virtually no room for growth.  If you have a high school degree and are excited about cosmetics, this is the place for you.  If you have a college (or more) education and want a career path in a challenging field where your talents and successes are recognized - then do not apply."
bad,"The management at Ulta was extremely poor. In the year that I worked there, I had went through 5 different store managers. The last one was by far the worst and she is still the manager at the location in Council Bluffs. She degrades all employees, and that is why there is such a high turnover rate with employees."
bad,One of the 2nd worst job I have ever have. The management is very terrible. Store manager treats you Like trash and dosent care how you feel. She's always talking down to everyone like your dumb af. Workers just talk smack all the time. No room for growth was the true issue of why I left. I repeat do not work at TOWNEAST.
bad,Lack of communication and lack of leadership from management. Also never appreciated and does not follow company policies. Extreme pressure to push customers for credit card sign ups. Zero flexibility on work schedule.
bad,"Poor work/life balance."
bad,"You would get scheduled about 9 hours a week, even though during the interview they would promise 25 or more.  Then when you come in, you would work about 2 hours before sending everyone home early."
bad,"There was never enough support, our managers didn't know how to manage people. I never felt appreciated or valued, and there was no communication between departments. I was promised promotions and I never received them. The GM was just concerned with numbers and meeting goals. He would pretend to care about his employees just to build moral."
bad,Have to stand on your feet for prolonged periods of time with no breaks/lunches unless you work 8hrs. Too much shoplifting. Also the AC was broken and there was mold growing in the back. Unspoken competition between other girls. A very catty enviroment.
bad,"Yeah you might love the makeup, and want some discounts but it's truly not worth it. You work 4-6 hours 1-3x a week. Not worth the check for all the work they make you do in those few hours. And even being 5 minutes late counts as you being absent. Personal experience I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days and I emailed my managers the doctors note, I called out 3 hours ahead and when I was released I had a voicemail letting me know I had to be terminated because of my absences. NO JOB SECURITY WHAT SO EVER. You aren't even guaranteed 20 hours a week, if even 10 hours."
bad,"To many tasks to do and NO payroll. Getting freight out and keeping the back room to plan is their priority. Ulta has unrealistick expectations for their stores. Great concept,  if the people in Illinois could focus on what really matters, its people and helping customers."
bad,Demanding company that did not follow through on training promised and required for a General Manager. Ulta is opening stores right and left and yet has not solidified staffing in current stores. Managers are over worked and under trained. Some how you are just expected to know everything about the company. Most enjoyable part is when i could actually interact with customers.
bad,"You will definitely be busy throughout your entire shift. I loved interacting with customers and I did a great job, or as best I could I guess. Some of my coworkers were sweet but there was such quick turnover because most people hated working there. I hated working there because every manager was different and very inconsistent. It was nearly impossible for me to predict what the wanted of me. I worked there for 3 months and though I was supposed to be trained for 2 weeks, only received about 2 hours of training which is why I quit. They expected me to know things without training me for it."
bad,As a manger was the worse place I've worked as for being respected by the GM as a manager . No room in one office one computer shared by 5 mangers in the store . Goals behind chair for services too high to have time to do the office part of the job . Waiting  in line to check out after your swift to get tip $ was a night mare sometimes wait was 45 minutes after working 8hr swifts .  I did enjoy meeting new customers and the staff in the salon .
bad,"This is literally the worst job experience ever. The managers don't correct you if you're doing something wrong, even when you're unaware. There was little-to-no training. On my first day they had me sit in the back and watch animated training videos for two hours and then threw me at the register. The coupon policies are terrible; the customers will yell at you about it. The dress code is ridiculously strict, even down to your nail polish not being chipped. The discount can only be used on items for yourself, not friends and family, and even if you're the one paying they will not let you buy anything as a gift. Not even around the holidays! I would honestly give a 0/5 if I could. Awful experience - never working or shopping here again."
bad,Worst place I have ever worked for. Company only cares about money not the people.If your people aren't happy then your company will not continue to be prosperous.
bad,management in our district is terrible. they are very dishonest to a point where employees take blame and get fired. youre typically stuck on register rather than getting to help out the customers.
bad,This company runs through too many mangers in a months time. They are consistently changing upper managers all over the company. We had no support from any of the other managers.
bad,"I have been working for Ulta Beauty for a little over a year."
bad,"You won't catch me stepping foot in another Ulta again. I was considered a ""lead"" tasker. I got 3 hours a week."
bad,"The management at the location where I was working is awful, the worst, the 5 managers are insane, they spent the entire shift talking about others, and the employees are rude and nasty to the costumers. Only 4 other people and I left the company."
bad,"The job was fine, but the company hires the wrong people to work as a team. Those people that don't have any good work ethic shouldn't be working there. The ones that actually do get there on time and try to get the work done should be recognized for their very hard work. The company should also make better work hours don't agree working on Sundays that shouldn't be mandatory."
bad,"No salon and spa policies and no cancellation penalties, so clients did as they wanted"
bad,This company has amazing pay and benefits. They also have amazing tools for employees to learn about makeup and beauty products if you're wanting to be a makeup artist or Thrive to be in the beauty industry this is the spot to be. For management this job was a complete disaster for me all the other managers we're fighting for the GM position when are GM passed away.
bad,"Company will do anything to save face. Human Resources is marketed as a ""we care, let's talk"" environment. However if there is an issue with your General Manager or your District manager HR will notify them of the issue and tell you to partner with them so they don't have to do any work. "
bad,"New store  management  taking over multiple times during the year .. complete chaos , no communication between salon and the rest of the store ..  meetings are being held and canceled with no notification ...stylists are allowed to act extremely unprofessional to clients and to salon management with no consequences!!  This is why there are on salon manager #4 in 2 years !"
bad,"Rudest company and does not care about there employees especially the ones that put years and years into the company, pay is good but that’s really the only thing going for them, you will work so much overtime pretty much not have a life outside of work. Work holidays also."
bad,"Working for Ulta can be great but it depends on who is running the establishment. I worked for a place that started out great But the management changed for both the store and my salon and all the structure I was going by went out the window. It was a free  for all  and the managers all were friends and had each other's backs but not they're employees. Oh wait except if they liked you then you were fine. But if they were challenged in any way they were retaliatory against you. I was off to an impression that the company cared about their employees but that quickly changed and it was all about the sales. No direction, no leadership, no mentoring, no guidance. This was loved by those who are lazy and don't like to do actual work but it was torture to me as I was bullied and Ganged up on until I had a psychotic break and got no help from my benefits bc of a policy they have in place that if your condition is caused by or aggravated by work it would not be covered and I was out for  7 weeks with out pay. The stress literally caused an auto immune disorder to appear and I soon went into debt. Over all  a horribly toxic work environment. I was thrilled to leave when I got a new job. Good luck!"
bad,The District manager didn’t care about about the store manager making extremely racists comments and being completely unprofessional and anyone who called HR would get fired. Garbage company. Even worse management.
bad,"Poor management, conspires against you. Harasses you to the point that you can't take it anymore! Stays in the office for the full shift. Mngrs on their cell phone all day. GM never assist on the floor. They hire their friends. Favoritism. No training for prestige, just puts them on the floor with no experience. You can never do enough! It's like being in a cult but your not a part of it."
bad,very under staffed.  associates dont get paid enough for the amount of work they have to do. management can never do enough.  always being reprimanded for not meeting standards
bad,"I very much was looking forward to working for this company. Instead I walked into a filthy, mean girls, understaffed store. Once they realized you have smarts of any sort they will fast track you with ZERO training and work you to the bone. Then show up with a stack of papers and a highlighter to highlight all you’ve done wrong. Absolutely NOT!! You’ve given no training and expect perfect performance. I’ve been in this industry for 26 years and never have I ever been as horrified at how a business was run."
bad,"Constantly changing managers around, all of these managers were literally crazy. No opportunity for job growth. Hired anyone at random sometimes without even interviewing and would cut the hours of the employees that had previous experience if they didn’t like them. I was let go without them ever calling me or letting me know that they were going to be letting me go, I received a check in the mail for my last paycheck and an email asking me to fill out an exit survey. This company is obsessed with selling their credit cards and will give you less hours if you can’t meet the weekly goals for credit cards. They also cut your hours if you don’t get guests to sign up for loyalty. The only pro for this job was the discount honestly. I regret ever working there!"
bad,"This place is completely unorganized, outdated, and there is so much favoritism going on it's not even a joke. STAY away. It all seems okay but its NOT."
bad,"Ulta itself is a great company which offers amazing benefits for its hairstylist. unfortunately they are horrible at selecting management. In the 10 years i was there i witnessed several managers bully other managers and employees.  Instead of hiring and promoting within they always went outside and hired brand new people and had current staff train new managers. District managers were never any better, very unapproachable and mean. Never celebrated wins with the team only came by to let us know what we were doing wrong.  There would be issues and employees wrote to corporate and nothing was ever done or they were retaliated on. You never felt like you were being listened to because no one would ever get a response to their concerns. Catty managers and a lot of favoritism.  the worse thing was the hostile work environment and every day there's a new rule. they have u on a point system, 8 points you're out, so you are always walking on eggshells.  If you suddenly lose a salon manager (usually because of work related stress) they don't bring in another manager for the time being so its a possibility you will not have a manager for a long time resulting in no product available for your clients and schedules being all over the place and just unnecessary catty, childish drama. the best thing about working at ulta was the education, discount and if you are in a busy store, the foot traffic of walk in clients. unfortunately you are too stressed about everything else going on that you cant focus on the client and give them the ""Wow"" experience they expect from you. I do know that not"
bad,"The values of Ulta Beauty aren't represented on a regional/district level. Dm's aren't consistent with the company values and competencies.  The HR hotline was intended for store associates and mgmt to voice their concerns, but unfortunately HR reaches out to DM and retaliation follows. HR is biased to all Corporate positions such as DM and LP"
bad,"If you choose to work here, be prepared to be severely underpaid for your expertise and experience. You will likely be promised regular clientele and great tips/commission to increase your income, but that just isn't likely. I spent most of my time, not performing services as I have been trained and licensed to do, but on the floor selling Prestige skin and makeup products. On top of that, they have a very rigorous point system to deter employee absences, but there is no flexibility for employees who are legitimately ill or have emergencies arise. You have 3 free days to miss and after that you have 8 days. If you use all of those days (even if you have the flu, pneumonia, etc.) you will be immediately fired. Don't even bother going to the doctor if you don't have to because a note will not sway their decision and they will give you a point regardless. My role required me to be within inches of customer's faces and I was still expected to work while ill to avoid a point. Communication between management and employees needs work. The managers are never on the same page, so employees get mixed messages, reprimanded by multiple people about the same infraction, and then are dismissed when they ask for clarification. The only reason I stayed as long as I did is that I loved my co-workers."
bad,"The pay is good at the warehouse, but the hours are not flexible with a lot of overtime. Sometimes overtime gets cancelled and you won't know until you come in to work. The benefits and discount is good, but wish there were more options for benefits. I used to love it at first, but everything went downhill with management and favoritism. I was doing doing really good there, I just didn't like the environment. Some of the hardest workers get all the blame, yet the lazy workers get a freebie from everything. If you want good money then this is the place to be. Trust me when I say there is drama there, well there really is drama there. It gets stressful, so I wouldn't recommend this place. Also your breaks are really short like 10 mins at most before you get back to your work station."
bad,I worked in the Ulta in Lufkin and I was hired on as a hairdresser. However when we did not have clients they expected us to stock shelves away from the Salon area having us miss potential cliental. Then when our numbers were not up we got into trouble. There was a lot of drama in the store and salon between management.
bad,"Huge turnover, management was never on the same page. The new salon manager brought some stylists along and swooped my shifts for her stylist and had me working not even part time. Went from full to not even enough money to live"
bad,"This company is the worst when it comes to work life balance, between cutting cashier shifts to save hours for other stores and do shady practices to save the store money I can't think of anything worse. Forget having any free time to actually enjoy your days off as you're required to always be at your managers beck and call."
bad,"GM was a nightmare to work with. Very cliquey environment, played favorites. The pay and benefits are nice, but nice enough to deal with the GM. The DM is also of little help."
bad,"Ulta doesn't provide enough pay for what they make you do. If you are assigned to Prestige you will end up doing operations, cashier and dealing with mass. Ulta simply does not have structure. The hours are always low and the managers do not assign enough people to work a day so you're stuck doing 3 different jobs or stuck with 8 people to assist all at the same time. Please do not waste your time working here. You are better off working anywhere else in the beauty community."
bad,"It's a great job for learning,  being in the salon system you can go to the Dermalogica Institute for certification program FOR FREE.  It's like going to esthetic school, but better because you learn specific treatment protocols that not only assist in making you a great esthetician,  but help you establish great service sales.  I was ALWAYS #1 in SERVICE SALES and in the top 10% nationwide.  However,  I would recommend to get your certification, because it follows YOU through out your career. There's multiple national and local accounts that use dermalogica. "
bad,"A typical day at work depended on which manager was on duty. With one you had to listen to her complain nonstop and with another you had to listen to her rude, catty remarks all day.  The environment had a mean girls vibe and the managers nitpicked and micromanaged the ones they didn't like.  This wasn't as noticeable until the new manager was transferred to the location. It became increasingly toxic and made it difficult to find anything about the job enjoyable.  The customers were actually the friendliest faces you'd see during your shift...."
bad,The managers would tell us put returned and used product back on the shelf to resell to keep our return losses low. Coworkers would use fake phone numbers to keep their memberships enrollment high. It was honestly not a good environment that wouldn't train you properly then reprimand you for not being trained.
bad,"Managers were unprofessional and unorganized in their scheduling, and in procedure."
bad,"This company could care less about you, I was getting bullied by my general manager and the company didn't do anything about it. When I called HR and filed a complaint, I stopped getting scheduled. So unprofessional, if you love makeup, don't work at Ulta."
bad,Awful management. Very rude and prejudice. Manage stole my gratis and gossiped behind all employees backs. Unfair wages. Reporting this specific store to Human Resources and seeking legal representation.
bad,I loved the job and all my coworkers but will never work for the manager again!! I was told by her several times that I would be moved to a better position and every time it was given to another associate.
bad,"My experience at Ulta as awful. My manager was racist and classist, never any hours, and eventually just stopped giving me hours. The only goodd thing about this job is the discount."
bad,"Loved most of my coworkers and the atmosphere, when the salon manager and general manager wasn't around. Salon manager kept setting me up for failure then blamed it on general manager. No communication. Poorly trained managers, full of drama. Loved my job and clients but hated management."
bad,The management way of handling customer/employee conflicts is poor. You get yelled at like a child IN FRONT of customers then escorted to the front of the like your a criminal.
bad,"To start off management plays the favorite game. Being an employee that didn't have issues with management but watching others that did was enough for me to quit. I can't see myself working for a company that per ""HR"" words directly to an employee ""your just a number"", was enough for me to leave this job in the dust."
bad,"I was excited to work here, but it ended up being a disappointment.  Management was the main reason for this.  The new GM they brought in was rude and always complaining, which only made the cattiness of the other managers worse.  They talked down to associates and focused only on the negative.  For a side-job during school, it just wasn't worth it."
bad,"Work is easy not a lot of opportunities to grow within the company. Management is okay , customers are all super rude. Management is pretty good."
bad,"I worked for ULTA warehouse for two years and let me tell you I would have rather been in ""the place down under"". Management is a JOKE!! They will write you up and GET in your face over everything. also if you think I'm joking one manger there used to get into everybody's face, that being a girl or boy. Also there peak seasons they have mandatory six to seven days a week! not by choice they will work you until you are broken and worn out. The health insurance is a joke, everything needs prior authorization. And if you get hurt say goodbye to your job because they will find a way to get rid of you. So if you still want to work there good luck and say bye to your personal life, you will never have one. And as far as the company as a whole goes, they have their thumbs up their butts all the time. HR are basically worthless."
bad,I wish I could give this job a negative 1000. This was by far the worst job I've ever had and I've had some horrible jobs. My manger made everyone uncomfortable by pressuring us to get credit cards and loyalty sales. If we didn't our hours would get cut. Their is soooo much favortism it's gross. Oh and you only will get 21 hours at the MOST. If you want a job that's going to pay the bills and not make you come in for a 6pm-9pm save yourself the trouble and please don't apply. This was a waste of my few months that I can never get back
bad,"Omg!!!!!! I worked the spas for few years.. I have 600 hours of training and am liscened in everything clinically possible. Body wrapping-eyelashes-tinting-advanced peels. "
bad,"I loved, loved my co workers but I never got hours. I had no hours for a straight three weeks till I quit. My biggest paycheck was $300 and my last paycheck was $47. What a joke. How do employers think that is okay? I wouldn't recommend getting a job at Ulta to ANYONE! The discount was nice but not worth it."
bad,"This is a bad place to work for. Ulta corporate as a whole has no respect for the ones below them. I have complained about my general manager several times about the illegal activities she does while she is on the clock.So far nothing has been done, and I am not the only one who complained about her."
bad,"Managers were bosses and not leaders.  "
bad,"ULTA is exploiting their employees by getting over 85% of what they make. For example, let's say that you spend 2 hours in a customer's hair. You get paid $9.50 x 2 before taxes, that's $19.00 for the employee. ULTA charges the customer around $120. The only thing you get is $19. plus tip. If you want to grow successfully as a hair dresser, ULTA is not an option.  For that income you can work anywhere without the demanding ULTA supervisors.  In addition, as an employee you're not allowed to do your own business during your free time. That goes against their interests. Capitalism at their best or should this be considered exploitation? You do the math. Thank you!"
bad,"First 6 years were good, fun place to learn and develop. Biggest issue with company: lots of promises of advancement, but watched as promotion opportunities were hired from the outside.  "
bad,Ulta does not believe in giving back! Very wasteful company who would rather destroy products than give to those in need.
bad,"The upper management at Ulta is not equipped to handle the position they hold. "
bad,"Decent job to start if you like to do makeup and are in high school, not enough to make a living. They don't train you at all, bad pay, customers are horrible. Management are snakes (all the way up  to corporate). No room for advancement.  Glad I got out. This place is a joke."
bad,"Opened as salon manager and brought ""stylists with a book "" I've been in the beauty industry for 28 years owning my own salon and looked forward to bringing  my experience to grow ultas salon .our GM was a 28 year old Control freak , who in reality new nothing! the salon market trainer was a joke who actually insulted me verbally in meeting (she was the furthest thing from trainer ive ever seen ) "
bad,"The one thing I did like about this place was the awesome perks like getting free makeup here and there. The management was absoutely horrible. They would call me one second and say I was working and then I would get all the way to the store and they would tell me I didnt have to work. They did this to me at least 20 times. The staff overall was friendly but the store itself was really disfuctional. It was messy, people would steal all the time, I would have to stay passed midnight to mop the floors. I don't have an issue with cleaning but If im the only one closing, it can be a little stressful with a store that size. "
bad,"Ulta is a great company with a lot of great values. The store in Baton Rouge had a lot of high theft and incidents. A direct result of that, led to having store security and everyone was treated like criminals, both customers and employees. Other than that, the jobs are not difficult and the discount is good. I will say, that the regional manager is a very negative woman. She thrives on putting her employees down and making them feel worthless. She often rules with a iron fist and resorts to negative comments and belittling. She is the reason I left the store and wouldn't recommend anyone to apply there. I wish for a better future for that store, but I doubt it will happen as long as she is in power."
bad,"Some people make it hard for you to enjoy your job. It's like if your back in high school, they like to talk behind your back to others and just smile in your face. I love dealing with the customers"
bad,they base promotion on looks not skill have yo really looked @ some the the gm's
bad,I worked there for about 6 months. I never got to advance in the company and did not see myself working there for very long due to issues with management.
bad,"Working here you had to be prepared for high school drama. Everyone always gossips and talks bad about each other behind their backs. The management was not supportive. "
bad,In the first week of working there we were robbed 4 times and I was the closing manager. It was also the reason why 2 other managers decided to leave and I was not aware of this until I decided to do the same.
bad,Worst job ever. Projects with unreasonable deadlines. You are bullied into telling on the associates to the GM because they lack presence on the sales floor and engagement with the team. The culture is toxic due to no team work. Managers snitch and lie to save themselves. DM only believes the GM. High turnover. BA’s hate it there. Everyone for themselves. If you speak up you are told you may not fit the future. Your practically bullied when speaking your opinion. GM turns team against one another and talks bad about the entire staff. Rather put responsibility and duties on Management. Workload is high and everyone looks at you when sonething is wrong . Do not apply you will be stressed out of your mind
bad,"This review is based on my store .The cut hours every week sometimes every day of week. Ulta is run on a performance based payroll. If you miss your day by 1,000 managers have to cut 4 hours. Well if you work with managers who don't sell. You get the picture. Now perks are good. Watch a product video you receive free stuff. Dream of working at ULTA better than reality"
bad,"This job does not allow you to have a real part time job because hours vary each week. I first started with about 16-20 hours a week. Now that I’ve been here for over a 3 months, I get scheduled about 8 hours a week. I cannot live off of 8 hour paychecks. Unless you advance quite quickly through the system, there is no way of ensuring more than 4 hours a week."
bad,schedules were crazy and never had more than 12 hours a week or two weeks they would always cut hours. but I had great memories with the friends I made. the discount was okay but must of the time you weren't able to buy some of the popular stuff
bad,"During my time at Ulta as a cashier I was asked to lie to uneducated customers about the products I personally use at home. I was told there was no harm in lying to a customer. I strongly disagree with this, and I found it to be morally bankrupt. I don't think I'll be trusting any employee from Ulta again, and if I had lied to customers and they found out the truth, neither would they."
bad,I felt like I was just another dollar sign to them. It was hard to enjoy work when you're given such a large sales goal for the day. I felt like a failure almost every day because I didn't meet their sales goals.
bad,"not supported in my business, lack of training for the job. very difficult to advance in the company. No support with my business and support of skills."
bad,"Unless you’re ready to get treated like robots, this is for you. Corporate is the worst, they don’t care about their employees. They expect unrealistic standards/ goals. They literally do not care about anything except making money. No commission but they want force you to force customers to open credit cards and accounts!"
bad,"Good Dermalogica training.  Very weird cult videos to watch to ""on board.""  But the videos do have good advice. "
bad,"They started out with a great management, but in the long run the management could see the company had no communication with each other. The good employees left to find a better job ."
bad,"This company exploited women with families and children offering them low-pay with no benefits. Shifts were constantly switched with others and there was no career advancements available. Focus is on sales and numbers, NOT people."
bad,"It's like working at a nicer Walmart. You deal with rude customers who refuse to understand our policies, there weren't enough workers, you didn't get paid to do all of the things you were required to do, including theft prevention, restocking and if you're like me the register and prestige makeup,  I was never given my 15-minute break. The only reason I put up with it was that I adored the staff and managers. However, at my previous location, I hated everything about working with them. There is so much wrong with working at Ulta I could go on forever."
bad,The new GM at my store just before I left was AWFUL. I honestly left working for ulta because I think the whole company is corrupt. You are under paid and doing the work of 4 people. Ulta is also a very petty place. Lots of drama and talking behind your back.
bad,Just an overall bad experience with company management. I went in thinking I would have intensive training and was not giving that opportunity due to lack of management support.
bad,Loved the girls working there! So Much FUN!! Lots of training and super fun events.  Lots of samples!!!!! Training was trendy and seasonal which was awesome! Pay was horrible.
bad,"Didn't do much training for a job I wasn't experienced at, and then they just threw me out to the wolves. The stylists were pretty rude and didn't engage with me much. The atmosphere felt very uncomfortable."
bad,"I worked at Ulta for about 4 months, during that time it was a disorganized, chaotic experience. However, the manger that hired me quit soon after I was hired and we didn't have a manger for about a month. Then the manger who came in went on sick leave for three weeks. When I started I received no training, never watched any of the training videos. The lead cashier told me to use my loyalty card when members didn't want to sign up, to keep our numbers at %100. I didn't know it wasn't OK and was questioned about it and didn't want to throw her under the bus. It would seem that anyone they didn't like they would get fired. It was a very catty, uncomfortable environment with no supervision.  The method of training was sink or swim and you'll know when you do something wrong after you do it. I was never rewarded for the good work I did only told about the little mistakes that very employee makes. Especially when your not trained. Also, I later found out I got what the lowest pay rate, but was in a higher position."
bad,The Salon staff is the most unwelcoming group of people I have ever worked with in my life. There is a complete disconnect between the Retail Floor staff and The Salon staff. The Salon staff at the location I was placed were nothing less than cruel and unusual to the retail staff and anyone new who started in the salon. I was advised by the manager that due to my being new and her staff being so close nit... they would not be welcoming to me until I had been there a while and proved my worth to them. The staff sent me harassing messages about how I would never fit into their clique anyway and they were glad I left...even though they never even talked to me or gave me a chance. The manager never properly introduced me to the team...she just expected me to jump in and assist her with coaching without even getting to know the team. I would not recommend working for The Salon at ULTA unless you are catty and feed off of the hateful behavior of others around you. I know several girls that have left their jobs behind at ULTA (in tears) due to the hateful behavior from THE SALON staff...not the Retail staff. I do recommend the Retail floor for anyone who has a passion for makeup and making people feel great about themselves.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of managing individuals who do not support the work culture, and what I learned is that upper management have little or no support with regard to developing, coaching or mentoring. Hardest part of the job is the high level of external theft that occurs and the fact that the company implemented a foolish theft deterrent system in which one employee was actually accosted by a thief. The employee was later told by LP personnel that she provoked the thief because she asked her to leave the merchandise in the store."
bad,"I worked here awhile back. Compensation was average. Sales associates, stylists, and receptionists were great. Retail managers were kind, but the salon manager and general manager were absolutely horrible. I witnessed them constantly demeaning workers on the sales floor and back in the salon, saw coworkers either angry or crying almost daily,  and they just created an overall toxic environment to the point where even customers would comment about the negativity of the management to my coworkers and stylists.  Working at this Ulta has unfortunately completely ruined the remaining passion I had for the beauty industry and just retail in general. Seeing how my coworkers were treated during my time there, I will never step foot into that Ulta and support their business ever again. I just hope that people that work at other locations have had a better experience than the one I have had in Manahawkin."
bad,Worked as a stylist for 3 years in the salon and was the highest ranked. When manager position was available i applied and was told no because i needed more experience and was to young. Then they hired a manager that had not had their license that long ( less than half the years i had mine.) Very poor manager skills and only looked out for herself. Broke so many of Ulta's policies and when i reported them nothing was done. They also offered me a full time position and then 8 months later when i tried to use vacation time they never entered me in the system as full time so i had no vacation or sick time. Even though i worked full time hours every week i was considered part time. It was really sad and hard for me to put my notice in. Two weeks after i left the manager and a stylist were fired for drinking alcohol and serving it to the clients.
bad,"A typical day at Ulta: GM does nothing but belittle the employees snatching merchandise, coupons and whatnot from their hands while yelling at them in front of the customers. Smacking her lips and rolling her eyes didn't help."
bad,"Ulta is an amazing company to work for depending on the management: store and district. My first experience in management here was great: clearly defined roles and expectations, fair pay between co-workers, and the ability to advance. However, another location gave the opposite: disorganization that lead to confusion and high turnover, secrecy about pay because there were vast differences between similar roles for seemingly no reason, and I watched people with amazing potential get jerked around for even small advancements. "
bad,Management doesn't know how to talk to people or treat people with respect they can be condensing also they have favorites and politics there and too much drama going on
bad,"Hours were fine at first but then they cut everyone's hours, I was working once a month MAYBE up until I was forced to quit because I needed to make money to live, and ulta was not giving me that. People are constantly quitting because they are getting screwed on hours. They tell you 20-30 hrs at first but then you'll be working once a week and it all goes downhill from there."
bad,"First I will start by saying I was super happy for the opportunity, but there’s a lot of retaliation and unethical practices from upper management such as drug use and favoritism."
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. I was hired as a part-time seasonal employee and the rate of pay was $11 an hour, which isn't terrible. However, as a Beauty Advisor (cashier) you're expected to sell x amount of Ulta credit cards every day. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but 99.9% of people don't want a credit card pushed on them. If you aren't one of the top salesmen, they slate you for 6 am truck shifts, which is doing strenuous labor for $50 since it's only a five hour shift. The management, however, was the worst part about the job. The general manager would change the schedule at the last minute the night before, and would often add a shift on someone's day off or take away a shift they were scheduled and they wouldn't be aware of it since it was so las-minute. The environment is solely female, so of course there will be attitudes abound when you have a team of 40 or more employees who are hairstylists, makeup artists, and cashiers. The cashiers are at the bottom of the food chain here, and wind up being delegated the worst and most difficult tasks for which they recieve no assistance. The managers refuse to ring out customers, prioritzing instead their customer engagement on the floor. If you call for help, they'll send somebody else, and they'll often piddle around right behind you while you have 50 people in line and 4 more registers open. I had multiple customers complain about management's lack of assistance. They're coached to delegate instead of do, so they'll take you away from a difficult task you're already doing to perform something else they could"
bad,If you can put up with the hard parts of the job their are great perks to this job especially if you are interested in going into cosmetology or esthetics they will reimburse you half the amount you pay for school if you work there while attending school.
bad,Basic place to work. No pros or cons just basic. You are working with a bunch of girls so be careful what you say around them lol. Girl are sensitive and they are drama.
bad,"It started as a good place to work but after some time it wasn’t.  The support staff talk down about the associates and their own peers.  Promotions are only given to associates the Operation Managers like.  Many associates who are more qualified are often passed over.  It is quite apparent you only get ahead if you are a butt kisser.  "
bad,Ulta is an Ok place to work if you are ok with mediocrity. Management often has no cosmetic experience and the store is normally short staff. Has great potential for amateurs.
bad,"This warehouse is by far the worst warehouse in Dallas, Tx the production is a high rate to reach and the management is straight trash don't apply here"
bad,"Over my time at Ulta, there were so many thefts, high stress, and unsafe situations. We called the police to the store on average once or twice a week. Despite that, corporate did nothing to ensure the safety of their workers. We had to walk out to our cars in groups in fear of not being attacked."
bad,This is NOT a place for those with an interest in clients. It is a great place for those focused  on operational duties and tasking and a greatvway for thise beginning their careers to learn how to navigate office politics. Managers promoted from within are grossly underpaid so go elsewhere when you are ready to pursue management.
bad,The middle and senior management were directionless.  Several of the project team members included entry level onshore and offshore resources.   Extremely unprofessional behavior.  I've seen two project managers quit within four months on the same project.  Dull lighting and crammed work space.
bad,Ulta has a lot to be desired.   I’ve never worked at an establishment that is so unprofessional and doesn’t run smoothly.   I would never recommend anyone to work their.
bad,"I was poorly trained and had to put up with hostility between managers and company pressure to compete with loyalty and credit conversion. Lots of cattiness, gossiping, rumors, and overall drama. The job itself seemed fun and promising, but the job culture honestly made it not worth working there."
bad,"very chaotic place to work, had to borrow passwords in order to help the customer.  You cannot speak to someone if you need help.  Everything is done in chat, then wait for someone to answer.  This takes too long."
bad,"The employees, including supervisors and managers, do not have a team mindset. Everyone is on their own and there is a push to get customers signed up for the Ulta card."
bad,"The job itself was fun and rewarding however, management is something to be desired. I've worked for the company twice and will not go back because of the poor management."
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service, my management sucked, stylists were amazing. Hardest part was being the only receptionist on a busy day, such as Saturday. Lines would be long, all four lines would ring at the same time, but that taught me so much time management and how to keep conversations respectable but as minimal as possible. Over all, this tremendously busy salon kept me on my feet the entire 8-9 hour shifts and taught me so much. but I would NEVER go back. "
bad,"The girls in the salon are catty and think of themselves as better than you, they say they recommend ppl to you yet they take some of your makeup clients and the place has too high of a sales goal for you to reach in the type of location it is in also they expect way too much out of you in 90 days when everyone knows it takes at least 1 yr to get a clientele started... you also feel unappreciated because you bust your self only for them to hold the salon at a high rank and they also make you do retail work so its like your working 2 jobs and getting paid for one its very overwhelming at times and don't let me forget the micromanaging that happens and major favoritism"
bad,"Oppressive work environment. Work 60 to 70 hours a week no breaks /no lunch. High turnover in associate MGR due to workload and unrealistic expectations. Upper management is very condescending and unprofessional, acts childish and shows favoritism towards younger GMs. High volume successful store with double digit increases. Never a thank you, always what you're doing wrong never what you're doing right. Nothing is ever good enough. Does not acknowledge team members."
bad,The director of Payroll doe not know what she is doing and if you try to tell her something is wrong she will tell you that you do not know what you are talking about.  She is always right!  If there is a problem she does not tell you what is going on and will try to cover it up.  I hope upper management catches on soon.  When she is mad at you she will ignore you for a couple of days and than when she does talk to you she will belittle you and won't listen to anything you say because what she heard is right.  They need to find someone that can run a department fair and doesn't pick favorites!  Upper managements thinks she knows how to run a department but it is her employees that do all the work and they just fill her in on what is going on.
bad,"Very unethical general manager and district manager. GM has thrown multiple employees under the bus, doesn't care about anything but herself and does absolutely nothing but sit in the office and talk on the phone for personal reasons."
bad,"Apply at your own risk.... Management set the environment of pressure - threatening write-ups because of unrealizable deadlines. All they care about is the bottom line - all driven by sales and greed. They don't care about integrity, good customer service, or an employee's safety/well-being. They promote sloppy, unprofessional, go-getters who do whatever they can to drive the sales."
bad,"It was a good job to have at first but they started to take advantage of me. It’s a lot of drama and he said, she said going on. If you wanna work there, I would recommend you to keep to yourself and don’t get involved in the drama. The store manager was great, it was just the others that was unprofessional. Overall, I would never work there again and I don’t recommend it."
bad,Unprofessional environment.  The management team was not supportive and was unprofessional. General manager should not be a manager because of lack of support and wanted to do what he wanted to do.
bad,"Very stressful work environment. As a guest service coordinator, you are pushed to drive credit cards, do laundry, take phone calls, clean, and are constantly put between your manager and others. Poor management, the rest of the store has great management."
bad,"I was a beauty advisor which is basically just a cashier. There are little to no promotions given out unless someone leaves and a position HAS to be filled. 4 hour shifts and the max hours a week is around 22 or less. If you have bills to pay or are trying to save money, this is not the job for you. Worked like a dog picking up peoples shifts with little to no recognition except from chosen managers. I met really nice people and still keep in contact with old coworkers, but ultimately had to move on and do better for myself."
bad,"We had an awful store manager, she harrassing and corporate never did anything. I reported her to my district manager twice and corporate hotline. Turns out  this is a common occurance which is sad because if the company was more supportive of its management it would be an excellent place to work."
bad,"This company has a habit of firing managers and letting them make it look voluntary.  They get to stay a bit longer and announce their last day.  Unfortunately, this can lead to retaliation because they still have the power to fire top-producing employees!"
bad,There is no job security. Seen many people fired for unfair reasons. Payroll is limited for size of the store.  I could not have more than 40 hours during the week for floor coverage. Workload is unrealistic.
bad,"Stressful environment, hostile manager, crazy hours. No training. I'm suppose to work for my brand but I'm too busy helping other brands. No true direction"
bad,The point system is guaranteed to fire any employee at the fastest rate possible. The company will work you whenever they desire. The management is very unorganized
bad,"unorganized, manager was a lush , very rude and make sure she talked about you to everyone. work schdule what chaotic a lot of no show no calls and people calling in due to working with management"
bad,"Best thing about this facility was the pay, however if you are good at what you do then more is given to you. Super short breaks for 10 hour shifts. Management is very inexperienced and unprofessional including the supervisors they hire. If any issues arise and you report it, it is dealt with by the supervisor or ops manger with the statement ""it is what it is"" and if you follow up to get issues resolved and they feel threatened to be exposed for not correcting issues or problem solving to help their departments develop,  they make it out to be your fault and YOU WILL BE TERMINATED. Supervisors talk about employees personal business in the office with clerks, supervisors, and other employees present. They speak poorly of newer employees that haven't caught the hang of the process yet. There are poor training expectations new employees are paired with fairly new employees and only given an hour or two of training and rest is up to them."
bad,"its a culture of slavery.. if you have an opinion save it. the managers don't respect those who disagree with them at all. you fall in line and do as they say, period."
bad,"Do not waste your time with the Ulta in Homestead. Too many things I want to say, just know we are under new management and everyone is leaving the beginning of 2020..."
bad,"I just recently quit Ulta Beauty. I think it’s amazing to get to work with makeup and learn different products, but when it came to the environment and how management ran the store, it’s horrible. You won’t get any hours unless you’re a manager and it’s a lot of favoritism. Gossip, drama, the regular girl stuff; an absolutely uncomfortable situation to be in so I decided to leave."
bad,"Ulta was best job.   Management was horrible and unjust.    I know great people that I will always have as my friend family, I regret nothing and learned and am trying to adjust and move forward with a company that will accept me and let me grow with them."
bad,Manager would yell at me while I was in the middle of helping guests. Everyone is very unprofessional and petty. My experience was so bad I quit. I thought I graduated high school but apparently the 25 year olds there are still in it.
bad,the workplace is a fast paced and stressful environment also not to mention that the management and other employees are very discriminating and highly competitive. Only good part was having the insurance benefits.
bad,"very unorganized, over worked employees, should consider employees personal lives during the holidays, didn't give breaks, lunches, understaffed. no training."
bad,"The holiday season is the only good time to work because you get 25-30 hours a week and its fast paced and a joyful time in ulta all around. Other than that, its very slow paced. You are told to restock shelves and put items away i you have to customers which is most of the time. You work 2 days a week and its a 4-6 hour shift with no break. Every other worker thinks they are above the next. Management is very self centered and not considerate of the workers. The best part was the 25% discount and constantly being updated on the latest beauty items. OH and stocking shelves was fun if you like organizing....because the whole store is generally a mess so it constantly needs TLC."
bad,its was laid back but you didn't know if you hade a job the next day or not.
bad,I'm currently a lead cashier. I have been with ulta for almost 2yrs and have been unhappy for more than half of it. I think the main problems are the managers. They have this buddy system that no matter what happens they're going to back each other up. We have so many employees both cashier and salon that have quit because of the intense drama. Going to the Dm or higher is no good either because they share that same buddy system. There is definitely potential but it will never get better until someone starts taking action and start firing some people who don't know what the hell they are doing.
bad,"I don't get paid enough to deal with all the bs that gets thrown my way on a daily basis while at work. I'm on my feet all day taking to customers who already beat you down, just to get barked at by management  also, more training  come on"
bad,"The ulta culture was not all about beauty at one point it was all about nepotism.  The back room was where you could find the group congregated as usual. Asking a manager to get your goals or change your hours would barely get done. It is very busy and intense environment, but if you can't keep up with all the tasks at hand why are you a manager. Oh that is it, they are all friends with no experience, leadership or accountability.  Got it. I love what I do, but hate where I work. The support to grow is up to you, but you have to fight for it because it is all about who you know. The girls who work in prestige are typically at the register while customers shopping there are aggravated because there is no one to help. It is frustrating everyday. I love my co workers, but I have little to no respect for my management team. Not all Ulta's are the same, no one is on the same page or knows what they are doing. You can ask 4 different managers and get 4 different responses. Unfortunately this was my experience."
bad,"I loved working for Ulta. There was a lack of comunication from managers. One manager would tell me to work a different area, saying she had talked to other managers so they would know where I am. Come to find the other manager had no Idea. Happened multiple times.. then got offered a better position, was given a couple days off. When I came back a different manager had hired someone else in that position. Also, Ulta had no Recognition of me working with them even though I have paystubs and all."
bad,"The management at this location sucks. They showed favoritism and were so fake. The management were always talking about other employees amongst each other and other employees. If you had a issue talking to management was pointless because it was never kept between you and management. Racism was a issue and allowed, customers could speak to employees any kind of way and management wouldn't do anything. The girls were fun to work with, management was just bad. Hours were only given to people who management favored."
bad,Once peak season is over so is your job. They promise to have u working and keep u working which was a lie and u barely get hours. Most of the people there are messy and have there favorites.
bad,"If you are part-time, do not expect more than 15 hours a week. In their two week pay period I had only been scheduled for 4 hours at times. I didn't come into work late, I signed people up for credit cards, came in dress code and perfume they sell! I don't feel like I really worked there, and it's sad because they hype you up as if you aren't just labor on call to them. Training is unorganized and rushed too."
bad,"If your a Hairstylist and you work for Ulta you will be helping customers find Beauty Products and cleaning the store , also trying to have clients in the salon and cleaning the salon . The pay is less than a Beauty Advisor and you have a License of Cosmetology , they do not care if you went to school for over 2 years . you will be making less money and working harder than everyone else trying to get clients in your chair . No help from Management they are fake and only care about their paycheck and Bonus. Ulta gives you no hours to build a clientle and they favor younger stylist that are not trying to make a living and paybills.the Ulta was slow so it was hard to get clients and over priced services and they want you to upsell add/ons and clients would get mad,"
bad,"management is awful. your breaks are only 30 mins for lunch, its not consistent and they're rude and demeaning to thier employees as well as play favorites."
bad,does not properly provide benefit to employees who have rightfully earned them. i loved working for Benefit cosmetics but hated working for ULTA. they are a terrible corporation to work for.
bad,"The management was not every good, it was too fast paced not enough time to breathe. The pay was good,  it I would not recommend working there if you are not very face paced."
bad,Workd for almost 5 yrs Took 3 yrs to b promoted ALOT of favoritism They only move you up if yor best friends or have know managers prior to employment
bad,"If you’re a GM you work too many hours and are only paid salary, Ulta doesn’t pay enough. Too many inconsistencies. Upper management is a joke . Hostile environment with customers shoplifting"
bad,"Let me first preface this by saying this review took quite some time to cultivate, as I’m typing it with my middle finger. That’s how much I loathe this place. "
bad,"Definitely would never encourage anyone to work there:"
bad,"You are limited to what you can do. If the passion is makeup, you will very rarely be able to be with the real makeup and educate guests. Managers are catty."
bad,"Benefit is a wonderful Company. Their training and gratis is amazing. There are pros and cons to every workplace, Ulta included. They expect a lot of you with outrageous sales goals. The pay doesn't match the work."
bad,"GM is too sales driven and constantly nagging on prestige. Far too often I would get told that we are talking and guests arent being helped but yet there was no personal chatter. Things will get turned around when they were said one way. Too many people come and go (no one lasts) Managers like to talk to eachother about others a little too much or are in the back most the shift. Favorites were also noticed. Poor management flow, no daily organization to what is going on. Very clicky. I had family problems and I was basically forced to quit."
bad,"No air at all makes it so miserable "
bad,"Management was horrible and discriminatory.. I did not enjoy it. Rushed breaks, understaffed, the general manager was condescending and rude. Retail employees interrupt you while you're in the middle of servicing clients."
bad,"Management was terrible, hours were nonexistent, pay was futile, and raises were unheard of. Cashiers were not allowed to leave the cash wrap to help guests, and nobody had a name tag."
bad,very disgusting place to work. No Marketing tools to help get the word out that there is a salon in Ulta. Co-workers very rude.
bad,ULTA is super boring if you work in the Salon there.  My boss was very rude to me and criticized the way I did my own hair.  I was not impressed and never had any clients at all.  It was a good thing I got paid hourly because I worked there for 2 months and had probably 10 clients total.
bad,No hours and no respect from anyone.You just work on the cash registers.
bad,They promise education and training thats untrue. Horrible place to work. No MANAGER presence hostile work environment.Oh and don't call the HR hotline they will do nothing but tell you to quit after being treated like ....Other stylist taking your clients and humiliated in front of clients not a good place.
bad,Great variety of high and low end beauty products. Excellent discount for personal salon services. 
bad,"I worked at Ulta as a cashier and had to leave for several reasons. First, 5 hours a week is not worth the gas to get there. Second, standing my entire shift without a break is unacceptable (and I think against the law). Third, the pay is horrible! Fourth, the fact that I have to carry a clear pouch that they provide and be patted down before leaving is beyond belief. Great discounts but not much else going."
bad,"I've never regretted leaving this job as abruptly as I did. The best part of being a manager was getting nice freebie products. Corporate expected way too much out of you, especially if you were a manager. You were supposed to deliver excellent customer service to everyone who walks through the door as well as do time consuming projects for around the store while still giving excellent customer service as well as trying to deter thieves who came in, often times on a regular basis. That's right-you were expected to confront people who were stealing even if you were not comfortable doing that. Depending on who you confronted, it could be a scary experience, especially when it's obvious they may not be right in the head. Corporate constantly cut employee hours and expected certain things to get done while having practically no staff during some shifts (really-most of the time it was just me and one other associate at night, which is not safe). I never felt like the company really cared about the employees, just the dollar signs. They did not put a huge emphasis on safety and integrity. The people who move up in this company are usually favorites who know how to talk to certain people. I put a lot of sweat and tears into this company for three and a half years and definitely did not feel rewarded for it. Ulta is convenient to work for if you're just looking for work while going to school or finding other employment, but other than that steer clear. This job could be so much fun if corporate didn't suck the life out of every employee. I'm not exaggerating. I did meet some great people"
bad,"A Typical day at this job 1 st of all the pay is low ,they do not give you beraks,the women who work at the ulta in plano are so miserable with no life.The store mgr talks to every one like shes got some thing stuck up her back side !!!! They are going to work you like a salve and they are not going to train YOU .My fisrt day the mgr just told me to go out and do the best i can with what they have. Also Management is so UNORGANIZED BEFORE I GOT THERE ULTA HAD JUST LET ALL OF THERE MGRS AND SOME OF THE STAFF GO.THE STAFF THAT THEY HAVE THERE NOW IS GOING TO RUN THIS STORE IN TO THE GROUND .SOME OF THE MAKEUP THAT THEY SALE IS SO OLD THAT IT HAS CHANGED COLORS ,THE LIP GLOSS IS SO OLD THAT THE COLOR HAS SEPARATED FORM THE OIL !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Until I had been to Ulta I hadn't ever had a job that I disliked. It wasn't the work that made Ulta a bad experience. Management was dreadful to work for. Not only were they rude, but they never gave any positive feedback about any one working at the time. Within the month that I worked there, all new hires had quit due to management, and scheduling."
bad,The manager was always late for the morning shift. I stood outside for a hour waiting one time. I was asked to come in because they needed help and they never paid me for my time there. Vet unorganized and unprofessional.
bad,"It was great until I transferred to a different store.  The management was totally different I felt like I was working a a total new place, the management was horrible at the new location."
bad,"great job but management ruins it. older ladies who dont relate to recent fashion culture and arent understanding of much of anything if its not exactly what they want. very prissy and they pick and choose who they like, and then those who ARE liked are given special priveledge while those who arent are treated bitchily. AWFUL JOB. you are also supposed to look out for the company and their money more so than the customer. they act like they have you and your wallets best interest but they wont even let associates provide a coupon if you forgot yours."
bad,"I didn’t like this job at all, the actual job wasn’t hard but the management was bad. I do not recommend it at all. I tried working things out but some jobs are just not meant to be."
bad,"This is a brand new store. The whole team is new and there is this lady from corporate managing us on how to set up the whole store. This is BACK BREAKING WORK! Most of us did not know that we would be unloading more than 30 pallets of product. Sorting the product, putting it in boxes, then putting it up. They should hire a team for setting up stores because most of us are miserable doing this. We signed up to be stylists, beauty advisors, brow experts, etc.) NOT grunt workers. The lady from corporate is basically a slave driver. She literally is so nasty to everyone that everyone already hates the job. If we ask for help she is demeaning and makes us feel stupid for asking. The funny thing is we are working our butts off while she sits on her laptop and phone all day long. All in all it has been a complete joke with an utter lack of direction."
bad,"If you are looking for job that gives you 4-15 hours per week with low pay, then this is the spot for you. It was honestly ridiculous looking at the schedule and to only see your working 4 hours that week!! when asked for more hours by management there was always an excuse.  Management is very strict about opening up credit cards to guests, the more you open up, the more they will favor you! if not, they mostly push you to the side. Breaks are super short! Majority of the time the place is a mess, and no one will take the initiative to clean up. Customers in this area can get very rude and angry for no reason. Only benefit working here is the discount, but honestly not worth the time working for this company."
bad,Lots of promises to grow in the company but they are empty promises. They choose by favoritism and not skill level. no work life balance but that is retail.
bad,No work/life balance if you want to move up. A lot of broken promises. Very cliquey. You need to know people to get anywhere in the company. Not much training. Always understaffed. Never enough time to get projects done.
bad,"If you're going to work here please keep in mind that you are just a number to them. If you want to move up in the company, get in with your managers because they only promote their favorites. This was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had and they definitely did not pay enough nor did they schedule enough hours. Management talks about an open door policy but if you voice an opinion that doesn't coincide with theirs they will mess with your hours and scheduling. This company treats its lower level employees like absolute garbage; don't waste your time."
bad,It was a lot over the course of the 4 years there it wasn’t all bad it just was more hard days than. Positive uplifting ones. I was able to create quite the clientele and have everlasting relationships due to working there
bad,never enough hours. the pay is terrible. nobody wants to work. you have to kiss butt to get anywhere at all. working for what you get is not the case here. people who have way less experience getting promotions over those who deserve it.
bad,"Sales Orineted, unwilling to be flexible on hour changes no advancement possible other than that it was a good job to work at while young but not a good job to work at once you past 20"
bad,"management was poor, people would leave after a month of hire because of poor management, salon and front has consistent conflicts, all in all not a great place to work. would rather be homeless than to work here"
bad,"They short hours to employees, make a schedule then change it the next week to less hours, drama is full of it there, can't advance unless best friends with the general manager, not my favorite place to work."
bad,"didn't get paid enough"
bad,Things were different after the manager left that hired me. Plus I'm a guy so nothing there interested me I just needed a job. I would recommend it to one of my lady friends though.
bad,Stressful place to work. You fight for hours and never receive them. You are under appreciated and over worked. Management isn’t the best. So much constant drama
bad,"I was so excited to work for ulta but they offered me a management position and then gave it to someone else. Never got hours and employees seemed catty, rude and disrespectful. I had been throwing up with a fever and an emergency room visit and they tried to force me to come in and work because it was a busy truck day and the managers were stuck working on the registers. I called into work and was told I needed someone to cover for me or I couldn't call in. At the time, I didn't know anybodys phone number because I was a new employee. Manager rattled off some phone number for me to text and I asked her to repeat the number. She told me she couldn't and that it was too busy and she needed to get back to work and hung up on me after telling me to call her back later. Needless to say, I never called and I never went back. I felt like I was signing customers up for the loyalty program and credit card against their will and forcing it on them because we'd get in trouble if we didn't have a 100 percent loyalty number. I didn't feel like they genuinely cared about me and they picked favorites a lot."
bad,No work ethics. No structure with associates. Other Managers do not follow proper protocol and favors certain people. Was not a fair place to work in.
bad,Clients are somewhat good just bad management and gm will retaliate against you if she doesn't like something you do . Also very unfair with scheduling usually days off are denied for no reason and there is a lot of micromanaging.
bad,"this job doesn't care about the worker only theres sales. If you have no experience don't worry they WONT TRAIN YOU AT ALL. Also they hours are a little crazy. the computer designs schedule, so sometime you will work 6am tp 10am"
bad,"I was excited to be working for ULTA, but the manager at the time made it dreadful to come to work. She was a very rude lady, always arguing with the staff in front of costumers, always having confrontation with the costumers, she was unorganized, and unstable to run the store. The pay was ridiculously cheap only $9.41 an hour to put up with all the bs she threw at us. Never would i recommend anyone to work at this location."
bad,"Overall I love the store, but management could definitely use some improvements, along with the security within the store. Scheduling is unexplainable in a negative way. I'm just not pleased with the company and how it's ran."
bad,"Nice place to work in theory and not saying all Ultas are bad but since working here it has been one thing after another and HR does not take appropriate action. District Manager turns a blind eye. Ulta mainly looks outside to fill positions and only seem to promote friends and ""YES"" people from with in."
bad,"Honestly I love what I do but the company as a whole i wouldn't recommend, or at least the Austin district. They over work you and you aren't paid 99% of the time for the level of work you do. the pay in general is a joke and forget about raises. Honestly if you're just looking for something part time and just want a cashier job or want a discount on makeup then apply."
bad,"Appearance restrictions were too harsh on employees, such has which shades of certain colors were acceptable to wear, restrictions on how hair was styled were too strict as well, ex. wearing a simple ponytail wasn't acceptable, the hardest part of the job was having to provide customers information with little to no training, co-workers were usually fun to work with, although most of the management typically had a bad attitude towards everyone, I did however learn a great deal about make up, the industry, and gain retail experience."
bad,Issaquah management is a joke and everyone is jumping ship. If you want a job you can enjoy and grow with. This is not your job. It's a completely dead end job. If you want to not get scheduled hours and get scheduled without being told. This would be your job. Bad discount to.
bad,it's slow but fast paced at times. Never really put me on the schedule. The clients were the only thing that made me like my job.
bad,more staff then hours. They over staff and so you will not get the hours they promise when hired. Only have part time so no benefits! so you can work there and make your own opinions they may have changed since I worked there and if they did great !
bad,"This position is labeled as a ""management"" position, but it isn't! You aren't full time and the benefits are terrible"
bad,"-Set Up Spa room"
bad,"I love the hair/beauty industry and everything it USE to offer. When first hired I imagined an awesome place to work with wonderful people who were as dedicated as me to help customers find the right products, makeup and hair wise to make them feel and look beautiful! I was wrong. I have never worked with such an unprofessional and child-like management before. This company is a joke. Not enough time to do ANYTHING that we had to get done. Too much gossip not enough working or everybody being a ""team""."
bad,Ulta suck. They treat there employees like cattle and dont give them any repect in return for doing great work
bad,its a laid back job but there is no leadership the management needs to step it up on all levels from the district to the general manager and on down
bad,Stocks merchandise in overstock areas.
bad,Alot to learn in a small timeframe. Poor leadership and fake people. Wages are not sufficient for the work demands. Little room for advancement. Very demanding quotes to achieve.
bad,I made the decision to leave Ulta because the work environment was not conducive. Management had a lack of communication and there was not a sense of team or any room to grow within the company. I will mention that Ulta is a chain and management is ran differently depending on the investor. My store location and experience is not necessarily for every store location.
bad,"Managers suck and made job miserable, they dont take you seriously or care about you or your well being just their money and sales. Dont waste your time."
bad,Very clique-y environment. All advancements through the company are based on how friendly you are with the GM and DM. Constantly calling on days off for coverage.  Unpleasant experience overall
bad,"Management over promised and under performed. "
bad,"They offer free education classes which was great. I, unfortunately, didn't have a good experience with management and work-life balance started to become an issue. I have to say though, I have gained some life long friendships from working for their company and very loyal clients that are willing to follow me anywhere.  I also wouldn't have built up the confidence to go independent if I had not worked there. So it all worked out the way it was supposed to."
bad,"I've had great managers, but they rotate/leave and are replaced with terrible ones. Individuality is not a thing unless you're a manager or prestige.."
bad,Inconsistent hours and poor management skills. Schedules are almost never followed and you may be assigned to work a day only to be told upon arrival your shift changed
bad,It was not at all what they expressed at the interview. They expect your personal/family life to come second always and Ulta to always come first. The promised training training to prepare you for your job and that also was not what they gave once I took the position.
bad,"the management system in Ulta is very bad from Cooperate, distric management, regent management to store management. They have no Communication to all of associate and management associate and very favoritism in their system. they are not train or coach their employee to become successful, they just try to abused the labor of associate with very low pay. Most of associate with certified license is get pay at a minimum wage or lower, not all of associate in Ulta get 5 cent rate for their salary yearly."
bad,"If your loyalty numbers were too low, they threatened to cut your hours to 10 per week. Not great management, nobody really did anything or enforced any rules. The customers were normally pretty demanding and it was a little annoying to have to get your bag and jacket checked every night."
bad,Working at Ulta was very stressful. I was lied to so I would take the job. The managers there don’t know what they are doing.  The hours are short. The pay isn’t too great.
bad,"My general manager was racist, my prestige manager was racist corporate didn't care and once she got fired for stealing, they promoted her junior. I was never promoted to lead cashier despite being there the longest. The work culture is messy like teenage girls. Do not work there unless it is a last resort."
bad,I worked here for three months and had less than fifteen shifts.most were three hours long and closing The salon manager would sit in the back and talk bad about her employees
bad,"Enjoyed most of my co workers , it’s a lot of caddy girls stuff. Your hard work doesn’t count , if you want to move up it’s all about brown nosing and sucking up to the managers. They tend to hire outside rather promote from within we weren't even making the minimum wage they never give us our annual review and instead of giving people more hours they would just hire a bunch of people and give people 4 hours each and wonder why they quit"
bad,There is no growing in this company but if you just want a part time job where you don’t care if it’s engaging go for it. There is a lot of theft and it’s often under staffed.
bad,"They make you work 7.5 hour shifts with only one 15 minute break that you are paid for so no one cares if you don't get to take it. I Had never worked in retail before so I had questions. One of the managers literally told me to figure it out for myself and walked away when I asked a question With a customer standing in front of me. She would have her phone out and be texting but if someone who wasn't her friend did the same thing, she freaked out and yelled at them. The customers are intitled and demeaning, rude and management never cared if you were verbally attacked. Please do yourself a favor and do not work here."
bad,Turn over was terrible. It was hard to get people to work as a team. There was no communication making it hard to deliver what they wanted. Wouldn’t recommend.
bad,Management was horrible and the employee all talked about each other. Just a nasty environment to be in. And HR doesn’t care. They just tell the manager what was said
bad,"I enjoyed my time at ulta for about the first 3 months but then managers started picking favorites, the coworkers would pick on you and HR was absolutely no help. Ultimately I was forced to quit due to being so unhappy. I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"This company forced me to perform managerial duties without managerial benefits.  Even though we desperately needed a manager in the position, they refused to officially promote me to position or pay."
bad,"Could never get gratis unless you sold the most credit cards.pushed credit cards  And they cared more about credit cards than the employees or customers. Management was rude to employees and customers.   "
bad,"I worked here for close to a year, I was hired on by an amazing manager that cared for her employees and wanted to make us all grow within the company. unfortunately, she was let go on a technicality and the new manager they brought in was horrible! This new manager didn't care to help anyone grow except herself and she did her best to stop anyone internally on getting a promotion. It was her mission to fire everyone and hire new staff, not caring to even get to know the staff she had. OHH and the district manager... HORRIBLE she couldn't care less about the staff, she just cares about the store managers, everyone else is irrelevant to her. Also, they discriminate against pregnant people. Just an FYI."
bad,"This is not a job for someone looking to move up in Ulta. I worked at this company for a bit and in the time I worked there I lost my passion for makeup, no longer felt like my contributions meant anything to my managers, and had my hours cut time and time again no matter how much I gave them. I stayed late, came in early, went above and beyond for them. For nothing but 1 shift a week at 6 am. The shift I told them I couldn't work because I lived an hour away. Making $80 dollars every 2 weeks sound fun to you? Apply at Ulta."
bad,I had a tough time being apart of the ulta team. Our store manager at the time was very rude to her employees which made it hard to work. She would give out degrading comments to every girl and never had anything nice to say. I ultimately decided to part ways with the company even though I love ulta so much as a customer. Due to the lack of benefits and the new company policy changing its benefits to none and lessening my hours I had to find something else as a single mom because I couldn't rely on ulta to be a great source of income.
bad,I barely got a promotion which yes the pay is great ONLY IF YOU GET THE HOURS !! I’m a BPA My store has been cutting hours left and right and not only that my GM OVER HIRED !! It’s ridiculous how we “need so many people for truck and adset “ Favoritism plays a factor and unless your willing to be fake and kiss some butt your chances of getting hours are still slim.. the girls are always catty and I never get floor time I’m always on cashwrap and when it comes to events I’m never scheduled or I close !!! I seriously dislike how horrible my team is (with the exception of a few girls ) DO NOT BOTHER WORKING HERE THEY WILL OVER WORK YOU TO THE BONES WHEN YOU ARE THERE AND STILL NOT GIVE YOU HOURS .. YOU WILL NOT BE APPRECIATIVE AT ALL .. and unless your all for drama and love having problems this place is right for you
bad,"From management down it's all about favoritism and what leadership brass you're friends with. If you're in the ""cool"" crowd you'll have an inside track for advancing."
bad,"When I got the job at Ulta Beauty I was super excited. When I started I was not given any training so I had to learn to do a lot of things on my own. I was told there were videos I had to watch for training but they were never shown to me. Managers informed me that my temporary job could be come permanent after working there for a few months. This did not happen for me and wasn't even discussed. I went to check my schedule for the next week and noticed my name was missing. When I asked a manager they said they weren't sure why. I was told days later over the phone that it was the end of my temporary job and I didn't even get to work the full amount of time that the position offered. At my location it was difficult to work because everyone was in a clique. When I tried to involve myself in conversations or ask question about the job I was looked over as if I wasn't there. This made me uncomfortable coming into work. My days consisted of walking around the store and turning products on the shelves. Whenever I got to the register to help I was consistently asked to leave to face products even if it was busy. The hours for the first couple of weeks were decent and then it went way down to having only 4-8 hours a WEEK. The store where I was located was at a very busy area too, so getting so few hours and not being able to help at the register was surprising. Managers didn't inform me that your hours depended on your sales and loyalty sign ups. But I was given the wrong employee number to log into the register, and told my managers that the wrong name was coming up, and it took forever"
bad,"Working with customers answering phones and setting appointments. was daily work life at Ulta. "
bad,"Ulta beauty is a great company to shop at but not to work for. The company heavily relies on its loyalty program and it's two credit cards. Employees hours are entirely based on the loyalty sign up percentage and how many credit card sign ups they've gotten per week. Ulta Beauty does not care if you are a hard worker, they only care about how much you as an employee can promote their company. Aside from sign ups being very difficult, while working the stock team in the mornings, the company does not allow you to drink water bottles from the store, there's no lights in the bathroom before stores hours and there is absolutely no A/C until the store opens. It is a horrible work environment. They also require you work 7 hours before you can take a meal break."
bad,The working at alto was different from my previous time before the GM was brand new the staff is brand new so it’s really hard to see where things are going nobody really knew what they were doing so if there was a chance for the team to get trained by those in the area the right way I’m sure that the kick off of the new store would’ve been different and things would’ve been run more smoothly
bad,"It's a fast pace job and super high demand on product to be picked. "
bad,"Very slow, not enough people coming in to the store to keep the salon a float. "
bad,Ulta is good job for you if you are okay with being micro-managed and given insufficient hours which will make it hard to pay your bills. The most enjoyable part of my job at Ulta was that they feed you sometimes and the discount .
bad,Management never had the amount of hours needed to keep an employee for an entire shift. Always being sent home three to four hours into a nine hour shift because there were no customers. That wouldn't be an issue if I didn't live thirty minutes away so it was a waste of gas for me. Management made you feel dumb and did not treat you with respect.
bad,Discount is the only thing that makes it bearable. No place for advancement and the hourly pay rate is not worth it. The management is lazy and doesn't treat they're coworkers as coworkers.
bad,"This company is very cut throat. Whether you're a BA or GM, you could be replaced in a blink of an eye. They don't care about their employees. Just their sales.. that includes corporate. They're all a joke. "
bad,"Currently a beauty advisor. "
bad,It was fun at first but once new management came in it was a stressful experience lots of gossiping back stabbing no good communication. There is a chance to have a great career with Ulta but the traffic is just not there in this specific store.
bad,"Terrible, TERRIBLE management. If you want to feel like you're back in high school, work for Ulta. Managers enforce random policies that are not stated anywhere. There is most definitely favoritism. Managers get away with literally any and every thing. If you want to work somewhere that will keep you from going insane, I don't suggest Ulta. The company itself is great but being an employee is awful. They treat you like dirt and pay you pennies for it. Not worth the hard work. I cannot emphasize how badly this company needs a management cleanse. The managers drive away most of the employees and they always belittle their employees. The managers I've encountered, have the most unpleasant attitudes out of any retail store I've worked for/shopped at. Stay away if you can. I thought makeup and the discount was worth it.. it's not !!"
bad,Coworkers were somewhat nice but my managers didn't really know how to train me. I was looking to be promoted within but they promoted the person that got hired after I did.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Ulta in Carmel for the first 2 months, then a new manager was hired and she was awful.  The staff changed drastically after she was hired and many people quit because of the way she ran things which was insufficiently."
bad,There is no communication between management and associates. All the managers talk bad about each other.They will cut your hours with no notice and are constantly hiring new people and taking hours away from people who have been there a long time.They have no loyalty for their employees at all. Expect  an average of 20 cents for a raise. Absolutely ridiculous and proves the company does not care about keeping people long term. This is the highest overturn of any company I have ever worked for and now I see why.
bad,"The management is just rediculous. Not flexible but promises to be. Too many people in charge, headband manager is rude to employees and customers. Takes over 2 hours to close when it should take no more than 1"
bad,I enjoyed being able to help customers that walked into the store find whatever product they were looking for. I also liked working with the employees.
bad,"great company "
bad,The jobs at Ulta will help to pay your bills don't plan on being there long management under a lot of pressure from corporate to meet their numbers
bad,"If you don't fit in with the ladies that work there, you're done for. The morals there are just ridiculous. It's like high school. No way I could have been given a raise or promotion with how I was being treated. I LOVED my job description.... hated the job. Always behind a register, always being ridiculed (not in a constructive way) and there's a lot of trash talking as well. Oh, and the hours are a waste of time. Seriously. 4 hours a week?"
bad,This company doesn't provide much hours at all. They cut back on hours and require the managers to fill in most of the time. I'm a hairstylist there and that is no way for me to grow a clientele.
bad,Let me start off by saying ULTA was a great place to work ten years ago. Now you'll be fighting off thieves and trying to save your stores product in lou of not getting written up for not doing enough to save your stores merchandise. Associates were and are getting hurt..cut with a knife..stabbed..punched...I was almost assaulted...sucks! ULTA has no plans of hiring security to make their employees and guest feel safe. That's just the LP issues. Upper management is disconnected with store management. Communication and organization in stores is horrid. This is a kids job for management for sure..not grown professionals. The pay is under scale and forget about balance in your life away from work...schedule changes almost daily and gratis is few and far between. Former Co Manager/Sac Area
bad,The hardest part of the job was creating an experience for all  clients within company standards. Not a company that was warm and fuzzy.
bad,It is retail so of course it sucks but its even worse when the company doesn't care about their employees.
bad,"Not a great place to have a career. But, it was an interesting place to work. Now I have a greater appreciation for shoes."
bad,Not the place to work if you are trying to make a decent living on your own. The pay sucks and working in the salon busting your but for nothing to hard too move up to the next level and when things go wrong there is no mannagment support to back you up they don't give you a second chance or try to work something out they just fire you with no warning
bad,"i got to work started cleaning and organizing the products , helped clients get their needs met . did stock , inventory , cashier, make up applications . i would do a little bit of everything everyday for maybe 12 to 14 hour shifts ."
bad,"The environment was very 'clickish' just like high school.  Meaning their were employees that were definately favored and supported. The company barely acknowlege skin care within the Salon at Ulta.  Guests entering the store had no idea that skin treatments were available within the store.  When the company did acknowledge skin care it was because they were offering discounts on my services: 30% off was frequent, store ""points earned"" gave my services away for free. Clients drawn in by discounts fairely returned unless it was to use another discount. No time was allowed between appointments for cleaning and sanitation. Lies from management were commonplace. Treatment had to be given in full view of all store guest. Absolutely no privacy. No solid walls for sound proofing. No restful music. Bright and loud treatment area. The best part of the job was my employee discount."
bad,"Main manager constantly scheduled people outside of their availability, treats employees like disposable underlings and is generally an erratic mess. She doesn't care at all about the employees and would rather hire out instead of promoting anyone so you will never be paid higher than minimum wage"
bad,"Ulta Beauty would be such a better company to work for if the company gave enough payroll to support a great customer experience.  Unfortunately, guests have to shop by themselves because there are never enough associates on the floor to help.  This make the guests very frustrated."
bad,"The stores are always cluttered and dirty, management has no leadership skills, no one helps you with planning a career within the company. Organization and communication from management is terrible. The discounts are the only good part of the job"
bad,No work/life balance.  The benefit package was pretty great.  Salary could have been more with how much is expected from you as a manager.  Very difficult job to have unless you are single with no children.
bad,"Very hard work.  The day begins at either 6am or 8am and for four hours straight you lift and carry very heavy boxes, restock shelves, break down those boxes and then haul out mountains of plastic and cardboard trash to a dumpster about a block away.  I just finished my shift and am too tired to have any sort of life.  My back is killing me but I do not get any health insurance because it is not offered to part time staff.  Staff, including mgmt is very young, and things seem very disorganized.  The stock room is so crammed full and disorganized that if a customer wants something, it is impossible to get to it.  We generally tell the customer to come back next week. There has got to be a better way to store back stock."
bad,"I work at the Chester,Va location and our gm is horrible, she only cares what corporate has to think about her. Pay is horrible. I cant even afford to save money to move out. I could barely save for a car when i needed one. They only care about the numbers you bring in, not if your physical well being. Poorly ran, poor management (i wanted to give management no stars), and they REFUSE to put people as full tim. Ive been myy store for a year now and i am miserable everytime i go into work. You never know what your doing wrong, they will just wright you up and not explain anything to you. You NEVER get told about any of the promotions that go on. The inly thing keeping me at my job is my Salon manager, since i am a stylist, and a few other people. Other than that i would be gone. The onky good thing about working here is that you get 25%off. And they dont give any hours to anyone but managers"
bad,"The only perk of working at Ulta was the discount and being exposed to the beauty industry. The only way you could get any kind of promotion is if the managers is if you’re one of the managers’ favorites. It’s very clicky and not someplace I would recommend to work. You’re also, overworked and severely underpaid. I was there for 2 years and made less than $10 per hour, when new employees would make more money than I would  come in an"
bad,Management was poor and unresponsive. Unprofessional lacked tact where it was highly need. Retaliated when you would reach out to HR. Would not recommend working here. They made it seem like a great place to work until you actually get in the door.
bad,"I loved ulta at first it was chill and it was fun cause I was doing what I loved. The problem came in when I started dealing with management that made my experience terrible, working and feeling like you’re not good enough or like at any moment they will fire you is the worse feeling ever. I got burned out working for them. The managers sucky attitude, the pay, them using you and not willing to pay or promitecupu left a terrible taste in my mouth"
bad,"Managers are very unprofessional and petty. They do not value their workers, cashiers are definitely overworked and underpaid. If you are trying to build a career, this is not the place."
bad,"Self serving, mean girls club. Favoritism served with a side and highschool mentality. No Diversity in with upper or any management. Stylist are not diverse either."
bad,"We were always told that they would advance from within which never seemed to happen, there were always outsiders that would come in who expected it to be an easy job. The management was very poor at my location (with the exception of one) and the general manager would never take action on people who were doing wrong in the store due to playing favorites. It was not a team environment and when advice for ways to change that were suggested, they never stuck through with it."
bad,"Company is great but the Utah district suffers with poor management, unreal expectations and disgusting discrimination. They claim work/life balance but do not practice AT ALL."
bad,Terrible management and I just never felt appreciated. I worked more than what I earned always. The management never wanted to explain how to correctly do things.
bad,Management is awful. Sales pressures are intense. If you don’t meet your credit card sign ups or membership sign ups two weeks in a row you’re fired. Catty coworkers and coworker drama. Avoid if at all possible. If looking in CT maybe try the North Haven one.
bad,Management treated me poorly after I put in my transfer. Trying to force me as a part time stylist to work over 40 hours a week and telling me I needed to do things that weren’t in my job description I.e cover for retail managers that were on their lunch or sell for boutiques. I received no benefits or anything for the fulltime as well I got in trouble for leaving early because I was put on fulltime without my consent as a part timer. When I finally was able to get off full time my schedule was butchered as much as they could. I waited about 3 months for them to then decide to fire me. Telling me they decided weeks ago and without being given an actual reason. The GM apparently falsified a report saying I had said something I never did. Our salon manager was out on loa and the gm became power hungry. Working for Ulta themselves was great but the manager was not so much. All of this over me wanting to transfer.
bad,"Ulta seems like it would be an amazing place to work, with all of the makeup to play around in, the amazing customers, the great discount, the promises of fast advancement--and then you start and you realize that it's not always the case. When I began at Ulta, I really enjoyed it! It was a company that clearly cared about their employees and guest experiences, making it a point to make associates aware that they should never sell items just to make goals, but to genuinely recommend product that suit the customers' needs. But after years of working for the corporation, it seemed as though their ideals completely changed for the worse. "
bad,"The location i worked at had 4 managers and they all had a different version of the rules. The goals are unobtainable and overzealous for the foot traffic. The co workers are catty and the gossip never stops. If you want to feel like you’re back in highschool, apply here, if not, go ANYWHERE else."
bad,The environment was toxic a lot of bad mouthing coworkers. Lack of communication on scheduling & shifts. There was no way of knowing what you were walking into that day. People were rude to each other & management made themselves unapproachable by locking themselves in an office majority of the time.
bad,Too obsessed with sales and pushing their credit card to care about their employees. No benefits offered at all except to management team. Favoritism is a huge problem and you will not be able to advance career wise unless you rub elbows with the right people. Expects high amount of workload to be completed while paying as minimally as possible for their employees time. Receiving hours is competitive.
bad,Store manager was disrespectful  and we had alot people that weren’t really there to help kinda had to train your self. Poor management and people were always in and out
bad,"They want you to restock, clean, help people, AND run the register. Now anybody can multi-task but not when they purposely don't schedule enough people to work NOR can one person do all of this is a giant store."
bad,I actually loved my job at Ulta. It was fast paced and crazy. I had a hard time dealing with the management there. They didn't listen. I was working full-time hours but was considered part-time so I didn't get all the benefits of full time.
bad,"You're expected to work past your shift end times. Hours are not always guaranteed. I was a manager and even I can tell you that the hours are very odd. Some associates would get three or so shifts one week, then only one the next. It's always just one associate and one manager on the floor, so when it gets busy it gets hectic! Store manager stays in her office all day long and rarely helps out on the sales floor. They pay alright but not enough for how much you are expected to do."
bad,"Low pay and mostly only part-time hours.  Management is terrible with lots of brow beating and picking favorites over employees that really deserve more.  Most people work only part-time with no benefits and you are expected to just work and like it.  I loved the work place but not the management they have there.  They do not promote as promised and if you have a problem with anything they just sweep it under the rug.  The concept is good, love the store and the products and services but they need managers that know the business of cosmetology!"
bad,Management was not considerate of my school life. basically would have to choose going to work or going to class several times because of their lack of scheduling correctly.  displayed favoritism. giving some employes 5 hours for the week while others would receive 30.
bad,"It was a very stressful environment to work in.  There was no room for advancement and all these requirements you have to hit before you actually can get benefits, paid time off, or any kind of sick leave."
bad,"I never like to bash a job, but this one was quite the job. I will say the pay was very competitive and the job itself was fun. Who doesn't like playing with make up all day and making people feel beautiful? The management is the downfall of this company. There were many unrealistic expectations as well as favoritism and drama. The job itself was great and rewarding, but the over all experience of working with this job was extremely stressful."
bad,Job is definitely geared for a younger crowd that is willing to work every type of job there without much training or hours. Hours are slim to none...
bad,The general manger of this Ulta did not care towards her employees. She showed favoritism towards certain employees. Most of the good management left after so long due to her. Also the management that stayed was mostly because they knew her personally. I do not suggest this job unless you are willing to bend over backwards and become a robot to work here.
bad,"As the store-level employee that actually performed the work that makes Ulta a successful organization, compensation is not comparable to the demands of the job. "
bad,"As management, there is no work-life-balance"
bad,"I did not enjoy my work experience at Ulta. The staff was very rude and not very good at training new employees. Also, there were too many people on staff and not enough hours available for everyone."
bad,"Never in my entire retail career have I witnessed such astounding favoritism, bias, and hysteria in the workplace. Management likes to schedule more hours for their favorite employees instead of actual higher-performing ones. For example, the store manager would give at least three days to cashiers with consistently low loyalty scores and less days to one with average 80% loyalty, simply because the former are more liked. Most of management are stuck in their ways and refuse to step outside their comfort zone. Seniority in a company does not always mean that these managers possess the ability to manage effectively and efficiently. In fact, where I worked, they didn't. A lot of tasks, such as visual merchandising, would be left unfinished, poorly done, or forgotten about until weeks or even months later. They only develop cashiers they like and hardly ever coach others. Also, gossip runs this location. Performance reviews tend to be based on what is heard and not seen. If management doesn't like you, they will talk about ways to get rid of you. Customers are honestly the least of your worries here."
bad,"A certain manager that worked at the Owensboro location, younger girl, she always had the rudest face towards the rest of her coworkers including myself. Always thought she was better than the rest. Had the biggest attitude towards everyone. The overall management was pretty sad. If you disagreed with something they would get mad and not talk to you the rest of the shift. They would gossip behind your back to other managers/ coworkers. "
bad,Had to let me go because my vacation time was unapproved . Said he would be able to rehire when I got back so I called and he never got back to me . Thought it was unprofessional of him to do that .
bad,"I was never given enough hours and the manger would always ""forget"" to talk to me about my schedule. The place was incredibly messy the break room was tiny and all of management were always so stressed out and upset constantly and took it out on the workers"
bad,"Ulta was not the best place to work.I would not work there again. The pay was horrible, the management team did not possess interpersonal communication skills."
bad,"I loved my job at first, don’t get me wrong. But as I kept working I started to get more and more miserable. They hire managers that know nothing about cosmetics and don’t care to learn, and they’re micromanaging and don’t care about your health and well being. The customers can be very rude and entitled. A lot of times they’re so short staffed that they overschedule. Extremely high turn over rate."
bad,"Other associates are rude, could be any location. Hours are all over the place. Return policy let's Ulta clean off used products and put back out on shelves."
bad,this place is a revolving door for the salon the store I worked for in Beaumont hadn't had an esthetician almost a year before myself I literally worked my butt off to build clientele and sales my sales were great re booking was a struggle finding people to put in my chair was easy the manager wants you to add to all guest ticket and sometimes that scares people away this place isn't for a professional who is passionate about skin also if the salon if off budget your hours will be cut and youll be asked to work 3 hr days
bad,Working at Ulta Beauty helped me to meet some great people and learn a ton on the cosmetics industry and proper selling tactics. The hours were never guaranteed and moving up in the company was rarely ever an option.
bad,"Atmosphere was not ideal, there were numerous times I had trouble with payroll and was not compensated for my work for at least 2 weeks at a time. I do not feel as though this company is an ideal place to work because some of the staff and employees are not fair with certain things."
bad,"typical day at work would be setting up salon. catering to clients and helping around the store when not busy in the salon. I learned some technical skill at trainings at ulta. management was very poor. There was total disregard for employees personal lives or feelings , you felt like just a number instead of an asset. poor communication, and disrespectful behavior. not a very positive for environment. One thing i did love was the clients and customers. and my favorite was the vendors we had  come into the store for certain brands carried at ulta. they were always fun and positive!"
bad,Too much drama. I mean of course your working with all girls and most of them being high schoolers. I don't really know what else to say. It's just too much of everything.
bad,"I was brought on with the promise of speedy advancement. What ended up happening is after one promotion, I was not moved up again but was expected to train my supervisors for their roles."
bad,"The company overall has a culture i believe in but the follow through in this particular district misses by a long shot. I really enjoyed the general manager of my store but that does not compensate for weak management of the entire district as a whole. That trickles down through the stores and creates a place of work where there is high turn over. The quickest way to lose a good employee is to make them feel unappreciated."
bad,"I worked at the corporate store and I started off extremely enthused to grow in the company but was not trained on anything but simple retail work and stocking and they never helped me grow in fact they tell most the ""beauty advisors"" to only stay on register and can not be on the prestige side of the store we are only retail basically.Most customers need extremely detailed information on a certain brand we are left confused because of our lack of training. Especially because I was hired to pretty much do everything in the store but am always in trouble with management if we help a guest and am not constantly on a register. The store is always understaffed and improperly scheduled,someone is always overworking while the others are never there. We were told this is because of not getting enough emails and phone numbers from customers which means you will not get many hours, which I don't understand why a company would do this because it would crash and burn if only one or two people were there working on a busy day which is always happening.The management is horrible and negative and they never communicate. The managers who work under the main manager are always stressed and never seem to have a life and the main manager talks down to associates and treats them very little ,not to mention she seems very antisocial and fake she is not sympathetic whatsoever and talks about people because their back. The high turnover is due to the loyalty issue with getting emails and phone numbers which is not your fault if people absolutely reject it but you will be threatened to be fired if"
bad,"Ulta has the potential to be a great company to work for and be a fun environment to work in.  There were many positive aspects to the Prestige Manager position at Ulta, but they were constantly over shadowed by a lot of negative aspects. I.e.: There is definitely a lack of communication between upper and lower management and beauty advisors; The training process leaves something to be desired; and A work life balance is not something that's achievable while working at Ulta - schedule is given to you at short notice and changes are often made. Benefits and pay scale are decent, but not much vacation time is alotted. Also, if you're someone who enjoys being environmentally friendly - Ulta is not the place for you."
bad,"poor management, not very friendly coworkers, very unwelcoming. They take you off the schedule randomly. Not very many hours and when  you call in for emergencies they punish you by not giving you hours."
bad,"Co-Workers were very nice,"
bad,there is a lack of professionalism and common courtesy here. there are a lot of catty like attitudes. micromanagement is a problem as well. unless you are a licensed makeup artist you will not be doing makeup on people in fact you will be on the register 90% of your time. the pay is minimal. the average person working here gets between 12 and 15 hours per week. it is also a rotating schedule so each week will be different. any company I worked for that has had the rotating schedule always had attendance problems and scheduling conflicts and when you get called to cover someone else's shift and can't do it you are met with attitude. all in all for this location in weatherford texas I would say it's not worth your time you can get more hours and make more money working for another business.
bad,"I worked here twice over the holiday season."
bad,"I believe Ulta offers an appealing message, but the follow through on the store level is less than satisfactory.  Unfortunately, I witnessed the greatest amount of turnover at this location in all my years in retail, I was only there 6 months."
bad,Ulta shouldn't have stylists or estheticians. They do absolutely nothing to promote their salon services. The managers are too young and bias to be able to effectively run a department or store. The pay is terrible and the atmosphere is very catty and immature.
bad,"A typical day at work would include cleaning up after other people working outside of the salon, running around and picking up the slack that the lazy employees dont get reprimanded for. Cleaning the bathrooms, constantly dealing with your scheduled being changed and clients getting angry about that, and you have no way of explaining why without bluntly stating that corporate doesn't care what happens to its employees as long as numbers are met. 110 hours a week are divided among 6 hair dressers and we are expected to do thousands of dollars when only working 10 hours a week rather than the 29 promised when hired."
bad,Negative and unprofessional upper management. LP is creepy and will call store to let you know he is watching you. Having a college education means nothing. Very little room for growth in this company because they prefer to promote outside regardless what they may tell you in the beginning. Racist and discriminate against age. Every store is run different depending on management team which makes inconsistent learning and policies. Poor business practices. Our best manager gets little recognition because other management members take credit for her work. HR is useless and not worth the cal.
bad,"ULTA is best for a student. You will receive minimal hours, but hold no responsibility. If you are interested in growing in the Beauty Industry it is a great start."
bad,"I entered this company with such high aspirations. I had been warned about the store management and even the district manager not having an open door policy. I unfortunately saw this was true when I started. They promise you the world when they interview you but once you join them you see that only a favorite group of people are the ones that get promoted. I do not suggest for anyone to join this company. No matter how hard you work if you are not part of their elite chosen group you will go no where. In addition, in my fifteen yrs of cosmetic experience I have never met such an unprofessional, pretentious management team. My advice is: DO NOT GO INTO THIS COMPANY or you will regret it I'm sorry to say."
bad,You never know what you are getting yourself into when you walk into work work every day. A lot of the time it is pure Chaos. The management staff is very stressed out and being the lower level of the management team I would take the brunt of it. The hardest part of the job is to undo the negativity that others have brought into the store and let people know that I appreciate they are there. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the makeup and seeing all the new products that come in. I liked working with the guests and helping them feel beautiful!
bad,"If you have all the time in the world to work then this is the job for you. If you are in Management, you will most likely work 70-80 hours a week. Good luck!"
bad,"What Ulta is doing to Estheticians is terrible.  Decent company for young, low-skilled employees. I was #1 in retail sales most of the time and took 2nd place for 2018 salon sales with 2 emergency surgeries. Was denied an earned raise the same month I was employee of the month. Salon manager was calling and canceling my clients, in secret, so she could beat me in salon sales."
bad,"good discount, high strung managers and entitled old customers, basic cashier job, but certain locations have better managers than others and more flexible fun workplaces."
bad,"Managers do not care about their workers!! Manager reported for inappropriate (if you know what I mean) harassment multiple times, nothing was done until months later she eventually quit. There is no advancement at all, unless you want to move all over the floor. Part time manager makes as much as half the employees, no chances for raises either. Coworkers are catty and act like children so beware. GM hires complete IDIOTS only. If you’ve ever had a bad experience at this Ulta, you know what I mean.CONSTANTLY understaffed with ridiculously high expectations. The GM has no clue what she is doing most of the time and drags everybody down with her. Not organized at all, if you work here be prepared to pick up other people’s slack because they don’t monitor their employees."
bad,"I worked at ulta for about 6 months or so.  I started off as ops manager.  I recieved no training what so ever other than following other managers around like a lost puppy to figure out what I was doing."
bad,Management complains of high school gossip but are the main contributors of it. Often discussing HR issues in front of coworkers as well as voicing personal opinions degrading employees they do not care for. Management more interested in how they are perceived and do not aide in growth of accociates
bad,"Management for the most part is incredibly subpar and inefficient. They also, along with many general employees, tend to unfortunately have an attitude both on and off the floor which makes the store not feel nearly as welcoming as it could potentially be for both customers and workers alike."
bad,"I had worked for ulta for 5 years and in my 5th year we received a new DM. She would come into the store and pick apart pieces she felt were important to success and then just leave without any recommendations on how to fix a problem. They are constantly switching around people and teams so you never know if you DM is going to stay with you or go. Years back their was a booming culture, a sense of family and a really in touch work life balance. Now Ulta seems to be steering the boat in the wrong direction and are headed to destruction. "
bad,Managers were catty.They undermined each other and fought constantly. All the employees were dragged into the middle of their fights matches and they quickly got rid of anyone that they didn't like. All of those managers were fired and replaced within six months but it has left an awful taste in my mouth. People don't quit jobs they quit managers and Ulta needs to figure out how to protect their employees.
bad,"It started off great, i didn't like not working enough hours to receive benefits.  They do have favoritism is the salon, and if you upset the salon assistant manager she can and will go weeks without speaking to you which i find very unprofessional.  They will suspend you for things people are not even sure you did, its a very stressful and unpleasant place to work.   At the store i work in they have had a lot of turnover due to the managment team."
bad,"While I love working with cosmetics and in makeup the company is extremely manipulative and does NOT give praise or credit where it is due. It is unfair hours, managers do not listen to scheduling preferences nor are understanding when situations occur. There is a lot of intimidation in the lead positions, if you do your job well and or stick up for yourself they do everything in their power oddly enough to degrade you. As I love working with clients and doing makeup on them the job became so much tasking and a hostile environment. Highly unprofessional store manager does gossiping about employees to others as well as making rude comments about appearance & size. I personally always beat sales goals and was praised by customers through surveys and in store to my management yet still could not be told I was a valuable worker. They’re backwards thinking & the immaturity is very high. I wouldn’t recommend the experience if you can avoid it. The “Ulta Way” is a no way to treat your employees who make sales for you."
bad,"Ulta was one of the worst jobs I've held. I worked in Dallas at Park Ln and the management was horrible. They expet you to give up your outside life and completely devote your time to the job, staying late, coming in at 5 am, leaving after truck at 6 am. The manager was extremely rude, demeaning, and a micromanager. You will not get far in the company even though they promise to build your career."
bad,"I’ve been at Ulta for over 2 years,  only received one salary increase which was a couple cents. If you plan on only having a temporary job then this is for you. If you got bills to paid don't even bother. Its ridiculous how they rather promote from Sephora than internally. There is NO recognition which is SAD. Too much drama for a low paying job"
bad,"Working at Ulta Beauty,  having over 20 years of experience i find that it is not great place for experience stylist .Due the fact you do not get enough hour they start you off full time after a months  they cut your hour to part time and if you have bill 10 dollars an hour salary will not work that make it hard to commission out .They do not give you the opportunity to build your clientele, They make it hard for you to meet your goals. They hire more worker than they have clietele, That why it so hard to build. LESS GREAT STYLIST MORE MONEY A COMPANY CAN MAKE. HIRING 10 STYLIST AND EVERYONE IS PART TIME AND HAVING TO DO REDOS OVER LOSING CLIENTELE IT IS INSANE , THE FIRST time  WORKING FOR CORPORATE AND IT IS A MESS THEY NEED LESS STYLIST SO EVERYONE CAN MEET THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS.."
bad,"Ulta is not a bad place to work for a first job, but you definitely don't want your whole career to start and end here. They promised me full-time work but I only get 3 days out of the week to work and they are part-time hours. If you don't have enough clients they cut your hours. If you have clients fully booked throughout the day you are happy and busy and management leaves you alone. If you don't have clients you have to work the floor and help people like a retail associate. I work in a low-income area so facials are out of reach for a lot of people money-wise. They also confuse me for a vender all the time because of the Dermalogica aprons we wear. My management doesn't respect me or my job title. We literally have to pass a state board exam to work and I still don't get any respect. Other employees don't promote facials and a lot of customers don't even know we have them. I'm looking for a full-time job somewhere else. My biggest hurdle is because of the customer base Ulta gets, fancier jobs look down at me."
bad,"First off, they build up the idea of continued education. That consisted of me sitting behind a computer for hours watching product videos. They DO NOT pay what you are worth and the other girls were constantly trying to snake my clients from me when I was not at work. My clients would get upset and let me know. After being in the industry for over 20 years, it was garbage to get paid 9 bucks an hour"
bad,The pay and benefits are great and so is being able to interact with the customers only if you are willing to work for a company that has no respect for personal life.
bad,My Ulta location had horrible management that played favorites and used seniority. Only thing I enjoyed about working at Ulta was that I got 25% off on all products and 50% off on all salon services.
bad,"I have been with Ulta for almost a year and have received little to no training  everything I learn I learned from coworkers not supervisors. I see my supervisor maybe 5 hours a week, If i have an issue protocol is to email my supervisor and I might see a response within 4 hours but most of the time they don't respond. Most supervisors have no idea what's going on so it is pointless to ask them any questions regarding anything."
bad,I’ve heard of other Ulta’s being great places to work but the management at the time I worked there was horrendous. My manager constantly created a hostile work environment and even told me I wasn’t allowed to be on the same side of the store as other employees and cited “my sales” were suffering. Despite it being the slow season with the whole store having low sales.
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal worker. A few weeks in, after the grand opening, I was not scheduled for the week. I was sent a group text message saying they were having issues scheduling all of us but we should be on the schedule the following week. I called in, was not scheduled. This concerned me but I was told by the GM that they would get me on the schedule for the next week."
bad,The staff for the most part is wonderful. Training wasn’t really provided. You don’t get many hours and there’s a lot of employees. Breaks are short and you don’t get a break unless you work 7 1/2 hours+ and the break is too short to really get food. Not a lot of room for growth or advancement.
bad,"There really isnt any training, youre kind of just thrown in and you learn as you go which is fine, except in cases where your percentages of credit card sign ups and things like that are watched and no one told you until your numbers werent good. At which point I then learned about it. "
bad,Horrible Management; all this company cares about is making money for themselves and getting credit cards. Managers don’t do anything but sit in the office and complain about things not getting done but NEVER help but LOVE to take credit for everything when their boss comes and does an audit.
bad,"Working there is very stressful. There are a lot of unexpected expectations that I've had to deal with on a daily basis. The salon manger is awful, as well."
bad,"Terrible place to work as a licnesed professional. (Cosmetology or esthetician). "
bad,"Lack of communication and teamwork. Manager wasn’t around often to give me my proper training was just put on the register, and I also didn’t like how every employee there had their own little groups and exclude other mangers."
bad,"This job could have stayed positive and interesting if the new GM actually understood the Beauty Industry.  Instead, this person saw everything strictly through a retail lens and could not relate to the ACTUAL job at hand.  "
bad,"I was hired prestige beauty advisor but was told beauty advisor was the same.. I was lied to and was never even put in prestige. I did mostly cashier and truck. The hours given was most complained from coworkers. Not reliable if you have another job. They often have you look for someone to cover your shift if you cannot come in or work that day and when you finally have a day off you have coworkers blowing up your phone to take their shift."
bad,"This company hired me to work in prestige products but never allowed me to sell it. they also set up a transfer for me when I moved, however when I got to the new location they had no idea who I was. they never set up the transfer."
bad,"You must be someones friend to move up in the company or be paid fairly for your earnings. For a predominantly female company I was surprised I wasnt provided lactation breaks even after formally requesting time to do so because I waand in a management position. New hire managers with less experience were hired into the company at a higher rate. When management was questioned, they stated that ""we hire at a higher rate now but were not increasing existing wages."""
bad,"Typically within a Corporate role, an employee is given 30-90 days for onboarding and getting up to speed with the role.  Unfortunately, the manager I worked for had no idea what he was doing and wasn't able to give me the tools or direction of what was expected in the role.  The role I was in takes research, networking and time to complete the expectations of the role of finding passive candidates for difficult to fill roles.  One employee that I worked with told me how I was to do my job, although I was much more experienced than her.  Her way didn't work and then she asked the manager to cut me loose after less than 3 full weeks.  I had left a FULL-TIME job with benefits only to be treated like a number in the organization. Never again will I ever shop at ULTA either....what a joke!"
bad,"The hours allocated for associates are disproportionate, meaning "
bad,"Daily the issues were different from the manager texting me she would be late, change her time but n-one on time times would not change making it look as if we were late.  I loved my job, seeing new faces and personalities, when I would apply make-up and show what a difference the joy was over whelming at times.  I was head of all merchandising de to my ability to work fast and adequate when given a task.  Able to set up planogram, set up end cap to catch customers eye, finding areas for merchandise on sale, clearance or overage.  Had all correct signage up.  Did all inventory check, quantity, pull all return to vendors and pack up returned items to send back to company, if the set up.  Keeping ware house set up with ability to find products and clean and safe work space. Ran a small team unloading the truck weekly and having the shelves stocked before store opens and then all back stock in warehouse."
bad,The job I applied for was listed as full time. I worked full time hours for part time benefits and terrible hours. I would've quit MUCH quicker than I did if my coworkers weren't so great.
bad,After working at Ulta for some time I realized they don't offer the best compensation for the jobs you do.you will earn minimum wage even if you're full time which is not ideal.
bad,The managers need better training. Staff needs better pay and PTO. The only manager that was always very professional was D all the other managers especially a short lady was so unprofessional and rude. My short time at Ulta was fun. I liked being around all the makeup. I liked helping the customers with finding their make up. Other then the mangers ulta is a fun place to work at.
bad,A good job for a1n 8-year old who loves makeup. This job is nice for getting a start and offers a pretty decent amount of training. But I felt as if there was not much growth for myself personally.
bad,"Unhappy with work/ personal life balance. Lots of favoritism and little to no support. Management just cared about making number and was telling staff to falsify loyalty, which could in turn get the employee that faked stats fired, but to no detriment to managers."
bad,"It was a great company to work for. When i was hired it was understood that i had family obligations. I specifically told them that I had family vacation every fall in October/ November, when it came time i was refused my time off. So I had no choice but to resign."
bad,Not a very good team. Very cliquey. They tell you that you will get more hours and then don't. Do not recommend. Wasn't happy at all working at Ulta Beauty and I was going to transfer to another store but decided against it because I was not moving up or doing anything.
bad,Worked there for 5 months and they barely give hours. Most hours go to the people that are close to the manager.  No very Friendly staff. no room for promotion.
bad,I am a fairly new employee but have been employed for a good amount of time and still have not gotten proper training aside from watching a few videos. I left my last shift which was a truck shipment without hearing when the next time I would work. Definitely going to call and ask but so far I have been working here for awhile and have not even worked 10 hours. Manager is nice so far but very scatter brained.
bad,They never gave more than one day a week. They only schedule mangers not team members. I would ask for more and they would say “it’s automatic from the computer” no matter how well you do.
bad,"I honestly have nothing great to say. the pay was horrible, are 'raises"" were cents, so don't expect some big raise. They favor people A LOT and move those people up in the company."
bad,sales are all that matters and customers are brutal to the staff.  the best part of the job is the 25% off discount and the once in a great while gratis.
bad,Management has gone down hill. The new GM is awful to work for. The environment is negative and not a place to grow. The salon staff & quality is lost
bad,"I was taken advantage of because this was my first job. Meaning, they made me work more because I was getting paid less. I was working 38-39 hour weeks but was still not ""full time"" and didn't receive any of the benefits. I've been working there for almost 3 years now and have only received two raises of LESS than a dollar."
bad,"Ulta was pretty good first starting out. I love my co workers and managers are amazing. The perks are nice like the discount and free services if you’re in salon  but, the store manager is to put it nicely not a nice person at all. Working for a corporate company when it comes to hair just doesn’t mesh. The rules for lunch breaks are ridiculous. The salon is always out of some sort of supply that is majorly needed. The point system is annoying. Also, they overhire so there’s lack of clients and they cut hours. commission and pay is unfair for the work you’re doing. Overall, the amount of stress you’re dealing with isn’t even worth the pay."
bad,Ulta culture changed when executive management changed at corporate. Ulta became a very stressful place to work and it showed little concern for its people
bad,Prepare to work among some of the vicious girls in the retail world. My team was very rude and confronting. Some of the girls on my staff were bullied by girls that had been there for years because they were very friendly with management. When they started to turn on me - I turned to my store manager and she looked the other way. I was horribly harassed which lead to my leave.
bad,"Ulta was poorly managed and understocked. I worked during the holiday season and was undertrained for my position. I was hired on knowing nothing about the products and received almost no training. We were always out of popular products, and I had received no training on products to direct customers to alternatives. We were reminded to push high end products to the extent that customers would get annoyed and not buy anything because we weren't supposed to show them the cheaper items kept in the store. Management was also just awful all around, blatant favoritism to the point of getting little to no hours if one manager did not know you or like you, ignoring legitimate reasons to not come in (I was scheduled after having a minor surgery and was yelled at by a manager for not being able to find someone to cover for me. I had only worked there for a few weeks and had met 2 other people who were allowed to cover that shift.) Overall just an unpleasant store to work in."
bad,"Although I did learn and grow from the experiences and the gratis was sometimes nice, I would not recommend working for Ulta. The pay is nowhere near the amount of work they expect. Upper management is totally disconnected and have unrealistic expectations; Catty, cliquey upper management. Regular schedules are discouraged and are made to be different from day to day and week to week so it is impossible to make plans. Hours given to staff the stores are nearly non-existent; expect it to be 1 cashier and 1 manager most of the time, even at high grossing stores. No respect for the employees. They treat you like a criminal and you can't leave the building without being searched. I could go on and on..."
bad,I loved my job at ulta. Unfortunately I had very unpleasant experiences with the GMS I worked under. The hours are very unreliable as well. Even if you do your job well there’s not much job security
bad,"I love the environment of working at ULTA but the negative aspect of the job is the amount of hours you get and the lack of any advancement. Makeup is my passion but being scheduled to work for truck and stocking when being on the floor and helping costumers picking makeup and color matching etc is my strong suit. On top of that, I dont believe that we get paid as much as we should be for the job that we do. Regardless, I would be okay if we got enough hours, but we don't. They dont pay you enough to live, they wont give you the hours, and the work schedule is never consistent."
bad,"Ulta was a big disappointment. They promised the world and when you get to a point when you have earned advancement opportunity, they conveniently changed the criteria."
bad,management was poor. they were not understanding of things going on in my personal life. i had a full face of makeup on one day and was told i had to put more on.
bad,Just didn't enjoy my time spent here. Management was very inconsistent and did things very wrong.  High theft issues uncontrolled putting employees at risk to handle their selves. Customer service was put at the bottom of the list.
bad,"At my ulta there was zero room for advancement even when you are trying. The GM would talk to you about it, but then you could go another 3-6 months without any talk of it again. Raises are few and far between and being paid less than $10 an hour and only receiving 20 hours a week is less than adequate when trying to advance and make a career. I was told no other positions were available when that was not the truth. It's a tough community to be in when you are not told the truth and paid less than you deserve. "
bad,"Ulta Beauty is a large company that is trying to do something different by providing its customers with a fun, all inclusive and interactive beauty experience. They lack the support, training and investment in their employees to make it a positive or realistic company to work for in the long term."
bad,Was guaranteed at least 20 hours a week when i accepted the job. I would only get 8 hours a week if lucky. They had me working everything in the store and I was only getting paid 9.00 a hour. I would personally never work there again. Plus management had favoritism.
bad,"Management at my store specifically is all over the places, we don't have a GM so no one knows what they're doing and how it's going to get done. We're expected to make many sales and hit goals every day, but don't make commission or any benefit from the sales. We're expected to be loss prevention and security, and when things get stolen we are still the ones to blame. We aren't guaranteed breaks or lunches, no matter how long your shift is. We aren't allowed to try any of the tester cosmetics during the day, so the only way to know if prestige cosmetics work is to buy it yourself or watch training videos. I would only recommend working here if you plan to make this a career or your life, because they want everything from you."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, hardly ever get to take a break. Management only care about their friendship and create a negative work place, and only cares about nepotism"
bad,"- worked at Ulta for about a year as a beauty advisor/sales associate"
bad,"The company had a lot of issues with scheduling, and policies. the managers I had were all fired. To this day they still send me employee information after I was ""fired"" by the salon manager, even though the store manager and corporate did not know about it. it was a lot to deal with. The store is great, but the company needs serious help."
bad,"I highly contemplated writing this review, but I feel I should to give a fair warning to estheticians who are considering working here. I have things to say about the specific Ulta I was at, and also the corporation itself."
bad,"Very unorganized and hectic work environment.  I'm VERY good at understanding a process already in place, and noticing the choke points that need assistance in furthering the flow of product/information to the customer.  People are numbers, not individuals.  My successful moto in life is to empower the people around me positively through group based incentive opportunities.  Not while ignoring deadlines or being easy-going on the job.  The balance is set by me with my actions and smile!  I'm looking for an employer that is willing to let me flourish."
bad,"Management was poor, showed favoritism.   Did not practice what they preached. Very mean. It was a bad experience all the way around"
bad,I enjoyed when I had clients and was happy to help customers. I did not enjoy having no clients I like to be busy and I dont know if they promote skin services as much as they promote hair services.
bad,"My experience at Ulta was good for just getting exposed to the makeup world in an actual store. "
bad,This job would be more fun if I knew I was making enough money to live or if i had enough hours to make enough money. I have only been getting about 11 hours a week.
bad,Ulta is one of those corporations that is screwed from the ground up.. The incompetency starts with the managers at each store. Everyone just picks favorites and it's not based on how good of a job you do.
bad,"Don't let the name ""Beauty advisor"" fool you. Your job is to stand behind a register all day, not play with makeup. I'm not sure if it was the area i was in, or if it was just our store being notorious for being suckish, but the majority of the customers i receieved each day were SO RUDE and complained over the smallest thing. Arguments were going on left and right between the customers and employees. Let me start off by saying we were majorly under staffed, so only 2 of us work at a time. And our store is a decent size. A typical day at work is clocking in, putting your headset on and hopping on the register. Usually nobody replies to me on what i'm doing for the day when theres downtime, so i aimlessly stock grab n go's, and straighten around my area since im supposedly not allowed to go past the bare essentials counter or i get in trouble. Does this make any sense, i have multiple customers asking for help all over the store, the only other person thats working is busy already, or in the back and doesnt reply to me over the head sets. I have 3 people complaining theres nobody in prestige, and another one is yelling at me because her makeup said another price on the wall but my computer wont let me override unless a manager can enter her numbers for me. So i stand there for 10 minutes awkwardly developing a line behind the counter because NOBODY will answer me. If this store wasn't understaffed, maybe i would stay. The pay isn't enough to pay bills, and they give you your schedule a day before you're scheduled to work, so it's hard to balance your life/other jobs because they"
bad,Owners did not seem to care about their employees only their bottom dollar.  felt they did not do anything to promote overall business.  several employees I worked with were also unhappy and it lead to a discouraging workplace.
bad,"GM and DM are very sneaky and unprofessional.  You are not treated like an adult in this store, GM is racist and had staff running around watching certain customers.  When I reported the discrimination to HR, I was then threatened that I would be fired.  I ended up finding a much better job and quit.  Great benefits, however I worked way too much to enjoy them.  They preach family/worklife balance...I was forced to work days that I told them I couldn’t when hired.  You are told to feel safe going to HR, but that is totally untrue."
bad,"I expected more professionalism and fun out of this job. Hours are constantly cut and management is extremely rude. We went from having a great GM who inspired us to be better, to a GM that makes me dislike even going."
bad,"Great products but very unorganized as a store, hardest part was being responsible for cleaning and restocking products constantly. Had to chase after shoplifters who they only alerted me to when they were African American, hispanic, or looked poor. Hours constantly taken away and then given back with no consistency. "
bad,"now not all of the management is bad, i would say its 50/50 between the four. Two of them are understanding and appreciative of the hard work that gets put in but the other two are unappreciative and hold expectations that they themselves could never reach. they also dont let the other two have any say. its abuse of power and also causes a hostile work environment."
bad,"I felt like I didn’t belong nor did they want me there. The people had biases if you weren’t who they like you received no hours. You work too hard for no hours, I was credit superstar for a month but barely got schedule."
bad,"I learned a lot but management was inconsistent and there was little room for growth or promotions.I felt like there was always something to do so I felt always busy so the time passed by fairly quickly. With that being said, I feel like I was expected to do a lot and was not paid enough for what I did. I was expecting to get more hours and quickly realized that was not the case. If you want a better inside into the beauty industry then I say go for it but if you’re also looking for a job to support you I suggest going somewhere eelse. They are immensely corporate and more concerned about making money then their employees"
bad,"Working for Ulta was one of the biggest mistakes. I was constantly belittled and harassed over the headset by my manager, so that everyone could hear. Someone eventually spoke up about it to HR, and I almost got fired for it. Management didn't do anything, and left everything to the Beauty Advisers. Hardest part of the job, was being forced to push credit cards, and being told to give up after the third ""no"", which made customers irritated and angry."
bad,No opportunity for growth because management doesn't usually come from within. It is hard for them to recognize talent. You're better off working for a vendor.
bad,"At first, Ulta was amazing, my little getaway from life. It's not until you get deeper into the system and realize how unfair and cruel the system is. If you do not get good loyalty percentage and good outcomes in credit cards you will not get any hours. This is proven to be true on multiple occasions, in which beauty advisors have seen patterns. When you get a shift of placement, such as cashier/customer service to tasking, you will have deeper intel in how corrupted the whole company is. They will ask you to proceed with certain tasks with cooperate sending you the appropriate materials to get the job done, and then blame you for their mistakes. Most of the stores are disgusting. There is no type of diversity or way to blossom in the system, being bilingual doesn't mean anything to them you will continue to be paid worse than the overpowered Caucasians, your extremely hard work is overseen and never appreciated. Managers only work for themselves and to benefit themselves in every possible outcome. I have never seen such a corrupted system."
bad,"I have worked at a variety of different salons. This “salon” felt like I was a car salesman. When the pay structure changed it did not change for the better. It took money away from individuals. You had to work twice as hard for half the pay. The “sliding scale for commission” is unattainable when there are other variables in the picture. The perfect picture to be making decent money is no kids, no life, work at Ulta ride or die type of hours. That is not realistic. 60% commission sounds amazing IF it were attainable within reason."
bad,Due to their seasonal sales promotions they always use temp employees. They never provide you with the feeling your job is secure. They provides many benefits to full time employees but not equal to temporary. This was mainly shown through work tasks
bad,Management is the biggest issue. I guess it depends on every location but I just felt like they didn’t really care about me and only cared about my performance. Even when it was amazing they weren’t satisfied.
bad,Did not like that the work/life balance was nonexistent  and didnt like pushing credit cards when people obviously dont want them. I learned alot about products and what to use and what not to use. I would say its a good temporary job.
bad,"Unless the occasional discounts is all you need, working any longer than seasonally for this company is almost always a waste of time. Our management team was not prepared to lead or teach us properly so we were often punished for leaving tasks incomplete when we were not given the right tools to finish said tasks. There was very little room for development and growth within the company, and their (management) actions were often influenced by their biased relationships with other team members. Upper management does little to nothing regarding HR issues and friction in the workplace, and they were will replace you and gouge your hours in a heartbeat if they find you're ""insubordinate* until you have no other choice but to quit. Overall, this company is severely lacking in concern or effort in protecting their employees, and that attitude often trickles down to your day to day management team. I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a stable career, maybe a good idea to pick up a little (very little) money on the side or receive some decent discounts on high end products, but thats it."
bad,"I was really excited to start working here. But as i started, i learned what it was really like working for ulta. For one, the Inconsistent scheduling. I constantly got notifications telling me that my schedule has been changed and its always them cutting back hours. I've been sent home not even mid shift! not to mention this has happened multiple times due to them being ""over"" on their hours. Also many of these employees love to gossip.. it will honestly make you feel like you are back in high school. You are poorly talked about to other employees if you call out or are late. You can also tell that they love to pick favorites. Overall this has been one of my worst job experiences and i'm more than glad it ended. Also, if you are looking for a job where you are given a break ... this isn't it. Despite working long hours, you will rarely be given the chance to take a break."
bad,"No work life balance, very limited if any training. As a GM you are expected to  deliver a lot of assistant manager responsibilities. Huge turnover in every location and there is no tenure talent in the company."
bad,"Unfortunately, I did not have the greatest experience with this Ulta and sadly my review is more negative than positive. There was minimal on the job training, most of it is done on their computer system and mostly covered the culture they stated they had. Very harsh criticism from management and no actual assistance to learn your job. The culture at the location I worked at was very bias and catty. Everyone talked behind everyone's back and all workers were always on the verge of leaving. If you do get vacation days you will have to take them when ALL other managers aren't and that is always when no one would want to take a vacation. Other managers would take a month off and then you have to separate your vacation into two days here three days there. The most enjoyable part of the job was working truck one because it was fast paced and two, no one was breathing down your neck telling you how terrible you were doing and stressing you out about a job they cant even do themselves."
bad,All levels of employees from cashiers to store managers changed while I was employed with ulta which with high sales there is room for some advice but unfortunately the management was on a regular turnaround that left things consistency changing for better and for worse when management (one in specific that always stated “fake it til you make it”) started going out of her way to harass me when I was extremely hardworking.
bad,"I really loved my job. I loved helping people find makeup and make them feel beautiful. Unfortunately the company is lacking on treating employees fairly. I was working full time but they refused to give me benefits because I was hired on part time. Pay is horrible, I was barley getting by...yet I was working like CRAZY! They sure expect a lot for receiving so little. I put in a lot of effort to get a new position and my manager never even sent me the link to apply and instead hired another employees best friend...just all in all not a good job unless you are a college or high school student who doesn’t need a actual income or benefits."
bad,"It could’ve been a good job, however management was probably the worst I’ve ever experienced. I’ve never met management who not only makes it crystal clear who their favorites are, but they treat the rest of their employees like pheasants. They literally don’t even speak to you unless something is wrong. Not even a hello. They bicker at you about what you’re not doing, or if you’re talking too much etc. yet they sit in the back on their phones, or talking to each other. The worst of it was when another peer told me that they overheard management openly talking poorly of me, or the time I came in to shop on my day off and was watched on the camera by the prestige manager. If you’re a young preppy white girl who is proficient in brown nosing, this is the job for you! If not you might as well move on!"
bad,"I was only a seasonal hire and ran into a lot of issues. Working later that scheduled, no sympathy for anyone, expected way more. I had a sprained ankle and couldn’t stand for long periods of time yet they made me work cash wrap  all day and forced me to wear a full face of makeup during a break out while my dermatologist stated I shouldn’t wear anything."
bad,"The ULTA I worked at had a high turnover rate. At least six people from the salon quit within two months. The environment was not great. Coworkers did not really speak to me, and when management did speak, they spoke to me like I was a child and did not know anything. On top of all of that, the pay was barely over minimum wage, and as a licensed professional, that is unacceptable."
bad,"The actual work is fun. It's the poor Leadership in this market that makes it a horrible place to work. Coercive management style to the fullest. Turnover is crazy. You will be treated bad if your not liked well enough. Its not a healthy work place for people that want to strive in a promoting, fun atmosphere. If your not in the Sacramento market it might be a whole different experience."
bad,"I love my time spent here for only 2 reasons,the great friends I made and the discounts.cons- Horrible management,very rude to staff and completely unprofessional to both customers and employees. Too much drama in the workplace, makes it stressful to even show up to work. Also unless you act fake and brown nose,you will Never move up with this company.All about special treatment and feels like high school all over again.Treat your employees better. With respect and common decency. Pay too low to survive the cost of living so unless you come from money or need some job experience I wouldnt apply,hours are cut weekly just to make up for sales and you are usually always on register with short of any breaks.I could go on for days about how horrible it is here but I stay for hope that it will get better because I see potential."
bad,"I could not recommend working for ULTA, unless it's just a throwaway job. Cashier or task isn't so bad, and can be mildly entertaining IF you have decent management. Any kind of supervisory role SUCKS HARD CORE...mostly because the corporate executive team is incompetent, and only interested in padding their bonuses. They expect 2 or 3 staff, including managers, to run the place. One cashier, and one floor person CAN NOT effectively service 15-20 guests at a time...many of whom are just there to rob you. This company is a joke."
bad,"not a fun place to work, like everyone thinks. management is not held accountable, it is all up to the peons to do the work and keep the store running."
bad,You get a 15 lunch break and you have to sell 3 credit cards(NO COMMISION FOR IT) and sign 80% of all costumers who come in and dont have an account. Add on appointments like crazy and only make $11
bad,I had a very bad experience working at Ulta. I was a receptionist for the salon and also a makeup artist. I am going to begin with my most stressful part of this situation. One day I was super busy because I worked at both the salon and doing makeup. And many people might not know but we have like 6 different managers telling you 6 different things.
bad,"Too many mangers with too many egos who don't care about anything but loyalty, awful customers, and you are paid less than most fast food places. You are expected to stay extra hours often and come in on your days off."
bad,I loved the makeup aspect of it but the management team was a mess. It was always unorganized and very chaotic and hectic. A lot of people would not get along.
bad,"Working at Ulta is a fun environment and there are some fun coworkers. However, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement and growth within the company. Hard work does not get recognized very often. Good employees don't get the rewards they deserve. Management is always changing and causes people to leave. Customers are extremely brutal because it's mostly women. A lot of shifts are 7 hours instead of 7.5 hours so that they don't have to give you a 30 minute break."
bad,"There isn't much room for advancement within ulta. You could be working there long time and they always will promote someone who is younger and been there longer before they ever promote you. "
bad,The Salon is run more like a retail job than a typical salon position. Work hours keep changing and you’ll get hours cut if the store/salon isn’t busy that week to keep the budget in line. Makes it difficult if you need a consistent base income coming in. Promised lots of support to learn and excel in to other areas or learn new services which has not been seen/heard/mentioned since starting. Really wished I had known this before accepting
bad,I left after seven years of no promotion and I started only getting 12 hours a week 3 hour day shifts. I learned a lot in the beauty field with skin and hair. I enjoyed the customers and my coworkers. The work was easy it was the store  operation that was the problem and why I left
bad,"Hours are low if you don't sell credit cards and beg people to sign up for rewards. Management plays favorites often, a lot of drama in an environment of all women. Severely underpaid. $8 didn't support me at all, especially learning grocery store workers make more. It's cool that you get gratis(free products) but i can't pay my rent with makeup. Overall ultra beauty needs to value their employees better (provide better training, benefits and pay)."
bad,"Core values and company are a wonderful concept."
bad,"During my two years of employment with the company, I have never seen so many Managers come and go. Favoritism was very common and policies and procedures weren’t always followed. No two Managers was ever on the same page. Long time employees weren’t  promoted, new people were brought in instead. The pay is low for what you’ll actually be doing. Everyone eventually gets cross trained, because of the high turnover. So you can get asked to go match make up, jump on the register and then run to the back of the store to look for an item within 30 minutes."
bad,"Ulta treats its employees as that -- employees. If you are looking for advancement or promotions this is not the job for you. Managers think of themselves first and their pay raises and don't care about overworking their employees to death if it means they make their numbers. Of course, this is fair considering the big guys at Ulta drastically cut hours if numbers are not made. Therefore making it nearly impossible to catch up. Many ridiculous shifts, like having to close and then be back in less than 6 hours. This may have been avoided if Ulta wasn't cutting so many hours. They do pay higher than average, which was the main reason I stayed. They constantly promised me raises and promotions but to no avail. They constantly preach their message about us being a family but it was not put into practice."
bad,There was no training given to me when I first started working there so I was not confident in the work I was doing. My hours were cut after they saw I had a hard time growing my business.
bad,"Long hours with 30 min lunch breaks. 15 min breaks are not guaranteed as a manager you actually hardly ever get them. Floor coverage is super thin, and if someone shoplifts during your watch/shift you are seen as if you werent doing your job and can even get written up.  Store managers are in a click.  Mine sat in the back all day. This place is a joke. Save yourself the trouble!"
bad,I'm really just passing time until I get full time employment. Hours are flexible but upper management don't listen to employees. Anytime the Store Manager is there people are miserable.
bad,"They Don't hire enough employees to fully staff their stores they just keep opening new stores and letting their current stores with no help. they give no opportunity for training for Beauty Advisors, they only train Prestige Beauty Advisors. The people you work with are great but higher management are either oblivious or don't care about concerns. Pay is basically minimum with yearly ""raises"" (like .24 cents). the discount is nice though!"
bad,"The hardest part of the job is bad management. Most stores have several managers and at my store our managers were always arguing. Our general manger, and some of the others, have a tendency to yell at us in front of customers, this not only reflected badly on the manager but it caused us to lose business on multiple occasions. Working with mostly females in tough too. There tends to be a lot of pointless drama that is not needed."
bad,"the company had a lot of turn around for management and associates. The management doesn't really pay much attention to doctors notes, or if you have set schedules for other jobs or school. definitely something to keep in mind if you want to work there."
bad,"Corporate directives are given with little to no times to complete - trucks and ad sets takes way more time than given. There is not enough payroll to staff the floor appropriately. If you want to be stressed out, over worked and under paid - here is the place."
bad,Management may benefit from promoting team as opposed to individual culture for the sake of training and retaining talent. Meeting so teams can be on the same page would be helpful and accountability to prevent task or responsibility roll-over.
bad,Good company overall but culture has a lot of work to get it up to par.  Need a lot of help with leadership to associate Interaction.   Work life balance does not exist.
bad,Providing guest with assistance with choosing make up or beauty products.The job is fast paced and requires a lot of multitasking.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts they offer. The negative part about the job is the little amount of hours they give you. You can go from working working 25 hours one week to only working 12 the next week. Ulta is a great job for a college student that needs some extra money on the side but its not a good job for some one that is really trying to start a career and advance in this career.
bad,"They will train you in everything, you will have to do all the roles especially when it's short staffed, but will pay you the minimum wage. Raises or promotions are not common based on how hard you work, the management definitely do play favorites"
bad,"When I first started, I was excited to be around products I found fascinating. That excitement quickly dwindled when I came face to face with the poor treatment of veteran staff and non existent ladder of advancement opportunities."
bad,"I worked at Ulta as a hairstylist. It by far had to be the worst job I’ve ever had! The GM in this store is a nightmare, and definitely shows who her favorites are! As a stylist be prepared to be hired to work every position in that store, but only be payed for your job as a stylist!"
bad,"On a day to day basis you go in to your shift, clock in and go to the cash register. If it was busy you would stay there until there was no longer a line. When there was not a line you would do go backs and clean around the area"
bad,"This review is strictly on my location. Our new managers are horrible! Are too young, Most are too faced snakes, constant power trips, constantly talk down to the employees and even the new manger, if you talk back to them in the manner they talk to you they become offended. the new managers are manipulated by another store manager from a nearby store. When an employee reports theft, the managers don't care or even bother to call police. like to be in the office a lot. No employees were given the chance to advance into any positon. all open positons were given to employees from the neighboring store."
bad,"I intially enjoyed working at Ulta, besides the low pay I was given alot of hours and enjoyed the fast pace working environment. About 3 months into working at Ulta a new general manager took over and she was the worse manager. She treated me differently from the other works and made sneed remarks as I was the only black worker in our store, extremely bias"
bad,"The management is absolutely terrible, definitely the worst management I've ever had the displeasure of working with.  The workplace culture was awful as well, everyone gossiped about one another and nothing was ever kept private."
bad,"For a company that tries to push themselves as new age and a positive place, they don't offer their employees anything but low hours, low pay and no benefits."
bad,you know its an issue when corporate has to come to your store because of managers being unprofessional and rude to their employees. - a lot of false promises.
bad,"i really enjoyed my time working at Ulta and was sad when it was time to leave. As much as I loved the work environment, the goals and expectations were unfair and the lack of proper management hindered the salon of the ulta I was working in and my position."
bad,Work environment was okay. The discounts was an decent amount but not really. Seemed like other employees were getting payed more than me but no retail experience.
bad,"fun working with colleagues"
bad,management starts more mess in the store than the employees. there is a lot of favoritism and personal vendettas. the tension in the store rubs off on the customers getting services.
bad,"It's a very slow location with no incentive and it's very hard to advance within the company. A typical day involves me servicing clients and helping clients with product selection and then imputing that information into the computer. Using the phone to contact clients to confirm appointments, and using the computer to input their information. Workplace culture is very positive but it doesn't transcend to all areas of the store. Hardest part of the job is there isn't much to challenge me. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people. I have worked on and off with Ulta since 2013 and it has not provided me with a financially stable life. It is very hard to make a living working for this company."
bad,"Was super stressful and management was always on your case about something. Not fun to always seem like you are getting in trouble. Always understaffed which makes customers upset but we were always trying to cut hours? Overall, just a bad work environment. Could only work there for 2 months before quitting."
bad,"Horrible experience. Low ""payroll"" so worked the entire store by myself. They are all very judgmental and talk down on you based on how you are dressed or how you do your makeup. They want you to be a walking barbie in heels and do 50 boxes of shipment, do 5 floor moves, run the cash wrap, make up-sells, book appointments, sign up guest for credit card, and be a janitor and a loss prevention officer all at the same time. and God forbid you say no to any one of the 25 million tasks they tell you to do you are done for."
bad,I've only worked there for about a few months and it's not what I thought it was like. You kind of have to learn everything your own. Management sucks
bad,the tips that is received for service is deducted from our checks weekly. that is unfair because they aren't doing any  of the work. It is ok could be better
bad,"It was alright working here, I don't really recommend anyone to work there. The hours were very little, and they hire way too many people.                     I did not enjoy working there"
bad,"I took a Christmas job at Ulta, which I imagine will end sooner than the projected February 11 since I barely work there now.  I thought I would get at least 8 hours a week with increased hours as the holidays approached. Wrong! I did early morning stocking shelves and cashiering. Didn't mind either. I like working with customers. I liked most of my co-workers who were always nice about helping me. I liked the brands. Instead of more hours during the holidays, I got weeks with NO hours. They cancelled three of my shifts the night before the shift and changed another shift. A couple of times, they simply didn't schedule me. I worked really early shifts and mornings. I am an older woman and at least 40% of our customers are, too. I have worked at Macy's and Nieman Marcus. The training here was practically non-existent. Apparently, training is only a word at Ulta. Management didn't seem to know that we sell to people, not wallets. Nor did they understand that you treat employees with respect. Whether it was because of my age, or because of my race, the tone of managment was sometimes rude. I have worked with hundreds of volunteers and with diverse students. I have managed people myself. In addition, there is NO manual.  I asked. What company doesn't have a manual? No communication system, so no transmission of schedules or way to get a sub or disseminate information, like events. NO email communication , though my volun teer and other jobs use email to send schedules. It's 2016! Their expectations of employees far exceeds their treatment of them. No training on the brands, either."
bad,"Loved the people and enjoyed coming into work a lot of the days. Got a final warning after only calling off 3 times after working there for a year. Management always let you down when you wanted to move up in company, Pay was to little for doing a managers job Schedule was never what I had for my availability. Extra percentage off when a beauty company had it was always super great, people who worked there were amazing. When asked for more hours got less hours, never enough hours, and when you get someone to cover you still counts against you for calling off."
bad,"The pay was a slap in the face. Even the commission was a joke. Everyone in the store makes more hourly than the stylists. Management was difficult to deal with, very passive aggressive, and made it impossible for anyone to move up. Mandatory training included a one hour each way drive, and they made it impossible to get mileage compensation stating that ""no one knew who to talk to or how to do it."""
bad,"I loved the ability to work here, but the company was ran by unorganized management.   There were a lot of the co-workers who made you feel less than valuable."
bad,"A fun environment but horrible management.  If you don't mind not being scheduled for weeks then apply here.  People don't stay long, trust me."
bad,"Lack of communication and poor training. Some of the management team treats employees horribly, and this has been witnessed by guests shopping."
bad,"There is a lot of room for growth within this company, but very little training other than learning as you go and video modules that don’t really teach you much. This company asks a lot out of each person without giving the hours or man power to get it done in a proper manner. They do not consider you more important than the products on the shelves. Management gets written up if they do not prevent a theft from happening (ex: theft occurring while manager on duty is customer servicing someone else is somehow still that managers fault). "
bad,"This was a nice opportunity to begin my esthetics career. However, the pay sucks, the management is horrible, and they don't treat you the way you should be."
bad,"I got this job through a recruiter & was placed as a digital design consultant, with the promise of it turning into a full-time, salaried position within 6 months. I have been here 10 months & am still a hourly-consultant. I get no benefits, no discount, no respect, nothing. The company gets varies desk drops of sample product & the consultants are skipped while everyone else gets to enjoy the products in front of us. We are treated very poorly and I feel disrespected most of the time from upper management. We are expected to come into the office daily from 9-5 & expected to work like everyone else who is salaried, yet do not get ANY of the benefits of a salaried worker. We are expected to work like everyone else, yet are not being treated like everyone else. Still waiting to be hired on full-time..."
bad,"It is a fun place to work, but that comes with many disadvantages."
bad,the managers promised more hours but as soon as xmas hit I was being left off the schedule completely
bad,Over all the job itself was fulfilling but the compensation benefits and Management was terrible. Opportunity for advancement was poor they had their picks even though you had the experience and outstanding job performance was good they picked who they wanted to move up
bad,"I came to Ulta with such an enthusiastic and optimistic heart come to find out that this location would just break my heart! Because the salon is located inside the store, stylists are required to do retail work as well (I don't remember that in my cosmo training!) stocking and trying to sell products. I was told there was heavy foot traffic but there was no such thing. A typical day for me was clean the salon, mop the floors, and pretend I was busy. I never went to a training to further my knowledge in hair or make-up. A lot of the times I was the only one at the salon and there would be so many times I would have to turn customers away because I simply could not do all that work on my own and the sad thing was that there goes a potential long time client! My schedule was confusing, humiliating, and stupid. I would be scheduled to work once a week sometimes for less than 4 hours and I live about 30 minutes away from this Ulta location.The manager claimed at the beginning she was understanding that because I had a baby scheduling wouldn't be an issue. I was told I would get to work 15-20 hours, it was the complete opposite of that. The stylists there need to be trained more if they want to keep their clients or be considered a high end salon. When I decided enough was enough, a few people felt the same way I did and we all left this terrible location. Non stylists there did not consider that we were STYLISTS and not sales associates. End of story."
bad,"I managed a salon at one of these stores in an affluent Dallas suburb for a few months but quickly left to go work as an independent stylist.  Ulta runs their salons using a retail product-oriented mentality.  The company does not understand that a salon is a service based business.  I had to report to a retail store manager and district manager that were only concerned with numbers and were quick to tell me how to do my job even though neither of them have any cosmetology credentials whatsoever.  "
bad,"I enjoy that it is fast paced, always something to do, so I always stay busy."
bad,"Very fast paced and very small payroll to work with.  Managers responsibilities overlap. Very high turnover in all levels from upper management to middle management and task associates.  Pay scale from middle management down is average to low. No ""Heart"" in company; they do not close for holidays nor do they care about your family. The only concern is making the next dollar. People are expendable. Heavily into micro-managing and daily reports. No excused absences. If you are sick and have Dr.'s excuse it is subject to General Manager approval. Three absences initiates a verbal warning, next absence has a written warning and the next is termination. Some employees with children quit to avoid termination."
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal working. I started off as task team, which consists of unloading the truck with all the products and placing them on the shelves. I moved from task team to cashier. You have to deal with hormonal women. It's hard to please everyone and you have to learn to just grin and bare it. Hardest part of the job would be learning the promotions that change frequently and dealing with people and their coupons. Women are naturally catty, I didn't feel like I was working for a team. It felt like people were there to benefit themselves. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with make-up and the discounts."
bad,"This is a very hard company to work for, the employees do not matter. to the company you are just a number. they will work you like a dog and not pay you any thing. But most of the people are alot of fun to work with "
bad,I liked my experience until my hours were cut to 7 a week. You can def work your way up but you have to remember its for your benefit. Great atmosphere.
bad,I had worked at ulta for a few years and watched this company fall apart since the change in CEOs. This company does not care for thier employees. They need to put more focus on getting better quality people that are in charge like DMs. Just an awful company to work for which is sad because it is a great concept and use to be a great place to work.
bad,"I went over and above,worked very hard and was let go just before Christmas and six weeks prior to my 90 day review!"
bad,If you are a cosmetologist DO NOT work for the Jacksonville NC store. The salon manager is a horrible person to work under. She is not kind or personable and is very manipulative. If you are a hard worker but you don't put up with being walked on then this is not the place for you! The turnover is so great there because of this manager!
bad,"Great first job from getting out of beauty school, great area and way to build clientel. Great for Estheticians who dont have enough money to lease your own booth. Pays hourly or commesion. Great way to learn about new products and improve skin care line."
bad,"This place isn't in business anymore. It was my grandfathers company, and it made me realize working with family is never a good idea."
bad,Not a very good place to work didn't have the right tools. The manager wasn't very accessible.
bad,Not awesome for moms or anyone with a life outside of Ulta. Promotions based off favoritism instead of qualifications so the stores aren't run efficiently.
bad,"It was the worst company I have been with. They don't have respect with the employees. The advancement is hard and the pay low.  Every day after work I had to wait around 30 minutes to check out my purse in front of everybody on the main door to see if I was stealing from the company, even though I had a small transparent purse as required. I felt very embarrassed."
bad,"I felt excluded because of my age In work talk, personal talk and in the ULTA environment as an employee. "
bad,"I will never go back to Ulta as an esthetician, the goals were unrealistic and they cared more about meeting numbers than client retention. "
bad,"The competition was very thick so much so the manger accused me of working at another salon I was not "
bad,Ulta is a great place to start for your first retail experience. There's not much organization compared to other companies i have worked for . I wouldn't work there again
bad,"Management was not good. Very pretty and not truthful to long time employees. No real advancement opportunities for good, reliable employees. Wasted many years being a loyal employee"
bad,"They hire managers that are not educated and don't like to help staff. Overall, the turn over of employees are the worst part because the store was always short handed."
bad,When i worked there management picked favorites and were rude to staff but lots of free goodies.Hopefully this has improved over time. The turnover rate was crazy.
bad,"I absolutely loved interacting with our customers and helping them to find things that will enhance their natural beauty. Taking the extra time to assist them was always met with such kindness and appreciation."
bad,"As a licensed Cosmetologist, I expect to make more than what I did. They pay is trash. Slow store. Drama, had me working full time hours but no benefits."
bad,"i was seasonal  but i wanted to work all the time they only had me work early on the morning and late night shifts for cleaning and inventory but i had the intention to stay longer when i first applied , after i worked a couple time i left because i know my worth ."
bad,"The company is debt-free for a reason... they put EVERYTHING on their management staff. When things don't go the way corporate thinks it should, it points the blame at the store management staff, not their poor planning. They way they operate the salon is absolutely ridiculous. They make false promises about continued education and training. What they really offer are seasonal, ""look and learn"" classes that DO NOT improve skill level of stylists. The way corporate had me (salon manager) schedules stylists is completely unfair. Totally sets young, unseasoned stylists up for failure. I felt absolutely horrible sending stylists home when they didn't make their sales numbers. They didn't make their sales numbers because corporate made me cut their hours. It was a vicious, unfair cycle."
bad,The company has amazing incentives and a great culture. Your manager can make it impossible for that to be the reality. It all depends on what location you find yourself and who your manager is.
bad,"I've worked here for over a year and in the beginning it was ok, I first noticed how management could be sneaky when they tried to talk me into going fulltime when we already had a current fulltime eyebrow expert (apparently they didnt like her and in the end she was demoted to a B.A....let that sink in a full time professional Esthetician was demoted from Arch Expert to a Beauty Advisor!!!! ) she didnt deserve to be treated that way. In the end that GM was fired for reasons I'm not aware of. "
bad,"I was hired to set up the store, under the impression that I was a part time employee - that was what I was told when I was hired at least. This was before the store had even opened, consisting of stocking and placing product and signage. I was told that once the store opened, I would be working a few shifts to see how well I did with customers. I went in once a week to check the schedule until one day my manager informed me that I no longer worked there. Completely unexpected and surprising - I would not recommend dealing with that."
bad,"My first day one of the very first things they said was that there will be no gossiping. That lasted for about 15 minutes. There was CONSTANT drama between managers and staff. We were treated poorly by managers if we weren't constantly harassing customers for bags. You get treated poorly by customers as well. I tried my best to make the store as approachable and less overwhelming for our guests but nothing was ever good enough. The days that are slow it's our fault for people not wanting to be apart of our rewards program and our fault for people not wanting to get our ultimate rewards credit card. Our fault for customers not buying more products because they didn't want a bag. Seriously, the bag thing frustrated me so much. Then customers complain that we're harassing them! No kidding! Trust me, I don't like it any more than you. Numbers, numbers, numbers. Even on register managers will blame you for not selling enough product. Good times. "
bad,"This job requires knowledge and passion for all things beauty. The work environment is fun and exciting. However, some of the sales goals and credit goals are not realistic for the company. There isn't an opportunity for a full-time position unless moving into a managerial position."
bad,"I was the licensed skin therapist I performed facial that last between 10 minutes to 90 minutes, I performed body and facial waxing, I also did makeup from casual to formal. I learned to become familiar with the Dermalogica products, I was able to answer the phone and book appointments as well. I was able to further my customer service skills at Ulta Beauty"
bad,"I loved it at first, you get to interact with a bunch of different people and have genuine conversation. I started as a general associate and it got worse every day. My location specifically was awful. As soon as I got comfortable with my position, corporate chose our store as 1 out of 40 something across the nation to do a pilot training if you could call it that... 75% of the way we ran the store was supposed to change but nobody had any idea what they were doing and it was a mess. The management was very poor. I came into the job ready to work my butt off in attempt to stay with the company and move up, and or get connections to start planning my career. What it really is, is a poorly paid retail job. They demand way more from you than your pay shows for. I was making $9 an hour and was only given 15 hours a week on average. Also, a few months in I got promoted to a Prestige Beauty Advisor but they never put it in the computer so I never got a raise. After asking and asking for months, the GM told me should could maybe get me at 0.50 cent raise at most. I was treated poorly and never acknowledged for anything I did."
bad,"Management keeps you in the dark, they don’t inform you to help better your career just wants you to make them look good."
bad,"Hours were inconsistent, hours were frequently cut with no communication, unrealistic sales goals, unprofessional work environment. Customers were the best part of the job"
bad,"The people are awesome but overworked.  There are not enough employes to get all the work done.  There is little time to tell a joke or ask about family.  It is all work, work, work."
bad,Ulta gave me the experience I needed to learn the ins and outs of sales.  The management could use more training.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
bad,"Managers have favorites, and promote them , if you are looking for a full time, unless you have a specialty area or are a manager you wont get many hours, atleast not enough to depend on if that is what you are looking for."
bad,As a sales rep ULTA give me promises they couldn't fulfill. Hours weren't steady and i only saw up to 8-15 a week. Management didn't seem to care about my work ethic
bad,Subject to daily search of personal effects and person.  Treated like criminal everyday.  Not flexible schedule for part time.  Facility was dirty and uncomfortable.
bad,"The District managers pick sides and HR is a joke. When you report bullying or racism they sweep it under the rug. The culture is horrible, percs are Gratis and discount."
bad,"Not much work life balance and the upper management does not care about your advancement whatsoever. The pay is very low for the amount of work they expect from you, and do not expect yearly raises to be above a couple cents."
bad,"It's a basic job but because you're working with women all the time there is so much drama. When you do have to take a day off or call out they handle that very well. Good first-time job, not a career."
bad,"This can be an amazing company to work for, at times, with the perfect conditions and superiors. Many make it hard to advance, raises will range from $0.00 to .50 cents. "
bad,"Fast-paced, low pay, no benefits for part time, poor management at my store and snobby salon professionals who unfortunately don't appreciate your work ethic"
bad,"I worked for Ulta Beauty from 2014-2018 at multiple locations and my experience at each one was exactly the same. I can genuinely say Ulta Beauty is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Now I'm sure there are employees that view Ulta as one of the best companies there is, but from my experiences, I feel the exact opposite. "
bad,"Poor Management did not provided associated or new managers with proper training. Very unprofessional environment. "
bad,"Upper management is a club full of micro managers, double guessing, digging for dirt and always pushing numbers over the people doing the work until it is time for the culture survey.  At that time, gifts start to roll out, meetings take place and it's all warm and fuzzy.  The pay and benefits are the best part of working in the warehouse."
bad,"If you weren't busy you would have to try to get clients off the floor and get them to get a facial. Most people didn't know about the ""salon"" and if they did they only knew about the hair. I think they could've done a better job of getting the word out there that we did facials as well. "
bad,"High priced business for a low income area. business was slow."
bad,I was an Arch expert so I worked for benefit.  This meant that I had to sell benefit products.  The goals were unrealistic and difficult to meet in the small town i live in.  The management was rude and would rather hire family members than promote employees that were there from the beginning.
bad,Honestly imagine working at a place where mean girls thrive. Management and other co - workers would constantly talk behind each others backs. It left me to wonder what was said about me when I wasn't present. The discount was nice but overall the jobs not worth the stress. I like to work my way up but I saw that wasn't going to be achievable here. The roles were taken and not to be bugged.
bad,The store team was amazing and friendly. But the management was trash they wouldn’t work around other job schedule. Only one person on the floor and management would be in the back talking.
bad,I love make up and I love everything about the beauty industry BUT I do not agree with current management or how it treats/pays its employees. Especially the ones who love what they do and are a real asset to the company. I would not work for another Ulta if it is anything like the one I have experienced. With that being said there are a few perks to the job. Free make up every once in a while and some what flexible hours .
bad,Most of the managers at my location are undertrained. The store manager was the most undertrained and still is very undertrained. There was a lot of favorites played in the workplace. Hours weren’t given out fairly.
bad,"There were some things I really really loved about working at Ulta; I loved learning more about makeup techniques, new products coming out, discounts on makeup and services, helping customers find the one product they're going to love... but it wasn't enough to make me stay. I was told I would advance quickly, and I never did. My pay stayed at $8.50 the whole time, I can't support myself on that and they knew it. They refused to give me more hours but hired new Beauty Advisors all the time. Management made work your life, I was always scheduled for times I couldn't work and they prioritized me working over me being happy and healthy. Once I was behind the register, I started getting dizzy and my vision started spotting, when I told my manager at the SLC location that I was going to sit down for a few minutes I was sworn at and told ""just go get a drink of water if you need it so bad and get back here!"" I have no respect for work places that value labor over the wellbeing of their employees. If you like a corporate work culture this may be the place for you, but it certainly wasn't for me."
bad,"A typical day at Ulta Beauty was extremely busy, I didn't learn as much as I wanted I more perfected my customer service skills. There was many managers and not all of them were available or around when you needed them. It is a very busy workplace and you are mostly on your own. The hardest part of the job was teaching myself the store and where everything is, and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the best products for them."
bad,The managers acted as if they were in high school. They cut hours to people they didnt like personally. One of the managers was talking behind a co-workers back. Hours were  horrendous.
bad,"Being at Ulta I have learned ALOT and became very knowledge about many products from makeup, skin, styling stools to professional hair products. "
bad,"Working at Ulta was enjoyable. There is room for advancement if you are willing to work for it. Great benefits, decent hourly rates. I wish there was a bit more development opportunity."
bad,"I worked at the Location with the highest number of sales for the region. Orlando. The operations manager was ok, she seemed nice at first and she wants things a certain way but would talk bad about the other employees and managers. I wore my natural hair and was told that the general managers couldnt see me looking like that, mind you I was the only one with big curly hair, so they put me in the back while they came. I worked as one of the fastest and most detailed which they told me but then randomly one of the managers just stopped sending a schedule to me I asked if there was something wrong and they said no i should receive it and they never did. Bad professionalism on their part, did not feel like a team, bad pay, and too much expectations."
bad,The only benefit was working with makeup and the customers. The management was chaotic and their turnover rate was way too high for managers within the first six months of opening the store.  I'm glad I left as early as I did.
bad,"Store management team was fantastic, district manager and higher management were rude, and showed favoritism to other employees. You are expected to do a million things at once, without much training on how to do it. Too many daily tasks without proper payroll hours so not enough staff to get the job done."
bad,"Management is terrible, they have no communication with employees. Very selfish company, they don't take their employees in consideration. Don't work here, you'll hate it after 2 weeks."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend people working at this place lack of management, never know what you are doing, you go in has a temp like I did 3 different time in different departments and was never hired on after my days was up. kept me on has a temp and I was really unhappy about it. I worked all those hours and never once got a thank you or I have a position for you if you would like to have it along with benefits and days off. NOTHING!"
bad,"I adore cosmetics and beauty in general, but this place really made me hate it. The customers/clientele at my location seemed to be the worst. Extremely high turn-over due to unorganized management and LACK of competitive pay. Exceptional talent always ended up elsewhere. Avoid this place."
bad,"I don't have many positive things to say about Ulta, I have worked there twice now. Once full time on retail side and in salon and then back again for part time after having my son. Both times were awful, managers don't know how to manage- try to be your friend, then your manager. Very unprofessional. Catty. No work life balance, no one is appreciated for the extra miles gone but instead expected to do more outside job description. It goes beyond being a team player."
bad,We had an awesome team! Awesome management team! Then we got a horrible district manager. She made everyone cry and was so disrespectful!  It caused all of us to leave because HR didn't do anything! No raises! No hours!  Takes forever to be promoted!
bad,great job for stylest starting out and wanting to learn they offer continuing education classes and competitions where the winner receives free products
bad,"It was a nice place to work at. The managers were ok, just noticed that if you didn't suck up to them you were treated a bit different than others... One of the managers would rarely say hi to me unless it was to give me a task, and she always had a disturbed face on as if she hated being there. I liked my co-workers they were all very nice. For the most part, my favorite thing was helping the customers out."
bad,"Working at Ulta was fairly easy however the co-workers were very rude. Women older than me sat and gossiped all morning behind peoples back about things that shouldnt have mattered. They were stuck up and looked down on pretty much everyone who didnt fit the ""look""."
bad,Unrealistic tasks and goals with little to no training.  Did not invest in their employees via training and development. So much change with out direction.
bad,I worked so hard for this company and never got recognized for it. No communication with management and employees. Very strict on loyalty sign ups if not enough you don't get hours. Got paid too little
bad,"Im a hard worker, I learned everything as much as I could as long as I was there. Very fast pace (which is okay), but no time to learn with them since no one had good communication skills. The Coe Workers were fine, super nice and friendly. Managers very scattered. Didn't do schedule well at all. Put 10 girls on at the same time from 7 to 10. Cut a lot of my hours, with no call before. Id show up for one hour then they will cut me. Not patent at all."
bad,Managers are very petty. They talk about each other to the beauty advisors and talk about the beauty advisors to other beauty advisors. The managers are horrible and do not communicate effectively.
bad,"I was excited to work here until i worked here."
bad,I felt that Ulta was more concerned with the way the store looked than on customer service. I'm huge on making sure each customer leaves happy and with the feeling that we went above and beyond their expectations. We were discouraged from taking time with customers and tasks were the main focus.
bad,"Ulta has poor  opperational processes in place. It is very confusing and there is no training program in place, there is also no corporate level help(they pass you around departments until you finally give up). The pay rates are also very backward for example as an assistant manager I only make a dollar more than the associates who help customers. While my work load is a lot more."
bad,Working with makeup is a way for one to express themselves and helping others find what suits their skin needs. Working at Ultra is fun. You get to meet a diversity of co-workers and customers. The management wasn't so great. and the point system is plain ridiculous. Fun temporary job.
bad,"The work environment was okay, the management was just terrible. they didn't write schedules according to when you said you couldn't work and the would proceed to misunderstand you as a worker."
bad,I didn't work at Ulta long. I was just a temporary hire for a new store set up. I helped set up store. Locate and organize inventory and maintained neat and orderly product displays.
bad,I was not here long but the short time I was here I did not like the management at the time. They did not know how to talk to their employees and they were very impersonal. They did not really train me and would fuss if you did something wrong even though I was never trained on what I could and could not do. They also did not give many hours which is expected for retail but 9-10 hours a week over the course of 3 days is not worth the trouble or stress this job gave me.
bad,"The lead cashier position is responsible for maintaining guest service as per company standard, is responsible for the efficient expedition of all guest transactions as well as ensuring guest satisfaction at the service desk and proper control of all cash and media materials in a superstore."
bad,My shifts are typically 4 hours long. You get shifts based on how many people you can sign up for the Ulta rewards program. No employees are working full time at my location because we are so cheap. A lot of our policies upset customers. I chose this job because I wanted an environment where I could express myself.
bad,"my day consist of 5 am shifts of stock and stock the floor and back stocking product. sometimes youll cashier but not often but when you do, signing people up for rewards cards is the goal."
bad,"every location is different however, where i worked it was an unfair workplace, i worked there for a year and a half and i outlasted 12 managers, and dozens of employees."
bad,"The job itself is fun, I really enjoyed majority of my coworkers but management seems to be an issue across the board. They are an extremely selfish company, I had a manager put an item back on the shelf once because she didnt want to NOT make budget. Not worth the stress in my opinion but this is just my specific location. Pay is decent, hours aren't great."
bad,"I was beyond excited when I started. Loved the environment and was getting decent hours. I'm a very hard worker who needed this job. I even expressed to them how grateful I was for the opportunity and how much I really needed all the hours I could get. Without any notice, my hours were cut then my name wasn't even on the schedule anymore. All the while, there's a ""Now Hiring"" sign up and new employees. When I asked the manager why, I was told they had to cut back x amount hours. I definitely feel as though there is favoritism and you would think they would take care of the employees they already have established instead of constantly hiring. If there had been better communication as to why all of this happened, it would be more understandable and I would have been able to find a new job to provide for my family."
bad,"Terrible management and support."
bad,"Been with the company 5 years and have had 6 different general managers, 3 different district managers and many others through store management. The company is unclear on what they want to be and they do not treat employees well."
bad,"a typical day at work was cleaning salon, prepping stations, making sure all the stylist had what they needed. making appointment calls, and making sure the stylist were getting the amount of guest to jump levels and build credit. restocking. ordering which wasn't part of the job title. management at the time used me to not only be in salon but on the retail side to help ring guest and cover breaks which didn't help if i was backed up in salon. turn around was horrible for regular sales employees to management team. don't get me wrong, it was fun working there, but only when it was the right manager. they over work their staff. but great benefits and discounts though."
bad,Its an amazing starting place for anyone who loves anything beauty related or as a side job. A lot of people quite because management is horrible. All they do is sit in the back office and gossip. Managers will ask you to run to stores to get food for them while you are on the clock. Also they will be 30 minutes to an hour late but will give you a hard time if you ask for certain days off. Like I said if you are in high school or need a side job its good. Don't expect to make much or move up in the company no matter how hard you work. If you are a gossiper or love drama you will do great and move up just fine.
bad,"I was working for this company tru the temp company "
bad,"Its wonderful on the outside looking in and overall great for building customer service, sales skills, and cash handling. But management is  the only downfall of this company. Breaks are not properly issued and the way they talk to their employees is a big problem. Thats why so many people are in and out."
bad,During my time with Ulta I managed a salon inside of of their locations.  The salon was not treated like an important part of the business and the staff that worked in the salon was treated much the same.  The company wanted to run the salon like it was part of the retail side of their business.  They did not focus much time on developing their leaders and they were quick to terminate a leader over training them to do the job better.  The people I worked with where great and many had the same complaints that I have listed here.  I know many leaders that work and have worked for Ulta that have left or want to leave because of the lack of follow through with leadership training.  The hardest part of the job was trying to run the salon with retail operation rules and the most enjoyable part of the job was the ability for me to be able to work on both sides of the business in the salon and on the retail side.
bad,"zero benefits, all managers give you different answers even if they have been employed there for 14 years. no one is on the same page ever, and never knows how to help you."
bad,"Stop and listen to what everyone says, it's worse than high school."
bad,You can't move up within the company and it is a very unorganized company to work for.  The environment is fun and you rarely take work home with you.
bad,"Corporate most of the time has no idea what they're doing. The company could be great to work for, if you decide to not depend on anyone else. Teamwork is encouraged but falls apart easily in a company of mostly women who only look out for themselves. Stores have sales competitions but more often than not employees at a level anywhere under a General Manager never see the prizes. Corporate makes occasional visits to stores but doesn't do anything besides ""grade"" us and leave. No changes are ever made and no opinions are ever asked on how to improve."
bad,A great temporary job if you want a part time position in a fun environment. Sometimes stressful but what job isn't. Good for those who just need something temporary or just want a few extra bucks in their wallet.
bad,its never enough coverage and things always gets promise to you but never happens. there were a few friendly co workers i would say this job didn't feel like a family environment
bad,"I've been at Ulta for quite some time now and although I love most of the girls I work with, I have been cheated out of my pay, been told I was in line to be promoted since February and it is July and there is always a reason why they can't promote me at the moment, girls who have been there for only 2 months, late to work consistently, called out numerous times, missed shifts, and don't do anything while working have been promoted over me even though I have only called out twice, come in countless times on my days off, stayed late, came in early, worked my butt off for them, and always do what they ask of me. I learned I was being underpaid compared to other associates in my same position by $1.75 an hour which makes a big difference when you're trying to pay your way through college with a $7.25/hr budget. Don't ever count on management helping you advance because there's only a 2% chance you ever will. Don't ever work for Ulta. You will be treated like dirt and it's not worth your time and effort."
bad,"Clock in, grab a walkie, and start cleaning. You're constantly picking up after others, so if straightening up and organizing isn't your thing this isn't the job for you."
bad,"•	Managed store operations, balanced a $5K budget, conducted monthly meetings, ran sales reports, demonstrated and sold fashion and hairstyle products, coordinated a salon and retail team of 30. "
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was the clients. They was open and ready to receive tips about makeup. they enjoyed the help.
bad,Ulta provided good benefits and pay. The company itself is not a bad company it is the people that they hire to run their business that I found disappointing.
bad,"I worked at Ulta Beauty in Wichita Falls, Tx for a year and a half. During that time I showed to be one of our top result-producing cashier and although I did receive a ""promotion"", no pay raise was involved and no change in work duties were applied. I did get one raise at my one year mark...a $.20 raise.Also, the hours I was promised (20 hours a week AT LEAST) didn't seem to exist. I worked only between 10 and 15 hours a week. The managers there were very into their given power. They loved to boss employees of lower ""rank"" around and give them unnecessary duties that were not listen in their job descriptions. Other co-workers were very snooty and made it clear they were better than I. I will never work at another Ulta or any company under the same ownership."
bad,"They don't put much trust in people unless they have previous higher experience. No room to grow in this corporation unless you start as a manager. Few hours, never more than around 14 a week. Hardest part of the job is not having all customers satisfied. The most enjoyable is being able to stock all items of the store and seeing people leave with a smile."
bad,"Merchandising, visual standards, payroll management, train staff, open and closing procedures"
bad,"lots of opportunity to grow and become something more"
bad,"Assisting customers with purchasing products that was suitable for their needs. Perform spa services i.e. waxing, facials, brows and lashes. I learn how to up-sell on products.  The coworkers were young the manager wasn't friendly.  However I always provided great customer service. The hardest part of the job was learning the locations of different products and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a happy customer after I've help them."
bad,I worked for Ulta for 4 years and was upset with the way the management treated the employees.
bad,This company cares nothing about its employees work there at your own risk
bad,"This is a great place to shop, but the management is far off from being professional. The attention to detail is not where it should be and customer service is good at times, but lacks professionism."
bad,"Didn't really matter which position you were hired for, if you weren't a manager you still did cash register, both sides of the floor, truck in the morning. Management wasn't the best, promised raises never happened. The job had potential but depending on the management and location you're at, you might love or hate it."
bad,"Retail job that involved not knowing about products because there was no training about them. Mostly worked cash register and putting back items where they belonged. Also stocked shelves early in the morning. Had a variety of managers, some of whom were competent and kind. I did not like working here."
bad,"An ok starter job, that's about it. Management just depends on the store. Would not work there ever again. You're pushed to get every single customer to sign up for the rewards card and punished if you don't."
bad,"Love what Ulta stands for. Thought I found my forever home with Ulta, my dream job. So I left a company I was with for many years, after 1 week I knew I made a huge mistake. The management for that location should never have been in that position. I have never dealt with such unprofessional management. No guidance, no training, management uses foul language and discusses employees around others, fits of yelling, crying and throwing things. Even after HR was called and emailed by multiple employees for over a year, nothing changed."
bad,"Not sure about any other locations in the area but management at Olathe store is pretty terrible. GM is pretty rude and unprofessional. Don’t believe the smiles, they’re FAKE. Some people I worked with were amazing women and I loved being around them, but the head manager will make you want to leave. Don’t waste your time. You’ll make friends elsewhere."
bad,"Ulta in the Austin area is more inclined to externally promote rather than promote from within. Despite Ulta's company policy of ""Promoting from within"", even as a long time employee who receives Outstanding level of performance on reviews, you'll get passed up by other candidates from other companies. "
bad,My days have been reduced from 2 days to 1. The GM favors the other esthetician. When I complain about things that need to be done and thrown out of the pod...I’m told that I have it in for the other Skin Therapist. If I have to do their job and mine but only one of get thoroughly checked then I have problem. You’re forced to convert customers to your chair on a slow day and no one wants to get a facial. Any clientele you could have is being taken by the other skin therapist since she’s been there longer and cliques up with the hair stylist to get more clients. Then Ulta expects you to automatically meet your goal when you work.
bad,My issue with Ulta was Management.  My hiring manager left her job with promises for days off and when the new hiring manager came in she would not support.  I felt that management was very unbalanced and not concerned about there key employees.  Instead of stepping up bringing fourth excitement and encouragement they brought in negativity .
bad,"I worked in the salon. The store forgets that the salon is part of their store. They demand a lot from the salon, but they give zero help and respect to the salon are. The GM at the Plymouth Meeting location was dreadful!!! I actually left because of the inner management!!! Corporate is great!!! The people they put in each store just stink!!!!"
bad,the pay is biweekly and they hire a lot of beauty advisors which means shifts can always be covered but there are not a lot of available hours and you end up with a few shifts a week.
bad,"Management was a total mess at my location. HR is also a complete joke, we all had major concerns about one of our managers and though multiple people called HR to complain, not a single complaint was filed and it was completely dismissed. He is still manager there. If you work here, your voice will not be heard. If you have any issues at all, they'll be completely ignored."
bad,"CASHIER AND STOCK. The job itself was not challenging, but store goals were so heavily pushed, there were threats to termination. Also managers were almost never available."
bad,"I worked as a salon manager. They gave me only two weeks of training, but I was promised six weeks of training.  The stylists that worked under me didn't like me from the moment they were introduced to me. They all called in a lot and took vacations and they would go over my head, instead of speaking with me about an issue or concern. "
bad,"Poor training and management development. Senior level management expects you to be knowledgable of policies without ensuring proper education or review occurs. Little support and assistance for new GM's and other management and fails to offer adequate on boarding training. Quick to turn to disciplinary action, resulting in high employee turnover."
bad,"It really depends what location you work at. My store was a mess but iv heard of other employees in our area loving their jobs. My store i was at was in a bad area where we had tons of theft, and that makes a huge difference on everything. Our sales were always super low because of this and wed get chewed out from management constantly and theirs not much we could really do to improve. Only thing we could really do is just watch every guest closely and then we would see them steal and it was pointless because its company policy that we don't confront them. Management was terrible at my store. They would never ever tell me if i was doing well at something and would always find something that you did wrong and bring that up. All my coworkers hated it there too which made for a terribly negative environment. Other things i didn't like were that it was super hard to get any days off. Any days off we wanted had to be requested a month in advance. Every other job in my life only required time off to be requested two weeks in advance. A lot of our costumers at this store only spoke Spanish too which is great if you can speak it but makes it hard for everyone else. We had maybe three employees that spoke Spanish and never seemed to be around when you needed them to help translate and then management would yell at me for asking for someone to help. Theyr require us to get a certain number of credit card signups each shift and every no you get you need three yes's which is nearly impossible."
bad,I was hired on the spot at Ulta and my probationary period was waived because of my skill set.  I was lucky I know and I loved it.  A few weeks in I had a pain in my chest and I went to the ER.  I missed work but came in the next day either my doctor's note.  I needed some tests done because a mass was found in my lung.  I missed two more days not in a row and they were scheduled with doctors notes included.  Two days later Ulta management fired me because I missed two much work.  I'm 18 years old and diagnosed with a congential lung problem that requires surgery.  I always had doctor's notes for my absences.  I don't think it is right that I was fired for this reason so I would tell everyone to not work at Ulta.  It's not worth it!!!
bad,"I would say it was hard to find clientele that could/would commit to having their skin done. A lot of people would either not have the time and/or the funds to keep it up, I will say my fastest time was around prom season. We had a ton of girls interested in the Makeup and lashes! It was hard to get people sold on the idea of getting skin services. Plus, I feel like a downside was the tools and materials we were provided."
bad,"During this time I don’t feel that I was fairly treated and never given the same fair shot at advancement as others. Ulta has a set of values that I loved, but no one on their leadership team upheld those values."
bad,Honestly this store in particular puts on a very good front. They seem organized and together until you actually start working there. A stepping stone.
bad,The property I worked at was sadly not what I hoped it would be. The culture was not up to par at the location I was at compared to other ulta stores. Overall though Ulta as a brand and the company is amazing. I just personally wasnt able to experience it at its best at the property I was at.
bad,"A lot of my coworkers were great, and very kind. However, there were a select few who would constantly be talking behind other people’s backs, gossiping about customers, and being just rude. Eventually got tired of being put down on the time and being told that it’s next to impossible to work in prestige/move up in the company."
bad,"Payroll for the store was so low, so every worker had to wear too many hats for the pay. I don’t mind lower pay and hard work, but the environment is not good enough to justify the cons. Then when the multitude of tasks weren’t completed, store and field management had to find someone to blame. "
bad,"I only enjoyed working here because of my great management team and co-workers. There is very little room for advancement and no incentive at all for part-time workers (and all positions other than most management positions and some counter positions are part-time). No benefits at all and full-time hours are not offered. Very small raises given yearly. No commission, no bonuses."
bad,"A typical day for me would be to get there before the store even opens to restock shelves, put out new merchandise and graphics, organize and make sure the store is ready for customers. Most of the managers are friendly but there are times where they get stressed and yell or take it out on associates. Some of the managers have a very poor work ethic and have gotten in trouble with upper management for things that they have done but they are still employed by Ulta; which honestly makes no sense because if I did half the things that they do I definitely would not be working there anymore. The workplace culture is very cliquey and some days it feels like being in high school again. There are very few if any opportunities to receive more training or move up in the company. I've been there for over a year and have been asking for training on specific brands and certain operational tasks and have never been given that training or given the opportunity to do so. It's been very discouraging to work there without any possibility of advancement."
bad,"I think the company has a promising model for their culture. Unfortunately, general managers can be hit and miss. I was a manager and felt a huge lack of support."
bad,Pay to low for job experience. I was promoted 3 times and no raise was given. I met all sales goals by dermalogica and ulta. still no raise. I did enjoy doing facials on clients i pulled from floor.
bad,It is good place to work as a young aspiring makeup artist and esthetician to get through school and learn more about the company makeup and skin care products. But over all I am not happy working for Ulta.
bad,The management at the location I worked at seemed good at first but ended up being awful. They hired so many new people that everyone only got around 4-9 hours a week unless you were a manager or worked in the salon. I asked for at least 30 hours a week and they said they could not give me more than 9. They also want you to kinda trick people into getting a credit card that they probably don’t want.
bad,"Things were great working for Ulta, it was a fun environment and I learned a lot about types of makeup. Things were not great when management purposefully started firing people for small inconsiderable things so their friends could start working at the store instead."
bad,Loved that we were able to explore beauty in all different looks and ages. Upper management did not communicate well. I learned about esthetics amongst other things.
bad,"Pay is close to minimum wage. I wanted to work at the Benefit Brow Bar because I heard they offer great training, but I have been there for a few months and have only had about eight hours of training. The environment is very gossipy which makes me uncomfortable. If you exceed your sales goals, your department is awarded with more hours. But they don't want to give anyone more than 30 hours per week, so instead of giving you the hours they will hire another person and cut your hours significantly. During my interview, I was told that clients could make appointments with me for makeup applications which turned out to be untrue. It made me feel very mislead."
bad,management is constantly changing policy to work to their benefit and how they see fit. Don't bother working if you don't want to be micro managed . Management doesn't know what they are doing half the time. Don't expect your ideas to be listened to or even acknowledged.  any and all requests are usually ignored
bad,"they seem to be too stuck in old processes to be able to break free and offer the customer service you'd receive at a Nordstrom - I don't see the company being able to compete with service-centric environments for quite some time. When push comes to shove, the mentality isn't there, and they will always foster a task, not service, focused environment. There were numerous (like double-digit per month) days I'd work 1, 2 or even 4 hours past the end of my shift due to workload or just flow of customer traffic, but yet I would be penalized for being less than five minutes late. Vendors can be difficult to work with, and often were involved in gossipy tattling (there just isn't a more professional way to word it - it was childish, and I saw this at many Ulta locations, not just mine...). The bigger problem became the corporate end refusing to relay details of these ""tattles"" to the store level, so we were often left guessing who complained about what, and how to improve in a conflict we were not given the details of. "
bad,"Pretty much what the title implies, if I wasn't in school full-time right now, I would not be caught dead working here. Hours suck, no internal promotions, everyone is hired in rather than promoted, discounts suck, everything sucks except the culture and the employees. Typical 4 hour shift is nothing but register. When it is slow, either managers give you something to do or you fix things over and over, even if it is fixed. Management does not care, they only worry about profits. Hardest part of the job is how boring it is! Most enjoyable is getting to know your coworkers"
bad,The store is somewhat poorly managed and it's kind of a learn on your own type of training. There was no advancement for me and my hours were cut so dramatically I was forced to quit due to me paying my baby sitter more than I was making. Not a bad job if you want something temporary.
bad,"At my location at least, the managers saw you as inferior, they’d abuse their power and make you feel stupid. If you got on the managers bad side she’d cut your hours and leave you with the least (ex. You got 7 hours meanwhile your coworkers worked 15+). Our loyalty program was frustrating because not everyone will sign up so if you didn’t sign up a lot of people then you’d also get your hours cut. "
bad,"Typical workday was fast paced but fun. Interacting with customers and taking sales. I learned a great deal about the register and customer service. The management was non existent. At the time, my manager was doing some illegal things and I later got compensated for it. The work culture was fun and light. The hardest part was taking a break and getting work hours. The most enjoyable part was the discount."
bad,"lack of management and communication made it very challenging to keep up a positive environment.  As for training, it was limited  and you are thrown right into your role feeling clueless."
bad,"Slow, little hours, bad attitudes, very sloppy old paced, appointment. book unorganized, phoned customer support was rude, training was 100% useless and education less."
bad,"Productive fun place that could be more organized and prepared for the day. At Ulta I have learned way more about make up brands, pros and cons, color match, add on's. Management could be better and treat all employees the same instead of showing favoritism to those who really don't bring much to the company but with being friends outside of work those workers get treated with more respect than the ones who actually work hard. Work place culture is a national diversity. The hardest part about the job is going after employees and cleaning up there mess because managers don't pay no attention to it. The most enjoyable part about my job is helping and guiding customers and having them leave satisfied and happy with there new products."
bad,I started with Ulta as an equipment operator and is now a part of the QA team. I have learned different functions and has gained a ton of responsibilities.
bad,"Managers seem to care more about sales and the store rather than the employees. The work is so much for so little pay and you cannot stop working even if there is nothing left to do. There's gossip and strange looks and even cliques within the employees. The customers are the best part of the job, you meet new people every day from all over the world and you bond about makeup and skincare."
bad,"On a typical day I would come in and manage the basic nightly operations of the business. I learned that even though you may have a title with responsibilities you are actually responsible for a little bit of everything, some management was awesome and some leaved much to be desired. The hardest part was close/open shifts, and doing your best setting ad and having it torn apart (as usually reset while you were off). The most enjoyable thing about the job was being able to get your hair done at 50% off and all merchandise was 20% off."
bad,"When I first started here the environment was fun and everyone got along. I love the people I work with minus most of the managers. There are too many hands in the pot and no one seems to know what they're doing.  The whole work/ life balance is a joke unless you're in corporate. And you can forget about your ideas ever being listened to , you're just looked down upon as a little peon in their retail game."
bad,"Management was disorganized. I had several scheduling issues that were caused because of a final schedule only being available with one week at a time, and coming out a few days in advance before that week started. Management did not pay attention to days or times requested off, that were given weeks in advance."
bad,"I started a couple months before holiday season and was getting plenty of hours. I expected the hours to increase or at least stay the same for Holiday, but they actually went down to like 10 hours a week! I had an open schedule so availability wasn't an issue. I wasn't hired in as seasonal, but people who were hired after me were getting more hours than I was. I was great at my job so I couldn't wrap my head around this. Also training is nonexistent here. You're promised services at the end of your training... about a month in and I had only watched one video about how to sell gift cards... Communication from some managers to associates was very rare too. There would be something going on for the associates (like wearing jeans or extra off certain products, meetings) and it's like the managers only told certain people and expects the associates to communicate to everyone else. It was very unorganized. Breaks are also nonexistent."
bad,"they hire temps, send regular workers home and still bring in more temps.managers have nice events for staff, they watch people like a hawk. very clean place, very hot in the summer."
bad,"The associate manager is rude. They can't keep employees. The store is unorganized. The pay isn't worth the sacrifices. They usually only have one cashier which frustrates the customers who have to wait when there's a line good luck getting a manager on duty to help ring they're always ""busy"" sitting in the back."
bad,"There was no support for poor in store management, the GM's are hired in with no service industry knowledge or accountability of actions.  HR will not address claims appropriately and you live in constant fear of being fired for performance that is out of your control."
bad,Very unorganized business. Manager was not taking care of responsibilities and that resulted in her being fired. Did not have a head manager for over a month. New manager knew nothing about the company. Such a hassle.
bad,Typical 12 hour shift can be very rough by only working three days out of the week with only 36 hours. Because not enough money can make go throughout the week until i get paid.
bad,"i worked for Ulta as a prestige MAnager for 10 months, loved my job, servicing guests, got great feedback via online survey."
bad,"not a lot of hours for the employees, your only full time if you are in management. Not enough cashiers for the customers."
bad,"Utla has many opportunities to offer but management was horrible to work with. I loved my co-workers, it seems like everyone got along, but store manager was not equip to handle staff. Most of the girls that worked there including myself were new to retails and managers were disrespectful when employees asked questions on how to stock and set up store.  Never knew what days I would be off and they waited till last day to give schedules. I did enjoy the discounts that they had to offer for employees and how they are welling to give employees a chance on trying new things."
bad,"The typical day is that I would go in and clock in and have a huddle before so I can see all the sales and good deals that are going on in that week. I would work the cashier when customers would come up with their products and items they wanted to buy. I would offer a team member awards card as well to try to promote our promotions and to save money on products, we would have goals for those and I"
bad,"Now being hired on as seasonal, I expected to have few hours, but not so few that even when I was on my way to work, management would call me and say, we have to cut hours this week so don't bother coming in. Even on one of the busiest days of the holiday season (Black Friday) I went in at 3 A.M and when i got there, the floor manager says to me "" we were going to call you and ell you not to come in but we figured you were already on your way here...."" meanwhile they were sending people home around 6 or 7 but I was there until almost 9....I'm not usually one to complain but I genuinely thought that this job was going to be very different than it was. Only a few people were friendly, mostly the prestige consultants..."
bad,"Obviously this job is going to be fun for any one that enjoys girly things like hair & make up, or working with people.. but management was horrid. Not all managers just the GM of Hanover, PA. She never considered any of the employees lives outside of work, she'd make last minute changes to the schedule all the time or give employees late notices of mandatory meetings ON THEIR DAYS OFF, she'd treat unhappy customers like they did something wrong when it was a hair stylists mistake, and she'd never let the other managers handle things properly. She would also expect everyone to work on mandatory holidays, but would never schedule herself on those days."
bad,"You make friends, ring people out, restock shelves, and... the best part is that they won't give you the hours you need or deserve, and then when you don't know where things go, they get mad at you... and then you say... well if I worked more than 4 days a month, I would know where things go.... BUT no more about me... AS A COMPANY it is great. It really depends on what store you work at though."
bad,"Ulta has a great concept!  It's a one stop for all things beauty related-- prestige cosmetics, hair, nail and skin care, mass market cosmetics, hair, nail and skin care, fine fragrances, styling tools, men's grooming and they even have a full service salon complete with a licensed skin expert for waxing, facials and such.  So much for for the visiting guest, but that is where the fun ends.  "
bad,They have high turnover! NOT ENOUGH MONEY! AVG 400 MONTH! Difficult to make commission. Dont waste time
bad,"I began working at Ulta after I graduated college simply to hold myelf over until I began Law School. My training consisted of watching a video that, clearly, did not pertain to the position I was hired for (the video was clearly for prestige reps and I was hired as a cashier).  I 'trained' under a lead cashier for a day before being thrown into the job. While working the register is a pretty simple concept, I had never worked in retail before and probably could have used more time shadowing. I was never taught how to answer customer FAQ's and often times had to bring up a busy, disgruntled manager  to answer their questions (there were never enough managers working). There are so many promos and giveaways that it's impossible to keep up with all of them without a cheat sheet or flipping through the newest catalog. I was never told I could take breaks, so I often stood for my entire 4-6 hour shift without ever taking a break, which resulted in terrible foot pain and fatigue. Many days I was assigned to work 'Task Team' which is dealing with stock and unloading shipments at 4 a.m. While I didn't mind this aspect, it would've been nice to have been told that this was also included in the job duties. Very often my hours were cut the day of, which was awful because there was money that was anticipated that you wouldn't get (maybe this is how all of retail is, I don't know). On a positive note, everyone I worked with, other cashiers, prestige staff, salon staff were VERY FRIENDLY and a pleasure to be around. I will also say that I learned a lot about certain products that I never"
bad,Accounting Processors are a great team. Supervisory and Manager rolls need updated training/knowledge in managing and communicating with others.
bad,"-My co-workers were rude and fake, they also hated it when I asked any questions."
bad,The manager there is very young not enough experience I like the place it has a very loving environment but not enough pay to keep you in a good living at home.
bad,the shift begins with a morning meeting and stretch
bad,"Working night shift for PTS department. Very simple job, work is easy and pretty chill when it's slow. Now with that being said, this is overall the worst place I have ever worked. No communication from management and overall some of the most childish grown adult co-workers you will ever work with. ALOT of gossiping around, even if you keep to yourself. Low self-esteem workers everywhere here."
bad,Read the reviews before considering a career as a General Manager with Ulta.  There is no work life balance.  As far as training goes there is very little.  Constantly being told that it takes at least 6 months before you feel comfortable in your role.  I opened a store and it seemed like no one really knew what was going on and as soon as your store is open the trainers and district manager disappeared until it was time to tell you what you weren’t doing right. Worst experience with a company ever.
bad,Discount and some perks are good. The health insurance is unbelievable. But it’s a retail job with no appreciation from management. Plus they’re open on thanksgiving.
bad,"Unfortunately the management puts a lot of pressure on your “numbers”. Your numbers, for example, would be how many people signed up for their loyalty program and how many people the cashiers were able to trick into applying for a credit card that has very little benefits. Your worth as an employee is mostly judged on an arbitrary set of “numbers”."
bad,Great job for a first time Aesthetician.  The pay is very poor.  Tips are paid out daily.  Salon Manager is the best and very fair.  Benefits are good and 401k is awesome.
bad,"Work environment was good"
bad,I loved working at Ulta Beauty. Great discount and fun team. The managers do not lead by example. Alot of gossip in this store. It became a toxic environment for me so I quit. I don't recommend this store at all!
bad,"I love working there, the manager is crazy end so So rude."
bad,"always try to communicate as much as possible. It’s easy to be forgetful there. Partnerships with your management is pretty hard, do your best to stay on top of everything."
bad,"Honestly, Ulta asks a lot of their employees and doesn't give much back. That's about as honest and quick a review as I can give. "
bad,I was hired around Christmas time when things were super hectic. I didn't get a chance to work much because i had an injury and couldn't work but when i was working i don't think i worked more then 5 hours in a week.
bad,"Women should support each other, not bicker all day. The hair salon and the retail sides of the store are constantly at battle over petty items which can turn ugly."
bad,I loved my job there but when Management changed  my job became  very uncomfortable  and  stressed  to the point  that being one of the best managers  there the it became  unbearable  to wrk there. I will  not  let one person or two people  stop me from doing what I love
bad,"Ive seen managers come and go. "
bad,"Start with a checking emails and paper work"
bad,"This is not the job for an esthetician. Unless you bring a handful of clients with you. It’s a weird position where you are a salon employee but your manager is the prestige manager and may not understand the license side of the Business  And you aren’t treated like a salon employee.  You’re more of “rep” or sales person for skincare. The open express bar is awkward. If you don’t have clients for the day, you’re expected to walk around and haggle customers for a facial. You’re also responsible for making testers, stocking skincare, helping customers with makeup/color matching."
bad,"The culture at Ulta is fun, and inspiring. The stylists, associates and managers are all passionate and kind. I believe anyone visiting can appreciate the customer service! I give two stars because it was difficult to grow as a professional. When I started, I was the only stylist, with no assistance, or receptionist. I managed myself and built a clientele. A year in and not a single class. The key to growth is knowledge and during my employment, I didn't learn much beyond my own trials as an artist. Despite having retained company clientele, alone, the wages and goals seemed to be non-negotiable."
bad,I love the company but i was only getting four hours of work a week because the manager has a problem with me that she was afraid to address. Managers weren’t willing to work with beauty advisors to improve their skills as a whole.
bad,I only made $8.00 an hour.  Not enough to live on. Ulta did not do enough marketing the skin care technician. It was good experience for me right out of school.
bad,Limited career growth opportunities within my role....lack of communication among upper management which lead to a lot of questions with in the role.  Pay was inconsistent throughout the same role
bad,It’s a good position for those who are in school or looking to build background in the beauty industry. It’s can also be used as a supplemental job. There are days of unloading inventory and stocking in the early mornings of 5am and changing out entire planograms before the store opens. The position is fairly easy to learn. Position could’ve been nice if the wages were much better. Ulta undervalues their beauty advisors with extremely low wages
bad,"In all honesty this was one of the worst jobs i've ever had, and i worked here almost two years. Management wasn't great, hours were not flexible, and they often scheduled you out of your availability. It was fun to be around makeup and get to see pop up events and get a discount on makeup you like, but thats about it. They lead me on about promotions for a year, and when i was eventually promoted it was for a different position than what i was promised. Their ""annual raise"" was $.25 and their promotion raise was a dollar. This company doesnt care about it's staff or the hard work that they do to keep sales high, but in reality that's just the beauty world."
bad,The environment was too cliquey and if you weren't apart of it you wouldn't be treated equally and would get less hours. Some of those who I worked with really liked it.
bad,Been at Ulta for a year and a half. Took forever to get the pay I deserve and when I finally did they cut my hours until I only worked 2 shifts a week. Had to get a second job. Had a male coworker sexually harass me and when reported they did nothing but warn him even though they have a “no tolerance” policy. Severe lack of training. Management is a joke. Can’t move up even when you express interest. Only good thing is the discount on product and my coworkers. And that’s the only reason I still work shipment one day a week there. Maybe other stores are better but this is just my personal experience.
bad,Loved the people I worked with.  Upper management was not supportive and very unprofessional.  Had many GM's and other employees leave because of DM.  Never experienced this in my 14 years of retail.
bad,"It all depends on the management staff at your location, starting with your general manager, if she doesn't understand the way division of responsibility and teamwork is synergistic , ie, we each have our own role, but Ill pick up where you left off if I have time... then your in for a shitoki show, because the time crunch at ulta is very real.. you have to have a good team, and be able to multitask efficiently."
bad,"I was hired as a ""Seasonal Beauty Advisor"" barely paid over min. wage but I thought it would be a fun job where I would get to help customers pick makeup and color match them, etc..  No.  I was a glorified stocker/cashier.   When I didn't have a full time job, I would get  scheduled 3 hours every 2 weeks(but they would call me in a few times, for about 8-12 hours on a big check), once I scored a full time job, they miraculously wanted to schedule me EVERY weekend all day Sat and Sun.  So I quit because my request for less hours fell on deaf ears.  The employee discount was great, but I seriously spent triple what I earned there."
bad,Pays a decent rate for machine operators and material handlers but poor work environment. Poor management only worried about numbers and not about quality or safety.
bad,"I have worked for Ulta Beauty for over 3 years now. As a professional makeup artist and sales woman, I worked my way up from Beauty Advisor, to Clinique Consultant, to Clinique Counter Manager. When I was promoted from a part time Clinique Consultant to a full time Counter Manager and I asked for a raise, I was turned down. As a very highly motivated sales driven employee, this was a slap in the face. Then to only receive a 3% raise after my yearly review, I was beyond frustrated. How can Ulta treat their best employees like they are worth nothing when we are what makes the company? I do NOT recommend working at Ulta Beauty unless you are prepared to be undervalued and underpaid."
bad,Good team but no talking skills very scattered and last min . Cutting hours was a big thing with them and it was always lat min with it. Id come in for 30 mins then they would cut me.
bad,"The management was very poor, they had an attitude anytime you asked a simple question. Barely gave any hours. The work environment overall was very friendly. I loved the customers and helping them with anything they had questions on."
bad,"Overall a great job, loved my coworkers. You did more than was in the job description. Basically a maid for everyone in the salon, had to sweep after stylists, do laundry, do dishes, stock all the color up, and answer multiple phone calls on top of it all! The management was horrible!!! Treated you very poorly if you weren't favorited. Started at 40 hours, got cut down to 18 once she found someone else. Brought you into the office which felt like every other day to scold you about not doing your job correctly, when you were working the best you can. Never ever got up to her expectations no matter what you did, and she made sure you knew that. Very rude and inappropriate, i remember a guest saying something about her to me one time. Other employees as well as the assistant salon manager left because of her! Would maybe reccomend working here with different management!"
bad,Working there was ok but they expect your life to revolve around working there and the pay is terrible.  They want you to work extra hard for little pay.
bad,"Some managers are just kissing a%$. The work they give is overload for little to no pay. You can never be sick. They work off of a point system, and you gain a point for evening calling in sick. After 8 you are fired...ridiculous, wants you to work when you have no voice so you can get others sick."
bad,Upper management does not care about development within the team. They do not think training is important therefore no one is properly trained. Management is very selfish and not understanding
bad,A cool place to work for a short period of time. Very catty management so things got messy fairly often. The game of favorites is also played alot in the company.
bad,"I was hired as an aesthetician, but most of my time was spent up in the makeup department providing product demos and information to customers, instead of doing skin treatments.  They did a great job at promoting their hair salon services, but most people were not aware that they even had an aesthetician, so that made it difficult to grow a true clientele.  I ended up leaving after getting hired full time somewhere else."
bad,"Didn't have the greatest management. Start out pay was low, not very organized as a company. Some very early hours to do shipment and unload truck. Not many reliable employees."
bad,"Starting out, Ulta was fun and exciting. However, after a few months of being opened the management went downhill and everyone was miserable every single day."
bad,I like working there because you work in your own pace  as long as you are working. And it's the same with  Menasha  they get slow sometime .
bad,"I liked the job at Ulta, I enjoyed my fellow part timers and associate managers. However, the GM and Co are catty and unprofessional. They reminded me of high school girls gossiping about everyone and I felt bullied in a way. I couldn't ask a legit question without being made to look, and feel like an idiot. There is much more to it than that. Leaving that job was the best thing I've done for myself. Too bad the management was awful, because the job itself was cool. Being around make up was amazing and I loved helping the clientele."
bad,"Loved the job at first, then I began to realize that the upper levels of management are heartless and don't truly get to know their associates and management staff. After 2 years of dedicated service to this company, I was terminated after not knowing about a policy change for associates. I was told I was incompetant and should not be running a store. It was very disrespectful on their part. Instead of training and making sure that other manageers and staff knew of the change, they decided to ""separate employment"" with me."
bad,"I feel I am wasting my talents. 8 an hour. tips poor"
bad,na I would not like to review this company. it was a good temp position for me. nothing more nothing less. I would like to stop writing now and move onto the next step
bad,"Company needs to fill headcount within IT to support additional projects and company expansion. Wearing many hats is helpful and you are respected for it, however hours can be very long and communication may not be the best between departments."
bad,"I waited for two long months, maybe even more, to work at ULTA. Excited to be working with make up and being with people, but nope. Apparently they choose where you work. I got a task position with a low pay. Hours suck, like this week I only got four hours to deal with. I texted my boss asking for more hours. No reply. I even said please. Still. No. Reply. We've only been open for a month now and we've already cut FOUR PEOPLE off. I'm currently looking for another job. I do not recommend working here. Hours suck, and your manager doesn't care."
bad,"An amazing idea of a company but too many blurred lines. Total charge of scheduling, ordering and stylist education, training and monthly reviews. Senior management staff are all retail experienced, so a blendable work environment and understanding of retail is a definite plus."
bad,"I loved getting salon and product discounts, and two out of the three managers were actually very nice and understanding. But one manager, who was the reason I was fired, was very rude and picky. She threatened to send me home on a daily basis, even though the other two managers always told me I was doing a good job and loved how reliable I was. I just think they need to organize upper management and get better managers. Hours were also no good, I was only getting four a week and when I asked for more, they said they'd put me on CALL. I don't think so."
bad,"Not a good place if you want to have a life. Mangament is horrible,which makes for a horrible work environment"
bad,"I worked at Ulta while attending cosmetology school. It was a disaster. The managers would not respect my school schedule and constantly scheduled me during my school hours. Also after working there for a few months, I didn't even get a work tag for my uniform yet every other employee had one. I was constantly being asked by customers ""Do you work here?"" It got to be seriously annoying. Overall, the managers need to be seriously evaluated more. They seem very careless and you could work your butt off doing your job yet it would never be good enough for the managers. After a few months working as cashier, I felt like I was able to get a job advancement as a Prestige Consultant. I had experience being in beauty school and was dedicated. The managers kept promising I would get moved up, but kept making excuses. Finally they were making advancements and they moved a cashier up that had no experience with cosmetology whatsoever. My advice to all people applying to an Ulta, do your homework. Check into the store more and make sure the managers are not like the ones I had."
bad,"I loved working here, just didn't pay well enough. I enjoyed my co workers and manager. Nothing was hard about the job, just did not pay enough. I loved making my clients look good."
bad,This is not the company to work for if you want job security. They hammer it into your head from day one that their are plenty of other people that would take your place.
bad,"This place has now caused the beginning of my mental decline. Pure chaos. I wake up and wonder why this is my life, yet somehow I cannot leave. It's similar in satisfaction to a garbage fire- You can't walk away, the flames are drawing you in. Management in deep desperation for brain-dead new hires. Sometimes I wake up and I wonder, ""What have I done to deserve this life?"". Keys jingling is nails on a chalkboard. Hardest part of the job- surviving my own mind. Help."
bad,"I adored my job when I first started but management made me hate my job. They’re unfair, DONT appreciate the work you do, and don’t pay good enough for all the extra hours and time you put into your work. Not every Ulta is like this but stay away from Ulta in Newport News for a job. They cut hours like crazy for unfair reasons and don’t bother with training new employees. Every store’s management is different but Newport News store needs corporate called."
bad,"No Work Life balance. Very chaotic and extremely reactive work environtment. training is not consisten and have to work with very little payroll. Hectic hours, opened on all holidayas except Christmas."
bad,looks like a fun glamours place to work but they cut hrs big time. and they give you a small percentage to buy product so in reality the little money you make you end up spending it there and giving it back!!!
bad,"The management team for my store was knowledgable not only about the product but the customer service. The only note I have is that the management team did not listen to their sales team as much as they should. Yes, work is important but so is the team."
bad,"Co-workers and managers were mostly cool aside from some immaturity, but that's anywhere a lot of young people work together. Hours were lean. They'd schedule you for 4 hours and 45 minutes so they didn't have to give you a lunch break. We were usually staffed as minimally as possible, so if there happened to be a rush it was awful. One time someone from corporate called the store before we even opened and I asked if they wanted to speak with the store manager, but they insisted on talking to me and asked me all these questions about whether the manager had told me about these certain promotions we were having. She hadn't, probably because we had all just gotten there and would have when we all checked in before opening the store, and I said as much. It was very uncool to basically ask an employee to ""tell on"" her manager, and then later they told the manager what I'd said. Very unprofessional and borderline abusive to use employees that way. Also no benefits if you're part-time and the hours fluctuate, and it's hard to become full-time unless you move up. The corporation clearly doesn't value employees. The upside is sometimes it was easy and fun, and the actual in-store co-workers are usually cool and supportive. Most employees there were in school, so the flexible/minimal schedule probably worked for them."
bad,Definitely felt like high school 20 years after the fact. Salon is not growing due to being overpriced and under-marketed. The culture of cattiness definitely reigns supreme company-wide.
bad,"I actually really enjoyed this job for the most part, but it was kind of weird when I first started. When you first start they make you work truck (stocking) it wasn't horrible but the hours, yikes. It was a weekend job because they don't put you on the floor right away. You basically have to start from the very bottom, so I worked Saturday and Sunday from 12 a.m til about 4 a.m. So your really only getting 8-10 hours a week and you get paid bi-weekly so that's 16-20 hours every two weeks meaning you get paid anywhere from $72-$180 every 2 weeks, which compared to some jobs isn't even really considered a job. More of a hobby. Anyways they make you work truck for about 2 months EVERY weekend. For the like 3 months I worked there I worked the floor maybe 2 times. I walk in there and still see the same 5 people working, none of the people I got hired with work there and I haven't seen any new people  and it's been a few months since I worked there, so they really do pick favorites on who works actual days."
bad,"Working here was absolutely horrible, training process is rushed. They do not work with your availability, and a car is your best form of transportation. They will keep you really late at night, and ask you via text to come to work at different time than scheduled."
bad,"Good benefits but low salary. Better hope you have a good GM or you will hate life! Clueless DM who didn't know what really went on in the store. Not much room for moving up or into another dept/role unless you are willing to move to IL and work at corporate. Annual ""how are we doing"" culture survey but nothing changes. Employee discount was good and loyalty program a plus."
bad,i wouldnt recommend this job to anyone who is new to the beauty industry. For stylists that have been in the industry for over 5 years i would possibly recommend this job but if you are free spirited it may not be the best job. It can be an entertaining job and fun if you have the patience of a saint.
bad,"Poor Management:"
bad,You get promised so much to come work here and then they do not deliver.  You are scheduled a certain number of hours to work each week and management is pressured to cut hours if you do not have clients. At the end of the week your hours are always way less than how they started. Impossible to build a clientele if you are always being sent home.
bad,"My position at Ulta was first seasonal, then I was promoted to lead cashier. I was in college at the time and this was a temporary position. This company works you to the bone and does not compensate accordingly. Even though the pay was horrible, my coworkers made it worth it. I have never been around such amazing, sweet, supportive people. They were the reason I was there for a year."
bad,"I loved what I did. I worked at one of the boutiques. The job itself was what I was passionate about and the compensation was good, BUT the micro management and attitudes of managers at my Ulta was horrendous. They were on a constant power trip and on many occasions I overheard them saying bad things about associates. For example, one girl on the truck team was still learning how to do makeup and they would make fun of her. It was Ridiculous. Regionals were rude too. I had to find another job because dealing with high school bs is not what I signed up for. They couldn’t pay me enough to deal with that mess."
bad,"This company is a disaster. There is little to no communication between management and employees. I worked at a new location for around 5 months and loved it at first, but quickly realized that the well-being of the store and customer service fell completely on Beauty Advisors. I often had no idea what I was supposed to be doing and was then yelled at for it. You cannot ask questions. The hours suck. The signs and prices are almost always wrong or not there. No one keeps up with anything. All they care about are credit card sign ups. You’re forced to wear an excessive amount of makeup & follow an extremely strict dress code."
bad,"No work/life balance. You live, eat, breathe there as a manager. The left hand often doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. High turnover in all positions of the company."
bad,"I felt overqualified for the position and I received little to no hours. I was expected to become a top seller which was virtually impossible with what little hours I would receive. The pay was not good at all. As someone who has invested thousands of dollars in licensure and certifications in makeup artistry and skincare, I felt severly underpaid."
bad,"I started out at the ULTA DC in GreenWood Indiana.. Go GreenWood.. Which I wish I would have stayed. But amywhoot Once I found out they was building in Dallas Tx, I looked at it as a advancement opportunity. So I learned all I could at the GreenWood DC with hopes of becoming in a leadership role at the Dallas DC. Boy was I wrong. GreenWood DC sent me to the Dallas DC to help with Ramp up ((Grand Opening ECT.)) Little did I know once I transferred and Moved ( Relocated) to the Dallas DC Almost every one in the DC even management and 60%  of the Workers had came from a Target DC which mean upper Management had already promised growth. Dallas DC management was cut throat no matter who I talked to even HR it was a no go so I ended up quitting. I loved the DC in GreenWood In. I was just sick of the weather and was ready for change with a fair opportunity of growth  over All I loved working for ULTA ..Dallas DC was just Cut throat and was doing underhanded things and I didn't want the drama of calling corporate .."
bad,"During my time working at Ulta, the store had just opened up. In the beginning it was great. Overstaffed due to overprojected sales. As time went on and more and more people were let go, there were not enough people at the end of the year and going further. We didnt not have a store manager for months, leave the other managers to carry the weight and more for about 6 months."
bad,"Going into this job was exciting with all the brands that you could possibly work with and trainings one on one with brands! But my experience was a lot of tasking, not much training with brands, and little to no hrs. I worked 4 hrs a day. My hrs per week was 12-16hrs and 18 if I was lucky. I really waited it out to see if the hrs would get better. because in the job descriptions it says 15hrs minimum.. and so I received a decent amount of hrs like maybe 22 hrs one week and all of sudden a manager calls me to say that the company had to “CUT BACK HOURS” so i’m off for the week and they don’t know what the hrs will be like and that I’d have to check back... obv. I quit bc the lack of hrs"
bad,I loved working for Ulta the rules set by the company that I followed seemed impossible as a Designer in the Salon. Taking a lunch break in the middle of a blow out not going to happen! You can only work three days as a designer until you bring in a certain amount of money. I didn't like this as well. Other then those two major things I enjoyed it and think Ulta provides a decent path to sucess
bad,Ulta was a very fun job and I couldn't image anyone not liking the job it just wasn't for me at the time I worked there. I was satisfied with how the job was.
bad,"A typical day at work for Ulta assisting customers finding their needs and wants for makeup, skin care, fragrance, hair care, ect. "
bad,"If you are looking for a part time gig then this is for you. Do not expect to move up unless you are either in at the right time or know someone in management. Seems like all management just got in at the right time, and most of the managers I have had have not been qualified at all for the positions. Theres a lot of ""Do as I say Not as I do"" at Ulta and I think again that goes with the lack of qualified managers. Anyway, I work here super part time- maybe 15 hours a week on a busy week, and the discount is pretty good to deal with the managers."
bad,most people that like working at Ulta have been there for a long time and therefore have a say and get what they want. I have personally had bad experiences with my GM and manager
bad,"I would say this was the best job I ever had when it came to have an nice life/work balance... mostly because I was never scheduled. Unless you're a manager, you get hardly any hours."
bad,"It can be a fun and educational place to work, however, upper management doesn't understand work/home/family balance and the pay is very low."
bad,"I've made many close friends and acquaintances and established some lasting relationships with clients. I love getting gratis because it gives incentive to want to work harder and acknowledges the hard work given. The discount was also amazing. That being said the management is what left a bad taste in my mouth and drove me away entirely. It may have been my location in particular, but the management was unprofessional, sketchy, and certain members of this team were some of the 'fakest' individuals I have ever met in my life. I began becoming super uncomfortable at work and didn't trust many members of the management team, especially the ""higher ups"". If your'e not a kiss a** then don't plan on moving up the ladder anytime soon. The walls have ears."
bad,"The manager was a poor leader causing the work environment difficult. There wasn't room for growth. I enjoyed working in retail and dealing with customers, to bad the management did not support the employees."
bad,"Ulta was a great stepping stone, but not a final destination. Advancement was a popularity contest, not a work-ethic basis. I am grateful for my knowledge and experiences gained. Overall it was a valuable employment opportunity."
bad,"I feel this is a decent company. Excessively high goals that are just used for motivation, but still are highly running and making a profit. I think this job would be better if I had a better manager. She distributes hours HORRIBLY. She gives them all to her friend (Manager-like hours for a Part-Time employee), while last week I got 6. The discount is okay. 25% regularly and 35% (was 40%) for the holiday discount. Also get 50% off at the Salon which is awesome. But this job could be better if I had a better General Manager."
bad,"I learned that these people are extremely judgmental and your work ethic means absolutely nothing to them.  You may be a hard worker and always pull through even with the most difficult tasks, but they still will find a way to get rid of you if someone has a any sort of issue.  They are also, they type of company that promotes working out if you do not meet their standards as far as weight and body image.  Not that it is necessarily a bad thing to promote fitness and health, but to make rude, and in my opinion, offensive comments because you are not their ideal body type."
bad,It was a great atmosphere with all the cosmetics around.  The upper management was not very discreet with confidential info.  The designers should have been paid more.
bad,"the hardest part of the job was having to dress up, if you did not have a full face of makeup the managers would tell you it is a dress code violation."
bad,"I worked here for about 7 months as a skin therapist. I felt like I had ample training, but was never able to fill my book and build clientele. We didn't have very many people in the store at all, let alone getting services. They would change my schedule the day before/or day of and get mad when I had plans (doctors appointments, etc..) and was forced to leave. Even though I didn't have anyone scheduled. "
bad,i had worked there for a yr. i liked what i did and loved who i worked with. we had a change in upper management and things went south. i think if the upper management would remember what it was like to work in the store there wouldnt be problems. sometimes you have to remember where you came from to understand where the Little guys are at.
bad,Everyone of the employees and managers are so nice and attentive and actually care about their customers I currently work here and I am definetly enjoying it here.
bad,"Day to day management was fun and interactive with both clients and sales team. The Salon was a bonus throughout my employment. The disconnect and communication between the GM and DM was not organized, or concise at all."
bad,I absolutely loved my time at Ulta up until we lost the majority of our managers/team within a month. I am incredibly grateful for everything the company taught me as I grew up a sufficient amount during working for them. It has simply become too much for me to have to step up as one of the only remaining managers and work full time for the part time benefits and pay I was hired on for.
bad,I worked in several locations. The Hoover location by far is the worst location to work for. Store manager and managers under her aren’t nice to work for. All other locations are wonderful.
bad,I worked at the new location in West Ashley. Since the store opened in Dec 2018 (less than a year) the ENTIRE management team has been replaced for various different reasons AND HR investigated on more than 3 occasions. HR and the management team did not take employees or their concerns seriously (which resulted in 3 members of management losing their jobs eventually). I would definitely be cautious if I was considering working at this location.
bad,For the most part most of management is horrible from the supervisors to the main office. Supervisors and employees have a high turn over rate bc of how stressful the environment is and the hours they want you to work and then try to cut overtime by letting you go home early on the last day or sending you home at the start of shift.
bad,"It is basically impossible to get promoted in this company and if you do you HAVE to relocate. Also scheduling is terrible, I would get scheduled during times I was not available and it was still my responsibility to get those shifts covered even though it was on my availability."
bad,It was fun but management wasn't good at all. Management is not professional and never compromising.  The opportunity for advancement was based on favoritism.
bad,"Management at the district level made all of the decisions. Forced to work off the clock. Store management worked when she felt like it but took credit from all management. Very little training when beginning.  Nice discount and environment to work in but upper management made it difficult. I watched multiple people get fired in 6 months due to tardiness, however. It came down to favoritism. Would be a great company to work for if the management was fixed."
bad,"Managment was my biggest issue while I worked at Ulta. Promotions and advancements where promised and never followed through, no matter the effort or fufillment of responsibilties."
bad,"It’s an okay company, I didn’t work there very long. They’re  not that organized, they need more people with experience on the job. The pay is good though."
bad,"Typical day can include opening procedures, chatting in on store's personal goals and metrics, where we were at for the week in terms of sales, salon services, loyalty and data capture, credit card metrics with fellow associates. Checking in on boutiques on their goals for the week, what they could see as opportunities and where I could help. Assisting clients with up to date knowledge on current makeup and skincare trends, helping build clientele for our MAC, Clinique, Lancome and Benefit Counters. The hardest part of the job is communication, our store in particular is high in volume and traffic so when something is not communicated or communicated well it can create a small chaos. The best part of the job is my team, we are like a second family. Everyone has each other's backs and work effectively to get things done and have fun while doing them."
bad,"The social environment of the workplace was less than desirable. I ended up hating the job, and avoid going into the location I worked at all costs. It seems a bit dramatic I know, but the employees were like a teenage clique, and I was deemed the outsider from day 1. The manager was never kind, not only to me, but actual customers, I just didn't have a good experience. I am sure it isn't the same in every store."
bad,Management needs to be more consoderate of their employees as well as keeping up with their jobs and not making others be responsible for their work. As well as treating all employees equally.
bad,"At first, it started out wonderful but slowly started to go downhill the more hours I had. The management was messy and there was too much drama for a workplace. I was looking forward to doing facials and interacting with customers but all they cared about was selling, not about the actual needs of the client which was very upsetting to me."
bad,"Ulta was a magical place to work at, I just wish the management I had worked under would have been better. My manager did not follow store policies and deliberately made employees feel bad about themselves, resulting in a lot of them quitting and the work load coming down on the remaining employees. The discount was awesome and the employee appreciation weekends were even better. The fellow employees were super helpful and the only reason I stayed for as long as I did. My manager made me scared to come to work daily."
bad,"reached out to hr via email due to having issues with GM, didn't reply and fwd my email to my GM. GM made my life a living h*ll afterwards. No room for growth unless you're their favorite"
bad,"The turnover is tremendous.  Communication between management and staff was very poor.  Not enough staff hours to accommodate all tasks that need to be completed.  Floor staff is given a huge amount of responsibility while most of management staff would spend too much time talking.  Also, the amount of paper that the company uses is out of control.  They really need to eliminate and simpliy.  They waste money on things that aren't helping their company and is overwhelming to their management staff.  Thus, huge turnover!"
bad,it is a joke to work at. You'll get set home before you start work for the day or you be half way through your work and they would send you home. If you go their have fun
bad,"typical day was standing around at the register waiting for someone to come up and cleaning the counter while waiting "
bad,"terrible work staff. Unreasonable management and unresponsive HR department. "
bad,The company is a good place however human recuses does not do their job in reaching out and helping staff. and district manager protects people who have shown to be unfit for the position
bad,"The managers at ulta are very judgmental, when I worked there my manager told me I couldn't just have my hair down naturally curly even though I got a lot of compliments she told me it has to always be done even though just bc my hair was down curly doesn't mean it wasn't done I had product in my hair from ulta even!!! They judge your makeup even though my makeup was always done I've seen seasonal employees leave work and quit without clocking out because they were told they're makeup looked bad or hair looked a mess or they smell bad and I honestly get it it's ulta you want customers to see that you know what your doing however making employees feel judged vs actually helping them are totally different things. Why not suggest YouTube beauty gurus to watch or help them yourselves since it's so easy to judge? Or how about tell them in a nice manner you've been doing truck all day there's deordorant over there freshen up. I feel as a manager it's protocol to be able to handle these situations without making the company look bad. I mean how would you know if an employee that just got hired is waiting on that first pay check to buy more uniform? Buy more makeup? Why so quick to judge? I honestly felt that they're was also a lot of favoritism they treat seasonal employees different from regular employees, they don't really train well my first day on the register they just did a quick review of how the machine operated and you  were on your own but u know they tell you always feel free to ask questions lol like what is that return policies are kinda confusing especially if they don't"
bad,"there is a lot of ego in this industry and people clearly play favorites. You know its hard to get fired so people basically slack off and have no regard for management. Its bad either way. "
bad,"High volume of customers, improved on my customer service skills, a  bit of lack in communication between management and other employees, enjoyed interaction with guests, high standards within the company, an overall good experience."
bad,"Its not all that they promise. If you need a job, just don't get too comfortable. High turnover. They could careless about you. Wear comfortable shoes, real hard on the feet."
bad,"I was not given the hours I thought I would receive. I only work twice a week at most and that's for about 4 hours each time. I thought I would be working in multiple areas (i.e. registers, truck shift, working the floor, etc). But, instead, I was only made to work JUST truck shifts. I rarely worked the register and at some point I was made to stop working the register and just truck. My hours were cut severely, and became even worse when the company hours were cut. It's not the most enjoyable job if you're trying to make money of some kind. And there seems to be favoritism of who gets to work at the register. They kind of push you to the side for register training if you don't speak up about it. I am supposed to be a Beauty Advisor, which means I work the front and the back. I don't mind doing truck shifts. In fact, I love seeing the new products and being the first to know or buy it. But, I did not sign-up or expect to be working JUST truck. That was not in the job description. And there is little to no effort put into training you on the register. You kind of have to learn on your own WHEN you are put on register. So if you're looking for a job that will most likely cut your hours and give you PLENTY of free time. Then I'd highly recommend Ulta. The good side about this is at least your coworkers are nice and the discount is amazing, along with the free items you get at times. But I like to make money and have a life at the same time. As a college student I especially like making money, saving some, and spending some, and then making more. But then I like to be able to use"
bad,"I was given practically no hours. i was under the impression i was a full time advisor. but apparently not, i was seasonal. i got fired. the last few weeks i was there they didn’t need me because they had too many people working and would tell me 12 to 10 hours before my next shift. which screwed me over, i got payed practically nothing. i wasn’t able to enjoy christmas because if this unprofessional work place. i wasn’t able to pay the bills. and"
bad,Ulta is a fun work environment but they are only about making money. If you have any kind of family emergency they will not understand and give you and kind of extended time off to be with your family. If you are having a hard time with a lose they will pass you up for a promised promotion as well. It's not an ethical company but it is a fun work environment. So if you don't mind working all the time for 40-50% of your earnings and only getting paid $8 an hour for paid vacations then by all means work at ulta.
bad,"The culture is awesome their. The bad thing is poor managements and poor communications, always breathing down people's necks and micro managing them."
bad,"Long days and too many people. Hard to tell some of the products with labels. Busier than projected. Short Lunch break, no smoking and rude people. Most enjoyable part was end of day and getting to go home."
bad,"The hours are a complete and utter JOKE .  Based on other reviews it seems like this is a common trend with the company and it’s absolutely ridiculous that this is something that is a term of theirs obviously .  Honestly sad!   I barely have money to upkeep my appearance which is a staple in this industry to make sales . I can’t live or take care of my children ,  I left my retail job of two years because I wanted a better worklife balance but this is absolutely ridiculous that they could think anyone could live off of this.  Many ulta  employees complain of extremely low hours but yet somehow the store keeps hiring new people . Lots of favoritism and obvious hazing ."
bad,"The company has a great culture but it doesn't always trickle down to the district or store level. Lots of unrealistic expectations on a skeleton crew. Payroll (or lack thereof) was one of the most stressful things. For such an ""advanced "" company they also have a lot of useless paperwork that could be simplified through technology. Their systems are also not very streamlined. I didn't hate it, but it definently wasn't what I thought it was going to be."
bad,"Your experience really depends on management. There's not enough hours for the people that are employed yet they're trying to hire more. Hours are continuously cut at this location. Schedules are changed last minute (as in hours before a shift). The short time that was worked full time, no benefits were received. The salon is not deemed important, it is only there as an extensive way to sell more product. Really the only perks are the discounts, and sometimes the amazing people you have the opportunity to work with."
bad,"Atypical day for me is begging my manager to please consider me for chemical services at work. There is a lot of adversity at the salon. What I learned was that the workplace culture in Brooksville, FL is bias. The hardest part of my job is being young gifted and black; which makes me fight to prove that I can be great. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers and the corporate plan that is in place."
bad,This job is good for people who are fresh out of high school or in college that live at  home with parents. It pays very little with no benefits unless you are in management even then I do not recall those being very great.
bad,I was excited to work here i love makeup and want help others with makeup but working here i got no hours even though i applied for a full time position and when i would talk to the manager about my hours she said she will add me to the schedule but when i went into work they said i didn't work! It was frustrating.
bad,I learned a lot about cosmetics and how to use them. It was a good experience to do make overs and see a person walk out of the store with so much more confidence
bad,Once again typing a review that is irrelevant. It has been years since I worked for this company and have no clue how they run their business today...
bad,"I worked for their call center . Staff was not friendly, no incentives or discounts on any products. Pay was not very good and they were difficult to get to work with schedule."
bad,"Working in the beauty industry was one of my biggest dreams, being a makeup lover myself. But sadly, working at Ulta was not what I expected it to be. I had probably 2-3 coworkers that I actually got along with. All of the other workers were very stuck up and treated the new employees like we were beneath them. I could not work a single shift without getting attitude from one of my coworkers. I have worked for a different company as a supervisor, so I know the ins and outs of working in retail, and how employees should be acting towards each other. Working there, was not how any employee should be acting. I still love shopping at Ulta, and I always will, but I do not think I will ever work for this company again."
bad,"The IT organization is going thru growing pains. The work is there, but PMO is ill equipped to handle it appropriately with current personnel, especially for the client-facing projects."
bad,"If you get hired here as seasonal, expect to be treated like trash and disliked by management. Staff is very catty and unfriendly towards newer people knowing they will be leaving within a few months."
bad,"Ulta is a great place for a beginner stylist to grow and learn new techniques of hair coloring, styling etc.  Hard to build a respectable clientele due to minimum hours. A typical day is to come in and pass your cards out to customers in the store."
bad,"Standard job, nothing above average to say about this. It is just a retail store. Also worked there a while ago so do not remember much,"
bad,Was  not a bad experiece. I felt it was a good company with poor leadrship.. I was hired when the company was growing in the atlanta market and  they were going though some growing pains
bad,management is not easy to work with. They don't give you any hours and don't work with you if anything ever comes up. Management was never helpful and never wanted to do anything.
bad,"I love working in any salon, so ULTA is no different! I would just really like to better myself. A typical day is rather slow when building my business up. I get better everyday that I am working, it is just hard to better myself when business just isn't coming in. My co-workers are great! We all get along and work as a team. Its a good environment. The hardest part is just getting the business in and staying busy. The most enjoyable part is that I am able to do what I love everyday!"
bad,"I enjoyed organizing, booking, and facilitating in store events. The events were great for the client's and gave vendors great sales opportunity."
bad,I found that the women who work at Ulta are not welcoming or respectful. Each emplyee was expected to sell and meet the monthly quota but there was no insentive. We were paid hourly without commission. They would constantly cut hours and not give a valid reason as to why.
bad,A growing company that needs to get more technology to help it get there!
bad,Ulta is a good place to work! But you do not get recognized for hard work often. They only care about numbers and not actual hard workers which is sad!
bad,"I've been working at Ulta for almost a year and a half now. I started first for season while I was in school but was kept on. At first, I loved it. I loved the girls I worked with and going to work never truly felt like work> Recently management changed to some very poor managers and some new girls who were hired act like they're in high school with all the drama. I was at one point in the Benefit Brow Bar but one of the girls who was also in it made it her mission to make me leave, and would complain to our store manager about how customers would complain and be unhappy with my services (untrue) and would consistently steal clients, which management did nothing about under the guise that 'the clients who rebooked aren't our clients, they're the store clients'. I accepted a demotion and pay cut to my old position and after I went to it I was happier, at least until they started cutting my hours (taking me from the 28 I was guaranteed when I accepted the demotion, to 18 on a good week). They'd also cut my shifts to shorter ones when I'd be there (an 8 hour shift to a 3 or 4 hour one) and then just today I found out I wasn't scheduled for training that as a PBA I'm supposed to go to. In my store, there's blatant favouritism, and they prefer to promote from other stores or outside the company than promote the people who deserve them in the store."
bad,lack of growth options for associates and management. unrealistic expectations with little to no staff. high theft and concern for your own safety.  expectations to run multi-million dollar establishment on a bare bones budget.
bad,"If not wanting to start a family or if you really love working, great place to work. Benefits are great if you are full time. Room for growth. Competitive pay, but below national average of management pay. Little to no work life balance. Schedules are out over a month in advance, not giving much time for any type of social life."
bad,"Everything kept changing. I was required to be a trainer even when I didn't want to.They work you like a dog for not enough pay, Great benefits, free shirts every year"
bad,"Very fun job to work at however hours provided were TERRIBLE no one got good hours unless took over other peoples hours, manager often had no idea what was going on"
good,"Lots of promises to grow in the industry and in management, all empty promises. Favoritism rules all in Ulta and it shows in their turn rate. Cant keep good employees who work very hard but see no growth after being there for years."
good,"Management consists of uneducated and self-absorbed associates who will do anything to cover themselves and throw others under the bus. Working with makeup is fun for beauty enthusiasts but each store is different and nothing is consistent or guaranteed. As expected from a retail job, there is a high turnover which makes it difficult to create a good working environment."
good,"Apply somewhere else!! It's stressful and not fulfilling at all. Management is cruel and childish. Low pay, no advancement. You push yourself and work hard to make Ulta money but not yourself"
good,Relatively straightforward job. Can be better in terms of creating a better system of accommodating employees. Customers can be overly difficult. Best part of job is meeting people from diverse backgrounds.
good,"I accepted the position at Ulta with the idea of getting in with a organization that was growing fast and had a great deal of advancement opportunities. I opened a new location and was given no direction or training on anything that I was responsible for. I stuck it out for over a year hoping that things would change and get better due to growing pains of a new location. "
good,"This job is really fun if you love makeup and hair! I loved it because I got to be around those things all day long. You are up to date on the trends, when the newest palette was coming out, etc. but the hours aren’t really there unless you’re a manager. For me, it was money to buy my makeup. It didn’t really go further than that. Managers also get mad if you have a set availability. If you ask for more hours and it isn’t when they want to give it to you, there’s a problem."
good,"It was not what I expected. It was a new location in Henderson,NV. I worked in the salon, it was very slow and very difficult to build a clientele. Made it hard to make commission sales."
good,"Ulta did not provide a conducive work envrionment for their employees. Employees are extremely underpaid, while the expectations for associates are high."
good,"Management was not the best. And this is my opinion of the Ulta located in Buckhead, Atlanta GA. But, we were required to sell the Ulta member cards, which most people did not want. We were required to sell a lot of things that people just really did not ever want, and if we didn't seen so many in a day, we'd recieve a warning or some kind of punishment. Management was not understanding or anything about personal life issues, medical issues mainly, etc. It just was not a good experience."
good,If you come into the store and just watch the employees you’ll hate my job for me. I am the only one who put out shipment and I’m the only part time/full time who opens at 7am with a manager.
good,"Ulta doesn’t care about their employees. They just want you to make money. I havent been put on the schedule for a month yet they still want me to get people to go in to get their hair done ( im assuming not by me). They play favorites and it’s completely unfair. There is no room to grow and you don’t really have a say in anything. My manager told me I basically suck at what I do even though my friends , family, and clients say I am great. Ulta does not care and they hire terrible managers."
good,i left my position at ulta beauty because i was not getting the hours i needed even though i had full avalability. they just cared about making money and gettting credit cards rather than making sure their employees were happy
good,The time in which a particular task was to be completed was truly a fail every time. Not enough people to complete and not enough hours given to ensure completion.
good,"Very organize work place , the supervisor are serious and on top of their employees , fast paced , when ever our stations run out of supply they at always to be found in the supply area we never run out."
good,"The management at my location was all over the place. I was consistently told by one manager one thing and then another would come and micromanage to tell me to do something completely different. the hours were great, however I explicitly told them I take public transportation and needed to leave by 930 every night and I was never accommodated. we were always told to try and cover our shifts before calling off, but if we could not find someone and we still could not make it in they made us come anyways. extremely unprofessional however the customers were always polite and it had a great aesthetic"
good,"I love ulta store but as workforce really poor management a lot of times  , with discrimination against other workers . Buying policy's for co-workers are unfair."
good,I come in at 6am waiting on doors to open at 7am I come in clock in and have a meeting about the day then I start stacking the product up on the shelfs and then I would pick up the trash around my group take it out to the dumpster the go advertise the company and tell valued customers what we have in store for them and great deals we have .
good,"No acknowledgement for there long term employees,no room for advancements.Upper staff did not complete job duties."
good,"I gave Ulta 3 stars because management just wasn't the best. They didn't pay enough for the amount of attitude the employers had to deal with. We were constantly getting stolen from, and management wasn't good at maintaining that. Although it had lots of downs I learned how I would want my business to be ran in the future and what to do and not to do."
good,POOR MANAGEMENT! however it is my understanding that corporate resolve this issue shortly after I left. However I was forced to drop out of college due to managements requirements of myself.
good,They’re always over hours which means there’s always a chance you won’t get any hours for that week. The managers don’t do a lot. Sometimes you’ll get sample sizes as gratis but it’s not often. They expect you to sell so many credit cards a day and yell when you don’t meet the goal but half the time the store is empty. Customers are hateful.
good,"The general manager wasn't a particularly nice woman, she was very fake to your face and then would discuss you behind your back. The employees were great, some of the most earnest I've worked with. The job is alright if you can deal with being disrespected. My favorite part was the discount."
good,"This particular store was unorganized and full of drama. It has potential, but the managers are either unmotivated or only about self. The discount isn't worth it."
good,"Managers gossip, they barely do anything in workplace, they will physically push you out of the way. Their ""policy"" is inhumane. I was not allowed to take an extra break when i was 8 months pregnant."
good,Pay is trash in every role. The hours are pretty ridiculous and if you can't get your shifts covered lol good luck having a job even if they really need you. the discount is decent compared to other places.
good,"Ulta Beauty requires that you be able to work long shifts with short breaks. At my store in particular, the staff and management were not willing to assist in curating a schedule that worked with my school and personal life."
good,Maybe my experience was because I was an apprentice.  I didn’t have any client and I felt pressured from my supervisors to harass the store customers to convert them to salon clients.
good,"This company does not give you enough hours to support yourself financially. They have you come in for two hour shifts. Asking for more hours is not going to change anything, they will just keep switching your schedule around, It is very inconsistent. One week I will have 7.50 hours and the next week 9.00 hours. Not practical for me to even waste gas getting to and from work."
good,I loved working for Ulta but at the end of the day there was no where to grow. It was awesome to partner with brands and get to meet new people on the daily. I would work there again if there was room for advancement. Great company I just wish they treated their employees better.
good,overall happy despite the micro management. fun upbeat environment and it is truly what you make it. It created/ shaped my voice. Take the opportunity to grow long lasting relationships with beautiful ppl.
good,"Work days were long, customers were friendly, pay was low but management is what made me leave. Job duties included: straightening inventory, cleaning the work place, and overseeing the register."
good,ULTA would have been a great company to work for if there were more communication among-st co-workers and less competition between beauty advisers. Combining strength and ideas would have made the company great
good,"The workplaces was simple and easy to work for, when you’re on the register and assisting customers from day to day. The management however (at my specific location), was not very organized in my opinion."
good,If you are a temp they will try to work you to death . No off days really and long hours. Mangement though Randstad is rude . If seeking this job go though the comapany it may be better.
good,"ulta is fine to work for. I would have liked to move up within the company. There is a lack of training within management, you are thrown to figure things out yourself."
good,Employees' skills are not utilized. There is not enough artistry based events. Employees are not educated properly on the basics of both makeup and skincare.
good,"Terrible management. Not much room to move up or for education. Would not give me full time, a higher hourly rate, or paid education after a year of employment. Not much support though out the store."
good,"I liked being able to do what I loved but I didn't like the style of it. Having to bother customers while they're shopping. My immediate supervisor was so great but the store owner was not very understanding and didn't really work with people. Every time I tried to talk to her she would say that her life is so much harder then mine so I have no right to not work as hard as her or whatever.  I understand its good to have a great work but Dont agree with her approach at all. "
good,"The people that work there are great and your discount is more than you get at other retail jobs. I was on the operations team but that's not what I applied for or even hired for. I was hired to be a beauty advisor which I may have done like one or two times a week max. I worked the truck at 530 am (again didn't sign up for it) and did all the resetting of the store, doing ads, planks, moves, wags etc. they expect you to move as fast as possible and even once you finish your entire work load. This might sound terrible but it actually wasn't as bad. You have to wear all black but typically those shifts are over a little after you open so  U can wear sweat pants and stuff. You were expected to help someone else without a break in between. All of the morning shifts I had for operations I never once got a break or a lunch. You're also expected to ALWAYS keep busy while managerment just sits there and chats but when there's like 2 customers I. The store all day it's a little hard to find anything else to do. Also management didn't know too much about policies / how to work registers / how to treat people at all. My biggest issue was obviously you need a second job unless you're management bc it's not liveable. The hours vary from 10-40 any given week for minimum wage but they would always schedule me ok my days that I worked my other job so I'd have to choose one or the other.  Very frustrating"
good,"A typical day was standing at the counter for 8+ hours with a 15 minute lunch break. Could never answer customers questions due to management only caring about getting the line down. Coworkers were insanely rude, would say hello and would be ignored or laughed at. "
good,"Ulta Beauty is a great start in the customer service environment. However, I do not recommend staying longer than 3 years. The environment is very catty, vicious and hostile at times. When opportunities do arise, the management team overlooks many people and gives to those who simply do not qualify or hires from the outside. Our General Manager used to go to Macy's in the mall and recruit people and artist from there and try and get them to apply to positions over at our store. It took me a long time to become recognized and to be promoted. A long time of doing dirty work or being treated like a ""worker bee"". They do not make you feel appreciated or important. I have worked at other Ulta's as well and it's the same wherever I went. Start at Sephora. They rain you in gratis, pay you well, and they are all very nice to each other. The environment is more casual but at the same time efficient. Everyone works hard and everyone is recognized for it."
good,"As a highly motivated beauty skin care professional at Ulta/Benefit , I have learned various techniques in waxing etc.  I sold and was very successful in many of the top brands of skin products such as; Perricone MD, Juice Beauty, Kinerase, It Cosmetics, Mario Badescu Skin Care and StriVectin to name a few.  In addition, I was the lead salesperson for three (3) months consecutively working the  Benefit Cosmetics Skin care line. The most enjoyable part of the job is Loving taking ownership in what you do."
good,I like working at Ulta it's been a fun experience although I am currently looking for something that will allow me to do more and start working on my path to a full time career.
good,"This is a semi-biased review which is solely regarding my store experience. Management was extremely unprofessional. I love the world of beauty, but unfortunately did not like the work environment here. I was making relationships with customers to keep them coming back, and management kept saying I was taking too long and they needed me on register. Unhappy customers=not coming back. They need to update their management on great customer service."
good,It was a very interesting way to get into cosmetics and learn so much about beautification work ethics.I am a MUA and this place was a thought process of building my small business  inquirers. Unfortunately I was not able to succeed in that due to the management and giving me negativity on my creativity goal seeking into the business of Ulta. This is not a financial place to work at especially waking up at 4am FOR 8.50 an hour to do truck and not be permitted to switch into something else for a change. So thank you Ulta for the opportunity but it was not worth calling back 10 times a day for this job.
good,"When you got to work it should not feel like a hassle, it should be a fun environment. Your co-workers should be a time not just to make a profit but to help each other out.  "
good,"This is a good place to learn about beauty products. The discounts are good. Flex scheduling is a plus. The regional manager loves to make people cry, she is so belittling and is not at all friendly or likeable, she called employees liers, stood in the way of stylist transfers,"
good,Ulta is very fun workplace but it is not steady work or enough financial support to take care of a household. They are good about listening and hearing when a request is made but are poor when actually executing that request. They however are wonderful if you have to call in as long as you follow the one hour call in notice they will work very well with you. The managers are sweet and help when they can but like there is in every workplace veteran employees will always get first pick in everything over new employees. It is a wonderful place to work if you also have a sufficient secondary income.
good,"the company is awesome and looks out for its workers with sweet discounts and gratis but there is A LOT of behind the scenes stuff going on to keep this beast of a company going, and if you dont have an efficient management team, then the stress trickles down to the associates and it can barely keep it together and/or it will all fall apart. Also, trying to earn an internal promotion can be frustrating and leave you feeling unappreciated."
good,"I’ve made some lifelong friends working at Ulta!! That being said Retail jobs as a whole are difficult. This company is very corporate in its management style. Hours given are dependent on your performance selling credit cards and loyalty sign ups. Loss prevention was a major problem at my location and often times employees are “talked to” if theft happens on their shift. Management was poor, morale was low due to unattainable goals set by headquarters"
good,Rude and harsh managers who never listened to availability and gave work hours based on like-ability. Very petty work environment. Coworkers were ok. Hardest part was the 5am inventory/stock shifts.
good,Could use better management. Usually management is children who don’t know makeup. The reason I’ve stayed is because I love my Clinique boss. If it weren’t for her I don’t know.
good,Sales jobs very busy environment without a work-life balance and lots of employees turn over.  Great learning experience but very difficult to stay organized within the management team.
good,"Pros: "
good,"It’s a retail job. However, I’m not even making minimum wage, and I’m only part-time. This job is good if you don’t have any bills to pay. Definitely over worked and underpaid and very short breaks."
good,"fun, if you do not have a life, or any bills. "
good,"At work I felt very unsupported by managers when I first started my position. It was hard to get the job done when there was no support. Eventually I got the hang of it and was able to change the dynamic of the team. It was a very tough transition, though. They also had me working 40+ hours a week, but refused to offer me any benefits when I asked. My managers would say I was ready to move up, but when the time came, gave the position to someone else."
good,"Must be able to obtain loyalty memberships, and adamant on getting guests to purchase credit cards. moving heavy equipment, unloading truck product and distributing it in store, basic everyday cleaning tasks. heavily needed at cash wrap."
good,"Popularity contest, don't look at results in store. Goals met and exceeded. More concerned with shareholders. All stores hot to work in. Oppressive atmosphere"
good,"Generally I enjoyed the store, my coworkers and the pay and benefits were decent. Benefit is a great company to work for but the management at my Ulta was some of the worst I've ever experienced."
good,You are never guaranteed to be working very many hours and the district managers are harsh and unwilling to compensate. However the staff were talented and knowledgeable.
good,"The company as a whole does not handle any HR issues.  "
good,I use to work at Ulta as a stylist in the salon. I had a horrible manager and a general manager that never tried to do anything to help. Otherwise I love the company.
good,"It is extremely difficult to be a skin therapist here. You're constantly being pushed and shoved to raise numbers, given pretty crazy expectations in terms of goals, yet there's no incentive for you to do this. "
good,"Great job if you want to make $10 per hour and work 6-8 hours per week!  People are all really nice but "
good,There is absolutely no room for career growth or advancement and they offer no help in educating their current staff on the services and products they offer.
good,"Very little advancement and very political. It doesn't matter if you are a good employee, it just matters who you suck up to. You learn a lot about make up, but the managers (at least in my experience) don't have any desire to help their employees. The discount is nice though."
good,This is an ok workplace. Great co-workers and the pay is reasonable. Management can use some improvement. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours during the busy season. The most enjoyable part of the job was was the fast and easy commute.
good,"Ulta is an okay place to work for a starter job, management is iffy but all depends on your Ulta. They prefer to hire outside the company so there isn’t much room for a promotion."
good,Management was very unorganized and general manager was very unfair- unless it benefitted her. Not pleased with the pay. They’ll make you do jobs in the store that aren’t yours all the time then complain about you not getting your actual job done. They make poor judgment issues and if you can stay away from there.
good,At ULTA it is a retail job probably best only for young adults getting out of high school. It isn’t practical for an adult especially since you can’t get moved up to any higher position. It’s a good first job though.
good,Not a bad place to work. A little unorganized and not much room for advancement or raises. Hardest part of the job was having to stay late at night or come in very early in the mornings for stock and getting ready for the holidays.
good,"Fun place to work if you enjoy makeup, lotions, hair and beauty products of all kinds, colors and brands. The salon is excellent and as an employee you get a discount!"
good,If you didn't meet certain numbers you were let go. They don't make you sign any forms of papers when they let you go. They just take you badge. They have favorites at work place so even if you didn't do something they just blame you for it.
good,"I enjoyed working with Ulta beauty in the beginning. Work environment was amazing and i loved working with my fellow associates and still do, but due to the poor decisions regarding management Ulta beauty has failed in  dealing the situations in a correct manner."
good,Great job for flexible hours and if you start at entry level there are a few opportunities to move up typically if you want to get into management level you have to be willing to relocate.
good,"Unnecessary, childish drama from grown women that are not in high school anymore. Never knowing how many hours you would work everyday (I've had 6 hour shifts-11 hour shifts).  Back and forth lies (mostly confusion) from my supervisor and management. I do not blame my supervisors what so ever."
good,"I went into the position thinking this would be my final career, little did I know that meant my family would have to sacrifice me in the bargain."
good,"I would color match shoppers for the desired makeup they were looking to buy, offer shopping bags to customers, answer any questions about any product a customer was inquiring about. I would sweep, take out trash, and wipe down counters after store hours."
good,"Ulta's internal culture has opportunities with management and diversity. They've made some strides during my tenure, however, still have a ways to go."
good,They have everything at your fingertips when it comes to beauty and always teaching on beauty products in the store. All ULTA stores are not the same.
good,"Being a licensed professional, they only pay minimum wage with a promise of making 44 % on bookings that follow through. They do not market so it is pretty impossible to make a living unless you are married or have a sugar daddy, forget it. There is no compensation/commissions on sales of makeup or skin care, had there been, the rating would be better. "
good,"Management was more suited for McDonald's. High traffic, easy sales goals. Gratis and lots of training available. No room for real advancement. The End"
good,Great benefits good medical benefits. Long hours stressful at holidays. Doesn't promote within the company. Good salary and great exposure to the beauty industry.
good,"The management team is very unorganized, the communication between managers and beauty advisor is terrible. This could be a fun work environment, but the management teams need to communicate better and improve their work ethic."
good,Job is okay. The enjoyable part about the job is that you're able to learn about different brands of makeup.  Wouldn't recommend to someone looking to move up in the company. Only are given decent work hours during the holiday season.
good,"Nice environment, very nice people, never had a problem with anyone.  There is just no stability right now as far as hours and days to work."
good,Got hired to work full time with benefits but was never told if salon budget was not met then hours would be cut. Minimum wage was hourly pay and no benefits were given.
good,long hours are expected.  Too many task without time to achieve results.  Micro management and threats of being written up or terminated.  Supervisors gossiping about other managers within the district and out of the district.  Very unprofessional environment to be in.  Would not recommend.
good,I have learned a lot working at ULTA over the past years but it is a very demanding job. They dont pay enough and the work is so much. Not for everybody.
good,Ulta is not a store you can grow in financially. Once you’re in there that’s pretty much all you’re going to make. You can learn great customer service skills here and how to handle different situations. But if you ever want to move up in the company it will more than likely never happen.
good,This company has favoritism. They take advantage of you with little pay. They have a habit of saying things you want to hear. They don’t Pompey with in
good,"Hours are fairly good but you have to work late, especially when doing truck. Pay is not near what it should be, but it is still reasonable for a part time seasonal job."
good,I am grateful for the experience.  I was only hired for seasonal help. I can not honestly answer the above questions because I didn't know much about company benefits because of being hired under Axiom.
good,"I LOVE working with makeup and helping guests. But I hate management and there is no opportunity for growth, it is all favoritism. They will not choose you, they will choose someone they already like. My general manager was hateful. Never greeting her employees and asking how they’re doing, always has a terrible attitude. It made me upset to see her after having a great day at work. She will only tel you YOURE mistakes,."
good,"I didn't mind getting paid a lot but if you like having a job outside of work, during the peak season this isn't a position I recommend. You'll have to work 6 days and 12 hours not much time to relax."
good,"The best part about this job was the makeup training classes every couple weeks (wish there was more though), the gratis of makeup (which later on became unfair), and the interaction with customers putting their trust in your hands and leaving thankful and ecstatic for your time.The worst part about this job was truck deliveries they threw everyone into that even though there are set employees on the schedule for that position. The hours - especially after the holidays were horrible. If the store couldn't hit its retail goal for the day which we almost never did every week at my store, they cant afford to have you there (or so that was the excuse?), therefore, leaving you with 10 hours a week sometimes even 5 hours a WEEK or sending you home halfway through your shift. The management was another bad thing here. They treated some unfairly and did not act as a manger should. They would act like you were their best friend and gossip about other workers to you. As a manager there is no exception for that behavior. Overall, if somebody were to tell me they were going to apply for Ulta beauty i would have them think twice."
good,"Ulta is a fun place to work at if you enjoy make up and helping people find products that work for them. However, at my particular store and with my particular management crew (I am a beauty advisor aka sales associate) we are pressured in an unhealthy way to meet credit card, loyalty, and sales goals. Sometimes I feel as though I am only a number to my managers and not a person with whom they have a relationship. It feels sometimes as if I am a failure if I do not get a credit card sign up or meet my goal for sales in a shift, I’ve voiced these concerns with management multiple times and nothing has changed."
good,Ulta was a great stepping stone for my cosmetology career but I would not recommend settling here. The company treats you so really replaceable and the pay is bad. There is a lot of drama with clients and employees and it’s a very high school environment. Ulta is a very penny pinching company and as a hair stylist you don’t get paid for the work you put into your clients and the hours are bad they don’t put you on a set schedule even if you have children.
good,"A typical day at work is normally really slow. Normally there isn’t much people, but it feels like a lot because its usually under staffed. Normally only one cashier and one person on the floor sometimes not even that."
good,"I was so beyond excited to work with Ulta, however at the store i was hired at i felt ostracized and ignored. I don't fit perfectly into a cookie cutter mold, but i am neat and professional. I am amazing with people and am great at starting conversation and making a customer feel included and happy. However, they barely let me on the floor, they kept me doing grunt work in the back for every single shift. And after two months and me speaking up about wanting to get on the floor and to learn more, I've been ignored and my concerns dismissed. I hope this only applies to the Ulta i work at, but i needed to be honest."
good,"Working at Ulta was just OK. The discount on makeup was basically the only fun part... NO one helped me learn anything. I constantly had customers ask me questions that I had no idea how to answer (And I am knowledgeable about makeup because I LOVE it). No one would teach me or help me. I basically had to guess to the customer. "
good,"they just put your out on the floor for you to figure it out, no training and it doesn’t matter how hard you try there is no growth there, customers are rude and the manager simply doesn’t care about her employees and there is favoritism which is absurd. The manager just sits in the back doing nothing and when she is on the floor she just tells u  what to do and maybe does a little bit of work like fix some products and that’s about it. They just make u feel useless and want u to multitask but is never enough for them, don’t work hereeee!"
good,"Okay so I have been working at ulta for a while but to be frank with anyone whos reading this , I felt like they need to work on training people. The store that i worked at had alot of unprofessionalism going on. They would just call me whenever they needed me which sucked because I cant keep cancelling plans. Also they never really properly trained me , they just threw me on a register and i had to work my way up from there. Good thing Im a fast learner , but some people arent."
good,Working in the salon was way too stressful. They set unrealistic goals. The managers do everything but manage. They sayd training is paid but I didnt receive paya and it's been 2 months since I drove from riverside to Mongolia 6 days for training. Great job for young people with no families.
good,I enjoy working at Ulta and the co workers are great. They didn't allow me the opportunity for advancement and steady hours as promised.  Also feel the pressure to make  sales on the floor was more important than making the customer happy
good,Lack of communication and teamwork. Manager wasn’t around often to give me my proper trainning. And I also didn’t like how every employee there had their own little groups and exclude other female employees.
good,"While the company's mission & core values are wonderful, the lack of accountability across management results in a poor culture in many stores causing a lot of turnover."
good,"A typical day at work, within my job title usually has to do with stocking, cleaning, organizing, getting the store ready for customers, and also for upcoming updates and changes. We are really pushed to make sure we make sales as well, and we have to make sure we are always meeting our company's goals, otherwise our hours can get cut. I've learned a lot within this company."
good,If you are on call you should just find another job. They don't even pay that much for full timers. It's just good to have the experience. They don't pay enough.
good,Ulta prefers to hire from within so it can be difficult to advance from the position that you are in. Workplace culture was rather cliquish and difficult to maintain friendships. Customers kept the store busy.
good,Not ideal unless you want to work your life away. Or that you want to work for managers that don't know what they're doing. I would not recommend this job to anyone that wants a life outside of work.
good,"For the pay, you work hard and produce. The pay is too low so mgmt suffer due to call offs...I loved my job there but felt the pay wasn’t enough for lack of balance or growth."
good,Corporate was too harsh and uninvolved in actual problems in the stores. They don't listen to issues at hand and they don't care. As long as you aren't a manager you won't have much to do with corporate. Would recommend it.
good,Ulta was fun. My co workers were fun. The management wasn’t they teamed up against you. They gave you poor hours if they didn’t like you. It was a horrible experience but I loved everything else about it.
good,"I wouldn't work there again, especially being in the industry for a while and you're coming back. Hours weren't too bad but then you couldn't really make a decent living"
good,Corporate has high demands for their stores and does not give each store the individual attention to reach these goals.  There is high turnover in management and that bleeds into the team. Low pay for the type of work expected.
good,"Never properly trained, unsure of hours, no communication, was never really sure who I answered too, nobody actually talked to me, texted me instead of calling, never listened and would schedule over leaping shifts with my other job.. some people were rude some weren’t. My job expectations were never clear. Never got to finish training. Never sure if they wanted me gone or just forgot about me. So many things wrong.. I was really looking forward to working at Ulta as it would have been my first job in the industry I wasnted- skincare. However my heart was crushed by that store. Absolutely crushed😞"
good,it’s a great place to work at if you love make up but it’s not worth getting little to no hours a week. managers always tend to have favorites and it shows. lack of work ethic and entegrady. unhygienic working environment we had to resell used items. the only good thing is product knowledge and that’s it.
good,Ulta  is a great opportunity to learn and have access to many beauty products. They do not promote the salon as they do their beauty products so there are so many people unaware of the availability of receiving salon services there unless they run across seeing the salon or are told personally by a client or service associate. Its a good place to work if you are newly starting out in the business.  Management has been an issue in maintaining one and making sure all intended procedures and processes are followed.
good,Hours are horrible working on holidays is MANDATORY but no holiday pay some management is okay others are rude.Good temporary job not to make a living
good,"although the beginning working there is fun, you quickly realize youll never do good enough. you could go above and beyond and it doesnt matter. gratis (items for doing well) is rarely given, it is so nice from the outside, but it is a miserable job experience. my experience was not what it was cracked up to be. emergencies dont matter t o management. you are expected to put Ulta above everything else in life, regardless of the situation. you are given unrealistic goals and penalized and scrutinized when you cannot meant them. i worked 8-10 hours a week for three months after being promised more. one week i didnt work at all. and even with the minimal amount of hours, they continued to hire more people."
good,Was not my favorite place to work. Management does not care about stylists or quality of work. Just want you to sell sell sell and get the client out of chair as fast as possible. Pressure you to do and sell when you're not comfortable and makes the clients feel rushed and uncomfortable.
good,Managers are not well trained and  tend to have favoritism with  some employees  to whom they  will be given more hours and  job advancements over other employees that have been working loner and have better  training
good,"all the employees were very cold. and very judgemental. none of them tried to train me or speak to me, they wouldn't help show me where stuff went diliberatly ignored me and kept talking about getting drunk the entire time I was there. they didn't make me feel welcome or comfortable at all. so I only worked one shift and didn't come back. they were all like real life mean girls. not enjoyable at all."
good,"I have worked for Ulta for a little over a year. When I first started, I had the best team and we all pushed each other to go further. Management is a nightmare! My first general manager was amazing but now I have a new manager and its really depressing now. They cut our hours, won't allow us to take any time off during the holidays, we're expected to harass our customers to make sure we make enough money for the store or else we get our hours cut. I'm literally working myself to the bone to work for a place that doesn't appreciate all my time and effort, including my blood, sweat, and tears. Its like they thrive on making you feel stressed out and just unappreciated and very underpayed. Its sad that instead of pushing us to move up in the company, they'd rather hire from the street to someone that has no experience whatsoever."
good,"The training is amazing at Ulta.  ."
good,if your looking for a job while in school or looking for something else this is your place. The job is easy and the hours are short and sporadic as there are no set schedules.  You could work 4-8 hours a day no telling. Management is lacking with all different opinions on rules. This is a drama filled zone! My suggestion is to take it if you need the money and keep looking for something else unless you just want the 25% product discount or 50% salon discount.
good,"Honestly I really love working for this company but my experience with the management and not making enough with the responsibilities I have to uphold, its got me stuck in a predicament."
good,"Good management can make a world of a difference. Was a fun part time job, but it was hard to get steady hours. It was like you had to prove yourself in order to get a decent amount of hours."
good,"Probably my least favorite job ever! So many rules and had some of my favorite lipsticks confiscated because the green dot rule wasn't really explained in my on-boarding. You think you get tons of free samples, but in my 7 months I got two free drugstore makeup items , and maybe 5 or 6 free ulta brand products upon hiring"
good,"Doesnt pay enough for everything they have you do, especially in the salon. management at some stores can be iffy. has tenancies to micromanage from time to time."
good,"This place is fun, but the girls are snotty and the management is unorganized. Plan to not have a life because you are at their beck n call at all times."
good,"When I worked at Ultra there was never any work. They were holding us up at the job for 11 to 12 hours, but we never had work. we constantly had to look for work to keep us busy."
good,"Its ok but don't expect many hours or advancement. Pay is very minimal and they waste product like it never even matters to them. corporate is ok, some of the management acts like you don't matter"
good,"ULTA was a place I thought that I would love to work. Maybe it was the location and that is is why I did not so much. I wanted to help people feel as beautiful as they felt on the inside and instead I rarely had that. "
good,"Stressful, unpleasant. The only rewarding thing were the customers and more specific the regulars that came in just for your service."
good,I loved the girls I worked with but there is no room to move up. Compensation is poor and I hated doing inventory. Inventory trucks would arrive at 6am which sucked in the winter.
good,I worked in the salon for over a year at a struggling store. I was one of five original employees and watched corruption everyday when it came to how the employees were treated/favored. A manager can continuously come to work drunk but an excellent performing employee gets terminated for showing up to work 2 minutes late during a snow storm? All I can say for this company is that everyone employed should document everything that happens while there.
good,"It was good and bad. When I was employed, they were unable to keep a descent and professional manager. I did hear they have a new lady working there;however, I went in there as customer. She treated me like she had no time for me. She was very rude and was more concerned about getting me ""out of her hair"" then actually taking five minutes to inquiry about a specific product!I've since moved on with a better company.I realize ""World Class Customer Service"". She treated me like ""below class customer""."
good,Upper management tried way to hard to get rid of previous manager's employees. Didn't appreciate what they had.
good,"I worked with 8 other stylists. It was a very busy and fast pace salon. I enjoyed my co- workers. the hardest part of my job was dealing with the ""higher end ' clients,they where very demanding. I love helping people be the best that they can."
good,"don't get used to one thing. they will change rules,regulations and expectations all with out a telling the employees. discount is nice but dose not make up for the lack of communication and constant put downs. "
good,"Ulta was a fun place to work because employee's got to test out all of the latest products. "
good,"I would answer phone calls from LTL carriers to schedule appointments for their deliveries. I learned how to navigate the SAP system, and Microsoft excel. Management was ok, and understanding. My co-workers were great bunch of people to work with. The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting new people, and speaking with them."
good,"Loved the company, and the co-workers"
good,Very fun work environment. Great management and a great team to work with. Everyone has positive attitudes towards customers and one another.
good,"A typical day at work involves collection money, customer satisfaction, rescheduling appointments, daily cleaning, answering phone, daily deposits, and scheduling weekly appointments."
good,"Employees are not valued. Ulta DC does not appreciate an honest days work because production is not based on how much volume you put out towards the workload, but instead bases your production on percentages which is input in the system manually and therefore can create biases."
good,If you love make up it’s for you management isn’t the best but that’s usually the case everywhere. You get to have fun which is nice But it’s not just lipstick like you think it is it’s sales and business
good,"The biggest perk of this job is the creative freedom you get with your makeup. However, the management in the willowbrook location was not ideal. They emphasized flexible hours, but when I set the hours I was available, they were often overlooked. When I brought this problem to the manager I was offered a resolution with no follow through. Besides that, the job is a pretty standard retail job, with the exception of occasionally being able to play with makeup."
good,A lot of work for bad pay it made it hard to come to work and be motivated when i knew it was a low paycheck. Management was poor aswell. A lot of favoritism.
good,"I was only at ulta for 5 months before I was let go due to points. I gained the attendance points by me being stuck in the ER for three days. I came back to work with a doctors note, my managers did not care one bit and still decided to write me up. Ulta has little no benefits for their employees, also the pay sucks and I had to fight to get a decent amount. While working for the short period of time I got to witness a high turnover rate .so overall I enjoyed the people I worked with just not the company"
good,"Ulta Beauty is a place to go when you are looking for anything cosmetic. They have the most diverse collection of Make-up, Styling tools, and personal grooming products. It's also the place to try the products before you buy it. Ulta beauty offers coupons and free products, specially during the holidays."
good,easy work. they were weird with gratis and didn't give it out a lot. A good starting job if you like to help people find makeup. they sometimes had incentives if you could sign people up for events or get them to buy something that was near the cash register.
good,"It was really weird to me that not only did every employee have to carry clear purses (I get that part, it's so no one steals) but then you can't leave the doors until a manager is available to check what's in your clear purse and sign you out. If they are gonna check bags why have to carry clear purses? I just felt it shows a lack of trust in employees. And if all the managers were busy sometimes you had to wait 30 min after you already clocked out to be checked and to get tips. If they are going to do that, whatever, but at least designate someone to do specifically that so people can leave right as they clock out, not have to stand waiting around!"
good,"Trying to sell people certain things, like credit cards. You will save money by signing up yes, but at a place like Ulta a person can get out of control. I don't want to help get somebody into debt."
good,Fine for part-time. Little to no growth opportunities even when management knows you're ready. It is all about timing here. Do too much to get paid too little.
good,"I worked at many locations and under many different managers; we have to give a lot for so little compensation, and while I did meet some genuinely wonderful people it was not worth it. I noted that one of the district managers made all her stores unbearable to work in and many managers and associates quit due to her micromanagement and overbearing tendencies. One of my favorite store managers had been with the company 10 years and left the company because of her. We were expected to give all of ourselves for minimum wage"
good,"There are many difficult tasks about this job. Not only are you working in a store with a bunch of women, but you are also told how to do your job by people who work in a corporate office and have no idea what the day to day looks like. I appreciated the job, but as a licensed Esthetician it was difficult to be satisfied in my job when management doesn’t know what my job ACTUALLY entails but they have to attempt to supervise me and corporate tells you have to do your job when they aren’t licensed themselves"
good,"At first I loved working there, but then I learned your hours depended on how many people you sign up for the loyalty program, no matter how good of an employee you were. My GM wasn't the greatest, her mood decided how the day was going to go. The pay there sucked, even when I was a manager. It might be okay for a first time job for a teenager but it's not a place I would recommend to stay at for a long time."
good,"There was always a lot of drama at my specific location. I worked with mostly women around my age and because of that there was constant catty drama. I did learn a lot about the makeup industry, but if given the chance i would never work for ulta again."
good,"I was excited for this job at first, but then quickly became uncomfortable with things that were going on. Human Resources was notified by several people about the goings-on, obviously I can't get specific in this review, but it was all to no avail. I was happy to have found something different as soon as I did."
good,"i did enjoy working here in the beginning, but as time has gone on i've only grown more aggravated. it doesn't matter how good of an esthetician you are, if you aren't making your sales goals (which are pretty unachievable, at least in my area) then you're constantly being nagged by managers. numbers are all that they care about, and thats not why i went into esthetics. i spend more time trying to sell products than woking on guests and it makes me unhappy. i leave everyday after not achieving my goal feeling like a failure. i am also constantly being told what i need to do differently by my prestige manager based on what my GENERAL manager is saying behind my back. she won't even come to me with these concerns herself. i'm always getting pestered to do tedious tasks that are not in my job description. not to mention one of my managers is always throwing mean jokes at me because she thinks it's funny when it's actually just inappropriate and disrespectful. i get treated like trash. but the people who have been there since the store opened NEVER get pestered, never get told what to do, never get talked to, never get in trouble for just standing around talking to coworkers (even if they do it everyday multiple times a day) where if i do it for literally 5 seconds i'm getting talked to about it. it's absolutely ridiculous. management puts everything on the hourly floor employees. i should not be treated the way that i am, especially as a licensed professional. also all everybody does is gossip. it's awful. it's reminded me why i hated high school so much. the only thing i've gained"
good,"Nothing was really wrong with the job, the only thing I would have a complaint about is the getting paid every 2weeks thing, I felt it was unfair to young people just coming out of high school"
good,"This job is great for college students who are on summer break and love the beauty world. If you are looking for a Job that will pay the bills, then I would try to apply for full time or work at the boutiques in the store."
good,"ULTA would be an excellent place to work if they would seriously get rid of some of their managers and HR Personel.  There is entirely too much favoritism within the company.  HR is NOT for the employees although they ensure to you that they are.  ULTA speaks on Diversity, but there isn't any.  There is a handful of Manager that are POC.  The female to male ratio in IT is extremely low. And although Illinois is an At-Will state, your years, dedication, commitment, and lively hood with ULTA does not matter.  If you feel bullied by your peers or management and you voice your concerns with HR, just be aware that you will be targetted and ultimately let go."
good,"I was a skincare specialist for Ulta. My entire job was about numbers and sales. The manager was HORRIBLE!  He was not encouraging nor helpful. He was new at managing a crew.  "
good,"Ulta was a fine place to work.  It wasn't exciting or some place I couldn't stand clocking out of, but it was a job.  Advancement didn't seem like an option, hours were often unreliable, but for a place to work between jobs it was fine."
good,"My location and several others have been called toxic by associates/managers I’ve met. Rarely is anybody promoted, they’d rather hire someone else from their literal neighboring establishments who have no experience managing. There’s a lot of favoritism at my location and poor HR skills if you’re not dealing with the hotline directly. The work itself is not hard (stocking shelves, cashier, helping people pick out makeup, planograms) but there’s no insensitive to meet our daily/weekly goals. Only a threat of being fired if you don’t assist in selling the chosen products or signing people up for corporate events. Converting non members (non frequent shoppers) into members via Loyalty program is another thing you will be fired for if you’re not in a certain percentile. You are expected to intervene when you see someone shoplifting regardless of if you feel comfortable/safe or not. You can not tell people who have earned “points” (individualized discounts) when they are able to use them because of your daily sales goal. Your shifts are just short enough so legally you are not owed a break, management flips out if you ask for a fifteen min paid break. There is usually only one associate on per shift so if you call out you deal with retaliation. If they don’t meet daily sales goals (or your store loses a lot of product in theft) in the beginning of the week they will cut your shifts at the end of the week to compensate for pay. There is no makeup based training for Beauty Advisors unless you’re in Prestige. Only prestige beauty advisors and managers receive gratis on a consistent"
good,"The management at the time picked their favorites. They were not very understanding when it came to scheduling needs (I worked part-time). If you had an opening shift, no one was ever on time to unlock the store, therefore you were late clocking in for your shift."
good,The GM I worked for made a typical day a pain. The GM hired countless of incompetent managers and work fell back on the employees. I just think upper management is what is going to make me want to leave the company.
good,"I learned quickly that retail was not the work place for me. People had terrible attitudes coming in, employees included. I stayed until I could find another job, but I do not think I would go back."
good,the management drives your work experience. you can either have a great day or a horrible day depending on which manager you have working. the manager at the ulta I had worked at was unprofessional. i had worked 2 jobs while working there and it was ultimately her inability to communicate with me about my schedule that made me quit.
good,"My personal experience wasn't a great one. "
good,I would work on sales the minute I got to work. Check my sales goal for the day. I would look up costumers names and numbers in my log and try to make contact with them throughout my work week mentioning new products or checking how the product they purchased was working for them.
good,"got free makeup alot. that's about the only good thing. Was a fun enviroment, Extremly busy especially on holidays but you do get first pick when new makeup comes in and a good discount specifically on salon."
good,Managers do not train new employees. You have to just figure everything out and ask what to do. When you enter you ask what you have to do for the day instead of being told.
good,"Looking forward to working for Ulta as I am into beauty consulting and enjoy it.  Definitely not enough hours and with it being 45 minutes away from my home, small increments of working hours offered didn't provide a financial benefit."
good,"I took the position as a ""beauty consultant"", expecting to work the sales floor. I ended up working mostly in stocking and back room duties as well as some cash register shifts. The culture is very snobby and stuck up, and advancement is practically non-existent, at least in the store I worked in."
good,"I could never get more than a few hours of work at a time, with days I worked being few and far between. I worked diligently stocking the shelves and reorganizing products, but was completely bored the entire time."
good,"It was a corporate job, and it was very much what you would expect from one policy wise. I would recommend the company to people starting out in their careers, but not to anyone already advanced."
good,I worked at Ulta for almost a year. None of my coworkers knew my name or talked to me. My typical hours for one work day were 4 or less hours a day and I never got more then 10 hours a week even after countless times of asking for a full time position here. I even applied as a manager and tried asking for education opportunities and was refused multiple times. Employees are always leaving so there are constantly new people working here with little training.
good,Working for ULTA beauty I have learned how important it is to have time management at any job. This enviroment was child friendly while fun for women to come in shop for all their cosmetic needs!
good,I did learn a lot at my time there. If you have a great General Manager and District Manger life at Ulta is better. Bad GM makes job miserable. Very fast paced stressful environment.
good,This was a subcontractor for Ulta direct. What I enjoyed most about  my position there was submitting proposals and bid approvals.A typical day consisted of challenges at any given moment
good,"No opportunity to growth. Unless you know someone who knows someone that can get you a management position. They do not work around your schedule. Barely any training. This is not a place to make a career out of,"
good,"I worked at Ulta Beauty for 2 days as a temp. While I was there I experienced an unorganized management and some very rude employees (including management). Although the work itself was okay, I was glad to get out of there when my time working there was done."
good,"Upper management constantly complaining about their job, complaining about who they had to work with. "
good,Not a good work place.  No hours and standing on hard floors. No traffic of customers . Great products. Nice store layout . Good network connection with vendors
good,"Working for Ulta was a fun environment, with great individuals unfortunately I had to step away from the company due to poor compensation. Was able to network with different vendors and make new connections!"
good,"Working for Ulta Beauty was meh. I think if management was better/more professional I would have had a better experience. Also, very little room for growth."
good,"Customers are entitled, rude, and the management has no real back bone to policy, so it can flip around and can make you look bad. Coupons and sales are complicated for customers to understand (of course no one knows how to read apparently in the first place).  Something happened with my management to where I was getting paid 9.50, and after working two years, people who were getting hired for 11.50, even though I had been encouraged to apply for management with how well i was working.Kind of a slap in the face.  I still got micromanaged after two years of service here. Its a lot of little things to learn, too, it's especially hard for new employees when they don't train much at all. So we have a lot of people who are just kind of winging it without any knowledge of what they're doing, so it fires back when they mistake any sales/coupon policies and misinforms customers."
good,The manager that I started with did not function as a manager and continually blamed the company and bad mouthed them constantly. Therefore making it challenging to work in that environment.
good,"everyone gets long wonderfully except for the manager and her favorites. They single people out and make those around them work harder to compensate for all the work they skip out on doing. If the manager were to be replaced with someone who care about people's well being other than her own pocket, it would be a better place to work."
good,This place is good to start off in the beauty industry. definitely  not a place i would want to stay at forever. The management at my location was not the best. i was constantly talked down to
good,"For a while I absolutely loved working at Ulta. I was a Makeup Advisor so I got to help people feel beautiful and further their experience with makeup. I ended up quitting because I was bullied by some girls I worked with and one of the managers, usually I have a thick skin but for a minimum wage college job, it just wasn't worth it. A woman in corporate would pick on me as well when she would come in for routine visits, it was a weird place to work."
good,"The women I work with are great people to be with. They are hardworking, kind, and great at what they do. My real problem with the company/location I work for is the hiring and management. They are careless with availability and you have to nag them about it. They hire inexperienced workers for management positions. Pay is okay but fairly inconsistent among workers of the same position. One of the lead cashiers makes 11.75 while the other only makes 10.50 for the same exact position. I was told starting pay was 10.00 6 months ago but now new hires are being told it is 11.70 while I still remain at 10.00. Overall I would say the work environment is positive but there are many many underlying issues. If you want a chance at a raise/promotion with this company don't expect much. It was a nice job if you ignore the problems but Employees are seemingly not their first priority."
good,Ultimately I loved my role. I did not love the new management. As a company Ulta has unrealistic expectations as far as tasking and hours go to get projects done and increase sales.
good,Ulta is a fast growing company. I feel that it is good experience for someone who may still be in school and needs a part time job. Its a great way to learn guest service skills. But as far as a career. They stretch their management team too thin and do not staff properly during during high volume times.
good,"management at my location was completely unprofessional and my skills made me feel over qualified for the position and pay so I decided to resign however my resignation was due mostly to the poor management which included unprofessional relationships with employees , special treatment, bad customer service at times, management specking unfriendly to employees, making employees feel like the cant return products like a regular customer has the right to, making employees wait 10-15-20 min's to check them out of the store even when leaving for a 30 min lunch break or 15 min brake etc. the list goes on.. work environment is extremely busy during peek hours and weekends how ever extremely slow outside of those days/hours."
good,"A typical day working at ULTA has many different factors. Every workday is not the same. Some days may be slow where there's nothing really to do and some days are very busy. I guess it can also depend on the location of the store. I learned some things from ULTA in regards to beauty products but for the most part I already had prior retail experience. Management was decent. The hardest part of the job is nothing really. Only you are doing is giving great customer service and selling beauty products. The enjoyable part of job is the employee discounts, the charities or monthly they organization part take in. I really wish the pay was better. Everyone is part time unless you are a manager or assistant manager. I have worked many of times long hours when people call out, Or I've been asked to come in on my off days. I was also apart of the task team. I think for those positions the pay should be reconsidered for those worker."
good,"As a Prestige Manager there was very little training from store management.  I would regularly be in trouble for tasks that I didn't know existed or had no training in. General Manager was extremely condescending, embarrassingly rude to customers, blind to her own faults, and used horrible grammar. Not exactly someone to set a positive example for the team. I would never recommend this store to anyone I had respect for."
good,I had fun when I first started working at Ulta but due to changes in management I felt that my interests with the company were not being met. For example I was only being scheduled to work two days a week with only 4 hours per shift. The drive for me to get to and from work is relatively long (about an hour or so away) and I wasn't making enough money even for gas. To me it would have been worth it more if I was scheduled more hours and was seen as more than just a temporary employee.
good,"Ulta gives you the opportunity to help your knowledge in cosmetics and skin care grow, they  provide you with tools to learn and they are put to the test on the sales floor. However the management is terrible and they have a very high turn over rate. Growing career wise with Ulta is a hit or miss; because so many employees come and go it may be easy to get promoted. "
good,"The manager focused on her self and stole clients. Never helped me move forward, just cut my hours down until i was working one 4 hour shift a week. the salon its self was great, it was the manager that made it difficult to work there."
good,"Strong company with great growth."
good,wasn't really excited about the people I worked with I was ignored and never trained properly breaks weren't announced and was always behind on all the work
good,Poor management and little room for growth. Treated as disposable and with little respect from customers and management. The only Saving Graces are the relationships that are built with co-workers over a shared loathing of job.
good,"Working as a MSC I was the lowest manager on the totem pole but had as much responsibility as the rest. Was only part time so did not get the same benefits but had to work just as hard, even harder, than the other managers. Company was not willing to help me transfer position when I moved out of state. HR prides themselves on ""CARING"" for employee but received absolutely no help nor felt cared for. General manager was the worst when it came to communication and refused to communicate any ""confrontational"" information."
good,"Typical day would be: clock in, get a rude stare from the manager, grab 5 boxes and throw them on a cart, be rushed by your manager to have every little peice of makeup out within 30 minutes. Not to mention, the makeup is a huge variety of brands and items so you must go searching all across the store for each individual item."
good,"Ulta is a great place to shop at but not necessarily to work at. Even as a cashier the expectations are high and the pay is low. I've asked for between 20-30 hours many times and still regularly get 5-15 hours, they keep hiring new people."
good,"Seems to be a lot of turn over, people don't stay very long. Management does very little to help with the exception of one or two, long hours standing in one spot. Ulta is all about hitting production rate even if that means sacrificing the integrity of the customers order and merchandise. Expect to much out of their employees. They bring in a lot of temporary employees and use and abuse them and then let them go. The temps do not make decent money but do the exact same job function and most work harder then the full time employees. I felt like a number and not a person. The more you give the more they want. A lot of politics also there, cliques and women being very nasty to other co workers and the behavior is not professional."
good,"This used to be a fun job, but no longer is due to management/personnel changes"
good,"Was not My Most Favorite company to work for , At the time there was no product Education or New to Position Training Program, No Real room for Advancement."
good,Typical day includs interacting with various guests with all different wants and needs. Learned about beauty and fragrance and product knowledge. Most enjoyable is the challenge of being a man in a store more geared towards women and products and the obstacles to overcome to connect with the guest. Hardest part of the job would be the first hand knowledge of how the products looks/feels from my point of view.
good,"My typical day at ulta is to make sure inventory is being displayed correctly, store resets and assist customers. I've learned so much about how to maintain great hair and skin."
good,The girls I worked with at Ulta where amazing. Working with management was a very difficult task. The Management team only cared about making numbers.
good,"Corporate in this biz has NO CLUE about beauty industry or the beauty salon! Corporate mostly doesn't even use the salon and it SHOWS! "
good,"A typical day at the salon is usually pretty hetic if you are over booked but when the day concludes you have been able to not only just fix, cut, color someone's hair. You have been able to touch someone's heart and make them feel better about themselves and provide professional knowledge about proper hair care."
good,"My experience with Ulta, has been a trying and unbalanced work environment. A typical work day consists of an unstructured work load. This unbalanced work distribution comes with chaos among departments. I have learned how a company is not suppose to act. The management team is untrained and unfamiliar with any level of tact treating employees, as if they are a second tiered citizen. Instead of encouraging growth and reinforcing a positive work environment, the management team belittles and micro manages. With no clear cut goal to go off of on what needs to be done. The hardest part of my job is to step into a work environment as unhealthy as the Ulta environment, and act as if nothing is wrong. I try my hardest not to allow the environment to effect the treatment of my customers. Finally the best part of my job is the commarderie among fellow employees though the management is strongly lacking any real structure. The fellow department employees do try to work together and structure some form of pleasant environment to make the best of a bad situation."
good,"I had two great managers in a row but when they both unfortunately left, the company seemed to just flood my store with the managers that other stores didn't want. One manager was fired from another store for coupon abuse and the other was notorious for treating employees badly. I have never had such a bad experience with managers. One even blatantly tried to frame me to get me written up. I reported all of this to HR and to the area manager several times and nothing got done! I have to say, Ulta on a store level can be a fun place to work depending largely on the manger. But I have found that upper management won't do anything if there are problems."
good,"All in all, great place to work. Loved my coworkers and that was the only thing that kept me there. Made min wage as a hair stylist, and my store was not busy enough for any real advancement or to even make commission. Called OSHA on my salon manager because she was putting bleach unlabeled in the bottles we used to spray down client's hair. Left shortly after that because I was not getting paid enough to deal with any of that."
good,"Whenever anyone asks me, I say it's great for people who dont have to pay bills. It started off great but it's a hard place to grow in if you're not in the loop! Great discounts and at most times a fun environment."
good,It was okay for peak season they have a lot of vto the breaks are short it’s a paid 30 minute lunch you can’t listen to music while working they are very strict on their production rate
good,"the other employees are great, however management at the location i was at wasn’t really the best... it was very two facey and just didn’t make sense."
good,"The Ulta location that I worked at had a very toxic general manager. She was finally fired, but I was disappointed with the way that Ulta's HR department handled our complaints. Her actions should not have been tolerated and she continued to create a very negative atmosphere to work in while they deliberated and collected ""evidence."" I hope that Ulta handles similar situations in the future better. Other than that, I didn't have many issues with the job... I enjoyed the industry and working hands-on with customers."
good,"Favoritism was huge"
good,I loved being able to connect and talk to the guests on the floor. Wether it was helping find their correct shades or recommending skin care products based on what they've told me about it; its a very fulfilling career. The only negative aspects of it was obviously rude customers but also the management and their scheduling. Also the fact that Sephora employees get paid much more for dong the same thing.
good,The hours sucked for part time people. If you plan on making this permanent don’t Bc you only get one or two days a week. And you don’t get paid a whole lot
good,"You never know what you're going to get at Ulta. There are some associates that care and want to help, and then there are others who prefer to work the clock and then leave at the end of the shift. Also the pay is unfair, you can have one associate that works multiple tasks and gets paid less than the other person working one task."
good,Ulta is a good place to find great deals on products!! Although there are occasions where some newer clients feel intimated that they have to purchase products they aren’t familiar with or don’t normally use
good,"I was also working a second job while working here, and they never worked around my schedule. I was constantly having to tell them I couldn’t work specific days even though I gave them my other work schedule. I was a seasonal position and had to work on Thanksgiving but didn’t get holiday pay (usually time and a half) I made $9.25 an hour on thanksgiving night"
good,"Doing hair at ulta required more retail service then I expected. It was a very corporate job, the most enjoyable thing about working there was the friendships I made along the way."
good,Ulta has MAC which is a great brand and business driver. The Benefit Brow Bar is also unique and gives a boutique feel to a guests shopping experience.
good,"Company in itself was great. However, beauty advising for me was Part-Time. I needed more hours because of my previous experience but definitely did not receive them. Favorites between beauty advising associates was prominent. Some would get more hours and favors based on who they were."
good,I loved my job there but they wanted me to pick up more hours that i could not work. I only worked part time so i did not get any special package deal for work. The training sessions were great and building tool to keep up on new skills
good,"I was very excited to work at Ulta when I first got the call, but it isn't everything you would expect. There are a lot of days where it is hard because the pay and benefits isn't that great. The GM is not very good with communicating."
good,They never told me when to go into work one day and they gave me a write up and this happened a lot because the manager never communicated with me about that
good,"As a GM you will learn every expect of the business from Operations, to HR Management, Hiring, Salon, Sales, Merchandising, Payroll, etc.,. You will have no work life balance. You will get to watch people put merchandise in their bag and run out the door regularly. Your shrink will be high. Your DM will not support you and like most of your peers, you will feel expendable. The turnover in management is obscene because Ulta is great at recruiting but not at maintaining its leadership. Great perks and bonuses if you make sells . Lots of gratis. And annual conference is fun."
good,No education or benefits.  Its literally just a job.  Only thing good was gratis and discounts but we dealt with a lot of theft and low morale among co workers.  Never wanted to go when scheduled to work.  I was a hairstylist in the salon and it was awful. My manager was amazing but the culture is nowhere I'd wanna be.
good,"after you work for the company for a while management starts to expect more from you when you get paid nothing, they are not understanding of you having a personal life, and do not take your feelings into consideration."
good,"Fun working with so many brands of makeup, hair, and fragrance. You have the opportunity to learn a lot there.The is not too much hands on times however you are always staying busy."
good,"Parts of the job are really fun, like doing brand events and learning people skills for retail, but there's no room for growth. Put in years worth of work for a position to not even be considered an option to apply. Loved the helping the costumers out though."
good,They had hands on training for new trends twice a year. The company  was a little stressful because they require a specific amount of money for the week.
good,its retail and you can expect to work long hours. and be under paid . Staffing was all over the place. little contact from DM and managers come and go all the time
good,Loved working with my coworkers. Management was ok. Worked there for over a year and hardly got a raise after being the only person working in my position for a while and having to work a ton while still in college.
good,"In the ECom department, they play very obvious favoritism and if you aren’t one of them nobody cares about you. I had to fight through two supervisors to be hired on after almost a year of being a temp, and now that I got a Trainer position they still act like I’m not there and tell others to not listen to me. Very dramatic work environment and even if you talk to nobody you still get dragged in somehow. You will often work overtime, and you do not find out if you do til 3pm (for 3rd shift) THAT DAY when your shift would have to start at 6:30. Very bad environment and the only good thing is the free stuff."
good,"Working at Ulta was very difficult. The management was terrible. The assistant manager bullied the employees that she didn’t like. If you leaned on the counter for even a second, you would be yelled at. It was hard to even get a break."
good,"Mismanaged workplace, they were always cutting hours and tried to shove managerial responsibilities on lesser employees without compensation. learned a lot about makeup."
good,"minimal training, all about hitting numbers, you must drink the koolaid to get ahead in this company. managers unwilling to help but quick to correct or threaten if you didnt make your sales"
good,"Working at Ulta was great, the day would start off by organizing the aisle of products which contains hair, makeup and skin products. Since my position was a cashier I would mostly be there checking out customers. This was my first job so it was difficult for me at first to work at the register; however I got the hang of it quickly than I thought I would. I enjoyed providing information to a customer about a product and seeing them happy about their purchase."
good,"You will run into a lot of egos and poor attitudes. I was working cross-functionally with many departments in my role and came across a lot of funk. I’m a firm believer in “it’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.” Aside from dismissive and disrespectful peers there is also a lot of cattiness which is sad because I would expect better from such a prestigious organization. Lastly, upper management is bad at what they do. When there’s high turnover in your department, take that as a sign. Also, the coffee sucked and there’s rarely free food."
good,"Ulta provided me great growth in the makeup industry. I worked my way up as beauty advisor to a Lancome counter. I loved my job and helping guest choose the right products. The biggest con of working at ulta is the employees and managers. I read a lot of reviews when I applied at ulta and thought nothing about it until I was in their shoes. Many of the girls and boys that are hired at ulta are very young. Majority are in college or had just graduated from high school. A lot of the work environment is he said she said conversations. The managers are not any different. Trust me, I thought maybe it was only at my first store. Ive worked at two ultas in my life. I can say both stores had the same con. I think working at ulta brings a lot of good things, you meet vendors and big people who work for high end brands. I think it's a great way to get your foot in but be prepared to face a lot of challanges."
good,My manager was terrible. I was under the impression that I would get to play in makeup all day and be creative. There is no freedom in dress. My manager told me to take my hat off one day when I was wearing a head scarf. Employees have to clean bathrooms. Long standing periods. Can not wear sneakers.
good,If you love beauty products you’ll love working here. Make sure management is in order before working here. Apply as prestige beauty advisor because they have more benefits. Normal beauty advisors do the dirty jobs.
good,"You are not really allowed to do makeup on other people. All you do is stock the store, help people, and cashier. This job is not worth the drama or the pay ."
good,"Not a terrible place to work, but not the best. There is a lot of drama, and a lot of petty people, the salon is pretty slow a lot of the time........."
good,"For me and the location I worked at, management was awful and I hated going into work with the stressful workplace. What helped was being friends with other coworkers."
good,"First job working a cash register, but they took their time and made sure you knew what you were doing. Good training but too little hours after the holidays."
good,I like working here and the people are great but the management sucks. they Overhired people and don't give their employee's enough hours. Most employees work a maximum of only 4 or 8 hours a week
good,"I liked working there, I had only wished for more hours and a busier salon. Not many knew that there was a salon there. Being able to learn new products and retail as well as getting gratis was a cool perk."
good,"Working at Ulta was great. However, my location had poor management with low pay. Working there was fun, I got to help many customers find their perfect match, as a makeup lover it was great. However, the management time made work dreadful."
good,"Ulta has great benefits and employee discount for someone when this is not their full-time gig.  However, my experience as a manager for several years showed how poorly managed the company is at the store level.  Employees are underpaid and when compensation is evaluated, raises are all based on a scale - I was once offered a 20 cent raise.  20 cents!  They create a culture of distrust and lack of employee value.  I would not recommend working for Ulta as a full-time employee unless you are out of the stores."
good,"I loved working with the customers, showing product and playing in the makeup!! I loved the Store Manager and enjoyed some of my staff BUT if one manager was terrible it ruined it for everybody...it’s hard to explain but everyday was a challenge."
good,"it was good while it lasted, has a lot of personal issues going on in my life and i needed to take a break from a lot of the noncense, fun place to work though"
good,Ulta is very cheap but they make millions off of their employees. We should be paid more and also have a better budget for allocating hours to provide better coverage on the floor.The pressure to make numbers and credit takes away the ability for us to give great customer service. Pressure just causes a stressful environment.
good,"The typical day is checking out customers, helping customers find what they need, matching foundation, getting items from the backroom."
good,"They could definitely benefit from hiring people who actually care about their job. It makes it difficult to get your work done when other people don't do theirs. Your ideas for the company and your individual store are overlooked because they have their own ideas for merchandising and product placement. They do not listen to suggestions of brands to procure and do not pay attention to individual stores' clientele to decide who gets to carry which brands. The discount was decent and the insurance is average. They do not offer any way for you to be creative; it's more about following protocols and not having to think anything out on your own. It is nearly impossible to have a life outside of work. The turnover is so high that it's always short staffed. You have to have completely open availability for management, which means you can't go to school or be involved in any other programs."
good,"a typical day at work at ulta was chaotic and unorganized, i never really knew what was going on, on manager would tell you one thing and then another manager would say something different."
good,Ulta seems like a great environment until you realize you have to do every aspect of what it takes to run the store. I was a guest coordinator for the salon and I was required to do my job and be a sales associate. there was too much I had to do on a daily basis that I was very overwhelmed all the time. management also almost everyday accused you of stealing makeup if the product was approved by them to wear. overall not a fun place to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working for Ulta, but when management changed and policy and procedures where no longer applied, I was very disappointed. It is extremely confusing and disheartening when you work for a company that uses it's policies as a free-for-all, and you never truly know from day to day."
good,"1: A typical work day at ULTA. You will come in and before you head out on the floor they wold talk you about our goals for the day. Unless they where busy then you would have to go up front and look on the clip bored. Presage isn't t supposed to help the cashier, but if they are under staffed then they will call you over to help check out.  In presage you will clean the products and the shelves. Restock, do planograms, help and answer any questions that will come your way."
good,had fun learning all the new ways they ship there items management  was so unfair and poorly trained. the employs however help when they see you having a hard time
good,Working at Ulta at times was very enjoyable. Having the discount made working there worth it.  The management could have been a little better organized. For example one manager would tell me to do something and then another manager would assign the job to someone else. There was also no consistent hours except around the holidays. Which they expected you to work unrealistic hours especially if your fellow coworkers called out frequently like mine did. Overall working at Ulta was a great part time job while being a full time college student. I would have loved to stay with the company if there was room to move up in the company. If you enjoy makeup and don't need a stable paycheck this job would be a good fit for you.
good,"Overall, the job was fun and challenging with a great staff. The main issues that came up dealt with the management staff, and they were the reason I ultimately left the company. The management staff has since then been changed for that particular location."
good,Working at the brow bar they aren’t fair with the hours. Shifts are suppose to rotate between each arch expert but it doesn’t so I don’t think it’s fair to always have the late shifts. You have to travel to attend classes I was never told that while interviewing and I’m not interested in traveling for work. Nothing but drama in this store. If you have no clients you just stand around all day. Unprofessional and tend to use foul language endlessly.
good,"Only Hires part time with minimum wages with the promise of full and does not fallow through with guide lines , Promise more pay yet keeps you at part time pay. Employees are allowed to acquire your clients that you had built and makes harder for that employee to build."
good,"Its okay job, I love makeup and hair but how this company is ran and how they treat their employees is different. I think they need to be there and support the stores more and give bigger payroll budgets."
good,"Ulta is a fun place to work, but it's not a career choice unless you are management.  There are no real challenges as every day is the same.  It is a very easy job and fun for young people."
good,I worked for the Thanksgiving and Christmas rush.  I liked the other associates that I worked with.  They were very helpful and gave me a some feedback on my performance.
good,The local store and current GM was always playing favorites not to mention everyone knew who was getting in trouble and for what reasons. She could never keep confidential information confidential. Some of the employees talked down to management and because they were favorites of the GM nothing was ever done about it. Until the GM is replaced I wouldn't recommend working there.
good,"Joliet GM Chanelle doesn't even follow the dress code constantly wearing brown/taupe shoes. In order to get you to leave without letting you go or firing you, they just don't schedule you or give you 4 hours a week to make it impossible to want to stay there."
good,"I didn’t care for working here. Some of the girls I worked with weren’t friendly and a 15 minute break after standing on your feet for 5, 6 hours is nothing. Dress code was strict. Wanted to work on the sales floor more often."
good,"Ulta has some good points, you get to see latest makeup and get a discount.  Ulta's top Management only cares about numbers. I have worked in 2 stores and witnessed many things. Very sad. Better Managers should be hired. One store near Chicago lost 15 employees due to a very non caring GM. This occurred in a 4 month period."
good,"None to really go fully into detail and elaborate on at the moment. "
good,"The other employees weren't friendly, the boss didn't bother to learn my name and referred to me as ""new girl"" for several weeks, the training videos were extensive and not helpful because i was required to do them after i had already worked register so it was pointless, and the new employees got stuck doing the work that the other employees just didn't want to do."
good,There’s not opportunity for advancement. The managers are all over the place and it’s jusy a sloppy mess. The new  gm at the baybrook location is a nightmare. You’re never doing enough there and get no positive reinforcement.
good,"Co workers were very fun to work with, good environment, easy to learn responsibilities and great discounts. At the time there was poor management  and my shifts were constantly cut short or cut completely."
good,"This is a very stressful, and much like high school oriented workplace. Supervisors and HR do not handle situations accordingly. Hours are scheduled 10 hours but can change very last minute either being less or more hours. Making plans outside of work for personal life and children very difficult"
good,"After many years with the company, and working within management as well during that time, some of the changes that have occurred within the company have been a detriment to the business especially within the salon community."
good,it was an okay place to work managment at the time wasnt at its best and there were a lot of problems but over all it was fun here and there and i met great co workers
good,"I love working for ULTA, this is the second one I've worked. But, my general manager is mean and very moody. She also plays favorites. She walks around unhappy all the time. All the employees think she doesn't like them. She is also always complaining about her job. It makes for a very difficult working environment. Things would be better if she wasn't there."
good,"A typical day would begin with a start up meeting and telling the department and employees what there job was for the shift and how many hours we were working for that shift. I did learn a lot while I was in this position and got more knowledge with computers and files and expectations for a quality control position and what to expect with the product.the working culture was very mixed .the hardest part was learning how to drive a order picker but then after a while I. Begin to. Love being in one and driving also , the worst part of the job was the bullies."
good,"good and fun at first until management gets overly demanding, they expect you to do a thousand things at once. And you get barely any raises or bonuses"
good,i really thought i was going to be taught skills and knowledge about the millions brands that we carried in the store. I was also really looking forward to training we never got to do.
good,"Pros - Good discounts,. nice co-workers, great direct Manager who cares about her direct reports."
good,I grand opened a new store and stayed for over a year. The amount of traffic was so low that it wasn't enough customers to service. It was hard to find people to do services on.
good,"Management didn't have enough time to give, and when store productivity was low management sent you home. Promise to give more hours but would take it away because of low productivity. Some workers were not responsible and unclean. Not profesional and talked about clients making me uncomfurtable."
good,"Most days are spent walking the floors and making sure that people aren't stealing, unfortunately. I love when there is actually time to help guests with their needs and really created an experience for them."
good,Overall great for makeup junkies but is not a long term place to work. Pay low for the amount of work asked for you. Can be a fun environment depending on management.
good,"a typical day at work was tasking, cleaning the front counters. Answering phone calls. Talking/helping out customers. Having regular customers request your service. Friendly to customers. "
good,"it was an okay experience at first , it was a little to catty and high school for me . the hours were not the best and I had a 35 minute communte for only 8-10 hrous a week,"
good,I loved my job and what I did but the unprofessional acts of management around me and the unwillingness of my District manager to act on anything is disgusting.
good,"Ulta Beauty is a fun work place, however as an Assistant Manager and OPS lead my work experience was horrible. I have devoted everything to this job and i never felt appreciated for my work instead i felt like i was always looked down on and even though i have exceeded all my goals in sales and customer service it was never enough. My personal life and work life was never balanced the way it should because i always had to compromise for my store manager.If i did not i felt like my job was at risk. It felt like my job was at risk no matter what."
good,"Helping clients with sales, returns and exchanges. Being able to quickly stop what you're doing to help assist a customer, also being knowledgeable about products."
good,"I worked for the Ulta in Albany, NY and had a pretty good experience. However I had a terrible experience on Staten Island, NY. Basically if your loyalty (data capture) isn't 80% or higher, you lose hours and lost opportunities to advance (even if it is from beauty advisor to prestige beauty advisor). Don't sell yourself short, apply for the higher position cuz they hire anyone from the outside but it will take forever to be promoted from within."
good,"They have challenges with floor coverage,  and at least at my store, hired people that were not educated in cosmetics.  They hired for cashiers and unloading truck."
good,"I loved the job at first.. you have spurts of being busy, but mostly you have to find things to do. I was the esthetician, but I was always stocking or arranging platforms. Not what I'm licensed to do. The management needed work, but wasn't horrible."
good,Working for Benefit has been a great experience and I have learned a lot but Ulta as a company I feel does not treat their employees the best and the compensation in the end does not add up to all the hard work put in. I feel like there is no room to grow as well. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers as well as my clientele.
good,"Ulta is an awesome place to be, everyone is equal as a customer and you can find all you need all in one place , which is the main concern for the company!"
good,"Seasonal hire. Corporate does not allocate training hours for new hires, so had to learn mostly on the job. Morning shifts may include restocking boxes of products on shelves or changing displays before the store opens. Lots of micromanaging, which makes it frustrating for employees when they're being talked down on. Only enjoyable part of the job was the 25% discount."
good,"Over all, the environment isn't bad. My issue was with the store manager and hours. Don't work here with the idea it'll be stable. Its not. No hours and when you do have them, they will take it away. More of a place to work as a hobby, not as a place to sustain a life."
good,At the beginning we were getting the store ready to open and there were plenty of hours. After the store opened they dropped everyone down to 5 or 10 hours a week.  The management were the only ones getting 40 hrs a week.m
good,"I was a stylist at the salon at Ulta as my first job after graduating cosmetology school. It was a fun place to work and I feel like I got a lot of experience in a little bit of everything while I was there. I started with Ulta when they first opened the rookwood location.  "
good,"As an associate manager for Ulta I found that I loved my job and with the right attitude and support so did my associates. However the disconnection between corporate/ District management and store level is appalling. The fact that they provide slim to no payroll for floor coverage but expect management and Associates alike to prevent theft almost as if that is their only role is totally unrealistic and frankly leaves the customers with the short end of the stick. Ulta does not care about its customers and I'm sure you could walk into any store and any location and see that that is true. There is also zero respect from upper management to store level management. The way upper management talks to store level management is incredibly unprofessional not to mention a human resources nightmare, that is if Human Resources ever got back to you even the most miniscule of concerns. I also need to mention that in the last 6 months that I worked for Ulta, I worked through almost every single meal and break and they constantly had me use my own personal cell phone for work purposes  (taking and sending pictures, emails, texts etc) both of which are totally illegal in state of California."
good,Working with makeup and helping guest was great but then I noticed how much disrespect there was between coworkers and costumers. Very unprofessional!
good,"The store atmosphere with all the beauty products and services were every girl's dream, but the manager was my biggest problem.  Seemed to have a lot of drama when the new manager took over last year."
good,"When I began working at Ulta I loved it, when a new manager came into our store everything went downhill and it was not a good work environment at all"
good,"While I enjoyed most of my time at Ulta, the company hasn't been the same since I got hired. Lots of gray areas in their policies and not heading in right direction. Company focuses on things that we cannot control on a store level, and doesn't take employees opinions to heart. Debt free company because they do not compensate their employees fairly."
good,the people great. The management was not accomodating when i came to life events or any type of time off or possible schedule changes. No real room for advancment.
good,"For anyone that loves the beauty industry, Ulta is a fun place to work. It takes a dynamic personality/leader to work there because you are required to accomplish many tasks in all areas of the business with a very limited amount of payroll. In my retail experience, I have never worked for a company that alots such little payroll yet expects the store to accomplish spectacular results! Overall, its a growing company with opportunity to grow in house too. Ulta has a lot of potential to improve culture from within and I think they are on the right track to get there."
good,"This job was only temporary and I knew that going into it. It was a good place to work and I made good money, but the hours were long and 3rd shift was hard"
good,they are trying to improve processes and spending money on IT projects. Just recently started using electronic filing system.
good,Made it very hard to do my job professionally. I felt like I was in high school and i was walking on eggshells all the time. I got of and worked everyday of the weekend. it was hard to have a life outside of work. I loved what I did but it was just too catty.
good,"Some of the management talks to you like your a child and your job isn't as important as theirs. The ""check"" point before you leave makes you, the employee, feel as if you need to walk in and out with NO clothes on b/c they search you like your a thief all the while they let the REAL thieves run out the door. Everyone seems to always be frustrated about their job or life. They have high expectations for a low salary. Didn't end on a bad note, just needed a place to work where I could get more hours, and better pay."
good,"Typical salon duties."
good,"Open and close the store. Cashier, have guests sign up for rewards cards. Color match, give makeovers. Find colors that blend with guests faces. Know about each brand of makeup, and skin care. Know about sales, Add ons, GWP (Gift with purchase) and salon services. In charge of truck when scheduled for it. My favorite part of the job was not only the makeup, but I love helping those find what they need. I am a big peoples person, and seeing the look on their face, and that wonderful communication with them makes them come back. I love being the reason why a guest comes back."
good,"I was so excited to work here, the store is amazing and has everything you could possibly need, but from day one there was complaints about the Manager, i was promised 20-30 hrs a week and most of us only got 6-10hrs a week. she was rude and condescending, even while you were doing your job. If they ever change managers, I would gladly go back."
good,"Manager of a retail cosmetic store, applying and teaching guest about make up."
good,"The store is very big varying in products from hair to skin, and then to make up. There was a lot to keep up with and rules changed. Management could have been better at knowing their duties and enforcing the same rules for everyone about everything. There was a lot of favoritism and uneven distribution of hours. There could have been a better outcome for extreme situations between employees and customers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day is just the fact that its an environment which I love such as, customer service, one on one consultations. Team work is a plus always makes the day much more enjoyable"
good,"This place is a hostile work enviroment constant backstabing, and bickering people cant wait for you to fail. Its so sad not to mention hard to tell when you walk into the front doors to the fake Hi's, and over excitement that they are forced to put on."
good,"Employees are great, but management needs to be a bit tighter."
good,"Nice place to work however many co workers would talk behind each other back, not address problems, and unfair favoritism."
good,There is no support. Rarely get lunches or breaks. No work life balance. No upper management suport. There is no accountability which means nothing gets better. The company promises Associates and doesn't follow through makes for a very toxic environment to work for
good,"Not a great work life experience, but fun and I learned new skils. Professional management made it difficult for work/home life balance, as well as an unprofessoinal work style."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time working at Ulta. I love makeup so getting the opportunity to work here was fun and I loved getting to talk to customers and employees about new launches. Like any other retail job, it were on you and that's what happened here. If there was a better management team maybe it would have been more manageable but unfortunately that was not the case here."
good,"Managers were known to speak very poorly of associates, however... that is not corporate's fault. Just a regional/district issue, it seems. Helping customers was great though!"
good,"Working here was good as my first job. You get some free gratis sometimes and get to see the new products when they come out. You get a 25% employee discount which is great. Some brands offer an extra discount for employees sometimes so you can get good makeup for cheap. Those things were great. However, hours are not the best. Only a handful are full time. Managers, prestige positions, and the lead cashier. Otherwise all are part time so it could be better. I only ended up working a few days a week. Not enough money was made but otherwise was okay."
good,"A typical day at work was exhausting. You were not only in charge of front cashiers and your duties, but some responsibilities of other managers. When you were responsible to complete the task of another manager's, it had to be done before you had to leave."
good,The hours are a pretty horrible depending on the location. You need 2 jobs working at Ulta. But it is flexible. Where I worked some co-workers can be catty and gossip about you especially in a small setting.
good,Typical day of work was packing items to go to stores. Making sure all items are packed correctly so they will not arrive to their destination damaged.
good,"no work  life balance, you get great discounts, but I find that their is a lot of back stabbing and petty gossip within select stores. You ask for support but it's not given"
good,Doing skin was fun. Commission is not what you make which is nothing. Customers are great. Management needs more training in how to talk and take care of the employees.  It's not bad company to work for. Ulta has a late points system so make sure you are to work on time. If you are in a busy store then it's a fun work day. Best wishes.....
good,"Starting off, I loved it. I loved the employees, I loved the products, I loved learning about new products. However, being a part of the shipment team sucked. there were never enough employees to stock anything so we could be there until 3 a.m. when we should’ve left at 12 am. this location loves to gossip. the manager isn’t a very good manager honestly. they liked to hire lots of people but never have enough hours for them which is the reason I had enough."
good,"I am so glad to have been able to start my retail career at Ulta. As a makeup lover it was great to be around something I was passionate about all day and share that knowledge with other likeminded guests. However, I did have a lot of problems with management, having to move and commute 2 1/2 hours round trip to go to work and it sucked that I wasn't ever able to be transferred. I would love to work for them again!"
good,The job isn't that bad but it doesn't give you adequate hours or pay. The schedule changes ALL the time after it's already been posted. Sometimes the day before your shift it will be completely changed. I was told this was due to Kronos. Not sure how that makes sense. The management acted like they were gods and you were peasants.The employee discounts were great and I would get a lot of gratis (free product). I would recommend working here if you need a little extra money but it is definitely not a place to work if you have bills to pay.
good,Corporate management is in constant flux and goals/ideals change almost weekly.Senior managers often come from the field with little to no idea of their new corporate position. Despite this there a lot of hardworking people in the field teams and corporate level pushing through.
good,"fairly decent clientele, poor management, competitive coworkers, retail position responsibilities, "
good,Good and Bad.  Just need to find your right fit and know the right people.  Lots of politics.  It was an amazing experience but they demanded a lot.  Work life balance was a joke.  It's a great job for a career driven person who can talk the talk and kiss the right bottom.  If you want a family life you can have the beauty of Ulta life.
good,Ulta is an amazing store with great beauty products.  The over work culture is good but management fails to teach safety and other general duties to avoid some situational issues.
good,"Overall working at ULTA is a great start in wanting to work in retail. If you enjoy beauty/cosmetics, this would be a great place to work and to learn."
good,"This was a great starting point for me as I had my license for years and had not been working in the beauty industry.  I love esthetics and was glad for the opportunity to get the training provided.  If you are single then this is a great atmosphere to get your feet wet; however, if you have a family trying to get the hours to work for your personal life is difficult.  Luckily I had a management team that understood and I was able to work there and an FT paying job.  Please be advised, even though you are trying to build clientele and experience, you also must meet a quota $$$$.  Unless you are Sales pushy uh savvy, then be ready."
good,"I experienced a lot of overtime, but not enough to compensate for the low wage I was being paid. Benefits and insurance were not an option for part time associates. Part time associates at my store were scheduled just below the shift required to get a lunch break, so we did not receive breaks a lot of the time."
good,Training was all over the place and was more so thrown out to learn it on my own.. felt no support from team when learning. Company seems to have potential to have it together but too much unnecessary back office work and keeping management off floor. Would not recommend working here
good,"We went through many managers within the few months I worked there, including GM.  You are required to use see-thru purse and be checked out by manager before leaving the store."
good,"Ulta was a fun place to work, however, there was never any time allocated for extra training on cosmetics, skincare, haircare etc., which is difficult when selling to customers. The GM at my location, and the DM were a joke. There is never opportunity for advancement because you are simply told you are not qualified (without any discussion of why), or were never informed of open "
good,"I worked in a few Ulta locations and your experience depends on your managers as well as corporate. If you have a manager that is enthusiastic, motivating and takes their available time to help you grow in the company then you are guaranteed a great experience. If not, unfortunately you may encounter a manager that will inadvertently neglect your needs to stay with the company. I and many others have had issues with being promised a promotion only to be given by someone with less experience so it can be very discouraging and frustrating. The pressure from corporate goals tend to be stressful which can sometimes cause an hostile work environment. I did have great experiences on training and learned a lot about makeup applications as well as products to sell for our customers. The manager was also very accommodating when I was pregnant. Of course working in retail you will encounter difficult customers and thefts but I admired the teamwork we demonstrated to help solve any and all issues. Overall it has been a decent experience but it ultimately depends on your managers and corporate."
good,"It was an okay job. Management needs work. Basically just a standard cashier job, that requires you to help customers and stock the store. Nothing special."
good,I learned a lot of interesting skills while I was working for Ulta Beauty.  I enjoyed helping costumers and giving aspiring makeup artists new tips. It was a great time!
good,"Typical day clock in quick ""chat"" about sales goals for store and prestige side. They would go over and promos, brand goals, tasks to complete etc.  "
good,"The work environment is very toxic.  I felt under appreciated, while giving all I had. The job also didn’t give many opportunities to advance or hire within. The culture is also very lazy."
good,"Answering customer and store call"
good,"My job consists of scanning boxes to totes at 86 boxes/hour. Sometimes you get big bulky boxes which could take up to 4 minutes each to work. Management doesn't even care how long it takes as long as you still meet rate. I remember one manager trying to do the same work and walked off because he couldn't meet rate himself. So they set high expectations for the workers while supervisors and managers get to relax and look at their phones when they aren't needed 60 - 75% of the time. Also they remodeled a warehouse to support only e-commerce; now only 4 warehouses cover all the retail stores in America, which is well over 1,500 now. Plus don't expect to move to a better department fast; if you get a single point for anything you're locked to that department until it falls off."
good,Not enough opportunities for advancement. Human Resources and Loss Prevention miss opportunities to improve policies by not supporting and encouraging a safe environment to report issues.
good,Great place to learn about both more expensive makeup and skin products as well as value priced items. Management makes it very clean that there is potential to grow in the company.
good,"This job is great for college students, MUAs who are trying to build their kits because of the discount, and individuals that want to get a start in retail to obtain a job somewhere else. It is stressful gotta be good at hitting goal. Hours are not consistent. Turnover is really high. Managers can be hard to get along with."
good,"A typical day at work as a Beauty Advisor was I would show up and once I arrived they would either assign me as a cashier or backup cashier. If I was backup cashier, then I would also be assigned on a section of the sales floor which was usually set as mass makeup (maybelline, nyx cosmetics, covergirl etc.) or prestige makeup (Tarte, Benefit, NARS, etc.) What I learned is how to sell products and how to have a ""selling language"" I also learned about management and different products, new products, etc. The management there was very different. The hardest part of the job was understanding the management. There were different types of management there for different things and parts of the store and they were not very good at constructive criticism. On top of that, the training was subpar and if you didn't know something, they expected you to and you were made to feel stupid or less than. I always left that job in a bad mood. There was only a few times that I left having a good day, and that was when I felt that I did a very good job with helping out customers. That was the highlight of working at Ulta. Helping customers and building relationships with people."
good,"This company supports their stylists, however only the top 1% get all the awesome experiences they tend to use as a marketing tool to recruit new talent."
good,I was so eager to start my job at Ulta and hopefully move up with the company! The company itself was great to work with but it was like being in high school with the managers. I have almost 4 years of management experience and when a manager position became available they did not even consider an inside source. Great pay and the company itself was very reliable and always was quick to help if needed. They would cut everyone's hours before they could hit 40 so they did not have to give them benefits or paid vacation.
good,"I am a sales manager. I was hired to sell, specialty boutiques and run events with brand partners. I have since my hire been switched to a predominately operations manager and it has been very challenging. It was not why or what I was hired for and I see the push pull between the sales that they desire and the operations that will not get done unless we do them. "
good,This job is more ideal for college students. It is not suited for paying high priced bills. People are often favored and schedules are often misconstrued even with your availability in the computer system.
good,"I enjoyed the benefits of working at Ulta, the workplace culture allowed employees to express themselves freely. I would say that management could use some improvement."
good,"The job is fun, but the managers at my location expected you to do way more than you should have to as a new employee. You have to cover register, mass, fragrance, hair and prestige when low on employees. Also, they dont inform you when your last day is, and will just stop responding to calls, and texts."
good,"In my role as a hair stylist I was barely paid more than minimum wage yet was expected to do not only my own job, but also work as a sales person or stock shelves when I had no clients. Keeping busy is all well and good, but I could have worked at a Great Clips and made as much money while not having to worry about driving sales or straightening a store full of merchandise. You also earned tips and had the possibility of earning commission if you exceeded a certain dollar amount in sales each month. However, at the time I worked at this location, exposure for the salon was so low that any dreams I had initially had of earning a good commission were quickly proven to be just that, a fantasy."
good,I loved working here but they aren’t flexible with schedules. I was crying and forced to quit because they wouldn’t let me transfer home after I already asked them to. They said it wasn’t their problem and weren’t professional.
good,"going into this job i was promised full time position, never happened my hours were cut. I love my co-workers super down to earth team. i think the hardest part of my job is getting clients booked for skin services when i don't have clients booked in the for the day. I am send home early. my sales are only"
good,"Great management and works hard to fulfill the needs of customers, but Needs to work on communicating new information regarding products to employees."
good,I really enjoyed the staff very bubbly and outgoing but the only down part is standing on your feet for 10-12hrs they let people go for sitting orl leaning....not good
good,"Not a bad place to work. However, the pay raises are based on random percentages. Usually giving $0.25 every 6 months to year depending on position. The schedule in certain positions can be hard to balance with kids."
good,"pay is ok, management is a mess. hard work life balance sometimes because management too focused on the little things vs the big things. some weird policies and really big on loss prevention which can be hard when someone is just trying to buy fragrance."
good,"The main set back I had with the ""Beauty Advisor"" was that the only hands on we did with make up was foundation and eyebrow matching. We showed customers what we would recommend if a certain product wasn't on the shelves. I think if we have the experience and if management has seen it, we should be able to express it."
good,"Working at ULTA began great and slowly deteriorated into a place where I was afraid to call off to take care of a sick family member lest I get in trouble. For the most part, it was an excellent job and I'm grateful for my time there. I think the pay needs to be higher for what they require of us."
good,"While I was working, there were over 20 girls and none of which, aside from the boutique girls, ever got more than 15 hours a week, no matter what. Despite this, they continued to hire more girls. They hired me as a prestige beauty advisor but bumped me down to a regular beauty advisor without my knowledge so I could handle the registers. They always understaffed on days when we would need it most such as weekends, but would overstaff on weekdays when there wasn't a need for much staffing. I loved the job but it was so disorganized."
good,"I never went into the job with plans of pursuing a career in makeup, this was only something I did seasonally. They were weird about hours- it’s determined by how many people give you the phone number for their points program except not every boyfriend or grandpa had a rewards number when they were buying gift cards at the holidays. My hours in turn got cut, but then they’d call me during the week asking me to come in when I wasn’t scheduled. It made no sense."
good,"I loved my job, however there is no advancement opportunities. I would ask to be notified if there were any ways for me to get more hours but they never did. Hours I earned by meeting sells goals would consistently be given away to other people. I never received any benefits/rewards from my hard work."
good,"I really enjoyed the one on one customer service experience, personable interactions, and end result once I executed their makeup concerns."
good,The coworkers and managers really determine whether you'll enjoy working there or not. However it was also very annoying for me because management changed and I wasn't advancing in the company. When I address this situation to management basically nothing was done.
good,"I started with such a love for ulta and advancing into management but I did not feel that my manager had the ""how can I build you to become a higher person"" mentality and I became stagnant. I felt that I could no longer grow as a person and did not gain the respect I needed."
good,Worked for 5 years to find I have no where left to grow. I was told I am at the top for my pay and top for my position with benefit. Having a family and being told there is nowhere left to grow is not the kind of thing you want to hear.
good,Ulta is a great job for people who love makeup. This job is more suitable for a younger crowd being you do not get a lot of hours and the pay is not great.
good,"Working for Ulta was fun, fast paced, and very much educational. I rang customers up on register most of the day. The rest of the day was spent stocking the store, doing inventory checks, calling other Ulta locations for item requests,mopping the sales floor, and light cleaning. The hardest part of the job besides upset customers was trying to get people to sign up for the rewards/credit card program which is required by the company and dealing with management."
good,"My store manager was very young and stupid."
good,Used ulta as a stepping stone for my career. Needless to say I was ready to step when I did. You do so much and don’t get payed for very much. As an esthetician I hardly ever got gratis.
good,"When I first started I was hired on as a seasonal beauty advisor and told that I could be hired on as permanent, however I received absolutely ZERO training. I wasn't informed how breaks worked and I was never given one until I just started telling my managers I was going on break, I watched none of the onboarding videos that I now know was mandatory, I wasn't informed about how any of the numbers and percentages worked, nor was i informed that your data capture and loyalty sign-up conversions and percentages factored in to how many hours you get a week. Knowing I had absolutely no training, my managers continued to roll their eyes, scoff at me, and get an attitude when I asked them questions or when I told them I didn't know how to do what they asked of me. I also later found out they were doing a lot of things incorrectly (which I found out after I switched locations and helped another store with their grand opening). "
good,"Great company to work for. You get a lot of perks and free make up. Culture is great, there is not much career growth within a single location. It is a great part time job. It is only full time for management."
good,I worked there twice with two different management staff.  Two totally different experiences. The discount was great though. and the people I worked with were great.
good,If the right staff is in charge then it can be an okay to have a part time job. It doesnt pay very much for the work.  Long hours in the am and at night
good,"it was an overall good environment. i enjoyed working most days. my location was picky with scheduling so just be mindful of that, the discount was nice."
good,"The job was okay with nothing great about it. I've had better retail jobs. Management gave no training to new employees and expected you to know everything as soon as possible. They would also expect you to drop everything and dedicate your all for the job without giving any benefits. The employees were kind. My biggest problem was that they do not give the employees the breaks they are legally required to give so employees would be lucky to get a half hour and if you asked for a break, you would been treated poorly."
good,the environment at that store could be stressful and unorganized. Managers plot to get you out if they don't like you. the managers treat you unfairly
good,"Overall Ulta was a good experience for me, however I didn’t always feel welcome among my peers. They had been working together for a long time and if you were new, you weren’t always made to feel welcome. Management also had its ups and downs, but overall, I did enjoy the opportunities I was given there."
good,"I've never worked in a more negative and stressful work environment than when I got to ULTA. Poor management. Poor communication within the team. It has been overall a negative experience working there. The point system for attendance is ridiculous. While there was poor management, there were maybe 2 managers that everyone got along with. The best part about my job was my coworkers because they were the only ones who understood what it was like to be working for this company. The only way I would recommend this place to anyone is if it was their last resort."
good,"the location i worked at was very busy, which i enjoyed because when its not busy you have the organize stock that other co workers messed up. I actually learned a lot at ulta, each customer was different and needed a different product so you learn something everyday. i loved my job until we got a new store manager. all my coworkers hated her so the work atmosphere changed. the new store manager wrongfully fired me two weeks after she was hired, and i only spoke to her three times, she barely knew my name. a lot of people i liked quit after her so i didnt bother reporting her to corporate. i actually tried getting my job back a few days ago because my friend told me they needed staff, and the store manager who fired me straight up said no. ALSO, GRATIS IS BASED ON FAVORITISM. a lot of what happens at work all depends on if your managers like you or not. thats the worst part about working with women."
good,"Great discount, wish there was more makeup trainings and such, it’s a busy fast paced job so you have to be prepared to work and you need to like makeup (have to wear it to work)"
good,"Working in management here means you have to be completely dedicated to your job even on your days off, be willing to work over 40 hours before a store visit and as a part time accept not getting full time benefits but work full time hours."
good,"Easiest put:  things were great when they were great, and things were really bad when they were bad.  More often than not, I worked with great people."
good,"Management is not usually the best. I have had maybe 2 GREAT managers and they made working at Ulta amazing. However, I have had bad managers who really affect the culture of the store. Great management creates a great culture. The greatest con is you can't request ANY time off during the Holidays (October - January) because it's the busiest time of the year. "
good,I started as an entry level beauty consultant and was very quickly promoted to management. In the retail world there is a lot of call ins so I was the first person management would go to when they would have a call in because I lived very close and I would always come in. This is part of the reason that I advanced very quickly because I was a very hard worker and very loyal to my job.
good,"I love the work I do here, I just hate that they won't give me any more hours or move me to a sales position where I could help them the most. Lots of stocking shifts, lots of manager gossip, endless top management issues. Typical cashier/sales work days were fun-- I get to meet a lot of people and help them play with sparkles and talk about makeup and really connect with them. I was scheduled for mostly overnight or early morning stocking shifts even though they kept telling me I would get moved to a sales position soon and are all about 'promoting from within,' which was a lie. Almost no training. The work itself is great, just getting tired of the low pay and few hours. I would love to work full-time as a sales associate here, but apparently they don't 'do' that."
good,"Co-workers ask every day you have off if you can 'pick-up' their shift because they ""don't feel good/some other excuse."" "
good,"All I learned at this job is how to work a cash register and deal with angry customers. I made minimum wage, and didn't receive any benefits besides the makeup discount. The staff was friendly half the time, but didn't have any intention to help career development."
good,"After working at several locations I can only say the typicality of a day, workplace culture, and management ranges greatly. I've learned how to be a effective manager and customer service excellence. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working hands on with the staff and customers. The hardest part are the constant changes in how things are done and additional work added without resources to do so."
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal beauty advisor, but they kept me on for almost a year until I quit to take a higher paying job elsewhere. The General Manager at the ULTA in Johnson City was AMAZING. She truly cared for her employees. If you were a good worker, she let you know it and valued you. The middle management is difficult to work for at times but overall, I enjoyed the job. If you want to get a lot of hours, this is not the job for you, though. They hire a lot of people so the hours are spread pretty thin, but it was a great job to have while in college for the most part as long as you can manage your time well."
good,"A typical day varies from each store. I worked at 2 locations and both were very different from each other. I did not get many hours at all and benefits were not great, only our discount. I am going to aesthetician school and though this would be a good job however I cannot pay my bills with the hours they give."
good,"Pretty much what you'd expect, it's retail. Working with make up it fun, but it has pretty much all the downsides you can imagine. Doesn't pay great and the hours are eh."
good,I enjoyed my salon workers at ulta.  Even though there is poor advertising of the salon and services offered so it was hard to drive in business. Besides that the management was horrible. I did everything but my job and was treated poorly. Gratis was used as a reward only and when we did get it we got testers instead of new products.
good,"It's retail, you can't expect much.  My floor managers were amazing.  Their expectations seem to be outrageous though with the lack of training they provide."
good,"Bad raises, not appreciate of the work done above and beyond. Constantly always scheduled closing shifts, I had numerous conversations of these problems and nothing was done. The said they would referring to the two GM's I spoke to and DM."
good,don't get as much hours then you'll like. management is always changing. new people every week. stocking early morning to late at night can be frustrating
good,"When I worked at this Ulta that was opening up in my area i help set up the new store. There were already associates that were permanently hired, but they said that there was a chance some of the temporary associates could too. The manager at my store always talked to us like we were annoying, and they didnt even bother to call or email us about future scheduling or when to get our checks if we weren't permanent. They even screwed up a whole week's pay of mine and I had to get reimbursed. It could be a better atmosphere at different stores."
good,"Ulta provides it's stylists with the best training in the industry. They provide a great medium for attracting new clientele. They do demand a lot when  it comes to managers, however the benefits make it worth it."
good,Working at Ulta Beauty was a good learning experience for me in terms of learning to do make-up in different ways on a more broad customer clientele. Learning the more retailed part of customer service opened up my knowledge well.
good,Management played favorites and talked bad about everyone. It was a nice job in the beginning but most jobs are. then true color began to show which made it harder to come to work.
good,"They need better managers."
good,"Ulta was by no means a bad place to work, but it was more of a supplemental job than a career. During the holiday season beauty advisers were offered about 25-30 hours a week, after the month of January passed beauty advisers could be scheduled for as little as 8 hours a week (even with open availability)."
good,"Extremely busy, based on customer reviews, that can be filled out from other employees/managers. Creates drama in the work place, due to the negative attitude based on fellow co-workers."
good,I really enjoyed working for Ulta and I would work for them again under new management. I worked really hard at Ulta which didn't go unnoticed but what I didn't like was the lack of staff the managers would put on the schedule so they could have more hours when they knew they were not willing to help when needed. They would sit in the office the entire shift and only two beauty advisors out on the floor to deal with a store full of people and if we asked for help they would be annoyed as if we were bothering them. Then if there was a week they didn't reach there 40hrs they would limit a beauty advisor to maybe 7-10 hours in a week so they could make up for theres which was really unfair and that is one of the reasons I could no loner work there.
good,"I really loved my job at Ulta. It was fun and rewarding personally."
good,"I started out in the Salon as the receptionist. Job description says that you will be tending to guests, phone calls and scheduling appointments.The online description was very misleading. In essence you are the salon's maid. You are cleaning up the mess of each stylist. You sweep, wash color bowls, mop, wipe counters, put away colors and materials, replenish shampoo bottles, etc. All for a mere $10/hr. You do not receive any tips for the amount of work you are performing. The job would not be horrible if your fellow coworkers thank and appreciate the work you do for them. They assume it is your job to be their maid and expect it from you. Management is also horrible."
good,Ulta is an okay place to work. It seems like no one is on top of anything and most customers a rude. Employees didn't seem to care and they don't work well with scheduling. Communication is awful they didn't tell me I was hired on as seasonal and I had to continuously call to find out when I was working next because they weren't organized.
good,"The company itself was incredible to it's employees and customers. The management team I worked apart of was lazy and never showed up on time. Store managers don't have to clock in or out, and would take advantage of it and never come to work on time or stay for their entire shift."
good,The Ulta I work at has retention problems. Needs to be looked into so there is not so much turn over. I enjoy working with my fellow beauty advisers. It is also a perk to have first dibs on new products that come in.
good,Managers and co workers are great; but the corporate side was terrible in making decisions.  The atmosphere was fun and enjoyable and regular customers were nice.
good,"If you want to start your career in cosmetics and want to familiarize yourself with products and techniques, working at Ulta is an amazing opportunity. However, my location rarely grants days off for personal family matters. If you want a day off, you have to request it half a year in advance and even then you are almost guaranteed to be denied. At my location, the schedule constantly got changed, often with no warning beforehand. The saving grace is that I love my co-workers, we were all very close and could depend on each other, and the customers were overall a joy to work with."
good,I love helping people. I felt extremely rewarded in my position when I knew I had happy customers and employees. Team work is a big part of working for Ulta.
good,Fun place to work with great and helpful co-workers.  Upper management not appreciative of hard workers with dedication to clients.
good,"What can I say? I love working with people. It makes my day to help someone out of a slump or to put a smile on their face or a tear in their eye because they've never felt so beautiful. The job is very rewarding and my co-workers are amazing.  The insurance benefits are awesome."
good,"working 110% once clocked in, hard work was unrecognized and unappreciated. Former supervisor was racially prejudice, and discussed employee information in a manor that should have been private."
good,It is a very enjoyable work environment and the hours are perfect for my life. It does take a toll on you dealing with the public every day for quite a few years.
good,"clock in at 6 a.m. and we looked at a sheet to see what our assigned job was for that day. i mostly picked so I will talk about that. when you have to pick, you have to get a RF scanner and login. then get sheets of labels and write down what section you were assigned to and scan each label so its in the system. then you have to go to that area to pick the following products the clerk assigned to you in the RF scanner. when you get to the area, you have to grab a cart and make sure there are 12 blues bins on the cart. the take the labels and put each one on a spate bin. they are the assigned bins which will go to the sort areas to be sorted then packed. after labeling the bins, you are to find the product on the scanner then scan the item and put it into the correct bin its assigned to. you then do this until the list of items are done. or until you see ''no assigned tasks'' on your RF scanner. you then take the bins the conveyor belt that leads to the sort areas to be sorted. sit then on the belts then after cart is empty be SURE to refill the cart with 12 more blue bins. if u didn't we got in trouble. and when you are assigned more tasks you do the same thing over and over and over again until lunch and then u go home at 6 p.m. its a 12 hour shift. with 3 paid breaks. total number of minutes on break during the day is only 55 mins. 15, 25 then 15 again. i hated that. "
good,"when i first got the job i was just a temporary employee. I was in a group with 25 other temporary employees to help open a brand new ulta. After we helped they picked me and 4 others to stay on permanently. my hours went from 40 a week, down to 5 a week. i tried to get more hours but there were none to pick up so i had to quit."
good,"my co-workers were very nice, i loved working with each and evryone of them. a typical day was a lot of team work, always helping eachother move a little faster."
good,i started out very happy with ulta moving up in the ranks and making good money but when i inquired about management training all i got were empty promises and never ending expectations while continuing to fill the positions i was being promised so there was never a position open for me. instead they chose to hire those that they could pay less such as people who had only been in the salon industry for a short period of time or maintained a cosmetology license while working other jobs in other industries and had not been in a salon in several years. management is over worked and under payed so no one stays for long i saw 5 managers in 5 years. clients recieve an expierence similar to walmart with people shopping all around them and kids screaming yet they pay prices that are the same as high end salons with a more relaxing personal expiereice. stylists are treated like retail employees instead of licensed professionals they are often asked to help at cash registers when not with a client and are not allowed time off from november to january. ulta does not do any marketing they believe in growing through word of mouth so it \is up to eac stylist to do their own martketing themselves
good,"Typical retail, not much too it. A lot of focus on selling and numbers."
good,"Drama. I mean, come on there's a salon inside the store...salon equals gossip...need I say more."
good,Fun fast paced environment with out dated registers that freeze. Most fun part is trying makeup on others making them feel beautiful. Management is sub par. I think it would be much more enjoyable with a more organized manager
good,"I learned a lot from this job, as this was my first real retail job. I learned a lot about merchandising and NPS. My coworkers were some of the best, I can honestly say we will be friends for life. The hardest part of my job is probably doing truck, and the fact that there is no feedback from management. You never really know if you are doing wrong or right."
good,Great place for training ground to me sale goals and over the top customer service and satisfaction.
good,Great for someone who does not have any experience and is fine with working for minimum wage.
good,"There's nothing more satisfying than knowing you made an impact on someones day. Whether it be minimal or something big, it's still a heartwarming feeling. You learn to become very personable working so closely with co workers and customers. Lucky for me, we have such a bond between us it makes the hard times a little easier. A typical day can go from simply cleaning and restocking your department that day to having makeup applications and wedding parties back to back, customers constantly calling for merchandise or complaints to having several customers wanting you to waltz with them down every isle throughout the store. And everything in between."
good,"My usual day at Ulta is nothing like any other job I have had. I do enjoy it very much. The people are great, I was able to make men and women feel confident again when walking out the door. I have had my difficult days with customers but they do come back knowing all of us at Ulta are trying our best to make every experience a great one. The hardest part about my job is definitely the work schedule. It constantly changes, or you loose hours because the company doesn't have enough sales to pay you. To be honest, it truly does not pay the bills. All of my co workers are all one of a kind and there is good communication. We have lost a lot of good management within the last month. So this has made everyone else very stressed and wondering where the company is going. Over all, I will admit, to work here is way too much fun. The people are great and the environment overall is good, but I would like to find something that will pay more and help support my family's needs."
good,I really liked working here because of the many clients I would get and the advantage to do make up. The pay was really good and we were always busy all the time. The only reason I left was because it is a stressful place to work. Managers always down your throat and were really strict. I wouldn't get to pick the days I would like to work they just give you a set schedule and it didn't really work out for me. The one main plus about working here was how much I learned new things and techniques.
good,"Greet customers, check customers out, process returns, assist with closing or opening of store. Train new cashiers. Enjoyed working with the public."
good,"The Environment is fun to work in, however the hours aren't so fun. You only receive one weekend off a month, unless its around Holiday time. You are not certified any requested time off around Holiday season."
good,"Working in the salon was very slow and did nothing most of the time in the quakertown store, i leanred alot from the classes but not the manager my co workers were always great the store manager was always rude"
good,"i liked my job here because it worked with my schedule, but no manager ever knew what they were doing, the company did little to help you advance, or even know what you were selling. the company did even less to protect their employees."
good,"A typical day at ULTA is utter chaos. Entirely way too many tasks, not enough payroll and HA! customer service. Guests are treats like annoyances, simply because the staff is under PRESSURE from upper management. I wish they would provide the necessary payroll so that I can do what i was hired to do...GREET, ENGAGE, THANK!"
good,"There are little to no benefits. To be eligable, not only do you have to be full time, but also a senior stylist to receive any benefits."
good,"I worked at Ulta quite awhile ago but I do remember learning a great deal about the cosmetics industry. I liked dealing with all the new products, hosting special events, and working with the guests on selecting proper skincare and cosmetics."
good,There are nice people that are apart of the company. The benefits and vacation time is amazing. There is a lot of mandatory overtime.
good,"It's A Good Paying Job , Have Pretty Good Benefits. You Can Chose Many Different Schedules You Would Like To Work. Also Different Departments To Pick."
good,"Working there for 2 years, I had learned everything. How to run the salon and how to do the store part. I never received a raise. Everything was about making them money to move up. Stylist had to make so much money a week to get commission as well as move up. The beauty advisor have to get so many people to sign up for there rewards as well as make so much money in that hour to get a raise or move up"
good,"They were accommodating with my school schedule and allowed me to take personal days. I enjoyed working there. Management could be better though, they"
good,"It was a pretty decent starting place right out of beauty school. You don’t get a thorough description of what your job title falls under as, like company needs and expectations."
good,unfair pay for a licensed cosmetologist. hours are scattered. clients pay little for what is done. same price for all hair types/densities. retail environment. retail hours.
good,Pay wasn’t enough as well as the hours and they only offer part time. People always called out but the management was nice and always on point. It’s a great part time job of kids in high school but not for someone in college
good,The management at Ulta is not the best in my opinion. They worried too much about trying to be your friend other than doing their actual job. Don't get me wrong having a good time at work is fun but sometimes it was just too much with how comfortable they were getting.
good,"Working for Ulta taught me a lot, as I was there for almost three years. I learned many good skills when it comes to the operation side of things, and have definitely improved my social skills when it comes to dealing with a guest or coworkers."
good,"Ulta was an interesting place to work.  People were nice for the most part in the beginning, but over time the energy became less positive.  I don't feel like Management was always the most reliable.  Also, our store dealt with a lot of theft so it was always chaotic in there with the police having to be called.  I enjoyed working at the Brow Bar, but didn't appreciate that I was the only one making sales quotas and actually trying.  Over time I just grew disinterested with the position and staff so decided to move on.  I'd only spend your energy working here if you thrive in chaotic environments, know how to fake a smile and genuinely love working in beauty retail."
good,"This job is all what you make it, if you are looking to just get some experience. However definitely not long term, unless you into the salon or management."
good,"Fast pace, always changing, never enough payroll to get the job done. Constantly on the go. Pay and benefits are good and they do champion diversity and inclusion."
good,Hours constantly trimmed due to budgets not being met. Technology issues everyday with different devices not allowing completion of duties . Not enough staff due to scheduling and budgets which resulted in customers complaints constantly . Unrealistic expectations.
good,"I love working here, but the management needs to be more openminded, it starts in corporate, I wish that corporate would be more willing to learn from the bottom so that we can have more opportunities to build a culture where we can all thrive"
good,I liked working there and i liked the management team. I had to leave there because i was not getting any hours. The boss works with you with hours as in if you need a day off or what.
good,"This was a seasonal position and I was excited to work there. Right off the bat I was just left alone at the register and had no clue on how to use it. The management was cool, it was the other employees that made it awful working there. They would blame us if something went wrong with their sale. They accused us of not wanting to be there and that we should just leave if we did not have the “drive”. This was all said in front of management and they did nothing. Being a cashier there, the others made you feel unwanted and unappreciated."
good,"There is no training, you are the only esthetician and are responsible for all skin sales and services. They don’t do any advertising for you or help bring clients in, you are responsible for everything. It’s a very cut and dry retail environment and management sees you as disposable. I worked very hard here and had good relationships with all my coworkers and bosses, then when I decided that I was better in a non retail environment and respectfully put my 2 week notice in, they fired me. So unprofessional."
good,My overall experience with ulta beauty was ok. The best part about working there was being able to help the customers fulfill their needs leaving the store satisfied.
good,"Not good enough pay for those who currently work, they’d rather hire a bunch of brand new people then give current employees more hours & pay. Management also isn’t the best."
good,"You will commonly be rearranging the store according to the planogram. No new products will be added, but it has to change. The truck is pretty bad to deal with as well. People can be fun and enjoyable, but this is case by case."
good,"It was okay working at Ulta, as long as you have a good manager. Many are petty and will over-work you. The work atmosphere could be lonely and clique-y. There were also never enough people on the floor to assist all the customers that were coming in. Overall, a bit of a stressful job, but, again, okay if you have a good manager."
good,"I loved the company, in fact, if I had a different salon manager I would want to go back. I'm now in a better salon and actually being paid for the work I am doing."
good,I worked here during school and was only part time but the pay was awful now looking back at it. I always went over and beyond and was paid minimum wage. The head manager was very hard to deal with and just rude. Workers were kinda of mean at first but the hiring manager was the best. The discounted make up was nice and being able to dress and do your make up in a creative way made it fun. The hours weren't that great and super inconsistent.
good,"My overall experience at Ulta wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best it could be either. The pay for having an educated trade was poor, and management was constantly changing. With the change of management and influx of different people, it seemed my job had to change as well which was very confusing and frustrating. Also, working with a bunch of other women was difficult as it seemed that there was constant drama between coworkers. They did work with my schedule pretty well, and there's pretty decent benefits for full-time employees. But other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"My overall experience with working at Ulta was great. I learned a lot about different kind of cosmetic brands and skin care lines. I learned about different ingredients are in each kind of product ! I got to experience and work with different brands such as NARS, Anastasia Beverly Hills, It Cosmetics and ETC."
good,"The interview is consisted of you competing with 5 or more other people to get 1 job position and the interview questions are really pointless. The pay doesn’t compensate for how competitive the job is or the fact that you get little to no training. On my first actual day I was thrown on the cash register after watching someone ring up about 5 transactions. Another thing is that no matter how many credit cards you sell, as along as your title is beauty advisor and you have not gotten a raise, you will still get beauty advisor earnings. Also they’re sneaky with data capture for the credit cards and the memberships. I also was due for a few gratitude gifts and never received them. Its really just a mess"
good,"Just when you think you have your job figured out they change the rules and when you ask for help you are told to look it up on ultanet, which is never updated in a timely matter.  They are so focused on opening more stores that they are letting unqualified people run the business.  Training is a joke.  It's do it there way or you are out."
good,I feel the company has a great way of handling diversity however I believe more hours should be given to make personal and professional goals in order to advance and a catch 22..you can't get more hours unless you meet unrealistic goals. So with that said how are you supposed to advance your employee level
good,The company treats contractors like second class citizens. My manager did not really know what the stakeholders were really looking for.  The manager I don't think liked her job.
good,"Ulta was a seasonal experience, it did not give much room for growth, no benefits, and very little job security. It was a good customer service experience and a decent second job but was not a good long term plan."
good,Ulta is not a bad place to work. However it is very stressful if you do not have a management team that functions well together. The hours are also insane. If you do not have a proper team you will be asked to stay until who knows when to get things done. Being a manager here requires a great deal of sacrifice. Working here means being a team player. If you are not a people person this job is not for you.
good,"You definitely Need to know a lot about makeup, you will be on your feet for the entire shift so some comfortable shoes and clothing. Must have a positive attitude"
good,They make it seem like it's great to work there but  They just want to juice everything you got and give you the minimum. I had a different idea of what it would be like until i worked there. Now i see it clear and it is not a great place to work at.
good,It’s a great place to grow your management and communication skills BUT you are always treated “less than” unless you’re in the clique. I was made and expected to run the retail side (which is against policy btw) but yet I never got support for the salon. I had to come in while I was on vacation to do the salon order because no retail manager would do it for me. 4 years with this company and I could no longer have my mental health ruined.
good,"There is a good discount, but managers definitely play favoritism when it comes to working advancement. They only send or give training to specific employees. I also, either don't have a good set of hours or I'm there doing the work of a lead cashier but am not getting the pay nor title. Coworkers are generally really fun to be around but its really competitive when trying to get credit cards. Managers will constantly badger you till you get a credit card."
good,"Ulta prefers to hire contractor rather than full-time employees.  This makes it easier for Supervisor to terminate employees they don't like, even when they are meeting job requirements."
good,"Simple job to make ends meet. I worked in two different locations and management and environment changes based on location. One place was better run than the other but aside from that, you go, get your hours, get your check and be done. Very easy."
good,It was okay. It just wasn’t the job for me.. I guess? And I was told I would transition into a management position and that wasn’t happening. So that’s what really kind of made me not want to continue working for ulta. I don’t like dishonesty.
good,"Dont get me wrong, I love the 25% discount and 50% off my hair but...the hours are not worth it! I only have this job cause it was my first job and I'm only keeping it till I find something better. The hours suck honestly.  12 HOURS. For 2 weeks! And on a ""good week"" you'll get 22 hours.  The hours are not enough. This has been the lowest hours I've ever received. If you want your check to be more then 250 go somewhere else."
good,"I love working at Ulta, I just wish there were more opportunities to advance in the company.  The way things are run differ from store to store but I mostly like everyone I work with."
good,Great pace to work. Fun and very informative. Can be very busy and hectic and your schedule always changes. You can work over night for truck and be expected to work the next day as well
good,"Since this Ulta Beauty is a high volume store the daily routine varied. A day could consist of stock replenishment, cycle counts, processing damages, setting out Ad's, conducting team chat ins with salon and retail associates, and engaging with guest. Some of these task are time consuming and were given short times to complete. This is where I learned that Time management was key in order to succeed at Ulta Beauty. The joy always came from satisfied customers. The environment is fast pace! One must consistently be on their toes ready to tackle the next task. Management at this location lacked communication between associates and managers. The hardest part about this job was not being able to have any type of set schedule."
good,"Ulta was actually my favorite job.. BUT, there was a lack of management which is crucial when working in cosmetic retail. We were often asked to stay and work overtime which is fine but it was always last minute and the day of when they need you. Yet they claimed that employees cannot work full time unless you are a manager.. so hours fluctuated drastically every week. I can't blame everything on Ulta and management though, the location I worked at was in a somewhat sketchy area so theft was a problem but that's out of Ulta's reach. I worked there for about 8 months and during that time, there was two General Managers that were terrible and didn't know what they were doing.. I left because the last GM I worked with was a racist person when the entire staff was Latino, black and or Asian which made no sense to me. Oh yeah, the pay was completely bogus. I would definitely NOT recommend working at ulta...unless you're just going to work for the discount."
good,Outside of the general manager the other employees are great to work with. They work together as a team. Everyone pulls together and helps one another get the job done.
good,It’s okay. Not a forever job... only for select few . They only train a few employees on new products etc.. Ots fun but definitely not something you could do forever and make a living out of unless you’re a GM
good,"If you like challenges and have desire to work in a very fast pace environment, then ULTA should be on your list. You get the opportunity of working in Agile/Waterfall - Hybrid model and with cross-functional teams."
good,"Would not reccommend. Only benefit was discount. Manager was horrible. Horribly understaffed for Black Friday. Promoted incompetant people over qualified, hard working people."
good,"It could've just been the store I worked in, but my management never communicated with me. After being hired and trained as part time, they eventually cut my hours and told me I was seasonal from the start and I had no official schedule. I was always put on the schedules on shipment days after telling my managers numerous times that I had school during the time of the shipment shifts. The more I told them I couldn't work those days, the less shifts I had. I worked maybe 2 shifts a month. They also interrogated me as if I was stealing for trying to make a purchase on my off day with $10 in cash and the rest on my card. They brought me into the back office in the middle of my purchase to question why I used 2 forms of payment and if I was using my discount to buy products for someone else. If I made more than $30 a paycheck maybe I would've been able to use one source of payment. I put in my two weeks after not being on the schedule for a whole month and then got a phone call the day after Christmas asking why I didn't show up for my shift. Nobody sent me an email of the schedule, I never got a call saying I was on the schedule, and ""I was never official"" on the schedule from the beginning. the job was fun but the management was awful."
good,"I do believe in ulta's mission and how there are endless possibilities of feeling beautiful within yourself but sometimes, the managers and higher up management do not really care to make sense of mental health and time management. "
good,"It is very fun, and the discount is pretty good.  The hours are all over the place  It is a very political environment.  I would say this is a just a job.  It would be fun for someone in cosmetology school or college."
good,"Enjoyed what I did there as a skin therapist, everything was great helping out guests and getting to experience all their products available.  A lot was great there,except the store manager at the location i worked. He was not fair with all employees, took favoritism many girls who worked there opened up to me and expressed themselves that way. It really is unpleasant having a manager who does not look out for the best for all employees only for his self benefit."
good,"The job overall was not what you would expect. As an adviser you are not allowed to complete makeup looks on your customers, and management/coworkers can be very very catty."
good,Great place to work as long as you keep to yourself and avoid the gossip. There is a lot of gossip there among the ladies staff and the Mexican ladies will talk about you in Spanish.
good,"If the store does not reach its goal for the day, peoples hours start to get cut during the week. Such as shorter shifts or the shift is cut altogether."
good,it's a good career if your manager is great. the hours are ridiculous and unfairly balanced. I would work full time while my friend who requested more hours was working less than 15 hours a week.
good,One of the highest volume stores. Very busy & non stop. Enjoyable. Happy atmosphere. The hours aren’t the best but they’re pretty flexible with your schedule.
good,Management is all over the place when you're a beauty advisor. They act like its everybody's first time in customer service even if it's not. You have to tell them we are going at all times or else they get upset with you. It's an okay part time job if you're looking to have fun in the makeup industry
good,"- Co-Workers made that place tolerable. "
good,I helped set up the Covington store but as a mother to a fairly newborn the hours were crazy with very little pay. I do not feel like I was paid enough for the set up of the store or my hourly work.
good,I loved the work environment. It was fun and upbeat and overall great place to work. Great management team. The downside of the job was not enough hours and too little pay.
good,"If you are lucky enough to have decent managers, this is a great place to work part-time. Unless youre a manager or hair stylist, you will not make a living wage."
good,I loved my team. Management could’ve been better because they were sometimes lazy.. there was a low pay and there’s not much growth within the company.
good,I've been working here for about a year and its a lovely environment but the management could be way better. I'm a beauty adviser yet more times than not I'm doing manager related work and not being paid properly.
good,"After many years at Ulta, and no chance for advancement, I moved on.  The manager I had was inept and had no  idea what she was doing,  Many years ago."
good,"Ulta isn't a bad company to work for. The location I was at just so happened to have bad management. The pay is highly unfair. You feel like you work your butt off (running 4k-6k) every 2 weeks and when your paycheck comes, it's barely over 1k. This is why people get discouraged and leave. The management pick their favorites and if you're at the bottom of the totem pole you're out of luck. Great place to work for someone coming straight out of school and not looking for a job that is your primary income."
good,"I actually enjoyed my time at ULTA, but I have a list of reasons why I left.  I was available every day and yet I wouldn't receive hours.  Also no matter how hard you work they give no recognition.  Well at least in the location I was at."
good,"A typical work day was routine. Usually talk to manager about the days objective/tasks then get working right away. I learned how to have better time management. Not only did I become better at managing my time, I also became better at providing the best customer service experience I could give. The workplace culture was a fun friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was during truck night. I found it to be a little difficult due to working very early in the morning ( 4am) during some truck nights."
good,"During my time working at Ulta, I'd have to say my biggest complaint was the management and how they treated the people that worked there. Not to mention the multiple class action lawsuits I was put into due to their negligence. Because they are a multi-billion dollar company, you'd think that they would pay their management a living wage, you'd be wrong. Once I was in the Clinique position, I did have a better time because I wasn't involved in many of the day to day dramas that went along with being apart of the store front. But, there were still so many other unrealistic expectations placed on being in Clinique."
good,"I absolutely LOVED my job. Helping women find themselves through the power of makeup was absolutely wonderful. I miss that feeling. Unfortunately, the general manager of my store was possibly the most ungrateful and misguided human I have ever met. She constantly belittled employees for their outfits or choice of makeup, even though they were all completely within Ulta guidelines. Not to mention finding out your schedule the week of. Management was absolutely horrendous which is why I chose to part ways with the company but the customers were the reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,"I applied and they told me I'd have a lot of hours per week, and it would be fun. only to come to work to see my name missing from the schedule, and when I asked my GM what was going on, she said I could pick up a few shifts that others did not, or could not, pick up,"
good,"Loved my coworkers at this location. Some management helped improved my skills, and helped me grow a little in the company. The hours were better than the location I worked before, if I needed more some management helped out, depending if we had enough on payroll. Learned how the behind the scenes things work."
good,Looking for change! Don’t want to be in retail anymore! Done it all my life.. Need something new & more fullfilling. I’m at new phase in my life and just need more stability etc..
good,Start the day with a meeting and getting our assignments for the shift. Inspected our equipment and then started to pick our orders. Overall management was not dependable and very picky with liking certain operators and people. We all worked fairly well together and got our jobs done. Hardest part would have just been the physical part of the job but still wasn't that hard. I really enjoyed some of the people I worked with.
good,"I worked there for training in three days. unfortunately, I was disappointed because someone else took my position. so I was asked to leave. I was hoping to get another chance, but there was no luck for me."
good,Ulta would be a great place to work if the hours were more flexible and product training on ALL products. If i use a product and like it I can sale it!!!!
good,I love makeup and helping people out but the job description for beauty advisor was a huge catfish. All you do is stay stuck behind a register and clean.
good,"This review is not based on the company as a whole. Plenty of the locations are fabulous. My location unfortunately was not. We had 4-5 managers on and off, and most of them were incredible leaders. With that being said, the direct supervisor of my location was a cold woman who did not care about the wellness of her employees, all she cared about was making her store money. She was very rude and would single certain employees out, resulting in an extremely high turnover rate and a very tense and fearful environment. Working as a Specialty Beauty Adviser means you work for Ulta and another company such as Lancome or MAC, which can cause some serious communication issues with your bosses and the partnering companies. As a whole I just wish that HR would be more cautious of hiring toxic leaders, and listening to the cries of their employees."
good,"Customer servicing guest"
good,"Fun, fast paced, always something new to learn about. Plenty of opportunities to take. It’s a fast growing company and always gaining new companies to work with."
good,"Its retail so be prepared to work crazy hours, the pay is good if you're in management, otherwise it's a high turnover because of the hours and which department you're in."
good,"Ulta is not bad at all for a retail job, but that is what it is. Loved my coworkers, some managers. Pay is higher than some retail jobs. hours are not fair."
good,"A typical day at Ulta Beauty could either be very stressful and hands on or the longest day at work!"
good,"As a Prestige Consultant, my coworkers and I (four of us total) were scheduled 3 to 4 hours each per week - laughably less than part time. In the year that I was employed, there was absolutely no room for advancement. Other than that, if you're looking for just a job, this is a good place to work."
good,"You're on your feet all day and the work environment is very FastPass. Customers like for you to talk to them about dupes to higher-end products so a good background in makeup is helpful. However, most employees are willing to help you out."
good,"Ulta was a good place to work at as far as communicated with your co workers. Management was very unorganized. you had  workers telling some supervisors how to do their job. They moved people up by who they liked, not by knowledge."
good,"I worked at Ulta for a year, was one of the best people to get club card memberships and and the never promoted me because every cashier only lasted a couple months. The manager (at the time) was always late when opening, not very professional from my interview until the day I quit. I think she was too young to become manager, she always complained when the district managers came in to do reviews. Everyone was really nice and I got along with them but I was always getting called in at the last minute when people wouln't show up. They were always short staff even when I handed in my letter of resignation, the assitant manager asked if I would stay if they promoted."
good,I was promised full time hours at hire but they would regularly cut shifts because sales weren’t high enough and I only ended up working 10-20 hours a week
good,I loved my job at Ultra but working as an esthetician its harder. You are paid either commission or hourly wage which is minimum so its not ideal if you're just starting out and need to make a living. I am a total makeup junkie so working there was a dream... I loved general management but my salon manager was terrible. She practically had no clue how to run a salon so I unfortunately left. Other than that it was an enjoyable job!
good,"Heavy unloading, long periods of time on floor. Manager never accepted any request offs, Started working with at least 18 to 20 hours a week to 8 to 10 hours a week. Was only working one day out of the week and once in awhile a Sunday for new sales. The associates discount is great, that was the only best thing working there and seeing the new products."
good,"Environment is relaxing but no real room for developmental growth. In retail you work alot of nights and weekends which is expected. In your role due to minimal hours given for staff, you're pulled into departments you werent trained in, ie prestige makeup answering haircare questions."
good,"~Typical workday involved greeting ever customer who entered the door, ringing guests up at the cash wrap and offering to sign up for the rewards program, putting away make-up and fixing facings or fixtures"
good,"This was most likely just an issue with the store I was working at, but the management was unprofessional. Managers changed schedules without asking and did not work well with my school schedule. But the discounts are really good and the work environment was slow paced."
good,"Starting pay for associates isn't terrible, but not desirable either.  While this job does include benefits, its not ideal if you are looking for something that offers a promising job advancement and good full time hours, unless you are applying to be some type of manager or a higher position (i don't know much about working in management or the starting pay) The staff and management are nice people, and fun to work with.  Overall not a terrible place to work."
good,Work and keep to yourself avoid people who aren't on your level of maturity a lot of younger workers whom don't understand or value work come to work do your job
good,The store was a fun place to work at because I enjoyed working with makeup. The discount wasn't too bad and they were accommodating with my school schedule. Employees were friendly and managers were good for the most part. A typical work day would mainly be register work or helping customers find products in the store. Other days before opening hours would be stocking items in the store and cleaning.
good,"management was kind of troubling if you brought up issues, never given a direct answer for certain things."
good,This job is fun for those just looking for a discount and very part-time work. Not so fun for people looking to advance their careers in the cosmetics industry
good,"The discounts and some of the employees are amazing. Some of the management  are pretty cool but you deal with a lot of angry, rude people. Sometimes some of the management didn't seem to happy to come in either."
good,"Honestly, the head store manager is a tyrant. She likes to downgrade certain employees. Everyone feels as if she bullies employees she knows that will just stay quiet and let her be rude to them. Nice discount, but not worth the stress of receiving only 12 hours a week and being sent home early on days that you're scheduled because the store is ""over hours"". Those hours are given to the favorite employees, giving them almost 40 hours every week."
good,"Company has a lot of pros and cons, but overall it's a fun and challenging workplace that can serve you well depending on what you are looking for in a job."
good,The work environment and the most of the people were great to work with. Overall the management was not the best and the hours were not the best. Costumers were good and most coworkers were.
good,"not too great on hours, and tasking can get really difficult. Can be fun, but management sometimes is not the best. I love my discount though. Many mixed emotions bout this place."
good,Ulta is a typical fast-paced retail environment with many things to be accomplished to make the business run smoothly. I enjoyed learning about all the different cosmetic and skin care products and especially  creating relationships with the vendors.
good,Young managers who did not take the job serious.They would pick favorites and give the other girls less hours. They were not there for the employees when they needed help
good,"If you are in high school it is fine for limited hours but if you are thinking you will get full time hours like the GM promises you, you will probably get 9-12 hours a week. Also they liked to keep my gratis from the company."
good,"I loved working there. It was definitely a fun time, and the co workers were great. Sometimes the management was alright. Managers kind of did whatever and just had you do all the work, while on their phones. Sometimes you don't even get breaks because they don't have enough workers, YET they don't give enough hours either. Working part time there was VERY part time. Some weeks I didn't even get to work. It was horrible, but again, I loved that fact that we sometimes got free makeup. Pay was horrible too!! WORST part about it."
good,"Worked as a licensed esthetician for Benefit Brow Bar."
good,"Management was horrendous. Hourly wage seems great, $8.50 ($1.25 higher than MS minimum wage)/hr. You'll work 4-8 hours maximum per week. You'll stand behind a register your entire shift and your bosses will treat you subhuman. Most girls who work there have at least one other job because Ulta alone won't pay your bills. You work really late nights or really early mornings and I was often scheduled against my availability even though the system isn't supposed to let them do that. You're supposed to get a 15 minute break per shift, 30 minutes per every 6 hour shift. But you'll never get it, and when you ask to take it your boss/supervisor will get annoyed with you. It's impossible to get a shift covered and if you get a shift covered for any reason, they'll intentionally leave you off the schedule for 2 weeks. Benefits were great, 25% off retail and 50% off salon but the salon butchered my hair so it's essentially worthless because I had to pay to get it fixed elsewhere. Horrible. I'm heartbroken I left my other job to work here. I've only been here for 8 months and it's added years to my life. I leave nearly in tears after every shift."
good,"VERY hard to get time off. "
good,"Great learning environment and starting place for anyone looking for a way to get familiar with the beauty industry but, the hours and pay are less than desirable and favoritism unfortunately plays a huge role in gratis distribution and opportunities for learning. If you want to succeed i suggest sucking up as much as possible to management."
good,"I liked having the ability to do multiple jobs. I would work at the register and I would also have tasking responsibilities. Unfortunately, the management wasn't the best. I experienced having six different managers in the span of 5 months."
good,"Learned about beauty items, Management is alright, most enjoyable part of the job is working with the guests. A typical day at work is very hardworking and making sales."
good,"I met a lot of nice people there and made a few friends. It is a good place to shop but working there kind of ruins the magic of the store. I was not trained very well so I had to basically teach myself and was kind of left to deal with things by myself. Some days I would be the only one at the register with a line almost to the back of the store and no one would be able to assist me because they were all busy. There were never enough employees working in the store to accommodate the guests. The workers were also quite clique-like and formed their own ""groups"". If you were not in their ""group"" then you hardly existed and they would not talk to you unless they had to. Overall, it is not the best place to work but it did teach me a lot about how to handle and manage retail."
good,okay job to beat a blank. didn't really care for the hours though. good job to hold you for the next one. some people are okay there. some are not just like anyway. do your job and go home.
good,"its an alright place to work if you like beauty and makeup, espically since you get a nice discount.  i just dont like how seasonal employees are treated, but that's how retail is sometimes.  Management tends to get mad when you dont know something, even when they didnt properly train you in the first place. Be prepared to get thrown out there on the sales floor"
good,Difficult to work with the store management.  Not very good on being unbiased and a good manager..treats some employees more favorably than others
good,I wasn't excited working for this company. I only got a few hours a week and they weren't the best hours. The management was pretty good. But the worst was on my last day I felt as if no one really cared that i was leaving.
good,I enjoyed the culture of this company. While you are often overworked and underpaid this position defiantly shows you what it means to work hard for a living.
good,"Management deals with lots of crazy situations, corporate supplies absolutely no backbone to you, your store or your situation. Tasking is required 100% of the time, and gives you little to no support on training. The people you work with are usually wonderful and the bad ones filter out. But your efforts will go unnoticed until they are stopped. So don't try too hard or you get in trouble."
good,Ulta was a great experience.  There were some issues with management because our store manager was dating our merch manager and that sometimes made the work environment a little difficult. The pay was good but we worked very hard.  This was my first corporate experience.
good,"The job itself was fine but the pay wasn't great, the discount is only okay, and there were only like 3 hours a week. Sometimes you get free makeup or perfume samples."
good,Enjoyable work environment. Great co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping  the guests that come in.
good,"I enjoyed working there, but 8 hours a week wasn't enough for me. I  liked the dress code and enviroment. The struggle was real, when trying to fit in as the new girl."
good,"I liked that i could help customers pick and choose the right makeup and skincare that best suites them. On a typical day i do color matching and stock product sometimes I'm on register. Co- workers were okay, lots of unnecessary drama, i did learn a lot of product knowledge for a lot of the brands"
good,"worked with this company for 3 years meet amazing people, just needed a change from corporate life  and retail discounts were grate and theses ladys will become family to you"
good,Excellent place to be employed to learn about new beauty products.  Ulta Beauty is a very fun and happy place to work.  All employees that are employed at Ulta have a lot of knowledge about beauty products.
good,"I began my career at Ulta at one location, and it was fabulous. Loved my co-workers and management. Transferred to another store for school, and it was an absolute nightmare. Ultimately ended up leaving the company because of how poor the management team was at this second store. I loved working at Ulta, and it saddens me that they had ruined that experience for me. "
good,"The hours are very flexible and the staff is very friendly; customer service is top priority and it is a very fun and rewarding job in that aspect. There are minimal benefits because the company will not hire FT other than management and even the managers do not receive FT hours. As is with any bureaucratic corporation, management cannot function properly without going up the chain of command, and that chain does not seem to link very well. If you're looking for a fun summer/winter break job or just a PT job for a little extra cash, ULTA is the way to go. If you're searching for a sustainable income and benefits, ULTA is not for you."
good,The job itself is not bad.  Management is very inconsistent.  There is no work/life balance here if you are salaried.  The company keeps coverage very tight and runs stores on skeleton crews despite growing profits.
good,"I'd begin the day by planning sales goals,zoning, task management, check and review all associate attendance . Greet and chat in all of my internal guest, walk the store to check for any damages or messes left from the prior day."
good,"Some shifts you're required to come in 3 hours before opening to set up ads or restock the store or whatever the manager needs you to do. Most days are simple, working with customers or as a cashier. The store I worked at cross-trained me to work as a beauty adviser and cashier. Prepare for the truck shipments that are before the store opens, some at 4am or at 8am-it depends on the store. It is enjoyable if you have the ability to work freely and your manager is not over controlling. Ulta has a lot of rules and expectations and standards, if you're not used to that kind of environment, apply elsewhere."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was all of the great co=workers I had the pleasure of hiring, training and working with."
good,"Store with makeup, hair care, nail care, facial care, ect. Professional salon located inside the store. Prestige makeup brands and mass makeup brands as well. Working here was a great environment if you love makeup like I do. I think i would have loved the job a lot more if i just worked around different people. I only worked there a short time and got mistreated a few times by the former employees. I was given tasks without knowing any knowledge on how to do them. When i asked questions on them, i was resulted in comments such as ""Are you stupid?"" Like i was supposed to know how to do something i have never done before."
good,"I like how before we started work we got together and talk about our goals that are set for the day. My managers were encouraging and they did want us to do the best we could. "
good,"The job itself is fun because you deal with customers and makeup.  However, there are drawbacks.  Your schedule is not consistent; you could have 10 hours this week and the following week only have 4. This makes it hard to plan for paying bills. If you work here, you should have another job (unless you do not have any bills and only need spending money.)  "
good,"i work on the cashier"
good,I came into this company with many years experience. I worked part time for the company. I would be happy to work full time. There wasn't room for advancement.
good,"taking care of guests. answering phone calls doing the order, cleaning, making coffee, great benefits that is all."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ulta Beauty.  I was able to quickly advance within the company.  I started at Ulta has a seasonal worker and advanced to Merchandise Coordinator with 1.5 years.  A typical day for me would be to open the store, complete and send morning reports to the corporate office, schedule employee task and goals for the day.  I would be the manager on duty, which would include assisting customers and staff with any customer service issues.  I would then have my merchandising duties to handle for the day.  Including but not limited to processing inventory, price reductions, handling returns, damages, return to vendors and resetting any stock within the store.  The hardest part of the day would be when i would have to handle processing the truck, managing the store and work with customers in peak hours as the only manager within the store.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer service aspect.  I loved working and training new employees as well as helping customers to find the best product for their needs."
good,Loved learning about the product and seeing how many different items they had to offer. They give you coupons for free items to try which is great. Management was friendly and had high energy.
good,"Typical day is to work 8 hours start early with clients if I wasn't busy I would be out on the sales floor and trying to convert people into the salon, building a relationship with the girls who work there, the co- workers were always very nice we always got along, like minded people are so much fun to be around, beauty is my line of work so I loved this job. The hardest part of this job was to try to convert people to the salon, I was good at it but it was always very hard to bring up the subject, Being near make-up and doing a quick make over was always the best part of my job!"
good,"I thought I had a permanent position but when I showed up for orientation found out that about 50 people had been hired to file 3 permanent positions.  All of us had to ""duke"" it out.  Would have preferred it if they had been honest about the position."
good,"It was a fast pace environment, but was not always in an organized manner."
good,"The hardest part of the job was interpersonal conflicts between each of the managers, that affected the vibe of the workplace. It is often understaffed, and does not allow for more opportunities for the guests to receive help. Typically, I was one of the people that managers looked to to give them information, or to handle visual projects that needed to be accomplished quickly. The management team in not very synced, and can make it difficult for the other employees to seek guidance from them. The most enjoyable part of the job were the free gratis that were given to give further product knowledge."
good,The hardest part of the job is working with very low payroll.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the guest at Ulta.  Customer's love shopping at Ulta and are pleased with what this company offers them.
good,This is a very fun upbeat place to work.  While it is always a good time it isn't always run very smoothly.  The schedule is posted very sporadically sometimes the day before it goes into effect.  Also things are usual disorganized and there seems to be a lack of communication among the management.  The hours are also pretty sparse.
good,"Very unexperienced, uneducated management staff. Managers didn't value their team and viewed them as disposable."
good,"I run my own business for the most part, unless there is a complaint or quotas to be made."
good,It was a great place to start off at but I am ready for something more stable.
good,quick advancement opportunities
good,"it wasn't a horrible experience but get ready for some drama. if you are competent and move quickly you will be tasking all day. they work you to the bone and then cut you down to 13hrs a week. If you are slow, you will be a cashier. The store itself was filthy and covered in dust, and the bathroom smelt like a sewage pump. Between the staff and the customers its a wonder they don't send you on the sales floor with a helmet and protective eye ware. Cattiness aside, the management I worked for didn't know how to solve their own personal problems at the store because the communication is not there. There was only person who didn't have her head up her a^s was the assistant manager. Thanks a lot Ulta."
good,every one is nice we are a new store that came to the florence sc area. hours are slim to none we may have 5 to 12 hours a week.
good,"I really liked the fact that I joined the Ulta team from the beginning. I helped build the store and things were great. Over time, I realized I didn't agree with the way things were run and my opinions and ideas weren't being utilized."
good,I have had a good experience. My coworkers are nice and I have had good management. There is not a lot of room for growth. It is just a typical minimum wage college job.
good,Fun place to work if you love people and anything beauty related. Only downside is the managers can be annoying to deal with depending on the store you work in.
good,"The culture at Ulta was awesome. I felt at home there. My biggest problem was with management. The store manager was a terror and had no people skills. People called HR on her multiple times. The district manager tried to help, but didn’t know how to handle it. Also, they told me I would get insurance. After accepting the job, the benefits office told me that only GMs and AGMs got insurance so I left"
good,"I enjoyed working at Ulta and gained knowledge in retail, management, sales, and most importantantly developing meaningful relationships with clients and growing my business."
good,Working at ulta call center is alot with very little pay. It’s unorganized and something is always wrong with your checks.. they expect so much to be be paying people something that’s barely going to get them by.
good,Pay wasn't enough for all the responsibilities we have as a beauty advisor. I enjoyed interacting with customers but I didn't feel like most of management demonstrated passion for their job.
good,"It's a very typical retail environment. Don't stick your neck out too far for anyone because it probably won't be reciprocated, but as long as you do what you're supposed to it'll turn out well."
good,"Management=overbearing, poor communication, usually seems overwhelmed and unable to solve any issues or answer any questions you may bring to their attention. Your DM goes months without responding to your questions/concerns whether  it's via text, email, phone call, etc. Coworkers=friendly, job itself=wonderful. Management only cares about numbers, your sales and ability to get people to sign up for rewards/credit cards are what get you praise. You don't get much respect or acknowledgement of any other hard work you may do for the company, even if it is considered outside of your role's responsibilities. If your sales aren't above and beyond, any passion/dedication/hard work won't really be aknowledged. Many employees feel invalidated but stay for each other and their passion for cosmetics & beauty. Lots of opportunity for advancement from starting as a cashier to working as lead, in salon, in brand boutiques, prestige, management roles, etc."
good,Hiring too many associates during holiday season to have them compete for a regular part time position after holiday was a little unnerving. Availability was ignored and scheduling was hard to work with.
good,"Loved my time there, and I love my girls, and I would still be there if the room for advancement had been there, however, certain times were more stressful than others, but all in all, it was a great experience."
good,"When I started with Ulta, I was single and no kids. I could dedicate my life to working whenever and for however long. I enjoyed throwing myself into my work. Now that I have a family, it is no longer conducive to my life, but they still expect the same dedication. I was told the are growth opportunities, but the longer im in the company, them more behind they put me. They trusted the opinion of a over my actual performance. bad manager"
good,"Im normally just told simple things to complete whether it be stocking, redoing a brands section, setting up tables, organizing, etc. I don't work even 15 hours a week and the only people who receive training are prestige beauty advisors. So I only know as much as I came with. The environment is nice and my managers are amazing and willing to teach."
good,"A typical day at work is spent at the cash register taking care of transactions and returns. If there are multiple beauty advisers on shift, we process go-backs and help service customers in finding the right product. Nothing stands out too much. I've learned how to help encourage sales through marketing and targeted speech, as well as how to mentor and direct a team as a more experienced beauty adviser. The team makes the environment."
good,"Ulta is great place to shop but not to work. They don't value their employees. Awful shifts, no recognition, no time off from November through January."
good,"The job itself should be fun and enjoyable. The environment is very tense and uncomfortable. Management likes to micromanage and give the hard working employees the hardest time , while the associates who don’t even carry their own weight can do no wrong. I’ve been through 4 different store managers at this location, turn over is high and they are ALWAYS in the office. Communication between  management and staff could be a lot better, and a sense of teamwork is a concept that has been left behind. Overall the cosmetics industry is fantastic and Ulta has its perks , but just be careful who you trust. This industry is catty and Ulta is no different regardless of the age of the employee."
good,"I worked for Ulta for nearly a year. I started seasonal as a part of task Team and was hired on to the permanent team. After holiday season ended, hours were gone. All of them were put towards cashiers and prestige. As Task, we needed a lot more hours than we were given to get everything Ulta was releasing out. It was ridiculous the amount of work Task was assigned and barely any time to do it. Pay for Task was ridiculously low since we didn’t have to wear makeup, but we had the hardest job. And we were also fill ins to wherever they needed us. So overworked during the few hours we were given, and underpaid for it. Management at my particular store was ridiculous and showed a lot of favoritism. There were cliques within the store and way to much gossip. "
good,"I like working for Ulta, but their compensation rates need to improve. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of because I have been raised to have a good work ethic, and almost never miss a shift. I show up at least 15 minutes early for shifts, I often offer to stay late and help, I have product knowledge and am constantly attempting to learn more about the products. However, I make a little over minimum wage, which I think is ridiculous."
good,"I think it is a good first job for a young girl still in school. Other than that, they give hardly any hours and pay is minimum. The management didn’t really seem to have it all together either."
good,Training was almost nonexistent which was kind of stressful since there were strict rules about certain things. I felt underpowered to do anything on my own bc I didn't know what the rules were and I didn't want to do something wrong. Also I spent a lot less time advising customers than I would have liked. I thought I would get to spend time on the floor assisting customers with makeup but that was less than 10 percent of the time I spent at work but that
good,"Overall ULTA is a good company to work for. Great benefits, opportunity for advancement and decent schedules and commissions. Work-life balance should be addressed"
good,"Overall, working at Ulta was enjoyable. My only qualms were that the managers would speak unkindly about a lot of employees and make the environment unwelcoming. For example, a new manager was hired and she blatantly called my coworker ""stupid and fat."" Also, at my specific store, the managers would give a ridiculous amount of tasks and make the day hectic. I loved my coworkers a lot and always enjoyed working with them. Essentially, I just had an issue with how the managers chose to compose themselves around employees, and then do a quick switch to a positive attitude when costumers approached. Basically all of the managers were fake. I am looking for a new job currently with a more welcoming and laid back environment."
good,Management sucks. Employees are upbeat and knowledgeable l. The company as a whole is awesome to work for. Flexible with scheduling. Fun work atmosphere.
good,"I have been in retail for several years, and I have never worked anywhere with the unrealistic expectations that Ulta expects from its managers. You get close to nothing for payroll, and they need a dozen reports a day that take a long time to finish. Then you get told you can't be in the office to work not the reports. If they took this to a minimum so employees can actually focus on customers, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Unfortunately, its not."
good,I would rather not do a review but the only way I can get passed this portion is to do so. I would like to move through this portion and also use my college degree in a different capacity.
good,"Over all its a good company to work for but they do over work you with little to no benefits, they did treat us nice and were very respectful but they would just over work you a lot"
good,"I like the people I work with but with it being very credit sales heavy, it gets overwhelming. Specifically our location with the amount of credit we sell compared to other locations, our goals are higher. We are expected as our location to be 300% over the general Ulta credit sales goal."
good,I had a seasonal position hoping to become a permanent employee. I did not feel welcomed at all. All the employees had their own cliques and did not bother to help you if you needed it. The employees that were not cashiers are rude to the cashiers and blame them for almost everything. Management needed to tighten up and stand up for employees that were being thrown under the bus. I was so excited to work there but now I don’t even want to step foot in there again. Just wasn’t a pleasant experience at all.
good,"I loved expressing myself and my creativity at Ulta. It was the perfect job for me until I was only given about 2-3 days a week that were only 4 hours each. I couldn't live off that. There is favoritism there. If you're peppy and good at scamming people into the credit card then you are considered manager material and you got as many hours as you desired.. The main manager at the time was extremely nice and always tried to work with me but the other was VERY petty and rude. She has a horrible attitude and always found something wrong with me so she could lecture and criticize me. The main reason I left that job was because of her, the favoritism, and the hours. I was low key bullied and it hurt because I helped open that store with what I thought was going to be my work family."
good,Lots of gossips and even when given your best efforts it’s barely noticed... I was the Trainer and very good at my assignment yet I was bypassed by someone who didn’t have any Put to Store experience because he worked somewhere else with my Manager a few years ago. Office Politics made the assignment too dramatic for my liking.
good,"My job at Ulta worked for what I needed at the time in my life. I was married and had no kids but I knew that when I did want to start a family I could not stay there. I worked shipment and knew it would be impossible to keep my position as the shipment manager while pregnant. However, that was not why I left. The district manager at the time was impossible to please and was verbally abusive to my store manager, who would then take out her anger and frustration out on her workers, myself included. Corporate was notified by several of my workers but nothing was ever resolved and the girls just ended up quitting the company. I left because I was notified that my health insurance benefits were being cancelled at the end of 2015. I did not receive notification until January 2016, AFTER the benefits were terminated and I was sent a letter to my store and not home address."
good,It really depends on who you had to deal with as far as customers and employees which either led to a good or bad day. That is really all I can say when it come to Ulta just like any other job you can have off days.
good,I enjoyed the customers and my coworkers were easu to work with. The employee discount is nice if you're into cosmetics and other beauty needs. Management was poor and ultimately made me look elsewhere for employment. The wage doesn't come close to matching what is expected of you if you desire to move up in the company.
good,I loved working here so much but the management was awful. We were always understaffed and part-time would only get 4-12 hours a week. The manager’s were inexperienced and unprofessional.
good,"It was really fun working here. I recommend this job if you’re in college. The ONLY way you will get benefits here is if you’re a manger. I work 40 plus hours a week I get nothing. Don’t let them trick you into thinking you are great. They treat you like nothing. Only thing they care about is numbers. Don’t care about how you feel or anything. It’s really saddens me because they make you feel like a mule, there is no emotion."
good,Not organized in the management department made a lot of things very difficult to accomplish a day. No having the staff to work on the floor it was really hard to help everyone.
good,I think that the hardest party of the job was learning about all of the new and different products that the store has. There was a lot of manual labor that I did not expect.
good,"I enjoy working at Ulta, but the sales expectations are occasionally hard to reach, and I've received attitude from management before if I was unable to reach them. If the store isn't making it's budget, they have to cut people's hours back, leaving the sales team and floor empty with no one to help guests if need be. I've had co-workers who decided to leave Ulta because they weren't helping them move up and advance in their career even when asked."
good,"The people are rude and things just annoy me , everyone cares about there self and they are not very welcoming to newcomers , even the managers are not very friendly unless it’s to the guests."
good,"I worked for this particular company for two years and have been an active employee for two locations. although they seem to produce a lot of stores, they need to re-train/ train current employees because it is baffling at all the problems two complete locations had with employees and management."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people feel good about themselves through make-up or skin care. The hardest part of the job were the time restraints on getting work projects done.
good,"no professionalism and bully-type environment. There were very lazy co- workers and it was not fair. A lot of people called out for shifts and there are no consequences,"
good,"I learned a lot of customer communication skills, and color.  The pay is terrible. Gm was very unprofessional and so is her cousin which is underneath her."
good,"i enjoyed working at ulta, they had a family like staff, and it was easy to make friends.very friendly atmosphere, compared to what i've heard from other ulta stores."
good,"I enjoyed working here at ulta, the people were nice and the customers were delightful. the management at my location was very hostile and soured the position for me."
good,I was there for about two and a half years. Low staffing and no office time.  I was even scheduled to work by myself with just one hair stylist who doesn't work on the sales floor so I had to ring by myself and run the whole floor by myself.
good,Would have continued to work there had I not had to go on maternity leave. We only got short breaks no how many hours a day we were there. The hardest part of the job was trying to get people to sign up for a credit card. Some won’t budge at all.
good,"Learned a lot from all of my managers. Ulta encourages a ""teamwork"" atmosphere and we were a positive group that really worked efficiently together. Converting guests on a slow day can be your biggest challenge."
good,"Ulta teaches its employees to take bias for action and to empower every team member to use their judgment in running and growing the business. Managers are provided the opportunity to own their business and build a long lasting relationship with suppliers and vendors through trade shows, conferences and consistent product trainings."
good,"The managers told those who wanted to advance within the company they needed growth but never coached how; then hired people off the street as managers. Since the new management has taken over, guest satisfaction has gone down. The associates will do their side work over helping customers. Since I have left, I've had multiple regulars say they've stopped shopping in store because of the horrible guest experience."
good,"While working for a beauty company sounds like the most fun job in the world, Ulta has some room for improvements. My store specifically had a lot of favoritism- when I came on, 5 people had been in my position in a year, and it wasn't hard to see why they struggled to keep someone. The other 4 members of our management team were best friends who hung out all the time outside of work and were treated with strict favoritism in most cases. It was hard to advance within the company, and corporate didn't provide nearly enough training or clear communication of position expectations."
good,"Productive place to work if you want to gain work experience. Wouldn't recommend unless you are in school and all you have to pay for each month is a phone bill. It is retail, so your hours could fluctuate, and it shows in your paystubs."
good,"I was asked to work at Ulta from my beauty school teacher in the past. I was told that there was clientele waiting for me, however I had to covert to get the clients, which they're not that interested in getting their hair done while their shopping. We have to earn a minimum of $50 per shift hour otherwise we only receive minimum wage, therefore if you do not have clients for the day you only receive minimum wage even though we are licensed cosmetologists."
good,"I learned a lot from ulta, and got the experience  to move further in my career, however, they did not utilize my skills to their advantage, had they left me in prestige where I was most valuable, I would have increased sales due to my vast brand knowledge and skills."
good,"A great job for someone just starting out in makeup. Gives the opportunity to learn about many different brands of makeup, haircare, and skincare. The culture of Ulta is all about giving great service therefore, you must be someone who enjoys helping guests and going above and beyond. Job becomes pretty mudane after a while as management doesn't really interact with their employees in a fun and engaging manner. Like most retailers everything is about driving sales. At times I felt overworked and unappreciated. I also didn't feel their was much feedback on performance which let me know the company doesn't care too much about advancing employees or giving merit based raises."
good,"Ulta itself as a company is amazing, however, management can seriously affect the overall job experience. When I first started the company I worked with people who LOVED their job, they made work a place I wanted to be. The customers are amazing, overall Ulta was fine."
good,I was there for about two and a half years. Low staffing and no office time.  I was even scheduled to work by myself with just one hair stylist who doesn't work on the sales floor so I had to ring by myself and run the whole floor by myself.
good,"The company and atmosphere were great, however, when it came to scheduling, it was not uncommon to not be scheduled for weeks at a time. This tactic was utilized with several employees who would be forced to resign and watch a replacement come in within days. Discounts are great and even have incentives for employees. Just unprofessional when it came to scheduling individuals."
good,Ulta is a wonderful job starting out in the beauty industry and can provide great opportunities for the right candidate. If you are wanting a job in the beauty industry specifically focusing on advancing in makeup I would recommend starting with ULTA.
good,Typical day is dealing with customers and stocking shelves along with organizing the cash wrap. I learned that working as a team is very important. This job can be challenging but working in cosmetics is very fun.
good,"Was a lot of fun working here, lots of hard work for sure. Hours were scarce and were minimal and never guaranteed. Everyone hired as part time employee that way you dont get benefits."
good,"Lack of management can create a more stressful environment for employees and when your not getting paid for the job your doing you become resentful. Then it's time to leave, unfortunately."
good,"It was a good job but was definitely different."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at ulta, I had a lot of potential for growth and advancement, my only complaint was that management did not value employees thoughts and opinions."
good,there's a low communication between managers were one may no even know what the other one knows and is no able to assist or help. even associates have no communication. there's no proper training towards all brands so no one knows everything we carry. not even managers.
good,I learned a lot of leadership skills and how to multi task well. It is a good job and team setting environment. Your team becomes your family. The best part of the job was the customers
good,"The job itself is excellent! Making people feel beautiful everyday is exciting and rewarding! And let’s face it playing in makeup all day! How much fun!!! The first manager I worked for was amazing!!! After she moved forward in her career, it changed. The executive management was cliquey, and if you weren’t  apart of that your pretty much nonexistent to them on a promotional basis. I still made well for myself there because I am a people person, and can work with anyone. I just wasn’t apart of the clique mentality, I welcomed everyone so that truly set me apart from the other management. If you get to work with management that is there for the right reason , which is to develop you and to recognize your drive and ambition, you will go far."
good,"Easy going work place, everyone was upbeat. Managers were great at helping out when help was needed. Offered some training on certain brands of make up sometimes."
good,I loved working at Ulta but the scheduling and the work hours were not suitable. I don't know if that was because of the store itself that I worked at or the corporation as a whole. The schedule was never the same each week.
good,"With a fun, young environment with flexible hours, it's a good place for an entry level retail job. You learn the basics of sales, register, stocking, and merchandising. Can be disconnected within the company via the in store management and corporate management. There isn't much room for growth in terms of vertical promotions. Cross training isn't pushed; everyone within their departments learns what they learn and doesn't typically share with others."
good,Typical day at work was checking in with the manager as soon as you get there and go over your goals for the day.  I had a great time doing hair and meeting new people.  I needed more financial consistency.
good,"I would have enjoyed it more had it not been for my poor upper management situation, I think. The pay wasn't bad and the hours weren't terrible for me, but I worked in a mall with limited hours and I didn't do any shipment receiving. The free makeup was definitely nice, but wasn't worth being treated terribly by customers. Never applied for the health insurance."
good,I didnt actually work here while the store in my area was open. I worked here while preparing the store for opening and putting out merchandise. I can say that I was part of the group that was supposed to be hired on and then the owner switched the groups at the last minute and we got let go..
good,I started in the opening year and it was very unbalanced and did not meet my financial needs. The OT was mandated around the holidays after weeks/months of really slow business.
good,"Tons of long hours. Work life balance suffered due to this. It was an ok place to work, but if you want to have time outside of work do not work here. Average 50+ hour work weeks for an entry level base salary."
good,Not a lot of benefits or hours for beauty advisors. So if that’s something that you are looking for then this may not be the fit for you. Great work environment.
good,"I personally liked my GM and my salon manager, but they were awful at handling things. I felt like I constantly had to handle everything, every client situation on my own when a manager should’ve been attending to the issue. When my salon manager left, my GM expected me to handle it all without any conversation about raises or more hours."
good,Was always the one who RAVED about the culture and values of the company.  They always ask what they can do for you to assist in your growth and development.  Things have changed over the last year with less training and education.  Employees are beginning to feel less valued and management has become increasingly more critical and condescending.  Very disappointing where things have gone.
good,"Too many responsibilities without enough pay. Retaliation is a big part of the company. It's a fun atmosphere if you just work as a cashier or beauty advisor, but once you move up, the amount of responsibility is not equivalent to the pay and recognition deserved."
good,I do not recommend this place to work at. The management was always hiring people and then cutting their current employees hours never had enough hours to give everyone and was always way to busy for the number of people that they had on staff at one time.
good,"I worked here years ago in a seasonal position. It was a fast paced environment and there was very little down time so the days went by fast but, the hours were awful.I worked about 2-3 days a week and maybe 5 hours at the most. I think it would be a good first job for someone who was still in school and just needed a little pocket money."
good,"I was able to get $12 an hour as MSC since I had experience. No experience was apparently going to be $10ish. Even though my title included everything managers do, I wasn’t technically a manager so no health benefits. The culture there is good. It was a fun place to work in general. The biggest problem for me was no health insurance and my particular GM was atrocious. Incredibly fake and unprofessional. If you can get health insurance, I’d rate higher."
good,It was ok long hours weekends no holidays can't leave the place to go eat u gotta bring lunch u cant smoke in your car etc. I wouldn't recommend it unless u needed it
good,It was fine at first then i got cut to 12 hours a week and hd to travel about 40 mins from my house to work wasnt worth it also was not hetting paid enough
good,I feel like to really benefit from working at Ulta you cannot have any outside responsibilities - more than taking care of a cat - the long workweeks prevent you from having more than a few hours a day to accomplish anything.
good,"Its alright. dont recommend it to anyone. Not the greatest place for advancement. This company is solely operationally driven, not sales oriented. They appear to be but they arent."
good,"I had nothing bad to say about vendors or beauty advisors, however the management team is always full gossip and insubordination. "
good,"great place to work loved it.    busy and the day goes by fast"
good,You won't be working with makeup unless you work at a boutique or in the prestige department.  You will be cashiering and tasking most times. Must be pro active with the loyalty program and credit cards. You work with a lot of fun people who will teach you a lot. They do have good training videos as well.
good,"it was a really fun company to work for,no room for advancement. also not everyone at my store was able to attend training from vendors, again, no room for advancement."
good,"Most associates who get hired on as ""beauty advisors"" are cashiers. If you want to be in Prestige, you need to work in a boutique or start as a cashier to gain experience. It is great to be able to work full time, with benefits, but I find myself not feeling challenged enough and bored out of my mind."
good,"I once loved working at ulta. I worked around makeup which was one of my passions, but management was dysfunctional for the entirety of my employment there. This is also not a job you can make a living off of. Let me be very clear. Unless you are management, you cannot pay all of your bills or afford your rent working here. Very stingy with hours and getting a raise and/or promotion is very difficult and takes a lot of time."
good,I enjoyed my time there.i would recommend the job to others. It was a clean warehouse. the equipment was well taken care of.The production rates were reasonable to get.
good,"Only 4 hours a day for 3-4 days a week,"
good,"I would come into work and mostly be excited because I enjoyed making guests feel better about themselves, that was the best part about going to my job, some of my co-workers were mellow and enjoyable to be around, but the others not so much. You could tell that there was alot of jealousy between some of the girls. The manager was in my opinion was unprofessional."
good,"This is a good place to get into the cosmetic industry. Ulta does not give you much training, and is not as customer service driven as other places I have worked."
good,Its an ok place to work. Its hard to advance up within the company. I've tried & tried but never had.......................................................
good,"My first day working for Ulta I was very happy, as the days passed I noticed that there was a lack of professionalism with in the store. I loved assisting customers. Every time I began assisting a costumer it became an ordeal. I do know for a fact the management in other Ulta locations is more professional and is better because i have a plethora of friends who work in other location and tell me its nothing like my location which is Clifton NJ."
good,Learned the ins and outs of the retail world. Learned how to sell to customers. Hardest part is the hours and holidays. Really liked the benefits we got from time to time.
good,The CEO is great. Most of the people who work for the company are great. Ulta sells great products and has great Brand Partners. Lots of opportunity for growth.
good,"does have a variety of high and low end cosmetics, fragrances for him & her, hair care products, skin care products, including a full service salon and estetician on staff."
good,"Job can be boring. "
good,Pay is low. Upward mobility is low. People that work there are great. DM is unaware of Gm's lack of work. Not enough time to get tasks done. Employees are expected to be security instead of doing the job they thought they were hired for
good,"Management and supervisors are not experienced, unprofessional and have no idea of organization, they have a big turn over rate and expect you to do the work of 4 Individuals because they can never stay fully staff, favoritism is rampant among the supervisors and employees,  other than the benefits and paid time off ,ULTA sucks"
good,"The workplace culture resembled that of a High School, there was unaddressed separation between Representatives and supervisors which hindered productivity."
good,"Unreliable work hours, easy job, new managers every 6-8 months, Most enjoyable part of the job was working together as a team and reaching expectational daily goals."
good,"It's an okay job if you want beauty retail experience. Hours aren't that great, and not much training is given. Because there's hardly any training/lack of communication from management, a majority of beauty advisors spend most of their shifts talking to each other on their headsets because they don't know what the heck is going on. "
good,"I am thankful for the experience I had at Ulta, but ultimately was not happy with the management and the way things were run. Though I did get along well with my coworkers and managers, I had a hard time with how unorganized the management and operations were. I did learn a lot about customer interaction, making the customers feel welcome and want to come back to our store. Also I enjoyed learning all about merchandising and our ad sets, as well as being on the store shipment team. Overall I am glad that I worked for Ulta but felt that I was not able to grow and improve with the company."
good,"Working at Ulta has come with its ups and downs like any other job. I love the majority of my coworkers and I truly love doing what I was hired to do. I've created great relationships with clients and built my clientele tremendously. The only struggle I dealt with was regarding difficult communication with management and the pointless gossip that would occasionally happen in the store. All in all, a good place to work."
good,"Ulta is a great place to start your career, the pay could be better but the education Ulta gives you make up for the pay. I have met some really great professional working at ulta."
good,the discount is awesome but the management sucks. My store was disorganized and was trained poorly. The co workers are fine. The customers can be difficult to deal with.
good,Great company to work that promotes from within and gives associates many opportunities to grow and develop themselves. Provides a fun and incredibly fast paced working environment.
good,I worked really hard from the bottom all the way to an elite 100k stylist while managing and the DM never recognized the salon for anything it's mostly about the retail aspects.
good,"There is no existing clientele at my location and the company doesn't promote the salon much, much less the skin therapist.  It's very hard to make commission as a new esthetician there.  My sales numbers are always right where they need to be or above the weekly goal, but the way the company has product sales commissions set up I don't receive any commission or incentives.  The best thing about working here is my co-workers.  Everyone is so nice and friendly and there is no cattiness between the girls."
good,"Been working for Ulta for almost a year now.  Love the job itself and the team but working minimum wage and never being allowed to work more than 4 hours at a time and certainly not more than 20 hours in a week really sucks.  Despite working really hard, chances at advancement is next to null.  The discount isn't that amazing either.  Certainly cannot support yourself with this job.  Might be a good fit as a secondary job as schedule is very flexible.  But you'll be a wage slave who gets searched every time you leave the store to make sure you're not stealing.  There are lots of opportunities to win free products and it's not that difficult to win."
good,"The girls were a bit mean at times, but if you can focus on yourself and your work it is a cool place to work. The gratis was awesome and the red and black dresses make you feel all kinds of awesome!"
good,"If you are looking to start off in the makeup business Ulta is great to start with. But, there is not much training if you aren't prestige and when you are in management it's hard to have a life outside work."
good,"\good store to work at if you enjoy makeup, the discount is great. Its a fast paced store, but the people are nice. Hr doesn't seem to care to much about you well being, and the hours are always steady at certain stores."
good,Hard work and low pay. Tough physical job and difficult to keep difficult customer base happy. A typical day at work is being treated miserably by cusomters. The hardest part of the job is to keep a positive disposition while being treated ver poorly by customers.
good,"Fun, upbeat work environment, great personalities, continued education, unrealistic goals for advancement, under paid for work load, favoritism in management"
good,"If you are seasonal you will most likely get a ton of hours which is nice. From the beginning I was told ' If we consider keeping you in January would you be interested?' This idea was never touched on again, though I know they needed help and I was a strong associate. Instead I was told 'isn't it bittersweet its your last day today?' as a way of telling me they weren't going to keep me. Another manager was very sad to see me go & had no idea of the plans."
good,"When run correctly, according to Ulta standards it is a fun, fast-paced environment in which you can learn a lot about beauty products.  It all depends upon the management, as they set the mood.  For someone who loves beauty products this job is for you.  The holidays in retail I believe are the hardest.  The most enjoyable is when you work with a great team & receive deserved recognition through gratis, praise, public acknowledgement etc."
good,Great company to work for with flexible hours especially for students. No benefits if anything bellow full-time management. No time and a half for working on holidays except for thanksgiving. Coworkers become your family and always make work seem like a hobby rather than a job.
good,Great place to gain knowledge on make up and hair items. Fun place for a first time job. Great way to get foot in the door for a cosmetologist
good,The hardest part of my job is the lack of allotted hours for my position.  The focus is more on bringing in money than the retention of its employees.
good,"I am an Esthetician at Ulta for about a year now. I would say its a great entry level job and can be a great career builder. You definitely have to market yourself and if you are not good at sales or closing a sale, you will not succeed or make very much money. I like that the salon is in a retail environment which has its good and bad sides. Good is that you have no clients booked, you can go fishing for one out on the retail floor which they definitely make you do. Its a great way to let the customers know about your services, which a lot of people don't know ULTA even has a salon (which i think they need to REALLY advertise it more other than in the ads they send out). The bad side is that if you can not get any clients to get services, they will send you home. Which is understandable, but if you need stable money and are not willing to work for it, then do not try to work in the salon. Like all work places, some coworkers are better to work with than others. Ulta is a corporation and you have to stay in their cookie cutter way of doing things. If you want to do something different to try and get people into your store or just anything different, you have to get permission from corporate. I love what Ulta has to offer, but there are a few things that I think they are lacking compared to their competitors. My store has a HORRIBLE prestige makeup section. It is embarrassing to color match people for foundations because we have outdated ""makeup stations"". Maybe it is just my store, but I think the stations should be uniform and presentable. Ulta does give ""gratis"" or free makeup"
good,I loved talking hair and makeup all day and had fun with the other employees. Awesome staff and managers were very sweet and fun. Team meetings always fun. Underpaid and store was always understaffed. People don't want to come into the store if they have to wait 20min in the line at the cash registers because only one cashier is on. Floor was always a mess. Not enough help for customers on floor. Loss prevention was horrible.
good,"I would restock shelves and help customers locate products. In an all female environment, a lot of gossip took place. The hardest part of the job was doing manager responsibilities while not being a manager. I was often called in last minute to fill in for others. I enjoyed working with make up, and having a uniform. I liked being appreciated by customers."
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for. However, I do wish that management would help employees pursue further advancement in the company. Day-to-day duties take over long-term goals."
good,Ulta is a wonderful and fun place to work. They have on going training for salon and retail members. Only problem was they have a really high employee turn over rate due to having to work retail hours. Example you are open every holiday and hours vary each week. If you are someone who wants a fun fast paced and very flexible work schedule Ulta is the place for you.
good,"I love my job at Ulta and making customers feel beautiful. My team is amazing and we all work hard and have fun doing it. The only downside is infrequent and minimal pay raises, regardless of how hard we're working to meet budgets and other goals set by corporate. It's hard to put so much effort into a company that only communicates via conference calls to tell us what we need to improve on, without recognizing how far we've come as individuals and as a team."
good,"Would have the day planned by appoinents "
good,"This could be a great place to work but the hours are crazy!! Advancement is good but not hard to get. The drama was little to none, but that has a lot to do with management.overall a great place to work if you can work there hours."
good,"Weekends seemed to be the only shifts where I didn't have to spend all of my time searching for a task to complete. Days were slow and there wasn't enough work to do. Hours kept getting cut back. Management came and went so quickly, things never seemed to get on the right track. There was a high employee turnover rate. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with. I made lifelong friends."
good,A typical day at work was very steady. My experience there taught me a lot of knowledgeable skills of presentation and merchandising. Management was absolutely amazing and very compromising. Co-workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part pf the job was the conflicting hours within my other part time job. The most enjoyable part of the job was excellent customer service.
good,This is another company like so many others that avoids having people even close to full time unless you are in a management position. It is a fun place to work however and the management team at this location are great to work for. They do give a great employee discount and depending on your position you recieve a lot of gratis as well.
good,"You have to have patience, it also depends which location you are at."
good,They hire more people than they need so there's no hours to go around. But everyone's like a family and they're great.
good,This was very fun position because of the educational requirements of my job
good,Working at Ulta has been a great experence because I've learned how they work as a company. They management was pretty great and co-workers were fun and worked hard. The typical day for me at work was unloading delivered product as well as restocking shelves and rearranging displays when nessissary. The hardest part of the job for me was being at the store to unload and restock product befor the store opened. The most enjoyable of the job was working with different people and helping customers get the best expericence at the store. 
good,Very busy growing company. Great benefits and great products to sell. Management is slight disarray.
good,"A typical day at work consist of not so hard labor and friendly and family oriented environment. What I learned is Together Everyone Achieves More! Management is so-so, the good comes with the bad. My co-workers are friendly and mindful. The hardest part of my job is the commute. The most enjoyable part of the job is safety-bingo."
good,"I was not able to keep my position, but when I had the position the store really did much better with their numbers"
good,Can be a fun place to work. Meet lots of different people. Great training. Diversity doesn’t always mean inclusion. Several minorities have been overlooked at career advancement at multiple locations in my over 2 years of working there.
good,"Retail experience is something that is needed within any management role. Cash handling, guest service and heavy work loads with changes once a week. Payroll restrictions and no PL tracking for planning."
good,Ok company to work for if you are a high schooler or just need an extra small income. Hours are only part time unless you are management. The company doesnt hold up their agreements on bonuses and raises
good,I worked freight before store hours and those girls were pretty chill (maybe because its 5am and we to tired for anything haha) My Freight Manager was always a great balance of fun and function tough. But I always felt super judged and not part of the team. Seemed really cliqueish and some girls came off snobby for no reason. You think that whole pretty girl cliche would end after high school. As a company though they were super flexible with hours and worked around my other job which was cool. And almost all of the managers were super sweet.
good,mostly enjoyable but compensation never made up for disadvantages. Couldn't cover the bills off of my salary and worked all weekends. blackout holidays from vacations made traveling home to see family impossible.
good,"if you need more hours this could be a second job "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ulta being a Lead Supervisor. The environment is an exciting one and I always looked forward to working with my team each day. My GM was outstanding at their job and helping me to reach new heights within the company; however, the way in which Ulta Beauty operates as a whole is disappointing. In my time of employment, it seemed the company was not creating an environment for long-term employment. They were not employee friendly when it came to health and family emergencies. Management communication with employees was stressful and sometimes non-existent. I felt there needed to be more structure when it came down to the brass tax of store-operations and the internal workings."
good,"It's a good job to be just that, a job. It's not the best place to turn into a career. It's honestly a good company but not the best for supporting a family"
good,"The manager pushed on to make credit card sales, if you didnt then you were fired. They get truck 2 days a week so it would start at 6 am and go till 12 pm."
good,"Potential for growth within company however, a lot of responsibility with unfair pay. Not enough support from district manager. Great with educating the team with vendors and brands"
good,Productive workplace very fast paced company. I love going to work. management made you feel happy and also made you want to work everyday. Very great company to work for.
good,"You are always doing something whether it be operations or guest servicing. There isn't a lot of training, you learn more as you go when it comes to any positions. The workplace environment depends on the management on whether or not you will have fun while working."
good,High Paced and energetic place to work. Nice co-workers and lots to learn. I looked forward to working every day and managers are easy to work for. I would recommend this place for part time employment.
good,"At the time that I worked there, my employer was too result-oriented and not concerned enough with the comfort and job satisfaction of her employees. As such, since we were unhappy with the way we were being directed and evaluated, the overall attitude was reluctant and resentful, although we did a remarkable job of not letting that frustration affect customer satisfaction. Additionally, since we had a common enemy to unite us, we did function well as a team."
good,The overall job is a good job to have even though it was temp to hire but they chose to let me go but the job was an excellent place to work and the employee where good to work with...
good,"Typical Tasks included: Greeting"
good,Great for beginning esthetician . The pay is just not enough to support a family. I decided to go back to school and further my education. I went back to school for a laser technician.
good,"It was a cool experience working there, personally I feel like there was just really no room for growth. Management was childish too and no good communication skills."
good,Ulta was fun until it went to Ecom only. No solid leadership training provided to supervisors or managers. Work environment was pretty laid back. Associates were fun.
good,"At the location I worked at, the pay was low for the work we performed and the store manager of this location was rude and made up lies to why I wasn't able to become a prestige consultant"
good,I love the beauty industry and I have a decent background in sales and customer service as well. This job would've been great when I was still an undergrad student in college however the hours were not stable and as a Beauty Advisor there are no options for a full-time position.
good,"As an associate manager at Ulta, overall the job wasn't awful but the pay does not match up to the amount of work expected from you. Always short staffed and a lot of the work is put on management because of it. Nice discounts and free product.  Loss prevention feels like a lost cause."
good,"i enjoyed working at ulta because I love to talk with people and help them find what they're looking for. I enjoyed gaining sales experience, but it became stressful as you were required to get credit cards and up-sell in order to keep your hours. I also did not enjoy truck or task days, you don't get breaks and often could not leave until your task was completed. They are sometimes unwilling to be flexible with school schedules and traveling. Overall though, enjoyed working with teammates and clients to promote fun environment."
good,Management is unreliable and frustrating to work with. They are stubborn and flay favorites with certain employees. They are also unorganized. Not a fan.
good,This was a good job to have over the holiday but long term the hours and labour necessary to keep the store running were a bit overwhelming for part-time.
good,i paid about half my paycheck on gas to get to and from with it being a 35 minute drive. very competitive yet exciting work culture. fun staff and amazing and understanding bosses
good,I made quick connections and moved up fairly fast. I love the job i do there and what ulta stands for but management does not communicate well or know how to properly manage fairly.
good,"Went in, did tasks assigned to me and helped customers. Enjoyed the holiday season as there were so many new products. Hardest part was actually learning about the zillion products that Ulta has."
good,The only way you'll make anywhere near a living wage as a skin therapist at Ulta is if you've been working there 3+ years. 99% of guests walking into Ulta have no idea they even have a spa or do any sort of facial services because the company doesn't do any advertising for it at all.  Prepare to swallow your pride and basically beg anyone that enters the store to purchase a facial from you if you ever expect to get/retain any clients at all. The pros of working as a skin therapist at Ulta are that the staff and managers are friendly and supportive and the training at the Dermalogica Institute is great and of course the free services and employee discount.
good,It is very hard to train and development associates into different roles with the amount of payroll that is given stores.  The GM and managers must be register backup and security to protect high theft items such as fragrance and pallets in Prestige
good,"Ulta was a decent first job. I made (what I thought at the time were) decent wages. I enjoyed the skincare, hair, and makeup trainings as well. I got to learn a lot about something I was interested in. Management was a wreck at the time but has turned over since then so I'm sure it's improved vastly. Would recommend to anyone looking for retail experience in an entry level job."
good,"I think I would've had a better experience at a different location. The management at my store wasn't understanding. It's also not a job to live off of, I've gotten $80 checks and pay is biweekly. It's good if you can get in full time as a brand advisor (MAC, Benefit, Lancome) or as a hair stylist/esthetician."
good,"Enjoyed working here, but as a stylist wished I was paid a bit more hourly! "
good,I was a manager at ulta and compensated well for what I was responsible for. The associates really suffered because training was all module based with VERY limited hands on training. The hours given from corporate were limited and the hiring demands were unrealistic.
good,"If you're looking to provide for your family, this job isn't for you unless you're lucky enough to land a managerial position or can advance into one, if there's an opening, but that has not been the case for me. The 29 hours I agreed to have no been provided. I'm a lead cashier and I'm lucky to hit 20 hrs. per week."
good,Fun place to work and a great learning experience. The managers were nice most of them. The CEO OF the company is great. It taught me a lot about make-up too.
good,Ulta was an average job with management that was not the best. The hours were long and sometimes we would have to work 8+ hours without even being able to stop for a drink of water.
good,Good starter job for anyone looking to go into the beauty industry but managers can make or break the experience. And the turn over is extremely high.
good,"My only complaints about ULTA is the low pay for stylists, & the “more than 5 min late, get a point, 8 points & you’re fired system”. It’s unrealistic. Other than that, ULTA was a fun place to work."
good,"It’s fun, especially with everyone I work with! I get a long with almost everybody. The team works great together. Couldnt have asked for a better job"
good,"I love my job with Ulta and would definitely love to remain.  Nevertheless, due to upper management I am considering leaving my position.  The GM is very disrespectful, dishonest, retaliatory, deceitful and is down right a “MEAN GIRL”.  The company suggests an “open door policy”, nevertheless, this is not advised.  Retaliation is at it’s best and other employees are recruited to assist. GMs and up are not helded to the company’s standards.  The  GMs and DMs are managed when numbers are involved but when it is pertaining to lower employees, not much consideration is given.  This type of behavior makes this company, at the store level, a hostile environment."
good,Good seasonal job. It was a fine work environment even though there were definitely friends groups within the staff that weren’t all that welcoming. But it’s just a job
good,"-Training is at a bare minimum"
good,The company has given me good experience but overall I am looking for something that I can make more money /benefits in and that I could have a different work schedule in as well.
good,Great place if you love makeup but the managers can really make or break the job. If you were caught talking to another associate you were given 4 other tasks on top of your 30 other tasks for the day as well as maintaining your sales for that day and the managers would get mad if you didn't maintain your sales goals. They get mad if you're full time and try to take a sick day and even make you find someone to work for you even through you give them months vacation notice. Just another corporate chain that only cares if you make them money.
good,"I was only a seasonal worker, so I do not have all the answers. From the little time I did work there, I honestly did not like it. Management was not the greatest at the time, but I've heard that it has improved greatly."
good,"It was a great job to have if you are a high school student. This job does not offer enough hours. If you have real monthly bills, this is definitely not the job for you."
good,"Fun place to work but certain management will ruin the business    They always hire management that doesn’t work or just sits in the office all day "
good,"Its a good job as a hairstylist; get your hair done for free or facial (the person doing the service is suppose to get commission), get training on new trends or makeup, play in make up ect, 50% off waxing from benefits and 25% off sale price on beauty products."
good,"When I first got the job it felt like a dream. A makeup store?? Oh yes. But as time went on, things were very difficult to get me to stay. We didn’t have a general manager for 3 months. There was very poor organization. It was also very cliquey. The managers were all friends and were friends with senior employees, whenever they’d stand in a huddle talking about non work related things they made newbies do the flipping and go backs, and their “friends” didn’t have to do much at all. Ultimately, I quit. That is to say I had enough points from calling in to be fired, but i shimmied them. It was due to never wanting to be in that environment. I was praised on my bubbly personality in the interview, but that was quickly drained by the environment of the store. I mean, it’s a neat job, and I stayed as long as I did for the discounts. I wouldn’t “recommend”, but if you want to do it, then I mean I guess. I would have rather been at the pet store next door."
good,They are always very flexible with the schedule. Ulta  overall is a very upbeat environment to work in. I enjoy working here and I appreciate the management staff
good,"Don't expect too much leeway working here.  Starting out you're bound to the register alone.  There's little to no further development or training unless the managers like you, So I'd suggest asking as many questions as possible when given the chance. "
good,The itself job was not difficult and it was by far one of the best customer service jobs. Management was unprofessional and there was a lot of favoritism.
good,"I had a good experience, and enjoyed working there. I would love to go back and work there again. If you love beauty and know more about it, it would be a easy and steady job."
good,"This was a temporary job. "
good,If you have a passion for the cosmetic industry you will love the job. you will feel overworked and underpaid but at times it will be worth it. The job is great if you want be in the industry but have no experience.
good,"It’s a good to work place especially if you love make up, but the pay isn’t very good or fair. I was part time working full time. I got one dollar raise for being there lead cashier but 11 dollars isn’t much. Especially when your doing everything. Like stock, cashiering, training new hires, I had to set up the fixtures that’s the make up goes on and much more. It was a lot. I loved the job for the make up and my employees but the pay wasn’t really worth it."
good,It was a nice place to work just didn't enjoy the hours once my daughter was born. I like to be with my family more. Great group of women who work there.
good,Calls you in almost every day you have off. Unrealistic goals. Most of management is not qualified. The only good thing about the job was the discount. Working during the holidays=no life and no days off.
good,Days could start very early and you were expected to get a lot done before store opening. Holiday hours are difficult. The hardest part of the job was learning adequate information about the products you're selling. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping women solve skin concerns/problems.
good,love it my store was very flexible with my school schedule. Also was able to transfer to a store closer to campus inorder for me to work through the year
good,"Good starting job. Typical retail atmosphere. On feet all day, need comfy shoes. Make-up is a must. Associates are fun to work with but it is difficult to move up in company"
good,"Ulta wants to be recognized as supportive of Protected groups and promotions seem to be based on this rather than actual qualifications and experience. So if you are not in the the protected group, say you're supposedly in a  non discriminated race,sexual preference, etc... and have more experience and education than the candidate who would be considered in the Protected groups who has no or little experience and education, you will lose the posistion to the more protected class candidate. Making Management very cliquey and actually appearing to favor the protected groups. I am not at all prejudice in any way but this seems to be reverse discrimination and no matter the incompetence or violation of policies these protected ones have comitted, they will continue to be promoted. While you, who have proven goal achievement and an extensive amount of experience will never move out of your hired position. "
good,Ulta is a great place to express yourself creatively through makeup. It enables you to be artistic with a new medium and encourages you to think outside of the box.
good,"I went into this job thinking I would love it since I love working with makeup and people. However, management made it a terrible experience. Not only are they a bunch of snooty girls running the place, but they are demanding and act like they are god himself. Forget about the fact that you're talented with makeup. All that matters is if you sell credit cards and the rewards program. Discount also not worth it. Like you wanna work with makeup and also get good discounts, but it barely counts. Worked with some cool people but for the most part its snob city."
good,"The job was fun and fast paced when the work was coming in. I enjoyed working here, only thing I would have changed was the way they let all of us temps go. No call, text or email was sent out over the weekend. We had to be notified by clocking in and seeing an 'X' appear."
good,"With any corporation, you're going to have to meet their unrealistic expectations. I worked in the salon so getting sales and add ons are required. If I didn't have my kind-hearted manager at the time, I wouldn't have stayed for as long as I did. "
good,"The day started with cleaning and restocking shelves and helping customers with products.  We provided demos on makeup application.  I would then direct patrons to section of store to locate specific skin care and makeup products that would best fit their needs; ring up sales on cash register."
good,"Very productive place to work, room for advancement. great place to work. the most enjoyable part was the fast pace and having one on ones with associates."
good,"ULTA is a good company for someone who wants to be in a multi brand beauty sales environment, someone that like big box beauty stores to work in and grow with."
good,"For a college student who loves makeup and the beauty community, I was content with my position at Ulta for the short time I was there. Although I felt like management was a bit harsh with us girl, especially since a lot of us were young, but it was good enough."
good,I only worked there for  a short time not long enough to make a decision. The coworkers and managers were very friendly and helpful with learning basic jobs.
good,It was to stressful management had favorites made other do double work . If they say you were fast at your job you would be in the busy areas all day and expected to finish.
good,I worked at Ulta for about a year and Ioved my overall job and got to be surrounded by makeup all day! Al though the managment was very unprofessional and unorganized making it a hard environment to work in.
good,"I love my managers, I'll start with that. If it was not for my awesome managers I would have left a long time ago. The hardest part of work at Ulta is the crazy customers, but it hardens you and you get used to it after a couple months. I have been with the company for 2 years and in the last year the only raise I received was 10 cents which sucks. Also, my specific location corporate would not pay for our parking and it would usually come out to 18$ a day when I only make 13.60 an hour. They only pay for the General manager and OPs. It's a job, what can I say."
good,"I liked my coworkers at ulta and for the most part enjoyed my time there as well.  I did not like how competitive it was for hours as well as the fact they never promoted anyone it felt like, just hired from the outside.  Working there was easy and hard work was appreciated."
good,"I learned about products I never knew about, which I use now. They taught me how to be more open with my communication skills. My favorite part of this job was being the beauty advisor."
good,Manage your time wisely and be sure you can handle a lot of responsibility because you might not always get the support you need from fellow managers/co workers.
good,"I learned a great deal about customer service, interacting with other employees.  The management changed often.  Hardest part was leaving good customers and friendships I built along the way.  Workplace culture was diversified.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy so they would enjoy their next Ulta experience.  I made many friends in the short five years I worked there and still enjoy those friendships now."
good,"management sucked. management tend to feel as though they are above the beauty advisors. the hours sucked, i would recommend this job if you are a college student."
good,Fun and fast place to work. During my time we had lack of management and supplies were always running low or out so ran into problems with angry clients
good,Good skills on retail sales good experience with employees early long hours stocking overall good place to work good people stressful in some areasDiscounts different all the time and a lot of areas a lot of labor and push
good,The company is a great company with great people. people need to be train better. Upper management is races. But one person doesn't make it a bad store.
good,The boss was a whack job and had really bad mood swings due to what me and a couple co workers was drugs. She took anger and frustrations out on the staff and made working less fun and more miserable.
good,"Ulta is a relatively new company and they are trying to figure out everything. Ulta has great potential to be an amazing company to work for, but they are not there yet. The opportunities for advancement are rigged by local management. The beauty advisors are usually overworked and underpaid. There needs to be better management training and the upper management needs to be more involved in making sure the store managers are actually doing what they are supposed to do. I have met lifelong friends from co-workers and customers. It can be a fun job if you love beauty and interacting with customers."
good,Ulta is really great about continuing education and training which ends up benefitting everyone. They are also great about your knowing as much as you can about all of the brands through training and giving gratis to their employees.
good,Not the best pay and to be honest it is quite disheartening to destroy all the merchandise that is deemed damaged or discontinued. It is quite wasteful.
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time working at Ulta  at first. There’s an amazing discount for employees plus, extra discounts sometimes."
good,"The good parts are the discounts, free unlimited training w/Dermalogica, and working with the different skincare and makeup vendors. The company could be more up-to-date with their skincare treatments. Marketing for skincare therapist could be better but I guess it helps you to gain marketing experience for yourself. I was lucky to have a really supportive salon team. The stylists were all very helpful and fun to work with. My manager was cool and allowed flexibility with my schedule. My manager was a bit more concerned with the stylist. My biggest pro would be the committed clients I had. "
good,"Great people, easy training, fun work but terrible management."
good,"was skeptical about this job at first but it was a nice atmosphere. calm most of the time and very easy job to do. Also it was very hands-on, which attracted me a lot because I was able to learn and teach from it"
good,"Overall, working for Ulta was a great experience. Despite having no prior retail experience, I fit in to the store well and learned a lot in a short amount of time. I enjoyed working in the beauty industry and being surrounded by coworkers who shared my excitement for makeup made for a great team relationship."
good,"I hired in as a regular beauty adviser and was encouraged to apply for one of the manned boutique positions which I did. I was not told that there would be monetary goals to meet and that the position was aggressive sales. I was expecting to be serving the public much as a general beauty adviser but in the specialty boutique. Word to the wise: Ask lots of questions."
good,"The schedule of tue and thurs 11-4 and every Sat 11-7 and Sun 11-5. This  was the only turnoff to working there, otherwise i really liked the management."
good,A typical day at work is assisting customers with their purchases and answer any questions they may have about the myriad of makeup products we sell. It's extremely important to have knowledge about a majority of the products in store and if you don't know just ask another associate.
good,"It was an ok place to work but the hours were long and it was fast paced but if the work was slow you were sent home, so you never really got the hours."
good,"You learn a great deal about working with every customer type and a variety of co-worker personality types, it was a very diverse mix of people that worked at this location"
good,"It was an easy seasonal job, definitely helped pay my bills and great for school, didn’t feel as welcomed though, the ladies there had a friendly pact you weren’t really recognized for you hard work"
good,"Learned a lot, not for me. Management was good, some in the beginning were not very helpful. Some didn't treat there emloyess as people, didn't communicate"
good,"I did enjoy working at Ulta, however management was not supportive. I felt that she was not fair, did not hold the same standards to herself that she set on us, and did not uphold a level of integrity upper management should."
good,no benefits barely above minimum wage nice environment but little help from management. You can't get the hours necessary to pay your bills and they are unwilling to increase
good,"The management is organized, but the managers are so effing rude.  There is a point system for tardies that is ridiculous. I wish everybody wasnt so uptight. i get it yall promote makeup, but you dont have to be rude about it.   Even the guests would come up to me, having no authority with management, they would complain."
good,"It was a temporary position, but I was never trained and when I had questions regarding merchandise or specific questions from customers, management treated me as lesser. It was demoralizing, but when I didn’t have to interact with management, it wasn’t a bad job.  Something else that needs further attention: the GWP (gift with purchase) inventory and schedule with correlating products was incredibly disorganised and we were out of stock on most freebies."
good,"While I worked at Ulta I was bullied by the same individuals everyday. Our management was notified more than once that this happened.  Nothing was done about it, other than that, good place to work. good money & benefits."
good,"Work was fine, I was a Merchandise & Service Coordinator. The main issue I had was with upper management not holding the General Manager responsible for not doing her job, coming in late, etc. This workplace environment was also entirely too much drama for my liking."
good,"If makeup is your passion,this is a fun place to work. However, the  pay was awful for what you have to do and put up with on a daily basis and the management was awful."
good,not a good place to work  people were very unfriendly and not good. i like my job but not the people i worked with. they are not a supportive company and very herd to work with
good,"A typical day is very fast paced and management want you to move quickly, especially at the front register as lines can get very long. Overall not a bad experience working there, its what you make of it though."
good,"company has great people to work with"
good,worked the front register as a cashier. learned how to properly advertise specials. management was great. a great group of staff. diverse and unique and full of positivity
good,"A typical day at work was quick paced. There were many tasks to do, but that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The workplace environment was fun and productive."
good,"Overall, the job is okay for someone with no experience in cosmetics. The discount is a very nice bonus. My biggest issue with the company is their cap off in terms of pay. They will not pay for their valued employees."
good,If you love beauty Ulta is the place to be and grow.  Everyday provides exciting new chances to meet new people and grow and learn about what people expect from the beauty industry.
good,"Overall my experience was pretty good, I opened the store the managers was very well mannered. The only thing was they led us to believe we were hired on full time but the let alot of employees go because it was only temporary in order to open the store"
good,"it was a okay place to work, the hours was slim but it was temporary. A typical day it was medium pace, the manager was okay, i enjoyed more than anything interacting with customers an making sure they were satisfied before leaving."
good,Great work experience for people looking for job experience. Easy to move up in the company. Great discount. Must have open availability if you want hours.
good,It was very fast-paced and unorganized at the one that i worked at. It was hard to ever request time off due to the scheduling body. There were many issues
good,Nice place!  Fun discounts and update on the new products.   Can get competitive.   Lovely atmosphere.  Learned a lot from my managers and team. Workplace culture is super chill tough occasionally competitive.
good,This place I'm not too sure about. Words cannot explain what I suffered there mentally. It was exhausting. I loved my job and they just decided to let me go.
good,"A typical day would be opening the store by checking product, setting up promotional signs, and cleaning. The store expects you to balance manning the cash register with helping customers on the floor. Employees are to be very hands on and detailed with assitance, giving their full attention to the guests question or concern."
good,"Working with ULTA is a decent part-time job. If you like working in the beauty industry this would be a great starting place. It may just be my personal experience but I was not happy with my management and there was some serious lack of communication going on. The hardest part of the job was basically having to compete with my co-workers to get hours. Like any retail company it's all a numbers game, and if you aren't getting good scores you get less hours."
good,do not want to comment at this time.  I honestly do not feel comfortable commenting about my current employer.  I will greatly miss my team I hope who ever takes my spot treats them well.
good,i do love it at ulta. it was a great work envorment and so much fun to be surrounded by all the makeup! great place to work.wish there was more room for advancement.
good,Didn't like the travel time and the supervisor wasn't helpful. The coworkers were ok. I worked 3rd shift so it was lots of VTO. Hardest part of the job was stayin woke
good,"A typical day at work involved, setting displays, stocking shelves, doing inventory, opening the store, working the cash wrap and greeting and assisting guests."
good,"Ulta is a good place to work if you like retail and cosmetics. Unfortunately, for me, I am not a person who knows a lot about make up and therefore, felt that this job was not for me."
good,"the people you meet is a great advantage but the pay is horrible. Management is great, but for the salon it is extremely slow. I have met a lot of great people and I love what I do but the commission is unfair and their is no opportunity for growth."
good,it was a good starting job. I did not intend to stray there because I was still in school. The location of the ulta I worked at was pretty sketchy. we had a lot of robberies. Probably would not work there again because of all of that.
good,"It's very hard to succeed there unless you already have a clientele.  You were expected to recruit your own clients off of the sales floor and management had very little to do with helping you build your business. They set arbitrary goals for you and expect you to meet them, or they'll cut your hours. They do not give stylists full time hours until they make $1000 a week and in the meantime they pay you $10/hr and give you 20hrs a week so its impossible to make a living for at least the first 6 months. I was very excited to start working for ULTA, and I was incredibly dissappointed in my experience there."
good,"i enjoyed working at ulta,it was a fun and inviting place to work.all of my  coworkers were really nice and very informative, they knew there job and what they were supposed to do and were very helpful"
good,not enough managed hours to make a living and the managers would always call me in on scheduled days off. They should know how to budget a schedule as a company
good,"Incredibly fast paced work environment. Mild politics and long hours. Growing, stable company expanding supply chain network with opportunities to learn a lot."
good,ulta in general is an amazing company and I truly do love them but our store is incredibly slow which makes building a clientele borderline impossible. there have also been some management issues but if I got into that I would be here all day.
good,This job was very demanding. A typical day at work is very fast paced. I enjoyed learning new products. AS well as helping customers with beauty needs.
good,"I worked there for a few months as a cashier. Mainly stayed up front cashiering people. Every once in awhile I was put on the floor to help customers finding what they need. Only downside of this, there was no specific training for a cashier when put on the floor."
good,I love the the store but I dislike upper management all they really know is numbers but don't understand the salon and or the beauty  industry and how to tell you how to do your job that they don't under
good,"Great place to work at first, "
good,"Ulta is a great place to work and you learn a lot of great information and skills working here. There are times when you can get gratis and employees get extra discounts on top of their 25% off. I would however recommend Ulta to someone that's not married or has children, your paycheck is hardly enough for one person to live off.  Only assistant managers and general managers are full time, everyone else is part time. Hours are terrible and very inconsistent. Some associates work only one day a week while others can work up to 4-5, it doesn't matter how long you've been there either."
good,"The GM was only at work max 45 hours a week and if you had questions or concerns, she wouldn't answer her phone. Some of the managers were cut throat."
good,Nothing too special just wasn’t the right place for me personally.  I guess it’s just based on how you like the environment in the place you work at to be honest.
good,Its a great place to work at with nice coworkers. It just doesnt pay anything for a company that makes $12.92 billion dollars a year. For a company who would be no where without their employees.
good,"As a company, Ulta I have found is stellar in customer service. The key is the dedication of store management and customer service team. When the management fails the team fails and the customer is the one that suffers."
good,The rules only apply if they want them to apply.  Certain ones can get away with everything while others are written up for nothing. It would be fantastic if the expectations were clear and remained that way.
good,"overall its good and all but not a lot of hours given and low staffed  , when its busy it really well , everyone helps with what they can , usually is hasn't been busy"
good,"Too much responsiblity with not enough of a salary.Responsible for sales and service, setting up visual standards, bookkeeping, etc. You run your counter as a counter manager but your getting paid as an employee who is only responsible for sales."
good,"Mostly easy going environment, great people and relationships, management could improve as well as pay and hours. Best part is working in an environment you enjoy and in makeup, worst part is not being able to make a living on your salary."
good,The Ulta in particular that I worked at was an okay environment. The GM quit and they were in a transition phase. It was extremely hard to take my required breaks as the managers went to smoke and wouldn't let me go
good,It really just depends on what you are doing in the company. If you are there for the discount then you will love it. If you are there to learn out about makeup you wont learn anything
good,"Now Under new management hoping this get better, I have worked for ulta for 2yrs now I think it's time for a change . Since we have no salon manager things have been difficult."
good,Your primary job is checking people out and helping customers find products. Management is good but inconsistent at times. Other associates are friendly.
good,"Ulta salon is my first official job out of cosmetology school. My manager is great, the environment is good. They put you on the floor right away and my manager gives me proper training. However I'm disturbed by the pay rate, and its sometimes completely dead. I know being a new stylist I'm still learning and should be grateful for my experience, but if I'm on the floor already I want to be paid for my efforts. I feel like I might as well just be assisting. Its minimum wage plus tips. But you don't get much more than 1 or 2 clients a day, 3 on a busy day. You can make commission on your services, however it's less than half and its almost impossible to commission out unless you have 2 highlight clients a day! If you commission out they take away your minimum wage hourly rate for that week. When I was in my interview and had first started working there they had acted like it would be so easy to commission out. I wish they would have been a little more honest. PLUS, They don't advertise! "
good,early mornings and late nights were one of my main reasons for leaving. There was also a lack of benefits. Certain jobs will never advance particularly below assistant managers.
good,Many people do not know that there is a salon in Ulta.  It is your job to make it know if your are an employe in the salon.  Ulta utilizes the retail enviornment to real in salon clientl sometimes it works and someitmes it doesnt.  If your not busy in the Salon your woking it the retail end.  Like I said its not for everyone.  Make sure if your a manager your understand the coupons and how they work and ask about paperwork where its store and how long its stored especially from former management or you will be held accountable.
good,"-busy days filled with guests and tasks"
good,"Once again, my experience with the company was not the experience the rest of my coworkers had. Just like any job, there are things you love a dislike."
good,"Typical day at work if no one is scheduled on your book is converting on the retail floor, helping customers, advertising your treatments and cleaning. Management is super nice and respectful. The hardest part of the job is to make sure your book is always full every time you come into work and trying to avoid No Shows and last minute Cancellations. The most enjoyable part of the job is your clients appreciation and feeling like you've done a good job and helped someone with their skin concerns or for hair stylists helping someone fixing their hair and the clients appreciation from that."
good,"Working at Ulta as a General manager has been an extremely difficult role. I come from several years of leadership under my belt, yet this one challenges me significantly. There are unique pros and cons that are store specific. The most challenging part of my role is maintaining a dream team at all times. Turnover is inevitable in any atmosphere, but i've experienced it at an exponential rate (managers and down). A lot of that, however, has to do with the lack of accountability on the individual as well as ethic to work. As a general manager my work life balance is often compromised due to staffing and lack of management coverage in-house. That has been a defeating part of the job, but it is a great and certainly exciting industry for the beauty enthusiast. We are growing rapidly. Senior leadership is inspiring and pulling us in the right direction. The priorities shift, quickly, but that is all to support the bottom line (make those sales). Just keep up with the pace and make the most of each day."
good,"While I worked there, the management was sometimes unorganized, in terms of scheduling hours and some days it was understaffed. Being a regular sales associate requires that you know how to multi-task and are organized, but especially knowing how to give exceptional costumer service, which some employees I knew at the time (and even managers) lacked."
good,"As a beauty advisor I pretty much stood behind the register and that was about it. It was nearly impossible to get someone to cover your shift, and I never went through a legitimate training period. But, I did gain a lot of knowledge about different makeup lines."
good,skin therapist duties with sales floor experience is what they are looking for and helpful with your growth. They do the level jump system and you can decide if/when to jump based on your work
good,Great place to work part time while youre in school. Get a nice little discount and you just walk around doing people's make up. The management are usually people who have been out of high school for a couple of years and don't really got anything going for them so they take really great pride in bossing everyone around. If you keep your head down they leave you alone.
good,"It is a unique place to work, it has a hair salon, a make up section, they do make up events that are fun. I enjoyed the customers who came into the store and helping them find products."
good,"ok work environment. job is very simple, you help customers all day. management was relaxed, didn't bother anyone. Discounts were a plus. downside the pay"
good,"Ulta is a fast growing company that offers a lot of opportunities in a wide range of functions.  Compensation is competitive, and includes a bonus structure and 401k contribution.  there is a downtown office that employees are able to use 1 day a week, which is more convenient for those living in the city than the main campus in Bolingbrook."
good,"great overall experience, management needs more training. Corporate partners hardly visit stores and do not listen to store level associates and correct unfairness"
good,The experience was different than what I was accustomed to. The hardest thing was trying to stock the materials on high shelves in the back. Other than that everyone was friendly and I furthered my education when it came to cosmetics.
good,My experience at Ulta Beauty was okay. The job was very enjoyable whereas the management was slightly less than enjoyable. Very easy going job to perform.
good,"Ulta is a good place to learn about cross promotion. Learning to link makeup and beauty products, nail products and at home  maintenance hair care products, can drive your behind the chair income."
good,"High management and associate turn over, loved working with the associates and guest but was really hard to work with outdated management. General manager is very seditive in position"
good,helping people with cosmetics and learning about the different products that we have. I enjoyed playing in the makeup and doing demos on customers. Stocking and cleaning the store was a nice way to show that are store was a comfortable and nice place to shop
good,"Ulta is a great place to get your foot in the door. Not so easy to move up or pay your rent. I enjoyed my time there, but upper management does not listen to lower management, but I suppose that's corporate for you."
good,worked there for a little while only due to the fact it was a temporary job. I started in the fall time and before it was even spring time i was laid off.
good,"Overall a great company to work for, I loved what I did in operations it  gave me the opportunity to grow and learn within my field as well as all aspects of the business. What I most enjoyed was meeting and working with a diverse culture of people, as well as the few friends I made along the way. The hardest part of the job was finding a work to life balance, I'm a workaholic and take my work seriously, I will do what it takes to ensure all deadlines are met on or before there time."
good,i enjoyed my coworkers very much. during the holidays it was very stressful being a high volume store. only thing i wish was provided was some sort of training
good,"The culture of Ulta as a company is great. They have a lot of detailed information on product knowledge, and high standards on communication and goals. Unfortunately management from store to store is not always consistent."
good,"Seasonal employment. Very enjoyable ,No explanation given for not being made permanent.Training could have been more hands on, especially with cash register computer"
good,This company has a good idea and concept but the were not caring to their employees and expected goals that were impossible to meet and did not care about your needs.
good,"Fun workplace, everyone has a passion for what they do! Everyone is great at working together and if you need help other coworkers are happy to help with a smile."
good,Within 5 months all 5 managers had left.Difficult to get hours. Almost every employee was given four hours a week. Very frustrating. But good benefits
good,"It can be very ""catty"" at times. It does offer decent benefits though, like getting free makeup and hair products if you sign up enough customers for rewards cards. I'm not crazy about the management, or the lack of hours. But other than that it's a good place to start for someone looking to pursue a career in beauty."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ulta, however, I needed to relocate to an area where there is no Ulta. I loved the variety of products that Ulta carries."
good,A typicalday of work was great as far as being challenging and keeping busy. Lots of interaction with guests and other associates.Learned how to open and organize new stores and how to operationally bring a store together.The most challenging part of the job was communicating with HR and and having consistent upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job was guest service and instore training.
good,working for Ulta was mostly a pleasant expeirence.I worked with a great supportive group of people. I liked that I was offered continuing  education. I did not like the high turnover of management. The most enjoyable part of the job was making my clients happy. the hardest part of the job was long hours on your feet. I learned that no matter how competitive the workplace is staying honest and true to yourself is key to survival.
good,It is a fun place to work and you never get tired of trying out new products and seeing what's available on the marketplace. i enjoy working in the salon area with the stylists. I get recommendations from them to their customers.
good,I worked here during the holiday season. it was pretty fun. I enjoyed being able to give people my opinions on make up and what was good and what i thought wasnt good.
good,I worked overly hard without being thanked for working so hard. I was always the one they called when someone did not come in even if I was busy. But I still like working with the product.
good,"Depending on your position, a typical day consists of assisting guests with any questions and beauty needs, and stocking, cleaning and facing in your down-time. Management tends to be approachable."
good,"ultra is and ok company if you are young and need them to work with your times, that is a job for you. Personally it wasn't a bad job I was temp and it wasn't paying my bills needed something more."
good,Fast paced retail environment with aggressive sales goals.  Company training and support is above average and continuous improvement is applauded and supported.
good,"This job serves more for fast paced people. The management is alright but have little consideration towards student employees and their load of work for school. There's a lot of favoritism, and tenures like to throw all the work at the new associates instead of helping and the managers don't say anything about it. I find it extremely unfair. The managers as well are lazy and like to make associates pick up their mess. That is a big no in my opinion. The hours are also terrible. They like to make associates close super late at night and make them open the next morning extremely early, or, give them a closing shift the day before class. There is no time for homework considering I come home exhausted from work. It's an OK job, I like my role, I enjoy helping people with makeup, I enjoy makeup, but I do not enjoy the treatment. It really is all depending on the management."
good,"I think the best thing about the company was obviously the discount, but I feel like I didn't learn anything. I feel like I was stuck behind the register when I wanted to learn more about the retail industry and how it all works."
good,"People either stay for 5 years or 5 weeks. There are always problems in management and the turnover rate is a disappointment. Sacrifices must be made if you hope to grow with this company. If you're passionate about the field, definitely stick with this company, but beware of empty promises and backwards policies."
good,"A fact growing company, but I high turn over rate. Valued for being a consumer loved company. However employee appreciation has decreased. Not valued as an individual."
good,Ulta is a vast growing company who values it's employees. Through my 6 years working for the company I have gained vast knowledge of how the retail management position works. I have been able to excel and accomplish many goals. I have truly enjoyed working for the company.
good,"-Easy going work days"
good,"I am a Ulta DC Clerk. I work with team members all day, helping them to succeed and improve on their selves and their production. I assist my supervisors and delegate task so other employees. I am certified on a reach truck and a dock stocker. I use a lot of computer based programs such as sap, excel, Microsoft and more."
good,really cool experience. glad that i met a lot of cool ppl. really loved the environment. never had a dull moment there when working. loved every thing about it.
good,"Great Company to work for flexible hours, great benefits, fun and great work experience. A great way to learn about all the beauty products available to various cultures. Learn about salon and how interacts with the retail part of the store. Making sales, and improving "
good,I don't believe Ulta is the place for anyone who has a preference in a teamwork atmosphere. I came from a community that was very bonded and family oriented and this was a culture shock for me.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning, organizing, meeting daily goals and providing an excellent service to my clients. I learned redken color techniques and the color and product line. The management was not very communicative. The hardest part of the job was when we were to busy and had to turn clients down. The best part of the job was the amount of different services i got to perform."
good,"Ulta on South Beach for stylist is a nice start off. GM isn't really professional. But the Salon Manager is great. The job is not something to be stable with though. Traffic is really slow, and only minimum wage. Not very organized. The coworkers are really great people."
good,"When I started they were very optimistic and upbeat about advancement potential. After over 2 and 1/2 years of service in which I had far exceeded quota's in all aspects of my job, they refused me advancement and, in fact, were hiring people off of the street and giving them exactly what they were giving me. It was truly disappointing."
good,see resume - good company.. i  was offered a closer job to home and more hours and better benefits to which it just was the choice that worked best for me.
good,The pay is exceptionally low compared to other places. I do not believe that starting out you should make the same as a cashier when you are a licensed professional.
good,"I loved working at Ulta Beauty. All the makeup a girl could dream to play with, the salon, the music, the atmosphere was admirable. Behind the scenes, not so much. My team members were amazing, fun, loveable, friendly, and helpful. But when you work with all girls, things can get a little dramatic. and i mean, dramatic. Also in my District, i feel the management has other priorities. "
good,"Fun work place with supportive management and lots of room to grow in the company. Not many hours to give associates, but good for someone who needs a part-time/second job."
good,"Perfect first time job. Enables you to grow and learn new things. Mainly focused on sale goals, costumer service and team work."
good,"If you love make-up, this is the place for you.  Flex hours, great co-workers and suburban location.  Company is rapidly growing and has the growing pains to go along with it."
good,This Job was very fun to go to at times. Other times not so much. Everyone at this workplace was very unpleasant. They either had attitudes or very mean at times. I learned a lot of different years in the two years i have worked there.
good,Ulta during week days where pretty mellow are weekends and holiday's are more hectic . Threw out my time as a sales associate here what i really enjoyed here was the team i worked with it . The thing i disliked the most had to be are short 30 minute lunches . We had a lot of theft in are store as well that had to be the hardest part of my job making sure are theft levels didn't increase .
good,I enjoyed the availability of customer interaction of a retail store to be able to turn them into a salon client. Unfortunately due to hours and scheduling were inconsistent my pay was not what I expected. I ended up choosing to quit and pursue college.
good,great benefits and good place to jumpstart career. Hours aren't fun and customer base could be better. NEver enough payroll to get hours.
good,"Does not ""take care"" of employees as a company of that size should. Lack of health care benefits, tuition reimbursement, work/ life balance are all benefits that need implemented"
good,"Great place to work at. Just wish we had more hours for more sales rep on the floor. Just know that what ever position you work, you will also work as a security guard."
good,"It's  a fun environment because you're around makeup but it can be super stressful. There aren't enough hours to complete all the tasks that need to be done. Also, they do not pay their employees well."
good,"This job was easy and stress free while I was in school, but the hours were not reliable and the pay was very low. Ultimately I am glad I worked here because it opened doors for me down the line, but I definitely struggled with money during my time here."
good,"The customers and staff are a delight with whom to work. The ability to learn from experienced staff, lead a willing and knowledgeable team, and interact with appreciative customers, is what makes ULTA a great environment in which to grow. However, the limitations in one's ability to advance and to use your skills for the overall benefit of the customer, are drawbacks. Still, ULTA and their offerings stand out as one of the better companies in the beauty and cosmetics industry."
good,"typical day: helping women find makeup that is best for their skin"
good,"I enjoyed being here, the staff was great to work with! My one thing that made me not want to come in to work was my (salon) manager. She would baby me and other employees. She acts like she knew everything."
good,"The Company is a great place to work, sometimes it can be stressful, but what job is not stressful. There is a lot to do,but you are not allowed in the office and you will work  with one on one coverage I mean it will be a manager and a worker all day. they give you a lot to get done with little hours to do it in. The hardest part OF THE JOB IS WORKING WITH FEW HOURS."
good,"I enjoyed this job, but there was really no place for me to move up in the company. I was only being scheduled two days during the week and decided that the job wasn't for me."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of replenishing inventory, selling and assisting clients on an everyday basis. Management was great until new management came to store and didn't make work exciting and enjoyable as it should be. Hardest part of the job was to neatly organize every item on shelves in a timely manner."
good,This was an excellent position for me at the time. I was able to use my experience to advance.
good,"Upscale environment, high-end products and services. Opportunity to use all aspects of my license."
good,"Working for ULTA, Inc. was an enjoyable experience in a fast-paced retail environment."
good,"work closely with receiving supervisor, assist in running the department. Resolve all receiving issues through SAP system."
good,Meet some nice people there that I still stay in touch with. Enough work to keep you busy on a daily basis and you can learn a lot about all different kinds of products and the retail business in general.
good,if your looking to have good hours try somewhere else. your mostly by yourself. you dont really work with coworkers only managemnt
good,"My typical day at work is alright, not much going on, in the night shifts, which I always get. But I love my co-Workers!"
good,Overall operations of the store.  Rapidly growing company.
good,"A  typical day for me was preparing my facial room for my appointments. Helping clients select appropriate skincare. It was like having my own spa, as I was left on my own to take care of my spa business."
good,"It was a company that was just opening, it was not that good of a fit for myself. otherwise everything was great when it came to the management and employees."
good,"Cashier responsibilities."
good,The management doesn't really work together and are somewhat lazy. My GM sat in her office the whole time. they definitely don't do things as a family and some of the clients that come in are rude.
good,"Associates are required to be very flexible, as you will be working positions other than what you were hired for. Management is friendly, but could improve their communication amongst each other and staff. The most enjoyable part of working at Ulta is the one on one time you get with customers. They appreciate your help and are typically very loyal customers."
good,"I only worked part time, but i enjoyed the work my coworkers and the customers. The vibe was so positive. Honestly I wasn't able to live and take care of my family like i should. If there was an opportunity for me to move up in the company i would take in a heartbeat!"
good,"ok job, good benefits, rewarding. Customers are nice to work with. jobs include greeting guests and color matching"
good,Had good schedule. Worked in salon with clients and also on retail floor when not busy to interact with potential clients. Strict management. Good team work. Hardest part of this job was the salon being corporate and not adjusting to regional needs. Most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with all the customer traffic that came through the store.
good,"The magalogue (company produced magazine) offers a variety of products, services and specials as well as informs customers of opportunities to earn club points for added savings on purchases year round."
good,"My job consisted of performing and giving facials, as well as skin mapping and skin care advice. Love my managers and think they do a very good job. Hardest part about the job is getting people to have facials because they come in to Ulta to buy things not to get services and a lot of times people would schedule appointments but cancel. Over all really like the job."
good,"Good work environment but not great pay. Fun to work at, friendly people, great discounts"
good,"All black attire, make up and hair restrictions and rules...this is not a place to ever have a laid back clean faced ponytail look."
good,"A typical day consists of checking the book for any appointments for that day, preping my work area for each appointment, keeping my work area clean and organized. When the store is slow and there are no appointments on the book, stocking shelves is what you do or walk around and convert customers. The management team is great and the co-workers are excellent. The hardest part of the job is trying to convert customers into getting a service done, but the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a satisfied customer and booking them for another appointment. "
good,"This job was pretty nice. If you were in the hair department, you pretty much had the floor with you and your clients."
good,-We would go in the racks and pick product.
good,"everyone that i met there was very nice, a good place to work."
good,Great place to learn about new beauty secrets and beauty products. Great employees. Fun environment.
good,"Working at Ulta has been a great experience. The is a job that gives you continuous support and skills to be successful. I was able to grow and maintain a steady client base, and use my creativity as a stylist to fit my clients needs. I had wonderful coworkers always willing to assist me whenever i needed them."
good,"Management was average, but normal warehouse experience consisted of dead stacking and shipping out product to various ulta stores."
good,Ulta was great they motivated us to do our best at work. The night started great I was well rested and ready to work. After finding our spots the night started and we started packing orders. when it was hot they would give us gatorade to drink and have fans blowning on us. I learned how to use OSHA safety rules not only at work but at home as well.The hardest part of my job was staying woke the last hour.
good,"I worked here on and off for about 6 years and had a pretty good experience. It fit for what I needed in my life at the time far as the hours, money and benefits. I was a department manager and I actually loved my job doing sales and makeup.It was time for me to find a position where I could keep moving up in the company, have a more stable position and increase my income."
good,inconsistent hours
good,"A typical day is stocking, cashiering, and helping customers.The hardest part of job was getting people open the ulta card, because a lot people already had them."
good,"I'm not a fan of ULTA, mainly because I spent more time standing around looking at a clock instead of actually working. They require a vast knowledge of makeup - rather it be name brand or generic brands - as well as skin care, hair care and etc. The job in itself is abnormally boring, but again I need to be doing something constantly. Absently walking around trying to look busy and waste time is just... a literal waste of time. The customers are great, the employees are wonderful, and the management is completely serious about the job. It makes the job straight forward and easy to follow. Your job is clear and your coworkers are always willing to help out if you need it."
good,"Working this job, I've learned more so now, then ever how to be a great multi-tasker in a fast paced environment. There are many duties we have to do at once, as well as servicing customers via phone, in-store, helping with customer issues, returns, and completing our daily tasks."
good,The day starts really early at 6am and there is a lot of physical labor involved. The management is upbeat and caring for each employee.
good,I learned how to interact with customers. Most enjoyable was meeting new people and being able to hold a conversation with them.
good,"As the planogram lead, I was in charge of a team of people that would change the store when new products came in line and setting up merchandising. As the keyholder, I was in training for management and I would open the store and registers. I also would be in charge of putting out truck when needed and helping cashiers."
good,Ulta is a very busy and fast paced warehouse that stays busy continuesly through the whole year. A typical 8 hr day can straight out slow but may pick up as soon as orders come in.
good,"Great Company to work for a store level, but the corporate level has some rules and values that I do not agree with, which can make it hard to do work you dont agree with."
good,"I have worked at 3 different Ulta Beauty locations and the environment of the store always depends on the Managers. Ulta, as a company, has very high standards for their employees and stores regarding appearance of the employees (the uniform) and store, customer happiness, and primarily sales. As a Beauty Adviser you do not earn commission for sales, but it is expected of you to push people to join the rewards program as well as apply for the Ulta Beauty credit card when working the registers. There are daily numbers to reach for the store and if you're working and do not reach those numbers you do get reprimanded.  "
good,"I was new there, thrown out to the wolves. My first salon job. Had to learn the salon computer system because Ulta couldn't afford a receptionist. Having to answer the phone in the middle of a service was extremely unprofessional and rude to the client. Other than that they are flexible with your schedule, there is room for advancement."
good,"Check the schedule to see the appointments for the day. Disinfect entire salon area, make sure all product were stocked. Greet all customers and evaluate their request for services to make sure they were satisfied with the outcome of their services performed. I learned to establish better time management between clients. Management was overall very helpful and knowledgeable with salon responsibilities. The workplace culture was upbeat and supportive of each other. The hardest part of the job was juggling between clients when double booked. The enjoyable part was meeting new guest and maintaining great relationships with existing clients. Also, working with great people that stayed positive when working through challenges."
good,A lot of your experience will depend on management. A few of the managers at my location were very petty and even bullied me and other associates at times. Sometimes you are pushed to sell certain products. Credit card is pushed very hard like other retailers. Often feel under appreciated.
good,"I personally enjoyed learning about different products and what works for different customer. The management was not the best at my specific store, Also i did not feel like i was included in alot of things. The hardest part is dealing with customers who had ridiculous returns and would not budge until they got it."
good,"It’s fun to work for ulta sometimes but a lot of things make it difficult for me to want to continue working there. The pay is low for the amount of work I do. The schedule is all over the place, constantly getting called in on my off days. No opportunity for a raise unless it’s for a lead cashier. And getting breaks is forever a challenge because we are always understaffed."
good,When I started I had a manager that I loved and was advancing me quickly. She eventually got tired of working herself to death to get anywhere in the company and moved on. Her replacement was awful and my advancement with the company came to a sudden halt. I left shortly after.
good,You have a good understanding of business metrics/sales experience to succeed as a manager! If you can push your team to hit their sales goals and keep up with training you will be successful!
good,I enjoyed what I was required to do as well as only working 8 hour shifts versus 10-12 hours at surrounding warehouses however management is poor. Having a labor scare at work distinguished how I view the picking department; I was mistreated and insulted for having to leave to go to the hospital.
good,I learned a lot from the company but management is not half of what The company could be if they had a better management the team will have started together
good,"I loved how I could work in the Salon but feel like a team with the retail side. That union of people made work more enjoyable and I made some really good friends from Ulta. Not to mention, I got to play in all the samples of products they had out. It was overall a good experience."
good,I held many different positions at Ulta. Everything from unloading the shipment to being an interim manager. I have learned invaluable skills from each title I held. It helped me become a more rounded leader.
good,"staff retention was hard to retain prior to my arrival, Store Manager was not orginized and project for the store fell behind. Which gave me the opportunity to show what I had to bring to the table. But things could have been better"
good,"The whole company micromanage everything you do"
good,"A strong GM makes a huge difference!!! As an ops manager, I didn't get paid enough to deliver what was expected from me from higher management. I still went above and beyond despite of us being understaffed because I care about my store and my team. I tried my best to help guide and develop the skills of my BAs. It gets difficult encouraging the team when everyone dislikes the GM. "
good,"*fast paced"
good,"I started as a Beauty Advisor, and was able to work my way into management. I was given great training and room for advancement. About 2.5 years ago the district because large enough to not be partnered up with Texas and we got a new District Manager. She was retaliatory, did not train her General Managers so the management teams were also not trained, she showed favouritism, and would create hostile work environments. That DM was fired and they replaced it with another DM who does the exact same thing. Overall it can be a great place to work, as long as you are a favorite or are willing to work 60+ hours a week. I do not recommend for college students because they will not offer you management positions nor will they give you enough hours to work Part-Time."
good,"If you’re new, they will make you work a lot of nights and a lot of weird shifts/hours. You don’t get many hours to begin with and if you want close to 30 or 40 hours per week you have to pick up hours only when they’re available, which means most of the time you would have to work 6 to 7 days a week. Just to get a decent amount of hours! There’s also a lot of pressure and pushing from management to get people to sign up for credit cards every day when you’re cashiering. Also, their truck processing night every week runs very late, and if you’re new your basically forced to work that night every single week. The people are great to work with but the job itself isn’t worth the goofy hours."
good,"Fun place to work, not great management for some locations, decent vacation/sick time, average pay for the industry.  flexible with schedule for the most part unless it's holiday season."
good,ulta in Conroe is a nice place to work if you do not have children or family. They have plenty of opportunity to grow within the company. In my experience the management staff could use more training in how they handle employees with family.
good,This is a normal part time with no benefits provided. Management is nice. You receive more hours based on performance usually. There is room to gain more work hours as the week goes on. Make up and skin care items are great to play with but the customers can be cranky (retail jobs :/) and management can get on you about performances quite often.
good,Working at Ulta was decent. The manual labor wasn't too severe. If you are planning on applying be ready to stand and walk around for hours. Whether you enjoy your job or not honestly depends on your supervisors/managers. Work can be tedious but overall not the worst job out there.
good,"ulta is a good place to start out at as a first job or fresh out of high school, especially if you are interested in the beauty industry, you can for sure learn a lot here."
good,"Decent pay ,but not enough hours at all.constantly hiring new people. Decent experience probably would prefer to work in a different location where hours are divided more equally. Specially to the people only working one job So ask the employees."
good,vgdfbidont want to do this i really dont care about filling out a review for working at ulta. you will buy a lot of makeup and be stressed out. coworkers are great
good,"The environment is built for younger people not wanting a long term position and the pay is compatible with that. The pay is not competitive for retail managers with heavy background and an education to support it. "
good,"A fun working environment"
good,"I was there full time but only given 14 hours a week. Nobody can make a living on that. Easy work. 40% discount on products. I hope you enjoy pompous women with superiority complexes, because that is what this kind of stuff revolves around. Vanity at its finest. Good luck!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Ulta Beauty. Even though it was very fast paced and busy most of the days, it was a good work environment. It was a fun job and I liked what Ulta Beauty had to offer."
good,"I would enter the workplace with my co workers greeting me with a good attitude and smiles. I usually would be up at the cash wrap or on the floor helping guests and their transaction. I learned about selling, adding on items to increase hourly goal, as well as how to engage customers in a positive way to increase their likelihood to return. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be receiving free products to test out as well as seeing how happy a customer would be when a product finally works for them. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers who were upset over something - that despite us doing what we could were still unsatisfied, this definitely taught me to stand my ground while providing excellent customer service."
good,A typical day was working with customers on what products they needed based on their descriptions. I did a lot of my own research on products so I could communicate what the store had to offer to the customer based on wants and needs.
good,But it can be very hard depending on the organization of your management and team. A bad management will make you not want to go back to this job.  You’ll spend most of your time at the cash register instead of on the sales floor where are you were needed to make sales and prevent theft due to being constantly short staffed and under budgeted hours. Even some management positions aren’t offered full time.
good,"I worked for Ulta shortly as a seasonal beauty advisor, I’ve always wanted to work here but once realizing how things operated behind the scenes I was turned off. Corrupt operational system where it’s a he said/she said. Managers are unprofessional and lazy (and have about as much experience and skill as a regular associate but way more pay) Everyone is beautiful and we’re allowed to express ourselves and look TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. Did lots of work for low pay. ($9/hour) I wouldn’t recommend working at Ulta to anyone. Only good thing was the discount, which I didn’t even use."
good,I enjoyed my time there but after the birth of my third child I had to take a step down from management. I would go back to work for this company. I do miss it.
good,i went to school to be a cosmetologist and i didnt even make enough money in one year to out weigh what i payed for schooling. i did love my manager and all of my co-workers though.
good,"It is a good job if you are into beauty however it can be stressful, My role could use more structure, fight for higher pay when you are first hired on it will benefit you in the future."
good,"It was a great experience and fun place."
good,"This job would be best described as a good place to work for part-time seeking young people. There are no full-time positions open for sales associates, only managers. Work is very easy, never anything that's too hard."
good,More career training should come with this job. No one has time to train or is willing. No paid days off. No set schedule. Doing the same jobs as other managers there but getting the least pay.
good,"A lot of people apply because they believe they’ll get to do makeup on customers and practice their skills. Not like that at all unless you work for the boutique. If you’re at the register, no matter how good you are, it’s very hard for them to advance you or give you a promotion, let alone a raise. I moved an hour away and kept working in hopes of getting either, but I was told it wasn’t their fault that I moved in the middle of nowhere, and that there’s nothing they could do for me. I was a loyal employee for about a year, my numbers were awesome, and I loved working with the customers. Only reason I left was because I spent more money going there that I was making. It wasn’t worth my time."
good,"Be very sure that this is the job that you want. It has its perks, but there will be a lot of challenges. If you are not one of the full-time employees, then hours may be short and they may not be regular. Things can change based on sales (like many retail stores). As long as you are a good worker you will keep the job. Keep in mind that your hours can be cut and its not your fault and there wasnt anything wrong things are just short."
good,I loved who I worked with but I did a whole lot of work to not be paid any more than the girls who did way less than me. I felt like I had many responsibilities and no substantial raises.
good,"The team is definitely one-team-one-box. We work together to make it a great place. Management is solid and really cares about their employees. Compensation could be better for the wild hours we work. Work schedules change by the week, making work/life balance very difficult."
good,"Employees could benefit with more management interaction. A team like environment or personal goal should be better planned out for overall business success. A typical day at Ulta was to continuously check up on what the customer was interested in buying and helping them find the product that best fits them. I learned to ask open ended questions to require more thought from the customer rather than a quick ""yes"" or ""no"" response. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer meet their wants and needs, along with the excitement from their appreciation of my assistance."
good,"Fun Work environment, but not enough advancement opportunities . I enjoy the people I work with day to day. Management is lacking in structure and consistency. Also Ulta does not pay well at all."
good,The work you do in any department is very easy but the work hours are never promised. Each department makes sure you are trained properly before sending you out on your own.
good,"The atmosphere and training was great, the managers could be much more professional, though. I think if they gave more opportunity to advance within the company, and monitored managers closer it would be much better! Managers were very unprofessional, allowed cliquey, gossiping, and badmouthing behavior."
good,"overall, i enjoyed working at this establishment. However, there wasn't any room for career growth nor did it seem to have any financial growth within the company"
good,This was a fun place to work. It was a fast-paced store with lots to do. I enjoyed the challenges of leading the team to exceed our store goals. I enjoyed the staff and the culture of Ulta
good,"Great place to work, it's very competitive for advancement within the company. If you make it to prestige you get hundreds of dollars of free makeup a month, if you're not prestige then you don't get any gratis whatsoever."
good,This company was a decent company to work for. My store manager was simply the best. She truly was a true definition of a role model. Its unfortunate she got taken advantage of by her manager.
good,"Overall I learned a lot of interesting facts on skin, hair and beauty tips. Hours were a bit too much or someone with a family. In store salon gave a great employee discount"
good,I actually liked working at ulta the environment was good and so was the management team. Everyone was super nice and i love helping people find products that they needed . But the hours really sucked and it was bad for like 2 months and I couldn’t do it anymore but it would recommend it if your into makeup and have a easy time doing alot at once
good,My work days were typically busy as it is a semi high trafficed mall. The hardest part was redoing all the shelves when customers would trash them. The most enjoyable was the look of happiness or excitement on a customers face when they finally got the product they wanted.
good,Hours are not fairly displayed due to the GM whose never worked in retail. Other than that the staff is pretty friendly. A problem that I had was that each manager had a different vision on how things should be done about the store which doesn’t help with taking up and down fixtures because you ask one and they tell you one way and visa versa. A definite benefit is the employee discount you are given which is about 25%.
good,"This is for young women who are in college and need a part time job as well as cheaper priced makeup. You have to be 18 and if you arent a shift leader then this pretty much cant be anything more than extra money for school books and makeup type job. They hire you young, and only part-time."
good,"From my time being there I noticed several changes. Many women were leaving due to the many changes in management and lack of communication. I had joined in hopes that I would be able to assist women in makeup application and search of products. Sadly I was mostly put on as a cashier. Then at some point a rule was established that certain beauty advisors weren't allowed to do makeup applications. "
good,"I worked for a Ulta in Colorado and it was wonderful, 5 stars and management was great to work with. I transferred to Minnesota and it was like working for a completely different place. Nothing was done by ""Ulta way"" and the entire salon lacked motivation. I think the key to every well ran salon is proper management."
good,"I loved working here, I had advanced and learned all i could to move up to the next management level and was ignored for external hires and looked over. Other than that the job was a delight and satisfying."
good,"A typical day for an Arch Expert is clocking in, then looking at my books to see what my day will look like. Most days I will have at least 8 services and the weekends are double that. On the times I don't have appointments, i have to help around the store with guests that have questions about the makeup. "
good,"Competitive location, great stylist who will work hard for their Salon Manager, team and clients. The company as needed to be more employee oriented. Stylist would work 32+ hours weekly and would still not receive medical benefits. Also their base salary for stylist was terribly low."
good,Ulta was my first esthetician job I loved the training they provided at the dermal institude but was not fully trained since I was the only esthetician there and they didint even have a salon manager  and No clientele at all  since they didn't have an esthetician for about a year. The pay is really low 8.50  the goal is to reach commission but whit no clientele that was kinda impossible and tips were discounted from the pay checks I don't recommend the esthetician job if there's no clientele because you won't make any money  arch experts get paid way better  totally want to go for it
good,very fun place to work; stocked entire store; loved trying new beauty products before coming out; loved being in store before opening; customer service
good,"I love Ulta. The atmosphere is awesome, I love my coworkers and I love my clients. Ulta also offers great benefits. The only problem is the pay is very low."
good,fast pace environment staff always helpful supervisors are great benefits are outstanding. you can advance as long as you work hard and give your all.
good,"As a new stylist to the industry, this was a great start.  Great training and a great compensation plan once you get to full time with a full book.  The skills I've learned will carry on with me throughout my entire career."
good,"employees receive a 25% off products and 50% off services. co-workers are amazing. managers are good.  they are not very good at making sure you get breaks, and you are often told to preform tasks that are impractical."
good,"Plenty of different jobs/tasks for everyone. Management was not the best, but they tried. Worst part was probably the entitled customers, but if you are a makeup lover you are bound to enjoy this job"
good,A good starting job for those interested in the cosmetic industry. There is some room for advancement and training is provided. Hours are spotty and there is room for improvement in management.
good,"It was very fun working for this company and the staff is like a family away from your own family!  The atmosphere is laid back, which can  be a pro and a con.  It's laid back until it is time for reviews and the other managers to come to the store, and then everyone is scrambling.  But overall, it didn't really feel like work."
good,Great experience for new estheticians but hard to make a living on that job alone. Not a lot of room for growth and limited skin services offered. So if you're straight out of school looking for somewhere to introduce you to the industry before you move on to something better this is a good jumping off point. Probably why the turnover is so high with Skin Therapists there.
good,I'm not getting enough hours to support myself or my family. great work environment but no opportunity for advancement. management does not effectively communicate to the employees on scheduling and hours they are wanting them to work per week ( 4 hours weekly).
good,Loved being able to play with makeup and apply it on customers. Management at the time was very strict. Loved the workplace culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new techniques on makeup application.
good,"Typical day at work is checking where you are on the sales floor, and doing your job, greeting guests and helping them out. Management at that store isn't too bad, somewhat always on top of the game. Co-workers were friendly, some girly drama, but I didn't bother with those. Hardest part was trying to meet the goals for the store, but the most enjoyable is learning more about the new products and getting to experience the product to best tell the customers how well it is."
good,"Typical retail environment. Way too much work and rarely enough people to do what upper management requires...wondering if any of them have actually worked in a retail store environment. Can be a fun place to be if you have good managers in place. The company needs to provide a lot more leadership development for the store-level and district-level management. Considering that most brick-and-mortar retailers are seeing a downturn in sales over the past few years, Ulta is opening more stores. So for someone who is willing to deal with all the bureaucracy of a large company, there should be plenty of opportunity for growth."
good,It is a typical cashier job. Ringing people in and out and dealing with their demands. It can be fun at times when people are in good spirits. Standing for long periods of time and looking at a computer can start to take a toll on your body.
good,"A typical work day in the prestige department was knowing the sales goal for the day and making sure product is filled and stations are clean before customers walk in. I've learned a lot from Ulta, not just about new products and knowledge about products but working with cosmetics as well. My co-workers made my job fun to where it felt like a family and that's very important to me. The hardest part of my job was probably going back and forth with being on the register and being in prestige all at once because of short staff. The most enjoyable moments were having relationships with customers as well as getting things done during the day. Every Sunday we would have an online training for new products launching and that was always fun for me as well as my prestige co-workers. The one bad thing about this Ulta location was the management not being able to work with employees the way they should. New management was also the same way."
good,"I was the prestige manager. I did the best job I knew how , I truly loved what I did. My coworkers are amazing, I loved Eventing and was the best at it."
good,"Ulta is a nice company. I've been with them for awhile. However, work life balance wasn't so great. Other than that, I liked it."
good,The management was not very nice and I wasn't paid what I deserved. I worked very hard for very little and had to do work that was outside my job description like stocking the shelves when I was hired as a stylist.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers greatly. The people were extremely nice and the atmosphere was good, I was not a fan of how the managers treated you at times. Mostly lied too, instead of being treated like adults. A typical day, was enjoying my work family, and working hard to get your job done. It was pretty easy.  I learned a lot about myself in many ways."
good,"Working is great, management is horrible! You are not really able to grow and develop as a person at store level. Co-workers are awesome! "
good,"i loved my time here because i am a very self motivated person. i took the job to learn and that is exactly what happened. it is a culture that supports learning and personal growth. "
good,I would never know weather they would consecutively schedule me two weeks in a row or not because they hired so many people. Having to compete with so many other girls to get hours wasn't fair. They definitely pick favorites when scheduling.
good,"They were always trying to advance you and keep you up to date on style, trends, and new products.  Nice work environment when working, also kept clean daily by all.  Once you couldn't give them what they wanted from you, they created a different atmosphere around and nothing was kept secret, everyone new therefore everyone started treating you differently.  I had scheduling issues that they knew when I was hired and that it would take time before I could give them more time (I was very honest when they talked to me in my interview).  They hired me and when they felt it was enough time, I was treated differently and called into meetings about my hours, which at that time was out of my control and they knew about before I was hired."
good,"Working at Ulta started out as a dream! Being surrounded by makeup all the time is a little difficult, but i love it there!"
good,"Hardest part of the job is to get LL's to over spaces on time and per lease requirements. Best part of the job is the travel, get to see the entire country."
good,A fun fast growing company with many opportunities if you are able to relocate.  It is great to transform someone's day by adding something beautiful.
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot about the diversity of customers. I had a few friends as co-workers so that made the environment more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was working a double with only one short break.
good,Wonderful place to build your clientele.  Great experience with retail.  Top of the line products that you feel good about selling.
good,"I was privileged to work with such wonderful ladies in Capitola, CA where the general lifestyle is very laid-back and carefree which was reflected in both employees and customers alike.  "
good,"Ulta is a very fun place to work at. You learn so much on how to do make up and different brands of make up,skin care,hair products,etc.... they also give you free things to try out and know more about the product. However, there is lack of communication between management and the employees. I got hired on in prestige then as months went by, I heard through the grapevine that I no longer worked over there and the reasoning was because their weren't any spaces left which I clearly didn't understand since I was already working over there. I'm constantly getting interrupted by management when I'm doing a make up application to go up and ring when others could have help check out a guest or management. Last week I only got put on the schedule for four hours!!! And this week only 9. I wuz promised hours would pick up during holiday season but they dropped. I can say working for ulta has taught me a lot and helped me improve as a make up artist and a cosmetologist period.if hours were better and management communicated well with employees I would rate ulta 10s all down the board."
good,"great discount especially if you like to buy beauty products. I was in management but felt like a glorified cashier. I didnt like at the time we were not allowed to think outside the box. couldnt merchandise how you would like. Cookie cutter store, but they do have several levels of stores, which some are fancier."
good,"My experience with Ulta helped me fine tune my skills in sales drive, and long term customer loyalty. Customer service has always been important to me, and my department not only excelled because of this, but I allied with other department managers to inter-personalize each client's experience. I inspired others to connect with the client, and created an atmosphere of excitement and fun. Management was rarely cohesive, and this affected overall sales and store morale. The company has high expectations for hourly employees without any real incentive, a paltry benefits package and no training. The most wonderful part of this job were my clients, from educating them about products and services, to putting into their hand something they feel good about."
good,Engaging customers promoting sales and promotions. Managing the department and educating beauty counsultants to achieve store daily goals and store expectations. Was able to grow within a multi facets skincare and cosmetic enviorment on all levels which I was able to make successful high level of events goals as well l established great vendor relation to grow business throughout my years at Ulta. Working on a daily basis with company cutting hours weekly and very low staff in store daily in order to accomplish what was expected had to be the most challenging and hardest.
good,"There's not much taught at this location because it is new."
good,"A vast majority of my current skill set developed with my time at Ulta.   With such an enormous variety of beauty names that range from drug-store to prestige, one must learn to adapt quickly and establish discipline. "
good,"I was responisble for all front end employees. Weekly ad sets, mark ups and downs. All -planograms oversaw by my -position."
good,"Work was great, loved the workers. I learned alot working there thru management. Store would have been a great place for me except the fact I was missing all my kids sport outings and just family life at home. Retail is for people without young family at home! The hardest part of the job was you work with all women and it tends to get very dramatic, if we had the right upper management to control it, it may not have gotten so out of hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they were so fun to work with. You have the ability to transform their lives and make them feel so much better about themselves."
good,The hours were slow during the summer but overall a good environment with good people.
good,All about customer experience and satisfaction. Its a lot of responsibility as a manager but it is easy. Its not a hard job at all and if you work in the right location you could go far.
good,"Im a Hairstylist at ulta, My day consist of customer service from the time i enter till i leave. I take care of all hair needs and questions. And in my down time Im helping other customers choose other female products and needs."
good,"Processed cash, credit card transactions for purchases from consumers. Excellent part time positon."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting all guests with the best customer service and making sure they leave satisfied and beautiful.
good,"I love the enthusiasm and love that surrounds Ulta Beauty when it comes to their employees and their atmosphere, one thing that this store lacked is their managers ability to actually listen and make changes when their employees had concerns about wages, scheduling, and other important things."
good,"I worked there for holiday help and just got hired permanently.  Environment has calmed down a lot since the holiday help has left, so it's more quiet."
good,It can be fun if you're into cosmetics but the management wasn't that great when I worked there. The worst part of the job was breaks and lunches aren't scheduled. We went when it wasn't busy.
good,Diverse environment as everyday is different and unexpectable. Always working towards improving business to keep up high volume store status while keeping customers content and satisfied.
good,"It was a good place for a student to work but unless you're favored or part of the salon or brow bar, you really wont get much hours. The people who came in were super nice, however there was lots of drama between workers which was annoying."
good,All I did was stock and I was not hired for that. I barely got hours. They had me there every Friday at 6 am stocking by myself. The boxes were almost unbearable. I’m not sure why they had a woman there every time instead of a man. The managers would sit and watch me struggle and not help .
good,"I’m not sure if it was just the location I worked at but I basically got fired for having to take one weekend off of work. I had to have a medical procedure and even had a doctor’s note and management was refusing to take it, saying I needed to be hospitalized in order for me to be excused. Disrespectful. Management was also racist. I’m white but I’d see them profile black customers and follow them around the store."
good,"I love my job, when I'm there. Not a lot of hours😔 The people are great, mostly. Customers are awesome. It's great sharing a space with folks who have the same passion as I do. Just wish the hours were better."
good,Manager was amazing some employees did not pick up after themselves left a lot of work for me to do staff shorten n more hours were given to other which became harder for flexibility
good,I loved my job. I got paid well. Management did not know much about the Salon. so it was hard to get the proper training for my particular job. Was really hard to leave.
good,The managers want you to succeed immensely. Cooperate cuts hours so you barely get 16 hours a week if you are lucky. Also making minimum wage sucks. If the pay was better and there was more hours it would be a great job. Not a bad place to start at fresh out of school.
good,"Hesitant to add more hours but otherwise not a bad experience. Fun staff, clean working environment. Customers were generally understanding and management was always helpful."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment during the busy hours.  I did not enjoy having to get a manager for the most menial of transactions.  The schedule was super flexible and most of the management was stellar.
good,"limited room for advancement and lack structure for growth. Schedule is not what is presented at time of interview, often have to work more hours and days than forst told at time of interview. Job in itself is easy, but lack of communication can make it difficult,"
good,"It was horribly unorganized. The turnover of employees was about every month! Had horrible management. I would highly recommend working for clinique, however!"
good,Ulta is a great place to work but in a small town there is very little room for advancement or decent pay. The events are great but I would recommend more trading for employees who have never worked in beauty before; including brand training.
good,"The job is lots of fun and the culture is great. However, the hours are not guaranteed and the pay is laughable. You are only really guaranteed 4 hours, but depending on staffing can get more."
good,"Where you're placed, is based on where they need you at. But you can work your way up ,by showing them you know your stuff, within the floor and yes, you will work the cash wrap. Very diverse working environment. Start off as part time and to get more hours they will till you to get more ppl to get the Ulta beauty credit cards."
good,"4 years, but its not a great place to work part time if you're looking to stay there for a while, all depends on what location you're at...................."
good,"It was pretty fun working here. The employee discount was very good. However, You barely get any hours and they don’t really give you chances to work extra hours."
good,"I enjoyed being employed with Ulta distribution Center, the only downfall was having to work the graveyard shift. I would have liked having a decent schedule with hours that were more flexible. Besides working the graveyard shift it was a pleasure working for a company that was thriving.Being a part of a independent work environment was great ."
good,"I liked working at Ulta for the most part. It was fun but I was only hired for the holidays. The managers were not my favorite part of working there. They had their ""favorites"" like every job does and I wasn't one of them. Because of that, I wasn't allowed on the register ever and I was only allowed on the floor. It was boring because we were slow a lot during the weekdays and I wanted to improve on the register but they wouldn't let me because I got one less credit card sign up than the others. For instance, during Black Friday, I was on the floor for 9 hours straight even though they were short on people at the register. They just didn't think I was good enough to check people out even though the line was so long. Also, my managers always talked down about me to others. Besides that, I liked working with customers and helping people feel beautiful about themselves. The pay is decent, for a part time job and the hours are okay. I didn't get many because they didn't like me very much and whoever does the best, they get the most hours. I would've liked it better if I had different managers. And the discount for employees is what made me stay there longer than I should've, honestly."
good,"You don’t have a life outside of work, because you get called in or you just don’t make enough to actually enjoy a day off. Too much drama behind your back and people like to hand off their tasks to other people."
good,"I LOVED working there, just needed to be compensated more than $8 an hour!! While it was fun and exciting, I couldn’t pay bills working for ULTA........"
good,Fun place to work. Can get very repetitive if you like more excitement in a job. No job advancement. Management is not the best with communication with entire staff.
good,"Great company to work for good benefits. "
good,Fun place to work. Everyone gets along for the most part. It is hard to get 30+ hours a week however. Nice to receive gratis on occasion. Some nice perks come along with the job like salon discounts.
good,"Great experience for first salon job, however management could've been more organized. i bonded very well with customers. Also, the goals that corporate requires you to set are unrealistic, especially for a brand new stylist like me and another coworker. I didn't really like how it was also a store; I have no problem with working store duties. However, it was not mentioned to me until after I was hired that this would be expected of me. I had the impression I was strictly salon."
good,Good for those looking for part time. Weekend availability a must. Employee discount. Not as much training as I would have expected. Be prepared to help customers and stock inventory.
good,I have learned strong customer service skills and sales representative skills as well. I had the opportunity to interact with people of all ages and I was able to help with what they needed.
good,"Was a good company to work for. Built good friendships with fellow coworkers. Supportive staff, friendly. Happy I got to experience working there. Always had educational classes."
good,The company is growing at a break neck pace. Be prepared for a lot of autonomy and grey area. Great challenge. Many new stores opening that may saturate the market and provide a challenge for exiting stores profitability.
good,"A typical day of work consists of us coming in in our uniform and either walking around assisting with makeup or observing people as security or acting as a cashier at the front. We leave by getting checked out by a manager who checks our bag(s) and person."
good,The job was not bad but the pay was horrible. I would only work maybe once or twice a week and get paid every two weeks. I barely had money to buy anything to eat. Scheduling needs work.
good,"While at the distribution center the busy season was a complete mess, everyone was on 11 hour days, 6 days a week for over 3 months. It was awesome when it came time for the paycheck but it was very easy to burn out quickly at that pace and Ulta management was very unforgiving. And even after the busy season ended there were still weeks after weeks of mandatory overtime. If someone doesn't mind working 12 hour shifts every day then it's fine. But when their mandatory overtime interferes with school then they do not care, they will not let you leave even just a little bit early to get to class on time."
good,"Crazy strict rules about dress code, cumulative time off/sick days. fun environment when you make no mistakes, very little room for error, easy to get written up"
good,i had a fun experience working for benefit as a wax specialist. i loved collaborating with different brands and doing big events. A typical day for me was waxing and product sales. there was a goal each day that i would meet. also calling clients and booking appointments.
good,"Working at Ulta was great! I loved the environment. Working there, you always had something to do. Working with customers, choosing their color for foundation, lipsticks, eyeliners. It was a very nice experience."
good,"My time at Ulta was short-lived, however, if you're very much into the beauty industry, it may be the place for you. This was my first official job and found that I would need to be made up every day I worked. If this is not something you're willing to do, I would suggest finding employment elsewhere."
good,I had a great time working at Ulta before I was married or had children. The pay wasn't the best but the manager I had was very flexible with my time and tried to schedule me the best that it would work for both of us. Great job for someone looking to get into retail management. Quick advancement.
good,"Typical day of greeting and helping guests and making goals when it comes to loyalty programs. You do receive gratis as a prestige beauty advisor, discount should be increased since the pay isn’t good (pay is decent if you work in boutiques). Staff works together as a team and we do have fun at work if you love anything Beauty. Pace differs day to day,  But the only way you work full time is if you are management."
good,"I typically walk into ULTA everyday with a smile. Happy to be there, and happy to see what the day has to throw at me. Typically it can be rather easy to advance as long as you show the dedication and passion for the company."
good,"General Maangers were considerate and polite, however store manager was difficult to work with. Recieved very few hours, and store was understaffed half of the week."
good,"Ulta was an extremely fast paced company that had many different moving parts. There were no typical days there, every day was completely different. Ulta was a fabulous learning experience for me. As my first managerial position, I was able to see that I liked to be able to delegate tasks but had trouble releasing a task that was important for fear that a worker would mess it up. "
good,"-Management was amazing"
good,"Is a great place to start off if it's your first retail job, they're willing to hire part-time if you have already a full-time job or school. Rather stressful especially the DM that we had. Her visits were often stressful and is very critical and brash"
good,Ulta is a great company to work for but the retail hours are hard to manage with a growing family. The company is growing fast and you can grow quickly as well if you're willing to relocate.
good,"Fast pace and on your feet for 10 a day. You really don't learn much, just picking and packing items. Ulta hires more lazy people than good workers. It's hard to work for a company that treats its employees different depending on shifts."
good,"call clients"
good,"This is a great place to work if you're wanting an entry level job in the beauty community. I enjoyed the coworkers that I had, but besides my direct manager, the management staff was awful. Staff turn-over was frequent."
good,"Ulta is a fun environment to working in including stocking, guest recommendations, product recommendations and mini makeup lessons to perform on guests."
good,I worked almost fifty hours a week as a salaried manager and barely had time to rest.  It was fast paced and frenzied most of the time. I was rarely able to leave the store on a break or lunch break due to coverage and we were often short staffed.
good,"I work as a Prestige Manager, and I love my job so much. I love eventing, working with vendors, and striving to meet business goals."
good,"Fun work place, great for young people looking to learn a fast paced management environment. Not really much else to say. It was a great place for me to work while I looked for me dream job."
good,"I expected more of a salon feel environment, instead it felt more like a sales driven workplace. The location I was employed at was EXTREMELY slow and was making the bare minimum for daily goals because of lack of traffic. I was pushed onto the sales floor more often than not and was forced to work as a sales associate instead of a hair stylist. Overall it was an okay experience I just think the location I was at was way too slow."
good,"On a day to day basis my time is split between servicing guests, doing admin work, and coaching/developing designers. During my time as a Salon Manager I experienced a lot of different personalities and obstacles. I feel that this has prepared me for many other challenging situations in the future. I have reached my full potential with this position and I no longer feel challenged in my work place. Training and management style are very inconsistent There is very little support from upper management. Interacting with many different types of people is the high light of my work day."
good,"Very serious management style.  Nice coworkers.  No outside training.  As an esthetician I was paid an hourly rate.  Only a part time receptionist, we all answered calls and made appt.  I did enjoy doing professional make for bridal parties."
good,"Ulta is a wonderful and exciting environment to work in especially if you like the hustle of retail. Great perks and discounts. "
good,"Would have enjoyed working here more if there was room for advancement. Besides that, really enjoyed the people and working in the makeup department."
good,It was really productive and sometimes worked like a team but many rude people but other then that it was great . Made many friends in working through that company .
good,had fun with all my coworkers but management was a little stressful. great place to start off if youre just getting into makeup industry.
good,"Ulta is a good company. I learned a lot about how to better market myself and grow a clientele. There was paid training at least 2X a year. I trained as a salon manager - I enjoyed the challenge of understanding what it takes to run a business."
good,"Company was great for management growth. However, I feel as though the company was more concerned with expanding rapidly rather than taking the time to make sure older stores were taken care of and trained thoroughly."
good,"Am passionate with what the company stands for, but am always looking to grow within a company. Opportunities here are slim."
good,"Ulta is a fast paced guest eccentric environment"
good,"I liked working at Ulta.  They pay a bit more than minimum wage to start and it was fun working with beauty supplies.  However, they keep hours to minimum and hire too many workers.  There is room for advancement because people don't stay too long.  Truck day is tough, lots of heavy lifting and hard work.  Overall, its a good job, just not one I would want to dedicate my life to."
good,"Very demanding and lacking resources. No set time off, didnt adhere to availability. Not enough hours to complete tasks. Favortism"
good,Ulta Beauty and the workers are amazing. The work environment is productive and fun. Customer service is our number one work goal and making sure the customers leave with a great experience.
good,Great place to work with great workers! Co-workers and I  all took the job serious and worked hard to give it  our best as a team. Everyday was different and the job was very diverse day-to-day which made things invigorating and at times difficult. I was most entusiastic about learning about all the brands in the store.
good,"I work only part time which is a catch 22- I'm out of the ""retail drama"" enough but not there enough to really say enough about the job culture"
good,"Great place to work. Wonderful people who are always willing to help you with any questions you may have on any product. Perfect place to start learning more about the beauty industry. I learned a lot about different lines of make up, hair product and appliances."
good,Good place to work. Management could have been more supportive. The business was good as far as walk in business. It was easy to build a good clientele base.
good,"Had a great time working for Ulta, the staff was great the hours were easy .. enjoyed the customers and helping them with their needs . only left because I moved would return if there was an position open for me"
good,"Fun work environment, to many hours to work in a week.  As a manager working 60 hours in one week is a little much. Great benefits and product give away."
good,"Working at Ulta is a great experience. Beauty, skin, hair, and appearance is something many women seek out to improve or to try new trends with, assisting and giving advice about products and boosting confidence is a great job."
good,"As far as retail goes the pay was normal at the entry level.  I was a very hard worker and was given the opportunity to move up, as my work ethic and willingness to learn and help the customers was rewarded.  I started as a ""beauty consultant"" aka cashier and worked my way up to Prestige manager, then Merchandizing Manager.  This was cause I always was willing to learn, work hard, do what was ever necessary in any given day and also help the customers.  I had a great Operations Manager that I respected and learned from."
good,This work environment is for the individual who needs work experience.
good,"I worked for Ulta for going on 5 years and I absolutely loved it when I first started and a few years after that  the environment was great, had great training. And then management changed and everything went down hill from there. Micromanaged, watched a camera in the office to see if employees were doing there job right just overall not fun anymore"
good,"1.The typical day was to demonstrate and education customers on different cosmetics/skin care products. I made sales and provided services."
good,"This company is good to work for.  They have good values.  Fair pay, and the staff is friendly."
good,"Happy, positive environment, below minimum wage pay, hours were not consistent. Work was never too exhausting or hard, everything was explained well and I learned a lot."
good,"I’ve been working at ulta for almost a year now and it’s very easy to tell that the customers are the most important thing. This isn’t a bad thing per say but it is when your employees want to quit because they feel they are not treated equally as important as the customers. We have these things called ‘loyalty trackers’ and if you get someone that doesn’t want to sign up to our rewards you get a ‘no’ on your loyalty sheet and you actually get penalized for it!!! In my opinion this should not be a big deal, some people don’t want to give out their personal information and that’s okay."
good,"Don’t get paid enough to deal with some things. Some people hired for seasonal were completely rude and had no respect for kind suggestions, good pay and great benefits"
good,"It was a good work experience, i learned alot about customer service and new products. I also enjoyed the work i did. I did not however like the pay and hours i was given here."
good,"It started out being fun because you can express yourself without judgement but the stylist are very competitive, managers talk about other employees to employees as well as each other. They are hard on you if you have no clients. They will send you home early therefore cutting your hours. It's a great place to learn new skills in the hair industry."
good,"Very happy place and fun environment.                                                           "
good,"You don't make a lot of money or get hours unless you're a lead cashier or manager. It can be very ""catty"" as it's an environment of mostly women. You learn a lot about all the store products and build lasting relationships with guests. Management at my store isn't fantastic but it's not horrible either. Overall I am happy with my job. There isn't really room for growth like they say there is. Also you get less than a 25 cent raise once a year and that is if your performance is immaculate. Discounts for employees are great. Not a bad start for someone in retail or someone who is in college."
good,You get gratis once in a while. The hours are based on sales goals overall in the store. You dont get guaranteed hours or set hours. One week you'll get 25-30h and the nex one you'll get 8-12h. They are very flexible on time-off and the discounts are nice. The pay is not good and the raises are from 1%-4%. Its a good place to work if you don't have financial responsibilities.
good,The company was over hired and only had college students working once a week with no room for possible promotions. Although the coworkers were very kind.
good,"I would recommend this job to a new stylist or someone who doesn't have a strong client base. New people come in all the time, so it's easy to get experience with different textures."
good,"flexible, nice co workers.  fast pace many projects limited resources.   office space limited and open and bright.  Upper management approachable and nice."
good,"Overall a fun, fast paced environment, with an amazing amount of growth opportunity. Management can sometimes be retaliatory and can have hostile work environments, but every store is different. Pay is fair, amazing benefits and PTO available."
good,"Working at Ulta has been some of the best years of my life. With the job, came a team that not only supported me in every aspect of my work but also became my closest friends and mentors. I truly found myself when I found this job. At one point, coming to Ulta was the only reason for getting out of bed. I wish I could have stayed here longer, but it is a typical ""overworked and underpaid"" job. It is just not a place I can build a future off of."
good,I love who I work with but the pay is close to minimum wage and people do not tip you there. They treat it like a retail environment and don't understand we are lincensed professionals. The few clients that I love made it worth it. I am thankful for the education and my co-workers. But they want you to do too much for too little of pay.
good,"It's fun working at Ulta. I love my managers. I love the discounts we get at Ulta. I love helping customers. That is all my pro about working there. The con is the pay is not livable. Have to ask customers about credit cards. Must meet the numbers for your sale or services. Too many venders show up for their products to sell and some are very pushy to customers. Because of that, makes it hard to meet your sales or services. "
good,"I worked as both receptionist and stylist at Ulta, so I grew to be very comfortable scheduling and accommodating guests. I also learned a great deal in meeting corporate goals."
good,But you get paid low not worth the gas I drive out back and fourth but I need a job that pays good not a part time which there is no full time in ulta
good,the associates and management are always friendly however the store in general had more slow days than productive days which made the job a little boring.
good,"restocking/ unloading inventory"
good,"easy work"
good,"busy yet can be fun and fast paced , work along side managers to accomplish tasks and help guest find the best products for their needs    djhfjdjdhfjhdjfhdj"
good,"I enjoyed working for Ulta, but the location that I worked at was new and had hired a ton of people so the hours came few and far in between. It didn't really work for me because this was a second job that I got to supplement the income that I was losing from my hours being cut at my first part time job. If I had been better informed during my interview, I probably wouldn't have taken the job. Good for high school or college kids who can't or don't want to work much!"
good,Coming from working at Sephora the base hourly rate at Ulta is EXTREMELY low. Considering that the shift you're scheduled for can be cut based on if the store is making sales for the day the pay rate should be higher to compensate for that. Ulta as a company seems to be outdated in a lot of their policies from a customers standpoint as well as an employee. The only way you'd be satisfied working for Ulta is if you worked in the corporate offices or as maybe a general manager. They don't take care of their employees that are in lower positions and once again the pay is LOW.
good,"I loved working with my Managers, they were very supportive and encouraged growth"
good,If you enjoy fast paced work enviornments then this is the place for you. I loved working with the customers here but the management was difficult and the hours were not ideal.
good,"Ulta is an outstanding company. However, they are experiencing major growing pains. They are opening stores left and right, however, they aren't investing in the stores already open. As a part-time associate, it's easy to maintain a work-life balance. However, when you get promoted, work overcomes your life. When you leave work you are still taking phone calls, handling associates shifts, answering texts in a management group text, etc."
good,"I have been loyal to Ulta since 2010 and I love the company; our team does not work for commission so it's equal opinions based on individual likes and recommendation, not just to sell a certain brand. "
good,"Great place to work, I loved my benefits and loved training employees and hosting events. Only cons are the upper management, but to each is own. I would defiantly experience working here at least once."
good,"i enjoyed my short time at ulta. being seasonal, you get a lot of guests. the girls i worked with were great. it is very clean and organized."
good,"A typical day at work may consist of being behind the cash rap, floor, or both depending on customer flow. On slow days, it could literally only be you, a manager, and someone in the salon. They openly tell you this when you start. You also have to maintain order and cleanliness of the store and stock as necessary. "
good,"my day at work was go in greet every customer, cashiering, make sure everything was clean and organized, front face, and put up displays."
good,"Nicest co workers I have ever had , it was fun and interesting place to work. Learned lot about hair products and cosmetics."
good,"I had fun styling at ULTA. My clients did not ever complain, but were not unhappy when I decided to move to a more advanced and established salon."
good,"The Hardest part of the job is converting. It's not as easy as they made it out to be. It takes persuasion  and skill to do it."
good,... For the most part.
good,A typical day at work is to log into my picking cart once I have located my assignment for the day and pick/pack orders in a safe but yet productive manner. I learned to keep a fast pace and how to be safe while at work and I enjoy picking. The hardest part of the job is not knowing of overtime or leaving early there is not an often occasion when an employee will work their full amount of hours in a work week. ULTA has a friendly staff and support system to help with any needs necessary to their employees.
good,"The job was great, I loved it and I loved the environment. The only thing I would say is that the hours are not given much so it is a second job or just a holiday job."
good,"Great company to work for, they teach you what you need to know and they want you to move up and grow within the company. Unfortunately, the store I worked for did not have the best management which led to a lot of drama. Other than that the pay is fair and the people are great."
good,"Ulta is a great place to work, however they do not pay enough. I would love to continue to work there and continue going to school, but they do not pay enough to keep me there."
good,"Ulta Beauty is a kind of like a cult, but in a positive way. They are very focused on achieving their target goals and keeping a pleasant and welcoming environment for all people. They are very inclusive and innovative. However hours are skimpy and pay is usually only minimum wage despite being told they do not believe in it. This job is great if you're just starting in retail and need some experience or just to get your foot in the door, but if you're already an experienced retail worker I would suggest applying elsewhere."
good,The peak season can be a little crazy. But if you like making money then you'll be fine at Ulta during the peak season. For the most part I loved my time there
good,"The company itself was great to work for, but the management was a little lackluster. At different locations the employees said that the managers had favorites and were only engaged when corporate came to town. "
good,"Wonderful place to work , the manager I had before was wonderful she pushed us to reach great potential. Had events and help meetings to make company better. New manager was not very family oriented with us and did not care for customers concerns as well as employees but Ulta job itself was wonderful."
good,"Hard to make clientele especially if the store is very slow. Ugly weather days, no body comes in to shop. You have goals to reach a day and weekly and monthly. You can't make it all espcially if you are new or new to the industry. They expect alot from you."
good,"Working at Ulta for me was like a dream come , because I love makeup so. My experience for Ulta was cool stressful and the best job I had. The managers were cool and the staff was cool I just didn't like the rude customers."
good,"On a typical day at work, I stock the fixtures and receive shipments. Working for Ulta that is all I have got to do. As well as met the stores requirement."
good,If not busy you're expected to walk the floor recruiting guest into the salon. As a skin care therapist you get a lot of training. I got to meet a lot of great people.
good,"My general manager was fired and I believe it was totally wrong, that's why I am leaving. The managers they generally hired are not experienced in the Beaty industry."
good,A great place to advance in the beauty industry especially with a license but management is too stressful they give you a 2 person job and get massive presssure to perform to their high standards
good,"The company is involved with the stores. The staff can be"" clicky"" but overall great people. Some of the things I think should be pushed aren't and sometimes what you have to say doesn't mean anything to management. Some things that should be address are often overlooked."
good,"a typical day was evaluating numbers and setting daily goals. coaching employees to ensure excellent customer service for our guests. writing schedules, hiring, and firing staff. marketing, merchandising, cleaning duties"
good,"Good environment to work in, very easy to learn new department in the warehouse."
good,"Overall it's a pretty good job, only thing is, I never really got breaks no matter how many hours I worked. Other than that if you like working around makeup and people, go for it"
good,Ulta is a great place to word. Nice friendly environment with an easy pace. It is easy to advance and be promoted as long as you demonstrate a strong work ethic and remain consistent with your efforts to improve always.
good,"A typical day at Ulta requires patience, great problem solving skills, and the ability to be prompt and professional at all times. It is a diverse, fast- paced environment that is ever changing . Management is above mediocre but, as a whole, could benefit from some continued training and education in the forever evolving world of beauty and retail. My co-workers are great people to work with but are stressed easily and require constant encouragement and support. Universally, our team does well supporting each other. The hardest part of the job is adjusting and adapting to rapid, consistent change with little to no warning while remaining positive and professional, keeping the team motivated and not overwhelmed and stressed. The most enjoyable part is being successful at the hardest part of the job and being appreciated for spreading the positivity."
good,enjoyed working with coworkers. good hours managment was a little behind
good,I love helping customers out with products I know and being able to sell what they want to them or have them upgrade.
good,"I am in charge of staffing, budgeting, goal setting, event planning, guest complaints/concerns, as well as, maintaining a full clientele."
good,"I was in the receiving department. "
good,"loved working with the new products that came out on a regular basis, good hours and stayed busy."
good,"I loved working at Ulta however the location I was employed was horrible.  We new managers every month and half of the staff would quit because of issues (favoritism, rudeness, racial issues...) with several managers.  Once a task was completed, my co-workers were happy to help one another finish tasks.  The most enjoyable task was interacting with customers and applying makeup.   I enjoyed making them look and feel good.  What I liked least about this job was the task of cleaning the restroom.  I had to clean the public restroom/toilet without being provided gloves.  This job helped me improve my sales skills.  They encouraged us to sell extra products and I came up with more innovative ways to push our products."
good,"A typical day at work would be waiting to be given a task to do such as stock, mostly shipments every Friday. I learned how to work as a team to get things done quickly. I also learned how to satisfy customers who came in to the store upset. Co-Workers are great, always with a smile on their face. Hardest part of the job was when working on a task such as trying to get all the shipment out while the store is open and having many customers come up to you when you have your hands full of merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new people and satisfying their needs."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in an hour earlier and cleaning and mopping the store and making sure all the products are neatly on the shelves. The managers were great and very nice and the co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that one of the managers took advantage of the fact that I can't say no, so I would be doing many things at the same time, but I did my job without complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the co workers and being in a great environment."
good,"I enjoyed working for Ulta, although I am not a user of any of its products other than soap and shampoo. Typically i was responsible for stocking shelves, and unloading truck deliveries. I was also in charge of most of the cleaning and some store mait. My managers were great with helping me work out a flexible schedule while I was in school and working a separate job. Very positive work environment. Sadly my hours were cut after the store relocated. The hardest part of the job was communicating work morale to the new employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing a large shipment retrieval."
good,Good company to work for just the managers overnight you have to watch and HR team as well. Coworkers are very friendly and very helpful mire than managers at times.
good,"I have heard different reviews from people who work here and I believe it depends on the location and the people you work with, mine wasn't really that great of an experience just because of the fact that I started during the holidays when it was extremely busy and they did not really train me on anything, it was more of a figure it out as you go type of thing which was sort of difficult for me, and there wasn't really any co-workers that I became friends with so it was kind of awkward working without anyone to really talk to"
good,Always changing!  Either adding new products or taking away after a set has been done.  Creating new positions then within a year deleting the position.  The company continues to grow but they forget about the staff on the front lines taking care of the customers.
good,"If you're willing to do the work, you can get really awesome gratis from your managers! I've gotten so much free makeup and had some competitions for a brand new makeup palette that came out. On top of your 25% discount on everything and 50% discount on salon services, throughout the year you'll get an additional 20% off of brand name makeup.I would only recommend it as a part time job though unless you're trying to get in management."
good,It was good job not stressful at all good envierment pick ing using rf scanner just pay was a little low great surroundings pick makeup shampoos ects.
good,"Working at Ulta beauty was a fast pace fun job. Management was my only concern. I loved the customers, and the overall environment. I worked on the sales floor; stocking shelves, front and facing products, as well as being a cashier. The most fun part about my job was seeing all the new products going out on the shelves before anyone else."
good,"A normal day of work for me is having a chat-in and delegating task and other assignments to my associates. Tracking product and shipment deliveries and/or pick-ups. Ensuring that the store stock is continuously replenished and rotated to remove all old, damaged, and recalled items from the sales floor. Having this job I've learned that communication is the key to success as a manager. The hardest part about this job is how time consuming certain aspects can be due to long process and procedures. The guest and and associates are the most enjoyable aspect of this job because I like interacting with different people, problem solving, and jus having fun."
good,"All facials were conducted in an area called a 'Skin Pod' which was a partially open spa area. It was impossible to maintain a spa feel in the open environment. Ulta offered amazing specials which made it easy to get people into the chair, but if the specials were not offered clients tended not to want to pay top dollar for such a 'mall' feel."
good,"A fun fast paced company to work with. It’s not what you think it is, and I think hours are based on favoritism. You really have to know how to sell to customers and earn points by signing people up for credit cards. It could be good if you like retail."
good,"While I worked at Ulta, my work environment was fun filled, my mangers were amazing and the GM was very supportive and was always looking for way to help me advance."
good,"As far as distribution work, it is a good job with good benefits. A lot of inexperienced supervisors and people in positions they really should not be in."
good,"depending on what time of year but usually really slow, on holidays it gets really busy so you gave to be quick. great personality's I worked with. enjoyed doing cashier and directing other people in the right direction. Organizing make sure t store is nice and neat. stocking walking around a lot."
good,if you love makeup and beauty products then you might love the job you also get free product. meet the sales goal is daily. fun place to work when you're working around people who like the same things as you.
good,"I loved working at Ulta and for the most part we had a great team, but I do believe they tended to show favoritism to some employees over other ones. It seemed each of the managers had their pick clicks there and if you weren't involved with their click you wouldn't receive many hours for the week or they ""forgot"" to let you take your 15 minute breaks you were entitled to or they would leave you at the registers alone during busy time, while their little groups just sat in the office and talked."
good,such perfection wa reflected on cold decitions over management
good,Very fun working environment and also a great learning experience! I loved going in everyday learning new sales and customer service techniques. I wish I could have worked there 24/7
good,"I loved working here. I only left due to my hours being cut down to 5 hours because the manager wasn't pleased with me getting another job that she had to schedule around. I would have loved to continue working their, but I was treated unfairly so I respectfully left."
good,"Ulta is a beauty store, ranging from high end to drug store products. It's your store for female targeted and male targeted products that range from cosmetics, perfume/cologne, hair products, hair tools, makeup tools, accessories, and even a salon."
good,"A little busy atmosphere. The work load increases drastically without a schedule. "
good,This is job for great experience. Company does not like to hire within and have poor judgment on hiring managers. Easy to partner with your co-workers for more creative products and I personally enjoyed building relationships with guests.
good,"I was working while a new manager was being trained. I did most of her training, it was just expected of me. The other established managers were always rude or just messing around playing with the makeup and it was very difficult to get authorization and keep the line moving at the cashier. The store layout is always changing, and some product placements make no sense. They would put a smaller version of a product somewhere, and then a larger version of the same product somewhere else. If something comes up and you need a replacement, forget about it. Trying to find a replacement to cover my shift was AWFUL they did not even know who still worked for them or left."
good,"Better be skinny, well put together, & attractive to the district manager's or whoever's liking. Otherwise they'll just tell you that your numbers aren't where they should be & let you go. Also they don't understand how to not belittle you while talking to you at times. And I'm sorry but most people shop at Ulta & know exactly what they are here for... They don't want a dang facial.. no matter how much you push & offer. I liked working here until my manager was let go. Then they got all catty & would yell at you for ""standing around"", but allow others to stand around and talk to each other in one spot the whole shift. The pay was only good for me because of the manager deciding to let me be in the position I wanted, but being a cashier/stock person isn't worth the stress of almost minimum wage. They were not understanding that I had kids & a sick husband. Then when I needed to go on medical leave, the manager never got back to me, & never spoke to me again after. They didn't even have the audacity to let me know they couldn't do that & they decided to let me go.  They aren't worth working for until they get some better quality people who care about others feelings more than making sales quotas & making the store look good. Maybe if I felt valued I would have made more of an effort to keep this job."
good,"I love Ulta, and I love the wonderful people I have met because of the company. The only major flaw Ulta has, is treating their employees like numbers rather than people. We all work so hard for a company who won't hear us out, or offer the necessary benefits or compensation."
good,"General Managers like to change rules like nothing and the only way to find out the truth is looking up the actual policy or contacting district managers yourself. If you’re hired internally, it’s nearly impossible to get a decent raise if you are promoted."
good,"Good starter job if you want to go into management work hard and you can get there. "
good,"every Ulta I have ever been to the managers have horrible communication, will call you on your days off, not listen to what you need for pay, hours, and off days. I told my manager I needed more hours to stay, she hired two others in my same position that next week. You have to be a favorite to move up in the company. I heard a rumor that a manager position was opening up, and a new co worker of mine got hired a few days later. You don't receive benefits unless youre a manager or work as a specialty adviser (Benefit, Clinique, Lancome).  I had my managers watch us over our breaks and not respect our breaks. As a prestige beauty adviser you are supposed to training and receive gratis, to help sell products, I have only been to two training's and received gratis from my Store Manager once."
good,I believe that the location that I was working at could have been a better experience if the management team was better. The atmosphere was unprofessional throughout the higher mangement team and they often downgraded employees.
good,"Love getting to play and learn about new make-up and other products, however the hours are horrific. If you get hired for anything other than a management position, be prepared to get 8-10 hours a week if you're lucky. Corporate expects one person to do the work of three for a terrible pay rate per hour."
good,I liked working for this company but the only thing I didnt like working the overnight shift.
good,"Great work group. Made work so much fun, however the boss was not fair about shifts, discounts, and time off. I wanted to advance and once i was placed to head cashier, I had emergency surgery and she made it to where i was forced out."
good,"When you go through training they teach you all about ulta''s values and how they want you to be a team and all the support you're supposed to get from your district manager and corporate. But when you actually start working, you realize that none of those actually matter, even if you're Making your sales. My store never got to schedule any beauty advisors, so even though I was a manager I rang people up most of the time. And the customers really suffered, because there was no one to help them on the floor. Also you can't really move up even though they try to tell you everyone moves up fast"
good,We only have 3 managers at the moment which makes things a little bit more difficult since we are low on staff there is a larger stress load for the people that do work there at the moment. the schedules are always messed up which means there sometimes isn't enough coverage in the store.
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,This is a typical retail job. Not stressful lots of fun and you got free product all the time
good,Ulta was a lot of fun when I first got there. I was excited to work with people and makeup. Bu then I was only put on the 5am-10am and 6am-10am shifts twice a week. You really don't get any hours working there.
good,Ulta hires teenagers that do not know how to perform adequately. The job was not hard at all. There was a lot of busy work and the days were faster if you were on the register.
good,It was fun to work there and all of the girls were pleasant to work with. Management was ok. They have a bunch of different managers throughout the store. Some were helpful and amazing others you didn't interact much with so I can't say much about them.
good,Management could be better and more team driven.  The hardest part of my job was also the most enjoyable part: the guests.  Some were so rude to us...
good,Horrible DM for My area. It’s all about who you know. Other than that great place to work and learn. No work life balance. Events they have to promote new products are stressful.
good,fun place if you love make up and meeting new people. talking to new people helping them find and try new products. you get discounts as and employee.
good,"Not a place to work unless you are a college student that doesn't need a lot of money or hours. The coworkers aren't so bad some can be bratty, but other than that it's fine. They push for credit a lot. They try to make you feel bad when you can't get anyone to get a credit card."
good,"The staff and management in ULTA is great.  But, the company is very unfair. As a cosmetologist of 35 years , I feel I am not appreciated for my experience.  Which I'm not getting paid for.  They place you in your position on how much you sell.  Not if you're an experience hairdresser.  You don't even get commission if you sell something.  It's a very cheap company !!!"
good,"Of course for any girl/boy it’s like being in a candy store. The benefits were amazing.. but the culture in my location wasn’t for me just a lot of gossip. But that’s with any job, but I don’t have time for that. Other then that great store to work at!!"
good,"I worked there during peak season. They had us on 12 hour shifts six days a week.  Most days they would VTO most warehouse associates right after the morning meeting.  They didn't have enough work for most of their employees.  If we did get to stay and work that day, we would have a little meeting in the mornings and do some stretching. You would then go to your area and start working for the day. I packed at Ulta, so I stood at a computer with a cart beside me. I would just pack the materials that were in the cart into a box and send it down the conveyor belt.  The job itself was very easy."
good,Loved working at ulta and getting to help guests find the right products for them. Coworkers were easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is standing for long hours and not being able to wear comfortable shoes.
good,it’s a great place to work but hours are very unreliable and pay doesn’t compensate for effort needed. the staff is very kind and welcoming and I would recommend it to a friend but I think I have just outgrown it
good,Ulta itself is a great company I do however feel the district I worked in was very unprofessional and needs training for those in management positions. Huge turnover rate. Very catty at times I left due to the GM not being very bright and absolutely unpredictable. Didn’t know how to do her job properly and was very conniving
good,"Great Place to obtain experience in retail. Taking care of customer's needs, questions."
good,The work was easy especially if you are into cosmetics. The coworkers are okay but the management is a mess. They schedule you on days you are supposed to have off and never have the updated schedule available for staff.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ulta, and would recommend it as a part-time or second job. The managers at my location played favorites and would promote who they liked best over who was most qualified."
good,They did not train as often as I liked. They would double and triple book me with not enough time to allot for the services. Which is not good when I came from just graduating cosmetology school. Because they had so little clientele I hardly made much and didn’t get enough hours.
good,I love working at Ulta Beauty the management is very nice and understanding and the coworkers are as well  they make me feel like family its second nature there
good,"Management was the worst t of working there, Greenwood Ulta had this one clerk who was always angry at other workers. The managers aren't very helpful when it comes to how things should be done, no guidance for operations people."
good,"I loved working at Ulta because I love make-up but after working there for over a year, I never advanced from cashier. I wouldn't work for the same manager/store again."
good,"Ulta is an amazing corporation, however individual stores vary based on management. A good management team invested in associates make it an amazing job, a poor management team makes it hard."
good,"As you can imagine, working with all women can either be a blessing or curse. With particular company, it's both. The hiring system needs an overhaul but it is a wonderful place to work and learn about your favorite brands. I enjoy working at Ulta very much despite some of the cons."
good,"During the year I spent with Ulta, I also worked at a job changing oil.  With the same pay period, I earned exponentially more doing that than I ever did doing what I went to school for and was licensed to perform."
good,"Unfortunately at this location they tend to have one black girl in and one out. They hardly schedule you after awhile and this is based off myself and 3 other African Americans working there. I will say the only African American that is kept around is the brow bar attendant. She is very good and basically manages herself so luckily she is secure with her job and is always very bubbly. (Columbia, Mo)"
good,"For the most part I love working at Ulta, however as I get older and graduate from college I realize being in retail for the rest of my life is not where I want to be. Some people can be ok with it, but personally it's not somewhere I want to be forever. Ulta has given me experience to evolve as a individual. I have done a lot of things within the store and did things I have never done before and gained so much knowledge. I have had so many amazing friendships and connected with so many people and that I am really thankful for. the only thing I have to disagree on is, I don't work a ton have hours because I am part time, and don't get benefits which I think isn't far. but they are flexible with me about my hours because I did have to pick up a second job because of the lack of hours and I was going to school. overall I do like working at Ulta and my over experience has been great!"
good,"A typical day would consist of "
good,"My was was to promote exclusive skin care and cosmetics. I listened to my clients needs and concerns, Once, I determined what would be in there best interest; I would demonstrate those products."
good,"was seasonal so I worked like crazy for only 2 days then worked maybe 10 hours a week, didnt even tell me that i wasnt working anymore just didnt put me on the schedule anymore. unprofessional in my opinion"
good,"This company has a great presentation of beauty products. "
good,Just love the atmosphere and the people that i work with. Everyone is very nice and respectable. The managers doesn't have a problem showing you how things should be done even if there showing you for the 5th time.
good,"The hours are only good around holiday"
good,I enjoyed working behind the scenes and merchandising at Ulta was perfect for me. I was in charge of a certain area of the store making sure we didn't run out of any item. I kept the shelves dusted and full of merchandise.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work and I've heard it has gotten a lot better. The unfortunate part of working there is you hardly get any hours and the pay
good,"I would like to be full time. They don’t hire full time salon. I need a full time job  and I have begged for more hours.  I am a single living on my own and it is very hard to do with the limited hours I am given.  If I don’t have a client scheduled, they send you home.  I can’t build clientele that way."
good,"At first, working for the company was super exciting. Getting a discount on make up was an amazing benefit, but that's about it. The management team was all over the place after two of the 5 left. The hours were inconsistent. One week I'd have 35 hours as a part time associate, and the next would be around 16. The push for credit cards towards the end of my time there really rubbed me the wrong way. Our hours were threatened depending on how few people we got to sign up. There's a lot of corporate greed. Over all the team was pretty solid and diverse, just the management team drove me crazy. They expected me to go above and beyond: come in early, stay late, and come in my off days, but gave me nothing but a ""thank you"" at the end of the day. Their raises are a joke, and the district an area managers are leeches."
good,They need better compensation plans. The pay structure changed and was not improved for commission percentage. Makes stylists not want to work as hard. Only benefit is that it is a structured company with benefits if you are full time.
good,The high turnover rate within Management and District Management is problematic.  Little to no training when you start and/or promoted to a new role.  Little to no opportunity to advance beyond an Assistant Manager Role into a Store Manager position.
good,"I was with the company for a total of 3 years and 9 months. In that time I saw 2 general managers fired, several other management positions fired/resigned, and countless associates come and go for a variety of reasons. But I had coworker who had been there for multiple years already, and are still there today. From what I observed and heard from other employees at different locations this is some what the norm for the company. I have very mixed feelings because I look back at my years spent there blissfully and truly enjoyed my job. It can be very fun, they offer great benefits if you can get full time, and the gratis is surprisingly plentiful. I eventually quit after a completely new team of manager one by one replaced my original team and I felt as though I was being pushed out, or ""coached out of the business"" which is a common term you'll hear in ulta. If you have a pretty open availability,  are friendly and personable, willing to actually work hard, and can fake a smile when you need to Ulta can be a great career path for you. But if you cant take being fake, gossip, or typical work place drama ulta is not the company for you"
good,"I really enjoy working here, but there is no place for me to move up in the company. I'm only scheduled 2 or 3 days during the week currently, compared to 4 or 5 when I was first hired in."
good,The original GM that we had was a great person and she was very understanding and willing to work with the employees but she left and we got a new GM and she was very rude not willing to work with people and just Petty so apply at your own risk
good,The high stress seasons can take a toll on you in any job. Working in the salon is very fun and you are able to really create a rapport with the salon guests. Use of Microsoft Excel and Shortcuts is used to book appointments and analyze the business data. The hardest part of the job is just getting used to multi-tasking when there are 4 phone calls happening at once.
good,If you enjoy makeup/beauty I'd recommend working here. You need to be a makeup artist or expert in all things beauty however you need to enjoy beauty activities all together. You learn a lot through co-workers and customers. There is also always lots to do especially in NYC Ulta's because they are usually high volume stores with lots of foot traffic.
good,"Working at Ulta is great if u are trying to build your business. Trainings are always relevant and up to date. Hours are somewhat flexible, but weekends are required."
good,"I am an Esthetician, not a sales floor person. So when I wanted to ask for a day off, only 2 people were allowed to ask, no matter what department you worked in. My being there or not had no impact on who else was working. The manager at the time didn’t give a 2nd thought to you. She only cared about the store, not you. I was hired at $8 or 35% commission, but was not busy enough to ever hit the commission. The ceiling of the treatment room was open to the noisy salon/store floor, and the lights could not dim.  Not conducive to a relaxing facial. 6 months & I quit."
good,"We were in between managers the entire time so the management was a bit crazy. Hours were fine, pay was low but what do you except? Discount made it worth it, especially if you bought the higher end products. They had employee exclusive sales that honestly saved you so much money that it only made sense to buy the make up, so I had a ton of it. "
good,"Schedules we’re poorly made and management was all over the place. Employees are fun and nice, but the job gets overwhelming sometimes. Cashiering is the easiest part!"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ulta Beauty overall, however my training wasn't as in depth as I hoped for I was prepared for a challenge. I enjoyed finding my own way. It was very good learning experience and I genuinely enjoyed the products and services we provided and it was a pleasure to work with others who had shared interests."
good,"This location isn’t bad persay the people are great and you do get gratis occasionally, however I feel as though there is no room for growth in this company. It’s a good stepping stone for someone pursuing a career in the beauty industry, but if you’re looking for a part time job of 32 hours you will not get that here. Realistically you’ll work anywhere between 20-26 hours. If you don’t need that many hours or just want this as a second job I would recommend here."
good,"Please don’t work for this company, I don’t know much more to say, management does not know what’s going on, they always over schedule and then call you 10 minutes before your shift to let you know it was cut"
good,"Typical day at work was interacting with new/regular clients, keeping the sales floor well kept and stocked.  "
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Ulta and have spent time working at two separate locations. In that time i have learned that your experience is shaped by the store you work with. Ulta is a good company to work with, but sometime management goes unregulated and can be hard to be promoted. I worked at one location for 2 years and NEVER got promoted, even after asking about ways to improve and work with those in charge. After the 2 years, I transferred to a different Ulta to continue my 4 year degree, and I was promoted the following week..."
good,I loved working at Ulta and enjoyed the training they provided. There was a lot of room for growth and advancement as an esthetician. Management was always encouraging me to do my best.
good,Ulta Beauty was a dream come true for me. Make up is my passion so landing a job there was great. I learned a lot of different things about make up from co workers. I had the best time helping customers find the right products for them.
good,"Working at Ulta is a fun environment where you meet wonderful people. However, management is weak and often times you are set up for failure. I was quickly promoted from sales associate to manager in 4 months. I ran a store without a general manager for 6 months with 2 other managers. However, Ulta hired a GM who was completely unfit for the position as he openly admitted to not caring about the products we sold or the company itself. We contacted HR and DMs about the issue with no resolutions to anything. If someone needed incidence and leadership we were ignored by not only our GM but the leadership above him as well. Ulta needs to be more willing to listen to it's employees and invest in what individual stores need."
good,"For the short time I was employed at Ulta Beauty in Bend, OR, the experience I had was not what I expected. It was a new store, so I was only a temporary employee, but I was told many times by the manager that I was ""more than qualified"" to move to a permanent position. I did not want to get my hopes up, but I was right. They dropped me and never answered my calls after that. I truly felt like I could have done such a great job at Ulta, because I know makeup and beauty very well. The environment was extremely competitive and gave me lots of anxiety. Very strict dress code and just all around uncomfortable vibes in the store. It was a major disappointment to me, but I still love the store and I still shop there. That store in Bend was brand new, so I understand that they were trying to find the workers they want for permanent positions, and even though they did not choose me, all I wish was for a call back."
good,"As a hairstylist and makeup artist they have you jump through hoops to get to the next level so you can earn another 3% commission. "
good,"If you have drive and self motivation , this will be a great place to start your career. culture an environment is fun! Follow the process and it all will work out."
good,"Fun place to work at, just manager is always extremely uptight thinking that everyone going to the store is ready to steal. Also, you only work 12 hrs a week or even less! Plus going in at 6am on a Sunday, sucked! Didnt even have time to enjoy your weekend!"
good,i was told i would be moved from cashier to beauty advisor within the first year. i worked there for a year and was still at the register. by that time they had changed managemtn so i couldnt say much
good,"Great company, alot of growth opportunites and education programs."
good,I started with Ulta in 2016 and moved up to an MSC in 2 weeks. I loved my job and role until new management took over and it was no longer fun to work there.
good,I was lucky enough to work in an Ulta full of talent and great character. Managers that would build you up and do their best to help. I would work there again.
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in early to help restock the shelves."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast pace and productive. I've learned to be much better with multitasking and time management. The management is kind of unorganized but is effective. The hardest part of the job is around the holidays when we get super busy, but i like a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people find their new looks and helping the customers feel better about themselves."
good,when you actually get the chance to work with clients about their make up needs its so fun. usually they just stick you at the register all day by yourself though.
good,"Management could use some work.The turn over rate for this company is high. If you prefer working in customer service, this is the place for you. The hardest thing you'll do is set up new stands and products throughout the store. I did enjoy my position there, however it did get old. The perfect place for part-time or if you have just moved across town and need extra cash."
good,"As the operations manager I oversee the main functions of the store. I have an operational team that handles shipment and replenishment. It is my responsibility to make sure this happens and if it doesn't to get it done myself. I am responsible for returns to the vendors in order to be compensated for their product being pulled from our floor, so it is detrimental that we provide all of what they ask for in return. I have resets for the store every Sunday morning before opening to provide our guests with the opportunity for our deals or brand new products in the beauty market. Every Monday morning with have planograms for our gondolas with new product or updated price changes. A typical day for me is busy and has to be accurate for our guests to have a great shopping experience. I am well organized and having to oversee the whole store as a function of my job is enjoyable because I am well aware of what we have to offer for product, as well as, the deals that are happening for the week."
good,Ulta is a fast paced environment that encourages their employees to engage with customers and sell merchandise. I personally felt that the company was constantly struggling to hit profit margins & all corporate training was basically just watching a video in the back. The store's stock room also served as the employee's break room so there really wasn't anywhere for the employees to escape and get a breather. During the holidays is the busiest time of year. Theft is a day-to-day challenge that employees must keep their eyes out for.
good,"At the beginning everyone was vey busy but after they changed the management they decided to downsize & reduce employees' hours "
good,I would suggest to work at any Ulta location other than the Jackson store. The job comes with great customers and great benefits.
good,"It's a typical retail environment where you are expected to meet sales goals and drive promotions. There's always going to be people who don't get along, but there are just as many people who do."
good,Great Values & discount! The discount is great. Should really take time to listen to what employees have to say. Feel like they put on a good show of listening but don't.
good,manager was moody. great at training when she would. left the business due to the manager exploding at me while we were in open store hours. a fellow assoc.&  i had really messed up a watch that was purchased at our location by a customer. i had no clue how to fix it because of improper training. tried to phone manager with no response i was left to tell him to return to our store & speak with her directly. i wasn't even sure how to do a return at the time. she was furious and we actually argued on a level that was not professional. i was extremely distraught and left the business. at the time i was the top jewelry sales person and i was in first place for a trip to mexico due to my sales. i did not get to even study for or earn certifications to sell gems or diamonds. i owe my sales capability to customer service i had previously received through other jobs.
good,"Given multiple task in a work environment, I achieve 65% of the sales from the entire store, book appointments, give excellent customer consults, preform a skilled artistry, and continue to drive my team into positive success for the day.  Daily package sending and receiving and daily deposits.  Exchanging Cash and achieving a net promoter score of 80% and above for the store.  Excellent customer service and fulfillment of sales"
good,A typical shift would be myself manning the register and money control.  Management was a joy to work under and co-workers were very easy to work with.  I learned how to be responsible in my first job  experience and cash management.  It was very enjoyable because even though it was laborious retail it taught me a good amount on who I wanted to be as an employee.
good,"Company lacks structure, no clear job duties, no training on makeup application"
good,Greet and assist guests with apropriate products to fit their needs
good,Ulta can be a very fun place to work as long as other's attitudes around you are positive. I've had a very good experience with the managers at my location being very friendly and supportive as well as some of my other co-workers. I would say that hours are cut a lot at my location and things are definitely not very organized. We have way too many employees and not enough hours to give out to make everyone's schedules fairly proportioned.
good,Working in the backroom was much better than working on the floor/front end. Because it’s mostly girls there’s a lot of petty stuff that happens. But the job itself is very easy to do and 90% of the customers you deal with are fantastic. So it’s mostly managers and other employees that make work brutal
good,"Was a really great job until we flooded in 2016, after we reopened, it was just a different atmosphere with the attitudes/hostility that some of the new hires came in with."
good,"At the location I was hired at, although initially an amazing team, its no longer the same. The general manager wants to hang on to control and finds an issue in everything you do or say. "
good,"This was a great company to work for on a day to day basis. There was great team energy and support. That being said, the management is horrible at communication of promotion options, schedule changes, and work expectation and training."
good,"Without a doubt, it is by far one of the best companies out there, unfortunately due to awful management, lack of leadership and high turnover rate, it has deterred me from ever going back to the Holyoke store."
good,"While I worked there, I was pregnant with my third child, so some times getting around wasn't easy. But we were still required to run the salon and greet guest, plus know our way around the store in case they needed assistance in other areas such as make up, or styling tools."
good,"If you've ever worked in retail you prettymuch already know what go expect. No one is full time, always fighting for hours, managers are overworked, there is no training."
good,"Typical day at Ulta Beauty will be for me to open up the store. Making sure everything is open ready. Having the front clean, paper in printers, clean brushes, and also making sure we knew our store goal for the day. I learned how to speak with difficult customer, how to come onto customers with selling products, and also learned more about the company itself. "
good,"I liked working for Ulta it is a great company . However, I worked at a third party call center which was managed poorly. The whole Company 247 Intouch was poorly managed and after 2 years of work, you would only be promoted by favoritism and it was very biast. I have known people who worked there for 5 years that bounced around different lines of business as well as others who were let go for an unjust or no reason at all."
good,Just go with the flow and have fun with your guests.  Don't feed into drama.  You will have fun if you just apply the ideas the give you in coaching.  :)
good,"Always need to have a positive attitude, and be able to multitask with a smile"
good,"Ulta Beauty is a great place to work for someone who is looking for a fun job.  However in the location I worked for the management did not give credit where it was due and ran the store like a high school cafeteria, making work feel more like a popularity contest.  However being someone who loves retail and make up, I was able to look past most of the drama and focus on the parts of the job I enjoyed."
good,The job was fun and not too stressful. Lots of perks as a manger with gradose and other little perks. Working different hours was hard trying to juggle being a single parent with small children.
good,"As a young girl or guy interested in cosmetics and skin care, you will enjoy your time at Ulta as a Beauty Advisor.  You have the chance to work your way up to a Prestige Beauty Advisor in which you are able to color match, and apply makeup on clients and customers as well as take part in monthly trainings on the latest products from some of the industries most trusted brands as well as many new and innovative companies. Even if you are not a Prestige Beauty Advisor, you learn so much from your peers. If you're interested in a training, ask your manager and let him or her know you're interested in moving on up. It isn't always cosmetics- based as some days you may be exclusive to the cash register or a morning shift which usually entails a ""re-set"" for one or more of the store's brand displays. No matter what you're doing at Ulta, you will definitely gain useful experience for your future career as customer service is always a necessary skill. If you want a certain role in the company, don't be afraid to ask!"
good,"this is an okay company to work for. I have had better companies that provide better discounts. the connection between ulta and brands is not continuous. management is not the best and there is a lot of fraternization. management is not fair to everyone in the same way, others are held to different standards than others that have been with the company longer."
good,"Enjoyable place to work if you like cosmetics, skin and hair care. Not great at rewarding seasoned employees for their hard work but getting better. Easy to learn tasks, training is minimal."
good,The managers were never clear on sales goals and the schedule and assigned work seemed unorganized. there was also a lot of drama between coworkers and seemed somewhat hostile
good,"It was great to work for Ulta until management was changed and new management had favorites. Holiday hours are pretty heavy, especially if you work a full time job and this is a part time job."
good,"After working at Ulta for over 2 years, I can truly say that it has been a rewarding experience with many lessons learned along the way. The management at my stores (both Boise and Meridian) have been great and easy to work with."
good,We were not given opportunities to advance and hours would get cut because too many seasonal employees were hired. The store manager wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. She focused too much on credit card signups even going through dishonest practices to get our numbers up.
good,Easy job!  You learn a lot about the products and the new products that are in the store.  Pay was decent and they worked with my schedule because I also had a full time job.
good,employees are passionate about makeup and have to be able to work all kind of different kinds of people and have to always to have an eye out for theft. and can multi talk and run a cash register. Always with a warm smile
good,"It’s basically every girls dream to work at such a little popular makeup store, but know it’s not just playing with makeup all day. You’ll most likely be a beauty advisor who’s at the cash wrap ringing up customers who take their anger out on you if their shopping experience didn’t go their way. It’s very fast paced and your head has to be in the game the whole time. And just a heads you’re going to deal with customers mad over a coupon 50% of your time"
good,"I gained the most retail experience in my life working for this company. From a teller, I learned how to stock inventory, customer service, and cash management. As a head teller, I learned how to train other employees and make returns, which in turn, advanced my customer service and cash management sales. As an assistant manager, I learned how to do payroll and manage a team of 10-15 associates. I learned how to be a team leader and a team player. If I could, I would work corporately for this company. This company definitely believes in career advancement and achieving goals."
good,If they didnt have a point system the turn over wouldnt be so high. a new manager came in she cleaned house. but had a habit of talking about other staff which i found to be uncomfortable.
good,"This is a cool place to work if you wanna dip your toe into the makeup scene but don't know where to start. I learned a lot about products and people. I loved getting to see all the new makeup that came out and trying them out on people."
good,Ulta is a pretty good company to work for. The pay could be better and there are no benefits for employess who dont have a management position. Great company!
good,Working for Ulta taught me a lot about customer service skills and created a drive to achieve results/goals. The hours prevented the ability to have a healthy work-life balance.
good,"Great learning experience, but too much is expected for so little pay, hard to be yourself in a corporate salon the environment was very uptight and uneasy."
good,"I learned how to delegate and multitask, developed customer service skills. "
good,great part time job blah blah blah blah they're making me do this and i don't really know why. The best part is the free stuff but it varies by manager.
good,"I liked working at Ulta for the most part, but management started to cut hours and would not give people a head's up first. That became frustrating for me, and I was not receiving the number of hours I needed, so I resigned from the position,"
good,"Nice environment to work in."
good,"The customers can be pretty horrible but if you love make up and make up culture you'll really enjoy working here. Sometimes it can be a pain because if you don't sell enough, hours will be cut from everyone and it's hard to keep a monthly budget."
good,"Great environment to work if you love makeup and working with people. Always get to learn more about new products, and interact with different types of people to gain more experience in the beauty industry"
good,This job was a very good job and I was sad to leave but unfortunately had to leave due to the fact I had to go to school full time and they didn't agree with me having class on Saturday. I loved helping my costumers find the right thing and see the smile on their face. It was always fun to get to test the new makeup and facial products. There was never a dull moment when working here. You always had someone to help or something to straighten or something to put away or clean. The co-workers were always so nice and never seemed to be upset or irritated. There was always a smile on every ones face.
good,"Cleaning office prepare dockets for people coming to see the doctor going to the bank, the different types of eye problems"
good,"I absolutely loved working at Ulta. It was such a fun place to work and my co-workers were great. However, the general manager is absolutely god awful. She is rude to her employees and her other managers. There were over ten people that quit in a 5 month time span because of her. Customers complained about her as well. I actually quit because of her. If she were to leave the company I would definitely go back to my job there and would probably stay in the company."
good,"Typically, Ulta management should be very positive approachable hard workers. Fast efficient work is key. The job tasks are never very hard but may be stressful due to time pressures or guest experiences. I acquired very useful team building and guest service skills. I do feel that the district manager doesn't care about lower associates like store managers do. She tends to make things harder for cashiers or prestige simply because of her personal preferences and does not actually take in to account their needs."
good,"Ulta is still a new company, so they still have some kinks to work out. The customers are all very pleasant and loved the new store. Hardest: There was often little communication concerning duties, expectations, or goals. I would have to ask a lot of questions. Breaks often weren't offered unless I asked. New store, hired too many young girls.  I was probably the oldest there at age 48.  Most were in their 20s.   Most enjoyable: working with some of the best products around.    Only paid $8.50 per hour."
good,"I really enjoyed working there at first but then the GM started to abuse her power and screamed at people and yelled profanities over the smallest of errors. Plus after working there for a  year and a half I got one very small raise that wasn't enough to keep me there.  I enjoyed most of the people I worked with but I can't support the fact that after all of the problems the GM caused, she is still working there. Very disappointed in that, considering she's been reported to HR multiple times."
good,"great decent place with poor management. I worked as a cashier and as a stock associate, making sales of makeup and cosmetics."
good,"It was a pleasure working at Ulta Beauty, There of course were some bumps in the road but at most jobs there will be, and I take what's given to me and work with it. it was fun, colorful and a pleasure to work there for as long as I did"
good,I liked working at ulta. I got along with all my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with snobby customers which is expected sometimes. It didn't get busy until the evening which i liked.
good,"Typical day was to log into POS system. Assist customers when needed to get rang up. Put go backs away, kept cashwrap clean. I learned how to use POS system. management was easy going and my co-workers were young and outgoing. there wasn't a hard part about the job, the most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,"Overall, Ulta was a great place to work. It was fun and a really good experience to have received. I learned a lot about patience and responsibility and leadership. The hardest part about the job was the customers, it was really hard to get yelled at for something out of my control for a majority of my shift! It was a great learning experience though!"
good,"high dollar sales encouraged, no commission. little to no flexibility on scheduling- typical retail store. trainings are great but not all managers go to trainings so it makes it very difficult to teach managers at a prestige advisor level, they dont take you seriously."
good,"Good money. Long hours."
good,The management and treatment of other employees was worrisome but overall a very fun and rewarding place to work. The pay could have been better for the amount of work.
good,"I love working in the makeup industry, however working with ALL women kind of proved to be an issue. There’s a lot of shadiness going on and management does play favorites. The discounts are nice but they are pretty strict with being late and calling off etc. I genuinely liked it but I left for a multitude of reasons. Honestly if I got paid more I would probably go back and tolerate the mess I dealt with."
good,"It's all about who you work with that make this store a great place to work. The pay was very low for someone in management. Great experience for a fast paced environment, but has all the retail cons."
good,Scheduling was sometimes difficult but other than that it was pretty good for my first retail job. I always wanted to be on the floor helping customers but was always put behind counter or stocking the shelves.
good,Change in management was tough but overall the company supports continued education. If you started booked you had more say over your schedule. If not you got a lot of late evening shifts.
good,Working at Ulta gave me the opportunity to help others find what they needed and also gave me a good relationship between me and my customers for them to want to come back and shop with me. I make everyone feel welcomed
good,It is a really good place to work as a college student. They are very flexible with their hours but no room to grow. Management rarely helped and would disappear.
good,"Very poor GM. She was not a partner that would develop and train her associates, she was a boss who sat in the office and did not fulfill her job expectations. She delegated down her own tasks to lower management, and often did not schedule to allow for breaks, leaving us working for 7-8 hours without. The only time she communicated to the staff was when she was pulling you into the office for a ""documented"" discussion. The worst! Even though all of my areas of responsibility (ie: inventory, salon, credit) had increased gains in two years, she gave me a poor review, even though I often worked six days so she could travel! on two occasions, she forgot her store keys at home, leaving me to rush to the store to help her out without her paying me, or a thank you. On one of those occasions, I had to cut short my daughter's roller skating outing two towns over to rush to the store. December third of last year. It's sad, because it was once such a great place to work!"
good,Not a bad job but not the best. Pay is low and favoritism is showed a lot. co workers are descent and it’s very slow other than holiday season other than that it’s a okay place to work
good,Not a bad company to work for if you get the right manager. I didn’t like how they only scheduled you 4 hour shifts unless you are a manager. Overall my experience here was pretty good.
good,"It was a good work environment, but be prepared for the possibility of short hours and unreasonable work goals for just one or two people. Working as a cashier was super easy, but they have you under a certain quota that you have to meet for the week, so be prepared."
good,I'd say Ulta is a good place to start for those going back into; or just beginning their working experience. They allow you to be a self starter and take part in what needs to be done in order to provide outstanding customer service as well as present a pristine and welcoming store. I wouldn't suggest it as a forever job unless you are wanting to climb the ranks and really get into the heart of the business itself.
good,"While I love working at Ulta, having been an employee for almost two years, the company is not a reliable place to work. You are only guaranteed one 4 hour shift a week. The company will hire more associates, rather than give it's current employees more hours. It is disappointing since it is a fun place to work overall and you learn a lot of product knowledge."
good,"The education offered and required is done in a very time friendly manner, with no extra cost to employees. They have a great structured support system with very direct expectations."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and assisting them in choosing products to make them feel confident!  The workplace culture was acceptable and I made sure I brought in positive energy to contribute to that.
good,"I loved to work for Ulta, as a makeup artist I was a prestige beauty advisor and took place of my prestige manager once she left to have her baby. I was promoted from being lead cashier to prestige, but only got a little bit of a raise. I was only there for three hours a shift, and that was normally called off anyways if they didnt need me. I was doing managers work, for less pay and not enough hours. That is essentially why I left."
good,"At the time, makeup was my dream so working here helped me get better and I can say I Benefited from working here. Management was helpful and when I went away to school, they offered to hold my position or when I came home"
good,"I really do like my work as part of the tasking team as well as the group of people I work with. It's hands on and you have a few tasks each time you go in that really make time go by quickly. Requires moving around quite a bit and some lifting of things but nothing major."
good,"Hours were flexible but limited.  Management was amazing and very communicative with all employees.  The whole crew felt like family.  Sometimes, snacks or small gifts were sent by corporate or by popular brands available in the store."
good,I loved working there and I learned a lot over the years. I ultimately left because I never had a set schedule and planning for anything was impossible. I was also very underpaid in my role. I made the store functional however the pay was not near enough. The district manager was also terrible! She doesn’t know the business or how to prioritize delegations.
good,ulta is lots of fun for a first job. not much room for promotion but it was a good time . They give you a lunch break if you are working all day which is nice and the employee discount is amazing. The onboarding training is a painful and lengthy process however.
good,They can improve on giving more hours and raise the salary. Other than that it’s a fun environment and the employee discount is amazing! I enjoyed my time at Ulta.
good,Very nice people to work with schedule was not organized but overall very nice to work there. Discount was very great. Customer service is very important there.
good,Overall Ulta is a great company to work for with lots of benefits. The employee discounts are amazing and getting gratis makes working at the Ulta very fun because you get to try things and give your personal experiences on products to clients. It all really comes down to the location you work at and your managers. I’ve had some really great managers and some horrible ones.
good,"Depending on management it could be a downer. Overall I loves working there. Loved the team I got to spend so many years with. Takes time to get a good ampit of hours, bit if you're a hard worker they will give them to you"
good,Great place. They could be better about understanding one’s time off and promoting from within. I wish that there were more training opportunities and benefits. I also have realized that in most stores there aren’t any truly trained makeup artists and that they are using cashiers as makeup artist instead of having an actual artistry team.
good,"I did not have much luck with my store. I lived a little too far and the commute made it difficult to have a better work and life balance. I did learn a lot at Ulta but, like any job you must be an active worker to make the best out of your day. As a stylist I had a little bit of a different duty then someone on the floor. Team work makes Ulta work smoother and if you have a staff that communicates and enjoys each others company you have found a perfect fit ! Ulta was great but having relationships with my coworkers in other departments made my job as a stylist more beneficial because I could help assist with various topics from make up to skin- not only hair. This communication between beauty advisers helped my chair and their sales."
good,"Work life balance is difficults great if your in management, other then that its minium wage. Training should be done for all associates on new products. Every store should be ran the same. Pushing the credit card only leads to employee turn over."
good,"Overworked, Underpaid and Underappreciated. High turnover, catty managers and no actual training or education. Rude customers and dirty location, good for a part time job."
good,"I liked that I got to meet new people and interact with them while I was helping them out with their makeup shopping! It was a fun experience, but the paying wage was not too good, it was too much work for how much they payed."
good,"Hours are unpredictable, but the job has good discounts and such. You often don’t find out about your next weeks schedule until only a few days before. Having to take a day off is difficult if you don’t plan 3 weeks in advance, and if you get sick, there is no sick days, so you personally have to call around to your coworkers to find coverage, or face getting a point."
good,"Here, I was a cashier, helped with truck days and stocking merchandise, changed store displays, helped with store remodel, and worked at other locations. Management changed a few times while I worked here. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with and still shop and get services done here."
good,"It really depends on your manager, but I for the most part thoroughly enjoyed my time with Ulta. With any company, management can be an issue, especially if the manager is inexperienced."
good,if u you become a fully committed employee it hard to have a work life balance and theres not a lot of room for growth unless u build good relationships with higher ups i personally love it there my customers are great and i always have a good time with my co workers
good,"Ulta provides"" All Things Beauty-all in one place"" "
good,I really loved my time working at Ulta. It is a real fun environment and a great company to work for. Unfortunately the salon had  very weak management and long periods with no management and once they finally brought in someone they destroyed us as a team and there was a lot of drama and favoritism. It was sad that I had to give up a job I loved for such poor management ethics and immaturity.
good,I love working for Ulta because of the people I'm around and the support they provide. Wages are insultingly low for the amount of work that is expected.
good,"Working at ulta was honestly an amazing experience. Not only did I learn a ton, but I was able to develop my customer service and managing skills while doing something I loved and had fun with. I loved the company and their values, the work atmosphere, and the work itself. My only complaint is with company policies, especially those regarding hours and employee manning. (They always had so few of us doing the work of WAY too many and expected us to do it in too little time without going over their allotted hours- it was nearly impossible some weeks)"
good,Awesome place work work everyone gets along beautiful people management isn’t the best but coworkers make up for it. Just like any normal retail job just have to know your stuff of beauty
good,"In my opinion, a typical day was enjoyable and wonderful!  I loved being a designer, performing salon sanitation and providing great customer service.  "
good,Customer service skills are a must. It’s a great place to build customer service experience and product knowledge. Pay could be better as well as benefits.
good,"Not many hours offered,  offers great discounts, over employed. Management is fair, fair relationship with co workers, safe and fun environment. Makeup!"
good,Decent work environment. Great customers. Great products. Good prices. Management was okay like any other job some managers are great others are just ok
good,The people there are friendly. The work I did was fast paced but not too overwhelming. The management team were excellent. I lived nearby so the commute was short.
good,I love working here.  Love the environment within the workplace. The management is a great team and have a great way of influencing the whole store to work as a team.
good,I absolutely love working for ULTA they treat their employees fair and there is room for growth within this company. I had a terrible store manager that made this job unbearable. I would highly recommend this company just not my store manager!
good,"Great for a first job! Hate that beauty advisors can't be full time. 10 hours/week NOT GOOD. Managers tend to focus more on people getting signed up for rewards card. ""Sign more people up and you will get more hours"" well give me more hours and I can sign more people up!"
good,Ulta Beauty  (the salon) Is a great place to work as you start and build up your clientele... but the St Augustine Ulta has had the reputation to be the lowest performing Ulta as far as customer service and good management.
good,"I love learning about new trends and helping customers. "
good,"Getting paid to play with makeup?  Yes, please!!  Super fun as a part time or temporary job but advancement takes a while.  Great vendors and perks so try it out."
good,Hard to find good balance with life and work. Each location varies in regards to management. Very quick paced with a lot to remember and a lot of responsibilities. Easy to move forward if you show interest and drive. The GM has a lot of control over job happiness.
good,"During my time with Ulta, it was a very diverse learning environment. Defientley a place to learn about all the different lines of make up and hair care products. Management needed a lot of work considering it was more based on favoritism. That was seen even in upper management with the Regional and District managers. Although I was an Associate Manager of People my work was never recognized even though I did the best I could with what I was given. However in saying that I honestly LOVED my job and interacting with the customers and the employees. I was told, when I had to put my 2 weeks in, that I would always have a place at Ulta to come back if I choose. Well that was a false sense of hope when I did try to come back just as a lead cashier and GC. I was basically blacklisted and no one in that region would hire me. Even though I hadn't done anything wrong upper management enforced her options about me so now I can no longer work at an Ulta at any of the locations near me."
good,Love working with the my co-workers! management right now is pretty awesome too. just don't expect to make a living just by working here unless your a manager.
good,Good place to start a career in beauty but does not pay well or give good hours. You have to stick with it for a while but you can move up fairly easily if you stick with it and are motivated
good,"I learned that no matter what level you are, you need to be a subject matter expert. Things change quickly and you need to be able to respond fast. If you dont learn quickly, things can start to be overwhelming for you"
good,"Over all a good company to work for.  Atypical day at work includes recruiting, maintain relationships and filling orders."
good,"Enjoyed the year of experience with the company, but wont ever work there for how they treat employees who want to advance in their careers outside of the company."
good,Working in the ULTA salon is vastly different than working at the front end of the store. There is an entirely different culture that is warm and inviting.
good,"I learned so much about cosmetics, skin and hair care products, beauty tools, and overall how to effectively, professionally, and kindly interact with customers. The hardest part of the job was truck day when the truck would come with all the products. I'd have to be at work by 4AM every Monday morning to sort through boxes and organize them according to product and then stock them in their proper place. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I got to work for a company that I was already loyal to because I am a cosmetic and skin care guru. Management was inconsistent, we went through three different General Managers in just the time I worked there. My co-workers were professional and friendly, and always willing to lend a helping hand. A typical day at work would be coming in, clocking in, going up to the front counter and checking people out. Occasionally I'd be given additional projects like putting stray products back in their proper location or helping another department."
good,"I loved working for Ulta Beauty. I loved that they let you help out other stores when they needed it. i loved what they stand for, however I do not like that they tell you that you can come to them for anything, yet when you do they do nothing. Or in my case, say you are a liar and fire you. Its very upsetting to give them your all and them not appreciate you. I was going for GM and instead i was stabbed in the back by my GM and fellow associates."
good,benefit was fun to work for. i was one of the arch expert loved it. love their products. always busy and something to do specially when they come up with new product
good,Great place to gain experience. Great co workers and good place to learn how to further my facials and waxing skills. The training was very helpful for my career.
good,"Haircut, color, and great conversation with my clients and staff......Perfect day if I don't say so myself. I learned new concepts and techniques from other stylists and management. I always had someone to talk to , and found time to laugh and talk about everyday events in our lives and trading secrets. Hardest part of my day was a slow one where their was no money to be made. But a busy day was always a good day and when tips were plentiful"
good,I love working for ULTA......However there is NO WORK LIFE BALANCE!!!!!!
good,the most amazing aspect of Ulta was the amazing customers.  I made lifelong relationships with many of my Ulta clients and they have followed me to my private practice.
good,"This was my first job. I loved it. Learned a lot about the field that is one of my passions. The managers weren't very nice but the customers and stylists, and cashiers were awesome. I never had a dull day here."
good,GREAT coworkers! LOVED my managers! EASY Work! Retail is also hard with upkeep and your customers!
good,Overall a good place to work. The pay scale is a little low but the continuing education opportunities make up for it.
good,The managers make sure that the stock room and floor are always neat and tidy. I enjoyed working here for the most part. Some days I did feel under appreciated and feel that the pay was not the best.
good,Helping customer find want they need makes me feel so good.Not having want the customer needs makes me really unhappy. Having over stock shelf’s is a pain when u got to go fix somebody else mess before u put stuff out.
good,"Great people to work with, store discount. Willing to work with schedule. Holiday parties. A lot of customer service work. A lot of stocking, cash register work."
good,Managers supported staff and made working enjoyable. Work is work but working at ulta felt more like shopping with friends so it was never a drag to clock in.
good,"The energy is fun, and the vibe is inclusive. You'll meet a variety of people, and have lots of fun learning about the new products. The discount is nice as well."
good,"Wonderful place to work, I enjoy being part of a passionate team and it is always fun being there. There is opportunity to grow and be successful. Definitely would recommend!"
good,Working at Ulta was a great stepping stone for bigger and better if you work in the salon. The continued education is amazing and your coworkers are always full of life. Helping customers becomes a daily goal.
good,Overall a pretty decent jobs..nice for seasonal pay. You gain alot of new experiences working here & meeting new people. The environment is always good.
good,I loved working with others who had the same passion for Makeup and Beauty the way I do. Loved recommending and selling products. I also think that Ulta has great benefits in terms of PTO and vacation time.
good,I enjoyed working here I found a lot of things that I enjoyed mainly working with makeup and being able to create relationships with customers and employees to grow!
good,Working for a big company sucks at times because of all the rules you must follow without any leniency. Hated the attendance/point aspect - made it all feel very high school. Good for an in-between job.
good,"i feel like this is the perfect part time job for anyone whether it's your first job, seasonal job, or just a small job to make ends meet. they are the perfect job to have. they are spot on with teamwork, and going by the book."
good,"I was lucky to have an amazing team so working each day was overall a good experience. The one down side is I have experienced sub par managers, and that can ruin the environment."
good,A typical day at work consisted of consulting with costumers about their skin care/ makeup needs. Walking around and talking to costumers was required in order to make sales.
good,"A typical day working at Ulta (cashier position/floor) was helping customers in any way possible, maintaining the store clean, and cleaning the store when there were no customers."
good,I enjoyed my time at ulta beauty. But I was getting married and needed a change of employment. Learned a lot of things for enhancing my skills as a esthetician!
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, but had some unpleasant management at the location I worked at. The overall environment is nice, and helping customers is very gratifying."
good,The job itself is a lot of responsibility because you are doing almost everything around the store. Beauty advisors are the employees that work the most beside managers .
good,Great environment to work in due to having so many skills and the background of cosmetology. It made it extra special because they searched me out rather than me going out and finding them.
good,"i have nothing to say about my job at ulta.  It is what is being paid minimum wage, i had fun and enjoyed majority of the staff that i was with.  Of course working with all females can be complicated but i enjoyed my years with this business"
good,"enjoyable job where I learned about sales and makeup, connected well with fellow employees and got my foot in the door with retail responsibilities during a very busy time in the season"
good,This is a good company to work for. The environment just depends on the team and the leaders. Every place has it's own groups of people who get along and don't. This place is no different.
good,"fun productive place to work, management could be improved. allowed growth with the company which is awesome. benefits are really good.  great team of people/.."
good,Ulta is a fabulous company but the management at this location was always a bit shaky. Never had consistency and always involved with drama. I had some great managers that really helped me excel but others I had were very hard to get a long with and made it difficult for almost all employees to enjoy their work life
good,I enjoyed my time working for Ulta. I learned a great deal from my team and managers there and the opportunity provided a great Segway to my cosmetic career.
good,"I work at one of the distribution center that supplies ULTA chain stores so the work is different than in the stores.  I work in the Quality Assurance department conducting inventory management and ensuring product availability.  I enjoy the my job, the company and the people I work with.  The pay is pretty good and they have exceptional benefit options.  The only downside to the job is that the distribution center is not climate controlled.  Other than that, if you would like a job in the Supply Chain field I would recommend one of their distribution centers."
good,"Always something to do and always room for growth. The discount wasn't the best, but you were one of the first to know about upcoming products. Great opportunities for clientele."
good,Pretty adequate. It gets a little boring after the first few days of working there. The entry level position there doesn't have very many responsibilities and it makes work uninteresting to me.
good,"There is room to grow at Ulta, but with that comes some growing pains.  Work life balance could be better, and the amount of working hours required by  Managers during peak season is very high."
good,"Your experience will vary WILDLY depending on location and management. As part of the task team I worked mostly early mornings (5 or 6AM). Beauty Adviser positions are part time, probably will never get full time. They don't promote within. Raises are basically not a thing. You do get fun training and nice gratis depending on your managers. Guests can be amazing or terrible. Flexible work hours. Most of the associates are amazing and we get along like family. A good, fun starter job, but not for long term."
good,"Fun lively place to work, I got along great with everyone! I was promoted within the year, job advancement opportunities were decent. Management communication was not the best."
good,"Ulta is a great company for those interested in beauty and retail. Hours are fair, but it would be best if you lived close by to it because of pay. Overall it's a great company to work for."
good,"Ulta is a great opportunity for stylists but thats it! Retail is hard and demanding theres not much room to grow. However when it comes to being a stylist for Ulta there is no other company that offers what Ulta does. Sliding scale commission, free education, conferences for recognized achievements, one on one manager/stylist book building, 401k, insurance plans, paid time off for full-time employees, maternity leave isnt great at all but its better than nothing."
good,"All of my managers and coworkers at Ulta were fun, likable, and willing to help my with anything I needed. I enjoyed the environment of the store and the responsibilities of the job."
good,Great discount! Not enough money to survive but its awesome being around the richest people in the state of Texas. Its pretty motivational the area is beautiful and refreshing. Who doesnt wana play in make up all day!
good,great place to work with amazing coworkers as well as clients. I wax eyebrows at the brow bar and have created great relationships with all clientele.
good,"Working at Ulta has been a very eye-opening opportunity, with a great work environment, including great coworkers and management teams. However, I was offered 29 hours a week and never got it, which can be frustrating. I do recommend working for this company; every shift I work, I highly enjoy."
good,Really gained more out of customer service and sales after working at this job. My favorite part of the job was getting dressed up and learning about makeup. I really saw myself grow while working at this company.
good,Enjoyed working there good part-time / second job to have. Laid back but fast past. Also easy to learn about the store and store products that they have.  Getting 25-50% on your purchases isn't bad either.
good,I really enjoyed working at Ulta. The staff was great and being around makeup all day was so enjoyable! I would recommend working at Ulta if you are starting out in makeup as well as if you have experience.
good,"A typical day at work included walking around the sales floor and helping guests find the products they needed. We also offered recommendations. Some days I would be stationed at the register. Thursday nights we had our Truck Shift, which involved opening many, many boxes and restocking the shelves. The management was pretty good at my location and I enjoyed working with my coworkers!"
good,"It is a good place to work. However the pay is lacking,and there is times where you will not get 40 hrs a week due to lack of orders. unfortately the temps are the frist ones they have leave. SO if you live on a tight budget or any budget at all it can be tough. If you are brought in with a temp position you might not be hired in that same position. Its pretty much grab anything you can and most likely you will not be on first shift as their employee any time soon."
good,Awesome place to work.  The work environment was very fair. The customers were the best part of the job.  It was a very team oriented operation which I liked.
good,"Working for Ulta for over 13 years I came to believe in the company's mission and work ethic.  My favorite part of working for Ulta was the opportunity to identify talent and mentor, develop and train them for growth  in the company.  The culture is upbeat, inspiring and fun."
good,"The pay was fair for the amount of work required. You definitely need to be on your toes about new information regarding existing products and new launches. You will need to expect to interact with a wide array of different personalities, therefore, interpersonal communication is very important in addition to patience and courtesy."
good,"Super fun job, awesome benefits, always something to do. I loved working here but left because of the management. I wouldn't mind working here again!!"
good,"Great Place to work when your fresh out of school and want to learn about the beauty industry. "
good,"I haven't worked for Ulta for a long period of time, but there are aspects that are nice but of course others that are not. They are kind of rude to new people at first, they treat you like you're incompetent. There is only one manager out of the many that I feel like recognizes hard work and effort. If you're a beauty advisor, you're going to be responsible for a lot with little to no credit given to you because they view you as ""just"" a beauty advisor so they make you run the register often times alone, pick up calls, greet incoming guests, and put out products all at once, it can be overwhelming a bit. And the co-workers are really what makes this environment not fun. Some are great and helpful, others are just blatantly rude, don't give you the time of day, etc. The plus sides are that the job itself is decent, you can keep yourself busy easily, the shifts feel like they go by fast. And if you love beauty, it's great."
good,"Ulta can be a great place to work if you love makeup and fun events although, there is a lot of micro management. You will definitely learn a lot about makeup although, you must walk the floor and clean if there are no guests. Talking to coworkers is allowed but kept to a minimum when on the clock."
good,Very fun and stylish. Free to be craetive. Everyday was something new but opportunities werre limited and growth was also limited. In order to grow travel and more education was needed
good,"Granted, I didn't work for Ulta as a career but was a decent workplace for students. Management at 469 is willing to work with your school schedule. The wage is minimum and don't expect a huge pay raise if you have a passion for cosmetics unless you have no work experience. Some customers are entitled but for the most part they are understanding. I would prefer to work here than a fast food restaurant. The hardest part is dealing with go backs and long lines and occasionally coworkers. The most enjoyable part is that most management are understanding, and lots of coworkers are fun to talk too."
good,there isn't room for much growth or learning. I felt like they pay for the brow girls was better instes of being an esthetician.  Management was terrible.
good,"Great entry level job, able to grow with company and learn new professional skills. Hours are consistent and multiple positions available in every store"
good,"Working at this company is definitely great for growth opportunities. "
good,Ulta provides the necessary tools to grow within the company as well as future companies. Provides great benefits as well as enough paid vacation and personal time
good,"A typical day was mostly getting to talk with people who have the same interest and passion that I did about beauty. I learned what it was like to make a person feel confident and help them find exactly what they were looking for. Unfortunately, the managers at my location didn't seem to value, trust or respect my contribution to the company, and didn't give me any pointers or constructive criticism to help me do better. But the culture was something I truly agreed with. The hardest part of the job was when I couldn't find what the guest was looking for, and they left disappointed. But the most enjoyable part was making a true connection with and making them feel confident and beautiful"
good,"Ulta Managers are too clickish. They only promote you if they like you. I didn't have many issues besides a hater  Manager. Old Bird"
good,It was pretty regular everyday clock in and get to the register organize see who was on the schedule that day and wait on customers. Also you could enjoy one of the benefits or using the products.
good,"The place is clean and air conditioned, the work isnt too physically demanding and supervisors are nice. The Hr team are friendly and willing to listen to staff needs and any concerns."
good,"This job is great for students who need flexible shifts. The work environment is fun and challenging, and as an employee, one will meet with diverse populations daily."
good,"ULTA Beauty strives to create a work environment that is fun, challenging, and rewarding. Although career advancement is minimal, and there is more lateral movement, rather than upward movement available.  Management style will vary from store-to-store."
good,It offers a lot of good benefits and is one of the easier warehouses to work at. They have good shifts provided they are not swamped in OT. The hardest part of the job is during seasonal time when OT is highest with black Friday.
good,Great place to work if you’re a full time high school student. You get to learn so much about the beauty industry and get to play with so many products before they come out.
good,The hardest part of the job is waking up early and showing up and not having any work to do. So you get sent home. Happened alot at the end of peak season. Work slowed down and we were getting sent home. Hours got cut short
good,loved the atmosphere and how it lets their workers be creative. The job was very easy and fun but they were also very under staffed so it was a lot harder to ring people up.
good,"The company was a great environment. Some management and senior management issues. Overall, great leadership and company values."
good,"The management didn't know what to do. It was unfair how they gave you hours based on who many people you got signed up for the loyalty program. I was hired to get 30 hours a week and was getting 12-16 hours a week. Which for a college student, was not feasible. If you asked for more hours you were not given. One part i liked doing was shipment, it was fun and early in the morning and you got to put away new makeup no one had seen yet!"
good,A typical work day at Ulta was very busy most of the time. We always had something to do weather that be cashiering and making sure the floor was clean. Management was good they treated every employee equal.
good,"Ulta environment depends on management. If you have a real strict boss things can get crazy. "
good,great place to work. Everyone was extremely nice and helped show me how to do everything and showed me the whole layout of the store so I was comfortable working there.
good,Loved most of the customers I was working with. Left because of management style and the favoritism shown in the upper levels of management for this district and store.
good,"I am hoping to work for Ulta again.  I enjoyed my job.  I love helping people feel good about themselves.  I have a tremendous amount of experience in this field and am totally confident in myself to do an excellent  job on applying makeup, assisting in skin care and dealing with the customers in a more than positive way.  I feel I would be an asset to the company and would serve them well,  Thank you"
good,"Ulta is a fun place to work. It's a retail job so hours vary, My workers were really nice and fun which made working there even better. Had to leave for career advancement."
good,"low hrs for part time"
good,"good company to work for with nice managers however, the customers were sometimes questionable. The tasks were sometimes tedious and long, taking up a full 8 hour shift somedays"
good,Nice environment but very low pay. Discounts were great but the job didn't have a lot of accountability and everything seemed a little scattered from location to location.
good,"If Ulta had more options for their employees to advance, or just gave positions as full time cashiers I think their employees would stay longer, and in turn we wouldn't have so much turn-around.  The managers are great, the pay is decent, but they need to offer more to their low-level employees."
good,Overall the job was fun when i worked there. It was overall steady most of the day expect at night. During the holiday seasons was really the only time when it was hectic .
good,they had a continuing education program that was amazing! Always on top of trends and new products! fast-paced environment and easy overall. not physically straining.
good,"Great management and coworkers. Relaxed environment. I really enjoyed working for Ulta, the only problem is the hourly pay is pretty low But I did enjoy the discount!"
good,"Ulta was a great place to work. All the girls were fun and joyful, they really knew how to have a good time but get the work done too. I've learned that no matter who you are or what your background is, the girls at Ulta accept you no matter what."
good,"Ulta it is a great experience for me, and personally it teaches you how to adapt to different personalities. It also allows me to have room for personal growth within develop management."
good,"A typical day at work was fairly busy at my location, I learned to be patient and try to take make the customers and managers feel heard. I often got caught talking to 3 or more of them at one time."
good,"A typical day at Ulta for me was, waking up at 5am to be ready for work at 6am to do truck. I would unwrap the crates of boxes with 50 or more boxes and separate them in categories, by product. Then take them out onto the sales floor to restock. I've learned how to stock and do bit of inventory, along with learning more about beauty products. Management wasn't the best since i was there we had three store managers and It was confusing to to have different managers, because each manager wanted things done in a different way, so every few months a new one would come in a replace the old and change out the system we got use to. Then work culture was great, they took pride in there products. The hardest part was, getting use to a new system each time a new manager got hired. The most enjoyable part of my job, are the employees we all became friends helped each other out and worked as a family."
good,Most of the people that work there are very nice and welcoming. It is a good job to start off with however not one with secured/steady hours.  You are able to move up in rank however you need to be there for a certain amount of years which is hard to want to be because of the lack of hours.
good,I worked for Ulta as a Beauty advisor for about a year and and half and I loved it up until new management was hired & completely flipped all the policies and dropped my hours to 4-10 hours a week. All the new hirers were giving 20-30 hours weekly...
good,Definitely high-volume customer service. Being able to assist guest with product knowledge. Being able to be upbeat in a fast-paced environment getting along well with others and being able to utilize products in your everyday life
good,"Working at Ulta was overall a pleasant experience. I enjoyed being there. I learned how to operate a register, manage money, stock merchandise, and help customers determine what products best fit their needs."
good,"A typical day at work I am either on the cash register or on the floor selling product. Usually it's busy, but when it isn't, I restock the ""little delights"" that grab customers attention. It's nice and a fun place to work. Customer Service is definitely not for everyone though."
good,"Great opportunity to build relationships with many artists and other industry professionals.  Large selection of major cosmetic brands utilized by popular social media ""experts"""
good,One of the supervisors told me I was too quiet in front of everybody. My problem was he was hardly there during my shifts so how was I supposed to talk to him if he wasn't there.
good,The hardest part of working was staying super late after midnight when I also had school in the morning. Co-workers were friendly and it was enjoyable working there.
good,"In my opinion when I was hired, the manager had already too many people on staff. I was literally only working one day a week so I had no choice but to leave."
good,"Ulta is a good company to start in if you're looking for something for a short period of time. Not something I would want as a forever job, but for some it may be a forever job."
good,"Was okay to work for, not many hours, was fun when I was actually working though. Loved helping people. More training needed and better communication."
good,"Learned a lot about working with other people and delivering customer service and the benefits were excellent, I'm grateful I worked there for so many years."
good,Working for Ulta was a fun and easy going job with a positive environment and great clientele. I enjoyed my brief time there and would recommend applying to Ulta to a friend.
good,It was very relaxed most of the time and then sometimes very busy. I learned a lot of credit ideas that I still use today. I never used makeup until I worked there so learning from professional was awesome.
good,Working 12 hours shift..its was long but fun too...i like the way the place was clean ...loading boxes onto the trailers all day and all night..ot was fun
good,Nice clean place to work. Regular work days are satisfying customers and helping them find the right shade of makeup. Make sure the store and registers are  organized and clean.
good,"I love my coworkers, but some times the hours and management is a bit difficult. You have to work so hard to be acknowledged and there is to much favoritism."
good,"A typical day at work was working with another manager for the majority of the time. We were the only two people available within the retail side of the store. It can be a pain when it gets a bit busy during the week. There were more people working on weekdays. What I learned was different types of skincare and beauty products. Vendors will come in for different brands and will talk about their products and the benefits of using them. When working in prestige, you get to do trainings for different brands to learn about their products too which was alway fun. There is so much gratis (free products) which is amazing! The workplace can get difficult at time. My shop had a lot of people trying to steal. And some of the girls that worked in the salon or even on the retail side were very catty. There is alway some type of gossip going around. I enjoyed meeting new people and vendors. Some are still close people in my life. And the amount of skincare and beauty products I received."
good,Ulta beauty a nice working environment with excellent staffing and cafe for employees to eat . Management is very respectful and understanding . Employees are very friendly
good,"It is a great place for any makeup loving girl to work, however the pay is not great unless you are working in one of the boutiques. Best as a part time job."
good,Growing within a company you are never paid fairly. The company can’t afford to keep the good people and replace them with managers that just don’t understand the brand.
good,There is always something to do be it restocking checking out or giving advice to customers. Short breaks but good community to work with. Overall not a bad place to work.
good,"Working at Ulta is fun I just wish that beauty advisors didn't have to do things like clean bathrooms or empty garbage, we should have janitors who do that for us."
good,I loved working here but there wasn’t a ton of room to grow. The managers and coworkers were very sweet. The only con was the lack of breaks working in the salon as well as no days off.
good,I worked in ulta during the holiday season so it was a seasonal position.  It was nice working there we a friendly group of people but it did get hectic but that was to be expected.
good,"Although I loved all the people that i worked with, I found it harder and harder to want to come to work. Unrealistic goals are set and expected to be reached. I think it is a great place to start out but not something I wanted long term"
good,Ulta was at times busy with long lines but over all a fun environment to work at. It was great working with different cosmetic vendors and learning about all the cosmetic and skin care lines.
good,"I love this store. I can find everything I need. But if you want to work here, you have to be quick-paced and efficient, which a lot of people don't feel like doing ""just because its a makeup store"" and don't take it seriously.  Be prepared to be put to work because that's what you applied for.  It can be a fun place to work if you do your job and what you're told."
good,"Productive workplace where you are dealing with customers, and receiving the trucks assigning off-loading responsibilities to other shift team member, ordering supplies, and overseeing daily departmental duties."
good,"This was a great entry level opportunity, right out of esthetic school. This environment allowed for great exposure to all beauty products, helped to build retail skills and large exposure to interact with the public."
good,"Working for Ulta Beauty was a great experience. I typically went into work around 8am where I helped with new store setups, once the store opened I usually continued with tasks, as well as walking around the floor assisting guests, as well as helping at checkout when needed. Management was spectacular and I felt very comfortable going to any one of my managers with a problem. In addition to great management I had amazing coworkers who were always willing to assist with anything I may have been struggling with."
good,Ulta is my very first company to work for that is actually what I love; Makeup! BUT unfortunately not enough hours. The atmosphere is great. Some of the staff are amazing to work with. some of the co workers are amazing minus  those who think too much of themselves and think everything is a competition. I do feel like its a huge pressure when you are force to sale credit cards when customers don't want them. It makes you Feel uncomfortable. I haven't work in 3 weeks maybe more last work day I only worked 4 hours. Sucks because I finally found a job doing what I love but not getting any hours and I believe its because of the credit cards; not pushing customers to get them. We should be able to express ourselves freely and not how they want us to.
good,"A typical day at work is stocking, organizing, and helping customers on the floor. You "
good,"it was great working there for the seasonal holidays, its very fast paced of course which almost made it boring when there wasnt much to do but do throwbacks"
good,The company provided great perks for working at the company. Manager allowed employee the showcase their talents/abilities to aid in generating more sales.
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed the environment, being around make-up and all. It was a seasonal job, but I wouldn't mind working fulltime there. Benefits and pay weren't bad even being seasonal"
good,I absolutely loved Ulta when I first started working there. The environment was fun and welcoming. I looked forward to coming to work every single day.
good,"This job can be tough. They expect you to do 100 things at one time on a little time frame. One thing that I did not know going into it was you have to be loss prevention also! People complain all day, you can't ever do anything right. There is either not enough workers on the floor to help or not enough cashiers. It gets exhausting on a day to day basis. The job is not hard but it is definitely a customer service driven position."
good,"Ulta is a company that cares about their employees, but not to their fullest. A typical day at work consists of restocking and constant communication with guests, while building a relationship. On a busy day, it consists of taking care of clients and making sure they are 100% satisfied before walking out of the salon doors. While at Ulta I learned how to interact with clients on a more personal level while also strengthening my professional communication skills with fellow coworkers. I also gained strong team work skills in this environment. The management I experienced at Ulta can only be described as mediocre due to the amount of negativity that was placed at work. The most difficult part about this career is the physical aspect of this job, standing up all day gets tiring and constantly on the move. With that said, the most enjoyable part of this job is the fulfillment of making clients happy with themselves and in their own skin."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my time with the customers as well as coaching the staff to embrace their assets.I enjoyed implementing the merchandising guidelines to make the store and profitable.
good,"I knew nothing about makeup when I was hired, so that was overwhelming by itself.  However, I learned a lot and I had to learn it fast.  A typical day at work includes selling makeup, being a cashier, restocking, and organzing.  Managment can get a little petty sometimes, especially if they have worked for the company for years.  It's a great job to have especially if you love makeup, however after a year and a half it became mundane."
good,"A great place to work but can lack the work/life balance that you may desire. Training is always provided and great relationships are formed. Benefits are awesome, although pay is sometimes lacking based on your role and not work."
good,Loved working at Ulta because its a positive environment that made the employees and the customers more comfortable with the sales. The managers and co-workers were very easy-going.
good,"this was a fun job to work at. I got to do my makeup and learn about different makeup and skincare lines, There was also salon services that are provided there."
good,"It was a lot of draw backs after my store manager was fired. "
good,"My experience at Ulta Beauty personally wasn't that great. The salon manager I had at the time was sketchy and did not help me advance as a stylist. He basically left me out to dry. The other managers where great, but they really need to be careful who they hire to manage the salon."
good,"Showing up on time as well as looking presentable was a big aspect of being a beauty adviser. Independence was something that was given from the start, with that said being a quick learner and willing to adjust to the environment was very important."
good,Learned good skills on makeup and skincare products. Also helped with makeup application for special events and occasions. Educated customers on any and all products being sold by Ulta. Balanced the needs of multiple customers simultaneously in a fast past retail
good,"Ulta is a decent place to work at. Most of the people were nice, I loved the management team. My hours were pretty flexible and the work I did wasn't difficult to accomplish. The only con was the shirt breaks and some the other employees can gossip a lot and personally I don't like that environment."
good,Great place to work if wanting to play with makeup all day and learn tips and tricks to making your makeup look fresh. hours are good and the people are great.
good,"The work environment was great at Ulta. The managers would help clarify if I had any questions, the other employees were extremely friendly, and the whole staff felt like family."
good,A typical day at work was fun because a lot of people came in trying to look for makeup and needed help testing stuff out. But what I didn't enjoy was that there was alot of favoritism. So a lot of people would not get hours.
good,very fun environment you get to know when all the good thing are coming out! 50%off salon. If you are like me and like makeup and helping people finding products great from them. Handling transactions. Returns. Only unpleasant thing was doing truck (shippment) especially around holidays staying super late.
good,Ulta is a very team driven company that looks at it current employees when hiring for higher positions. I was promoted within a year and received tons of free makeup in the process!
good,"The work was simple and it was fun interacting with the customers and the employees. I applied makeup, sold makeup , cleaned and used the registers to help customers."
good,"Management is sometimes not the best, but the company is great. Really wonderful job for retail, especially if you like cosmetics and beauty. Great customers too!"
good,"A typical day at ULTA consisted of cleaning, restocking products,  engaging with the customers, and accessing the customers needs while utilizing my artistry skills. I was well versed in almost all job aspects of the company and learned a great deal about how the store functioned as a team. My managers were nothing but amazing and full of knowledge. I always greatly appreciated their feedback so that I could learn from their techniques and advice and make it my own. The workplace was very communal and everyone worked very well together. I would say the hardest part of the job was not being able to be as creative as I wanted. The customers that usually shop at ULTA were not as open to ""new trends and techniques."" However, they were always friendly and I enjoyed my time at ULTA while I was an employee. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the products and being educated on different techniques. I especially enjoyed it the most when a customer looked at themselves and loved the way they looked after I applied makeup. It's a great feeling when you can makeup someone else feel good."
good,On a usual day work was slow and we found little things to do around the store to stay busy. Stocking was done fast and on time every monday morning. At the end of the day everything was done in timely manner and customers were satisfied.
good,i just help set up the store i dont really know alot about this place the people are great to work for it is a fun enviroment hardest part of the job is making sure you look the part
good,I was in a new store so it took some time for the manager to get everything but overall i liked it. The days went by quickly and it help expand my clientele
good,"Ulta is a great place to work.  It's a fun environment and they have high quality products.  If they had a store management position open, I would love to stay here!"
good,"Busy workload for management, new tasks to complete daily and weekly.   Time management is a must.   Lots of room for advancement.  Work/life balance not great."
good,"This was a fast paced, results based environment. Friendly people to work with and very helpful in training. Some opportunity for advancement. Good place to grow."
good,"This job has taught me a lot about makeup, hair care, and skin care. It's easy to ask management for help if you need it. The customers are okay. You have to keep an eye out for the ones that are stealing or trying to steal. It has its moments when it's boring, like when there are no customers and the only thing that you can do is work on the grab n go (that can always be worked on) or clean. It also has its moments where it's super busy, but that is only a few times a day."
good,Makeup is very fun for me. I love being in a fun and relaxing environment surrounded by something I enjoy. The day flies by when you do something you like!
good,I typically worked as a cashier and occasionally color matched customer's foundation for them. Other times I would wake up early to do price changes on products. My favorite part about working with at Ulta was being around customers and coworkers who were passionate about makeup as well.
good,I enjoy working at Ulta Beauty. Everyone who works there is always full of energy and very outgoing. You get to learn a lot about many different products and you are rewarded with gratis at trainings.
good,The staff in store is amazing they are all hard workers and love what they do. The upper management is horrendous. The district manager and the LP are unbelievably rude and just mean
good,Ulta was a great first job for me. Co- workers and management were always friendly and easy to get a long with. I learned how to multitask to get the job done efficiently
good,I get to work and set up my station for my clients. Then I take out my book.to see what appointments I have for the day. Make calls to clients  if needed. Walk my brow bar the make sure that everything is clean and in place and stock merchandise.
good,"I started with no training and was expected to know my duties and perform  highly. Once I got into the swing of things, sales were smooth and I enjoyed my clients."
good,Customers can be very demanding and demeaning but coworkers are very supportive. The management can be inconsistent with what is going on within the store and does not offer very much in terms of training. Overall a good job with a family like team.
good,Its a fun place to work as a part time job. The managers are pretty good for the most part. I learned a lot as far as skin care and make up. I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"Ulta is a great working environment. Everyone is extremely friendly and they enjoy what they do. If you are big into beauty, I would highly recommend working at Ulta."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  It was a fun environment and I learned a lot about makeup.  The managers were warm and friendly and it felt more like a family than anything else.  I learned a lot more about hair and make up and I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,Management can be great or horrible. Super corporate. As long as you can play by their guide lines it can be a really great place to start off in that industry. Pay is weak considering you just want to spend all your money there anyways.
good,Fast paced fun place to work. Working with my Co-workers and other management is a team effort of us all working together to be the best we can. I learn something new everyday.
good,Typical day includes giving wow experiences  to guest. I learn to always be polite and greet with a smile. The hardest part about my job is not having a specific product for a guest and the most enjoyable part is being able to beautify other woman.
good,You will never be bored here. We get tons of customers everyday. They start you $8.00 but I don't think they give raises to part time people.
good,This workplace allowed me to expand my people skills from being able to communicate with individuals to help them find the correct products they needed.
good,"Due to management issues, operations were more difficult to accomplish. My coworker are the reason I stay as well as most of our customers. I loved how the company was constantly educational."
good,All of the employees are extremely nice. We do all that we can to make each customer feel beautiful and happy with their purchases and experience at ULTA.
good,"Loved the ladies I worked with, the overabundance of skills and information I was able to learn. usually a pretty flexible place to work with. The only con I can say is a lot of material to always keep up to date with."
good,"Had a great time working for Ulta Beauty. I learned so much about beauty and the full customer experience (i.e. providing demos to customer and having full knowledge of product that is being demonstrated). I also learned a lot about the retail world as well. Became a very fast and efficient cashier. I often was on truck committee, which included unloading new shipment and placing it on its correct shelf. This was extremely helpful in getting to know the large store as well as the majority of the products sold. The staff was very kind and helpful with my beauty education, and were always full of enjoyable conversation. The most difficult part of the job would be remembering the hair products. Often, the salon would get involved when a customer had a question about hair, however the few times that they were not available to help, I would step in and give the customer my full attention. The different hair products and benefits of each brand were difficult for me to remember, so I made sure to spend extra time in this field of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the customer satisfaction. I always enjoyed when the customer walked away satisfied and excited to try a new product that I had recommended. Often those customers would return to the store excited at how well the new product worked for them and would ask for another recommendation."
good,"Overall pleasant experience; I would have liked to have received the promised additional training for personal growth however fellow employees and management were very personal, fun, and great to work with.  This position allowed me to gain exposure and knowledge to a plethora of cosmetic lines."
good,"Poor management, poor scheduling. They weren't very clear on what the hours for the position looked like sometimes you were working 30+ hours per week sometimes you only worked 4 hours a week."
good,Good company. Great co workers. Employee benefits are good as well. Very busy and up beat work environment to work at. I enjoyed working with this company.
good,Its a fun place if you love being around beauty products all day and helping others!  However if constantly being on your feet or rarely having your weekends free is a turn off for you then I would skip this particular job.
good,"I loved GA location, I got to do a little bit of everything and learned alot, the location im at now has me just as beauty adviser when I could run the store myself! My GM in GA was amazing and pushed me to learn and do more!"
good,"I loved doing my profession in hair, i enjoyed making people feel beautiful and happy. It was such a great feeling! I did what i absolutely loved, cut and color people hair."
good,"I learned how to provide exceptional customer service. Management was very helpful and flexible, willing to work with employees."
good,"I received full training for various positions. Worked flexible hours, the staff was fun to work along with. This was a fast-paced work environment."
good,"the employees are very energenic , the free samples they give you with some of your purchases are nice. the customers were very high end but showed respect/"
good,Fun place to work. There is some pressure to meet sales. Management is pretty easy to get along with. Overall a great place to work.
good,"I love what I do as a Prestige Manager at ULTA Beauty. It is a wonderful position that is very fulfilling when it comes to customer service. The only thing I would say could be better is the management. It is a top down company and those at the top make decisions without understanding the life of those at the bottom. I've always learned that when it comes to good leadership, you have to improve from the bottom up. You are only as strong as your weakest player. Corporate does not work that way for this company. They are hasty with decisions and do not keep they employees in mind often. Other than that, the store environment is fantastic, and being in the cosmetics and the beauty industry will definitely give you great experiences."
good,"ULTA is an excellent company to work for, and is led by one of the more dynamic people in the country.  Their growth goals are lofty, but attainable, and for people looking to continue their career growth, there are not many better places to work."
good,"Enjoyed working with my co-workers and the manager. It was exciting getting new shipments of new products to introduce to our customers. Working truck and shipment was my favorite. Being a cashier got a little bit repetitive sometimes, but it was overall easy work. Cons would be hours are dependent on sales and are easily cut."
good,"I liked the company but there was no unity and no support, but the customer base was the most amazing part and the opportunity to learn more than just one position as well"
good,"Easy days. Ive learned about different companies and their backgrounds. My management is nice and trustworthy. Very prestigious co-workers. Hardest part is hours, they have none to give. The most enjoyable part are the guest and helping them."
good,I really enjoyed working at ulta. I learned a lot and actually used my skills to go to esthetics school and further my career.
good,"-running the sales floor 6-8 hours a day"
good,"A typical day at Ulta Beauty Salon is arriving early and I start to organize and clean the store to get it ready for opening and the guest. Once the guest arrive I check them in and inform the hair stylist. I've learned to have a lot of patience in this job because I am dealing with all types, I learned how to read facial expressions. Being the salon guest coordinator is slightly difficult at times but enjoyable at most, because I am dealing with so many different personalities and also by becoming closer to the guest it gives me chance to sell to the customers as well."
good,"During the time I spent working at ULTA, overall I enjoyed it."
good,"If you're interested in cosmetics, very fun place to work."
good,"Long hours as GM, minimal floor coverage makes things difficult in a 10,000 square foot facility. Many new stores opening in large markets canibalizes current/existing stores. "
good,"Cashing out guests"
good,Ulta has been a excellent work place. They are very flexible and provide great training. Overall I would say it was good working there.
good,Ulta is a great place to gain leadership and communication skills.  It has been in operation for 25 years and is going stronger than ever.
good,"daily consultations. must meet sales goals. greet every guest at ulta in an effective and timely manner. coworkers are friendly. you learn about skin care, hair care, and products. the hardest part of the job is not having enough coverage on the floor on a busy day."
good,"I enjoyed working at Ulta because of my experiences and knowledge I have gained. Going into Ulta I thought I would learn more about products and receive more product training. Compared to Sephora, Ulta is definitely more about the business side rather than the beauty side."
good,"Work day is spent behind register or walking the floor and assisting customers with product questions. When working the mass cosmetics side it is a bit difficult because customers get frustrated not having testers, but that's standard. I learned a lot about products and makeup/skincare in the work environment which was nice. Management had some issues during my employment. A lot of head butting. Overall was a good job, and good work environment. Nice work atmosphere, easy to pick up on how things work, very friendly coworkers!"
good,"My typical day consists of doing hair, cleaning the salon, and if I'm not busy with a guest, I am helping others find products they are looking for as well as answer questions about hair and skin care. It is a very fast paced, uplifting environment."
good,"This was an opportunity to exercise my expertise in leadership of teams within a rapidly growing organization. I was able to work independently in the field with minimal supervision.  Each day offered a myriad of opportunities to problem-solve, plan strategically, and refine communication with corporate office.  I really enjoyed being able to make decisions locally to ensure our profitability and stability.  "
good,"There is so very much in the make up industry that we as common shoppers don't know.  I was able to learn alot of great info on what brands are best for us, which brands don't test on animals etc.  Great place to try free make up!!"
good,I worked as an hourly nail tech with tips.  The pay was good and I had the opportunity to learn additional techniques and other cosmetelogical skills to further my career.  I grew tired very quickly of a very slow paced work environment and decided I needed to attempt something a bit more challenging than working in a salon.  This particular work was not suited to me personally.
good,good fun fast pace inviornment friendly employees and clients.
good,Great atmosphere. Nice place to work. Unlimited potential.
good,"Super easy job, pleasant environment, even if my manager paid me a dollar less an hour than the guy in my same position even though I'd been there longer and was a harder worker. Good discount, and so many free products!! Great salon discount, where as store discount was only ok."
good,On a typical day your interactions with customers are very demanding but extremely rewarding. Its unfortunate that there are not many advancement opportunities as it is a very small intimate environment.
good,"hard working"
good,Great place to work. You are able to learn so much about the products. Very educated.
good,"On a daily basis, I greeted customers, as well as helped them with finding what they needed and checked them out. I also stocked merchandise, helped with inventory, did shelf resets, and trained new  cashiers. I really enjoyed working with all of my co-workers and the management was always encouraging us to improve our sales goals and rewarded us when we did a good job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to play with make-up everyday and helping people find beauty products that they would love."
good,My work was specifically with unloading store supplies and distributing them to appropriate areas for sale. I also worked closely with my team members while store was open. We helped address customer needs and answer all questions.
good,"I have learned a lot about make up, skin care, and other personal hygiene needs.  We stay pretty busy with customers but also with changing and rearranging products.  My co-workers are great, we all get along well and we work very well as a team."
good,Easy place to work as long as you enjoy communicating with others through out your entire shift.
good,"A typical day includes checking guest out on the register, making sure every guest has been serviced, and meeting sales goals.  I learned alot from this company including shipment processing, how to achieve sales goals, doing ad sets, etc.  I am currently part of the management team and love the people i work with.  The managers treat all the employees with respect and do not try to overpower them.  The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the slow days at work.  The most enjoyable is making sure every guest leaves feeling beautiful."
good,"- Fun co-workers and friendly managers"
good,I have worked very hard to get to where i am now my brow bar is growing and i love my co workers
good,Ulta is a nice place to work. I liked working there but the amount of people that came in for hair and beauty products with stylists was not that much. So better to work in a salon that there is a high revenue of clientele
good,Great management. Fast pace work place. Lots of customer connections.
good,I learned a lot about how stores are set up for grand opening in a fun environment.
good,"Working at Ulta is a great place for working as a first retail job. When you do apply, and you receive a called from the manager to set up an interview. You definitely want to dress very professionally and also wear makeup. If you do get hired, you'll probably have to come in early in the morning to go over how to operate with the register, maybe do a little go-backs (basket fill with products that were returned) or do a little bit of cleaning."
good,easy to work and get along with customers. Good sales and fun to work with makeup.
good,My typical day of work would include me working on the register and interacting with customers to make sure they found what they were looking for.
good,"A typical day at work was to meet sales goal by the end of the day. Selling skin care, make- up and skin care utensils allowed to help reach sales goals. Co-workers were nice and respectful of others job duties. The hardest part of the job was meetings sales goals due to low number of customers coming inside the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do what I love to do which is working with clients who look for bettering their skin with skin care or make up. This was rewarding for me because seeing the look of my happy clients face when she/he noticed positive results while using the products. "
good,"I traveled to all four stores and would deconstruct old and construct new store fixtures. Organize new and existing products, take inventory a make price changes.  I learned a lot about upscale makeup products.  Management and co-workers were nice.  The most difficult part of this job, was driving to all the different stores and sometimes losing money in gas because there wasn't enough work for us to do.  I loved organizing all the products.              "
good,"Fun place to work, great co-workers, management, and salon staff."
good,I have been with the company for over six years and have learned numerous things from how to merchandise to how to give great customer service.
good,"Rang up purchases, stocked merchandise, answered phones, customer service. I learned how to multi-task, became efficient at all aspects my job required. Management was there but let us handle our duties without helping or second guessing our decisions. My co-workers were great, at a given shift, I was either alone or with one other co-worker. The hardest part of my job was having to leave it due to my pregnancy. I enjoyed everything about my job at Ultramar!"
good,the only complaint i would have is not having enough managers available all the time for certain tasks otherwise great place to work but prepare for the preMadonnas that come through the door
good,"Decent place to work, however could improve in a few areas. Didn't like the fact that smokers got many more breaks than non-smokers. Some felt exiled because some of the co-workers were in such a tight knit group, you felt left out if you didn't go out to the club with them on the weekends."
good,"Depending on the location and manager of the store, there can be some minor organization problems, but that is typical of retail in general. It is overall a fun place to work, with a lot of room to grow and move up in management."
good,I was always kept on my toes and was taught so much. I feel like I've grown playing different roles within the store and doing so many different tasks. I have learned to be more patient with people and how to handle pressure. I loved helping people and doing what I could to make them happy.
good,"Good fun enviorment to work in, loved the girls that I worked with."
good,"My experience working at Ulta has been very positive. As a Lead Cashier, I am responsible for assisting guests with their transactions, as well as with returns and exhanges. I've strengthened my interpersonal communication skills not only through interactions with customers, but also by interacting with my co-workers as well. Everyone I work with always has a positive attitude, and I thoroughly enjoy working with everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers. The hardest part of my job is learning about the different products in the store. Ulta sells a wide variety of salon retail, cosmetics, fragrances, etc., so sometimes it is difficult to pinpoint the perfect item for a guest. Since I started working at Ulta, though, I have certainly expanded my knowledge on the different products."
good,"My typical day is helping my customer's pick out & play in makeup. It is such a cool environment when it comes to skin, hair & nails. A girls ""Home Depot"" if you will. My co-workers are AWSOME & I totally love working with them. Great group of people to work with. The hardest part of my job is stopping, sometimes we get so caught up that we can't seem to stop on time."
good,Typically a day at Ulta was fulled with customer service and stock.
good,"Over all Ulta was a typical part time job, good co workers but some poor management."
good,"Interact with employees on a day to day basis. I learn about new products everyday and disperse my knowledge about products to customers daily. I was promoted within three months of working at my current job and help train new employees. My managers and co-workers are fun and easy to get along with which makes for a better working environment. I love interacting with new people on a daily basis, it has been a great way of networking."
good,Help customers find the best beauty product that is best for them.
good,I started when the store first opened and I worked with alot of great people. I learned alot about some products that I did not know about in the hair industy and also was able to use them on clients. The hardest part of the job was getting people to reconize that there was a salon in the store.
good,12 station hairdressing salon with 1 esthetics room. worked 8 hr. shift 4 days a week. Great support from salon as well as management. Best part of the job was my ability to build clientele and retail sales in a good environment. Hardest part of the job was working with constantly changing rules and lack of professional products.
good,"It was fun, very very fast paced. I liked my managers as they taught me alot, but after they sifted managers (which they happen to do alot) my experience changed.  I enjoyed working in makeup, and met a lot of amazing people through this job."
good,A typical day at work is normally very predictable. There are specific tasks that need to be completed each day and other days there are things out of the ordinary. I enjoyed getting to know a lot of guests who entered the store looking for retail product and also getting to know my clients at the Salon and making a personal connection with as many guests as possible. I loved helping people feel confident and try new things!
good,"Ulta offers great benefits and decent pay rate . I enjoyed working with many different types of people . I believe they need to start a recycling program like Sephora has done , then  they could be part of  the solution."
good,love connecting with people and talking makeup. However it’s a big faceless Corp so you don’t feel too valued and the pay for prestige isn’t the best.
good,"The beauty industry is definitely its own league of retail! As my first job, it was imperative that I quickly learn how to work a register, as well as adapt my vernacular to our demanding customers at any given time of the day!"
good,Overall it was a great experience just wish it was managed a little different. There were managers who disagree on things with another manager and come talk behind the managers back.
good,A good company. Some locations are more catty than others. Just really the people who it depends on. Nice perks with working with the company. No real complaints in 3 years besides some staff.
good,"I worked full and part time while I was employed by Ulta. It's definitely a sisterhood and you'll find friendships that last a lifetime! They aren't the best at promoting from within the company, but overall a great place to start in any beauty industry!"
good,Home & Work life are balanced unless it's during the last quarter of the year. Good pay and opportunities for advancement. Culture continues to improve.
good,"Fun atmosphere with great employee benefits such as an employee discount on products and salon services. Pay is tough, but it is a great place to work."
good,While working here i learned more about makeup and was able to be around hair care products so it was a fun experience. it was my first management job so through trial an tribulations i did grow as a person and my coworkers were amazing. My area manager and store manager was horrible and ruined that experience
good,"this job consist of lots of standing, they are very open but wish they would be a little more clear on how to do things they expect you to know things within 2 days but it is a little more complicated when everyone doesn't work at the same pace"
good,"The position I held when I worked at ULTA was titled ""Prestige Consultant"". I assisted customers as they chose products and showed them the new trends and the most desirable brands. I applied makeup the guests and demonstrated techniques that they could try at home."
good,"Overall Ulta was ok, it really depends on the store and who's there. They're all very different vibes at each store. I think they under pay significantly and most of the employees are unhappy which is a negative culture."
good,It was okay to work there but it was alot of favoritism so sometimes it's hard to work with all the drama. The benefits of working there was okay but overall it was really tiring at times
good,"Very task oriented,  yet push not doing tasks. Working closes, and being back at 6am the next day. Ulta can be a challenge."
good,"Lots of college students or people that want ""play money"". Hours vary drastically depending on season. Went from 50 hour weeks as a regular employee to maybe 15 a week. Discounts are very nice, training is more available recently, but opportunity to advance(at least at my store) is few and far between."
good,GreatPerks but team ts required to do a lot of selling so this is more a sales job. Hardest part of job is balancing office work with training the team.
good,"on the go training but close knit environment, management has a close professional  relationship with staff, very open to ideas that will help the overall function of store."
good,"I helped open a store in my college town. The whole team went through some training, but only some were permanent employees. The free products were nice and I had a lot of fun."
good,"Lacks organizational functions for such an operational store. Is not where you would expect them to be with their operational technology.  "
good,"Hardest part was having to work 12 hour shifts every 2 or 3 day in the week. It was struggle due to college classes schedule, which was Monday-Friday 9am to 1pm. I worked the 2nd shift, Monday thru Thursday (Fridays when needed) 4pm to 2am and 4pm to 4am."
good,I loved working for Ulta. It was a huge learning experience. Everyone was nice and we grew together. I learned sales goals and how to achieve them. Overall great!
good,"Overall fun work environment - good team and collaboration with brand partners."
good,"As a college student, I used to love Ulta. But hours began to be cut. I also was working at Ulta for 4 years, I had to fight to get a high position, and I was only given a 25 cent raise. I worked over time constantly, and did above and beyond what I was asked to do. I was working over and over beyond what I needed to, and I was not shown appreciation or a raise or anything of the sorts. But other works that were newly hired were being paid more. Managers were not on the same page and some workers were being overworked compared to other workers."
good,My manager is amazing. Fun place to work. Company cares about their people. Great employee discount. If you love makeup this place is for you. Would like it better if we got our breaks but sometimes it doesn't happen
good,"Ulta has been a great company to work for. They’ve helped me come out of my shell and learn so many things I would’ve never known before. It’s a creative and fun place to be at, I’m so thankful to have had the opportunity to work there."
good,"Good place to work, fun place to work, and you can enhance your skills. I loved the training i had to take. And i almost always won contest for selling products  and skin care. Customer service was great."
good,Nice place to work at with a very nice discount. The manager at the store location was not the best and caused a lot of problems in the work environment.
good,"The only real perk about this job is the free makeup. But it only comes in sample sizes. And over all the girls I work with are nice and supportive, but they will cut your hours if you aren't meeting goals."
good,"Ulta is not a bad place to work, sometimes the management is a bit annoying to work with about certain things, and the clientele can be very demanding, but overall it's not bad."
good,"Ulta is a decent, enjoyable place to work. Like anywhere some days are better than other, the good days outweigh the bad. Ulta as a company is understanding of a work life balance."
good,"Overall, my time at Ulta Beauty was incredible. I enjoyed working in a busy environment with much responsibilities. As a lead cashier, I was to train and set an example to other coworkers and new employees."
good,"Working with Ulta Beauty was quite enjoyable for me. I loved working with guests and helping them select a specific product for their needs. I never had any problems with coworkers and made friends with many of them. However, I had multiple scheduling conflicts after informing multiple people I could not attend certain shifts, thus creating issues within the scheduling. Overall, I loved my time with Ulta, and I learned a lot through it."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers whether it was to find a product or to help the customer choose the right product for their skin. Being able to assist them and make them satisfied.
good,"The company is solid. The teams in store are terrific- the best thing about Ulta is the people."
good,"I enjoyed working as a salon manager ."
good,"Tasks are usually pretty easy but can often become monotonous. Management tries to make it a fun place with lots of fun activities and extras but of course, there will always be negative people present. Most supervisors and managers are perfectly adequate and decent people who are enjoyable to work for/with. The hardest part of the job is obtaining sufficient training and communicating effectively with other departments. The facility is nice and new. Pay incentives are nice but breaks usually feel pretty short and most feel that the amount of paid days off leaves workers unsatisfied. Overall, it is not a bad place to work."
good,The work place is always live and there is always something that has to be done. Coworkers make your time there more enjoyable. Management is the best I have ever had.
good,A very fast paced work environment filled a ton of diverse great individuals who come to work with positive energy. I enjoy working in the atmosphere where we can provide great customer service and leave our customers walking out of the store with a great experience.
good,I absolutely loved working for Ulta. My only reason for leaving was no availability for advancement as well as a lack of hours. Once I found a full time job I stayed with Ulta as long as I could but had to leave due to family needs.
good,"managing ulta beauty stores is always stressful and never enough payroll for a sales floor to be fully stocked with associates to sell, or do things operationally"
good,"Lead Cashiers are in charge of ensuring that Beauty Advisors are trained well and drive loyalty and credit, It is only an internal promotion but you are expected to do a lot but not get paid as much. Hours are so iffy and attempting to get to corporate is based off how good your GM is and if they are willing to help you. Mine wasn't good at it or was never there."
good,"Ulta is a mediocre place to work. If you are interested in the makeup and hair industry than sure its right up your alley. But for me, it's become the same boring routine every Friday and Sunday. Only thing I have to look forward to is new product coming in and working with some amazing women. Other than that, it feels like a prison."
good,Good place to work if you know the right people. Can get a little competitive had a high turnover rate. Better management now. Inter structure has shifted and seems to be more employe focused.
good,"I overall loved the work, not so much working with the people. They gossiped too much and manager would stand around talking to employees, then turn around and be upset if tasks were not done. Complaints never went anywhere and I even had money stolen by a fellow employee TWICE and nothing was done."
good,"A typical day at work for Ulta was very eventful. "
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers find their perfect products, we are able to watch training vidoes to improve our product knowledge, the culture of the workplace is really fun, my coworkers are very personable and friendly, the hardest part of the job is not being able to spend as much time as I need helping one customer and the most enjoyable part is helping customers find products to make them happy and feel like their best selves."
good,"This job consisted of product knowledge at its finest. I started out in Stock which was incredibly easy if you like organizing many items at once. I moved to Sales Associate quickly in my time here, and loved how easy it was to communicate with customers, being it was my first job. The downfall to this job was the strong competition between the ladies working here. Lies, downgrading other workers and every effort to excel yourself while hurting others was quickly apparent. That is why i left this job as soon as possible."
good,I enjoyed working there and was really sad to leave. There were some things that I will keep private that I didn’t approve of but that’s not for me to display publicly. I will miss Ulta
good,"I was a temp to hire, I enjoyed my time working at Ulta. I would've stayed there if I was offered a position at the end of the seasonal rush, but was told I wouldn't be hired on until mid June and possibly later. So I looked career opportunities. If you can get hired on at Ulta, its a good place to work. During the slower seasons they offer VTO, and then when they start ramping up for the seasonal rush they offer overtime like crazy. When I worked there they did 10-12 hour days, but I'm unsure if they just switched to Saturdays or not. Overall, great place. Coworkers are amazing and the management is great."
good,This was my first job. What girl wouldn't want to work with makeup for their first job? helped prepare me for my future endeavors in the health care field in the sense of working with people.
good,"I began working at Ulta because it fit with my school schedule. It was your average minimum wage job, and if you like makeup then it's great! I always had a lot of fun when I went to work, because it didn't seem like just work to me. Of course, there were bad days with customers but that's any retail job you have."
good,Learn as you go type of company. There is minimal training but a lot of room to grow and love what you do. Ulta does a great job of promoting hard work and diversity in the work place.
good,although there is new management now i believe the atomsphere was very immature when i worked there. wiithin the time i worked there i had 3 different GM's
good,I was a seasonal hire at Ulta and only working there for a few months I gained valuable customer service and retail experience. I really enjoyed being able to get personal with the customers by figuring out their skin type/needs to find the beauty products that was bested suited for them. I also really enjoyed coming in early for inventory/truck delivery days. Maintaining an organized work environment is important in my eyes so learning how to check current stock and put out new shipments in the correct way was most definitely a positive experience.
good,"For being a fortune 500 company, Ulta underpays it’s workers. They expect you to work yourself into the ground to prove you want a promotion, instead of looking at the proper qualifications."
good,"I loved Working at Ulta until a new divisional manager took over. He was not familiar with the cosmetics industry, seemed overly egotistical, and unwilling to see cosmetics as much a service industry as a sales industry. He was recently fired and I am thinking about once again applying at Ulta."
good,"I love working for a company that follows their core values. With the growth of the company, there are lots of opportunities. Would love to see the company expand into more locations."
good,"I have really enjoyed working with Ulta for the most part. The atmosphere is always so fun and friendly. There was always something to do, even on our slow days, so the work felt meaningful. I’ve learned and grown myself since being able to step into a managment position, being supported by my colleagues. I’ve been through quite a bit of change in managment, so I’ve built up a skill set on how to work with and around change, and through a big transition. The hardest part was learning how to help myself. Sometimes I was the only manager there, and I had to use the tools available for me to problem solve a lot.  Overall I am very grateful for the experiences and skills I have retained from working with Ulta."
good,"The work place environment is great. This discount is awesome as well. NO opportunity for advancement unless you stay there for 10 years and then you get a 20 cent raise and ""prestige"" on your badge."
good,"I was hired temporarily to set up a new store in town. In the short time I was there, the culture was very ""clique-ish"". I knew that I wouldn't want to work their full time because they didn't seem accepting of everyone."
good,NOT a fan I would only recommend you going to work at this DC if you are a fan of overworked and not appreciated by management/HR The hours were ok need better trained HR dept
good,I loved working at Ulta Beauty. I was always the first to hear about new products or good coupons. I would do extra organization around the store and in the back that my managers loved!
good,"Working at ulta was over all a fun experience, it was nice getting to help people find products best for them and the employees I worked with were great. The only thing was that the way they did the schedule was very inconsistent. They posted the schedule in the back room weekly (usually at the last minute) and would regularly change it without notifying anyone."
good,When you enter Ulta you can have a great experience if you make it that way. There are people there that don't want to and you cannot fall into that group. If you work hard you will be promoted but you have to make sure management notices you
good,"the job was fairly easy, must be energetic and able to run around or be on your feet. Co Workers and Management team is nice for the most part! pou[oh;h"
good,"Our store was new, management was not run very well. Coworkers were all great, and the store was always neat. Very easy to get used to the store and what needed to be done was always done."
good,"My manager was very unfocused and you could tell did not love her job. So I think that put a stress on the job, if it weren't for that I think it would have been a wonderful place to make a career and move up."
good,"I came to Ulta after leaving 4 years of telecommunications and it was a welcome change. I was not happy with my store's Manager, being very abrasive and difficult to approach, but I loved the overall work environment and the rest of my coworkers in both the retail and salon portion of the store."
good,I loved working there I left because I was moving and I miss it so much I was only part time and I was working full time hrs. but without the benefits
good,"Hours were based on sales, so if you are looking for a full time job this is not the place work. In other words, if sales are down and you are scheduled 30 hours that week, they will cut your scheduled hours back at least 5-10 hours that week. But if sales are doing well you will get more hours. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with."
good,"I learned a lot about makeup skills, techniques, and tips. They had video's to educate yourself on brands which in return they offered ""gratus"" which is pretty much free makeup for your own pleasure."
good,"It was a fun experience working here. However, hours are minimal if you’re not a manager. Expect 20-25 hrs a week or less. They should adjust their point policy because it’s not accurate when it comes to employee performance."
good,Ulta Beauty has allowed me to understand and appreciate the cosmetic industry. I was promoted from a Prestige Beauty Advisor to the Salon Guest Coordinator. I am somewhat of a receptionist. Our location is a little slow paced for what I am used to.
good,"Learned the effectiveness of a team working together, which was the most enjoyable part of the job. Helped customers find best products for their individual needs. Learned the benefits of efficient customer service by observing the managers' and coworkers' enjoyment, patience, and diligence with each customer."
good,"I only worked 3 months as a Beauty Advisor. I always worked closing shift which was nice because it's more calm at night. All the managers are very nice and willing to help. They make you wear a walkie so you can call if you need help, the only bad part is it hurts your ear. They're always on you about getting reward cards. The discount is great. The job is VERY flexible. If you want to work hands on with customers (doing makeup and such) this job isn't for you because all you do is ring people out and help customers find things. Very saldom had problems with customers. You never really get to know your coworkers because you're always scheduled by yourself. As a beauty advisor, you will be working in the ""Mass"" makeup section which is the drug store part of the store. Breaks are good, I'd forget to take mine sometimes though. I saw on YouTube that people who worked here got free makeup, but I never did, but I also believe I didn't work there long enough to. My starting pay was good for retail. This is a good second job or somewhere to work while in school but I wouldn't depend on it as an only job. Litte hours if you don't get enough reward  cards. They make you carry clear bags and you get checked every time you leave the store. I had to quit because this was my second job and I was wearing myself down."
good,The hardest part of the job is getting hours.  Especially after the holiday season when the rush slows down and hours are cut.  Your hours range from 9-14 hours a week if you are lucky. Working at Ulta really is a fun and enjoyable job but the hours part makes it difficult unless you are a manager.
good,We as associates were the first to know when new products were in and got to purchase them first. We got to learn about new products too and educate customers on them.
good,"Good company but very demanding job that required almost 24/7 availability. Many hourly employees that should be salaried. Good benefits, good pay, great senior management."
good,Ulta was a great place to work while I was in college! I definitely recommend it as a first job. I had a great manager that took her time to coach me and I think it was a great way to get my foot in door of retail.
good,Great for a first job or part-time job. Fun atmosphere and great teamwork. Managers are great at the location I work for. Very flexible in the scheudle
good,"My workplace was always up to date and always clean. All testers were managed and cleaned for hygienic purposes (Plus I always felt the need to clean everything in the store). My managers were always so understanding and friendly. They helped me with so much and I learned so much from working here even if it is just a simple retail job. Days could feel repetitive, stressful, but fun. I always enjoyed talking to friendly customers. It was stressful when customers yell or complain because of ULTA's return policies, but that's retail for you. I would have definitely stayed if I was paid more and given more hours. Benefits could also be improved."
good,"I worked 1 year , beside the fact its hard to get promoted. It was a fun place to work, you can learn a lot if its your first retail job. On top of it you get free make up every month and have the opportunity to meet the CEO or Creator of some brands."
good,A typical day at Ulta consist of making sure the store is well organized. attend to clients needs and wants. at the beginning of every shift there are chat in to make sure we understand the goals for the day.
good,Genuinely enjoyed working here and the enjoyed the makeup discounts if you're a makeup lover. Flexible schedule and worked over night for shipments. Easy.
good,Some of the management was okay. I was a manager myself and I loved it. If I had a better manager I probably would continue working here. Loved it for a while
good,I worked with amazing women while at ULTA! The Prestige Beauty Advisor was incredible!! Learned a lot! Great hours if you work hard and are reliable..
good,"Corporate should set stricter guidelines for the manager-associate professional relationship and have an HR rep that can help monitor, so that associates are always protected from inappropriate behavior."
good,"Overall a good place to start but not for growing , management has always been the problem for me & a very gossip orientend place . No complains with Benefit Cosmetics though they’re amazing and they treat you as you should be treated but we have to follow Ulta guidelines not benefits ."
good,"If you are person that loves beauty and fashion and love making people feel good by looking their best Ulta is a great place to work. From helping customers with makeup applications to suggesting the trendy new products to keep beauty enthusiasts ahead of the game, the environment is fun, fast-paced and offers great opportunity to grow"
good,"Depending on the shifts you work, tasks will change. Learn to speak to customers professionally, you get to learn how about products to make recommendations. Harder shifts are usually the ones that are not during store hours."
good,"Working with all women is not for the faint of heart and it is not a job where you play with makeup and perfume. It is retail, and all that that entitles. Your main job is stocking and working at a register, it's a lot of fast paced hard work and you are expected to do your own research and have an understanding of brands that are SOLD IN STORE, not just about youtube and instagram brands, and application. In the end, it is a job about making women feel beautiful and confident building women up; and that is a wonderfully admirable thing."
good,The turn over rate with managers at times made it hard but the culture was strong so everyday was a learning experience. Organzation paid huge factor in the unsucess and lack of organiztion the work place.
good,Very nice environment. Wonderful coworkers. The clients were always very sweet and loved the add ons. A variety of product to talk about. Such a family environment there.
good,"Pretty typical retail work job, can get stressful around high volume sales times or holiday seasons, somewhat low pay, all around pretty easy fun job especially for part time"
good,"I opened the new store in Prescott Valley, AZ. They provided great training and we all built the store together. My District Manager was poor however. She was negative and hard to communicate with. The Corporate team they sent in to help with the Grand Opening were amazing! The Venders who came in to train us were also great and we got a ton of FREE products. They have very strict company policies so don't work here if you can't follow rules exactly as they are written. As a Manager the scheduling program they use is a nightmare. Very complicated and time consuming. The goals they gave were realistic and my team beat them every month!"
good,"Very calm place to work, definitely not expected to do too much. Pay is low, 25% discount on products in store. And you always know about the good promotions."
good,Great for anyone looking to work in the beauty industry. Can pick up hours from other co workers if you need extra. Great discounts on everyday products.
good,I worked at the front end of the store.  SO i was the first and last to see the customers.  All while checking out the customers in line and making sure they found everything they needed.
good,"my work place is very diverse and always interesting, I never know how the day will be. Sometimes we are slammed and sometimes we are just trying to stay busy. I love my team and the management team, I feel we all work really well together. The hardest part of my job is multitasking on those overly busy days when we are taking clients back to back, but at the end of the day its always worth it and rewarding."
good,"A typical work day starts by clocking in and checking schedule books, and calling clients to confirm their appointments. Walk the floor to gain potential clients. Help manage the other salon employee's with any questions or concerns they may have about a product or booking clients."
good,"It's a nice place to work when you're young, inexperienced, and love beauty. You get a discount on products which is pretty cool. The pay is a tad above minimum wage."
good,"I love coming into work and doing fun projects that keep me on my toes. Color, cuts, and styling make me the happiest. I mostly love doing hair because I get to make the individual look and feel better about them selves all while learning about their life and exchanging stories."
good,Fast paced and fun place to work. Really enjoyed working here and wish I could have stayed longer. Co-workers were great and the work environment was pleasant.
good,For any girl or boy who loves to be happy and around makeup and hair and be around awesome fun loving people would love to work at Ulta. You can't support a living off the pay as an associate but the 50% discount for salon and 20% off products is worth having it as a part time job or second job.
good,I had only shopped in an Ulta twice before I began working there. I love that there is a salon because it made me realize that getting my cosmetology license is really what I want to do. Made a lot of amazing friends here too.
good,Managers were amazing! Working at a make up store is the best. Bad thing was you were given very little hours a week and shifts were usually only 3 hours long.
good,I liked Ulta because you didn't have to go out to find clients. They would come into the store. You could also do make-up as well as hair! It was a fun cool place top work.
good,"This was probably my dream job. I enjoyed what I did there, but not always my coworkers. There was a lot of gossip, which I get when you work with many girls, but that is something I could do without in my job/"
good,Loved working at the brow bar.  I had an amazing store team which made all the difference.  Really enjoyed working for Benefit Brow Bar.  Clients are very loyal and come for a very specific look.  Hardest part of the job is being interrupted while in the middle of wax for a make up question by shopping customers.
good,A typical day would be what you were assigned to. You would learn to do more than one thing at the warehouse. Clocking in on time was very important. I enjoyed working there.
good,"A typical day at ULTA was pretty laid back, we would help out each other wherever help was needed. I learned how to work better with others, and gained more customer service experience. The culture of the workplace was amazing in ULTA. Everyone got along, and we worked together as a team majority of the time."
good,"The company has large goals for each store that increase each year, as should be expected. However, the payroll budget is insufficient for meeting these goals. The atmosphere at work is pleasant, but stressful as there is a lot to do operationally while they expect you to also be selling as a manager. Selling is a key piece of any management position with Ulta. The operations of the store are convoluted and it seems that the corporate office can never get it right where they send you all of the pieces to need to execute operational demands."
good,"Great gratis and free product. However, as a manager it is a lot of stress and little recognition. You work most week ends and 2 or more nights per week."
good,"Your shifts do vary from week to week but being on the operations team was always fun and rewarding. A typical week for me included resetting the store according to the current sales ad, reconstructing planograms, and receiving weekly shipments. It was very sales oriented, as most retailers are, so it was challenging at times to really hit your sales goals, but my Ulta crew always made it worthwhile."
good,"Working with Ulta was fun. Most managers were very patient and willing to help. However, since we were without a manager for about 3 or 4 months, one of the remaining Operations Manager had to take on the tasks from the missing position, so it was somewhat of a crunch (Our general manager was only around to watch or discipline employees because she was always at 2 or 3 other stores). The environment was very relaxed amongst employees. Most were very friendly, and always willing to help."
good,"Working in the salon was amazing, don't get me wrong, but I quickly realized the company pushes for the salon to do well but doesn't do anything to try to help skincare. I was basically asked to harass customers on the floor when I wasn't busy to try to get them in my chair. There was no advertisement for facials whatsoever, but there were posters for the hair salon plastered all over the store, and then I would keep getting asked why I wasn't booking enough appointments. Too stressful, but I absolutely loved the people I worked with."
good,Left we  they changed the Management style. People that have never worked in a Salon should not be running it. Stylist and clients want someone how can understand the unique situations that involve a Salon.
good,"Working at Ulta was very laid back and easy. My ex-coworkers there were very inviting and helpful when I first started. A typical day at work consisted of mostly working the cash register. When there were no customers to check out, I would go through every isle and make sure all products were in tidy and in place. The hardest part of the job was whenever shipment came in because some of the boxes were heavy. Overall it was a very great place tow work"
good,The people who work here are very kind and nice and sweet they work hard to make their employees feel like they could move up in the company. there are a lot of perks of working here
good,"Not much room for advancement "
good,"Ulta is a great company to work for,  they offer great benefits for the full time staff members and gratis is given on a pretty regular basis."
good,ULTA is a great place to work. It's really fun if you're into cosmetics. You will need to be knowledgeable about cosmetics of course. You'll also learn so much more while working here. I wouldn't mind working here temporarily.
good,Culture is still formalizing due to the excessive company growth.  Nice place to work with many perks.  Diverse work environments.
good,This is a good place to work if you do not have other priorities. I attend college full time and have four children so this job just did not work out for me.
good,I always loved coming into work and knowing that I loved my co workers and it just made working that more enjoyable. I didn't care for the management and I wasn't getting enough hours at the time so I had to look else where.
good,Long holiday hours that were still kept fun with an encouraged co-worker social life. People were given the promise of possible permanent positions shortly before what seemed like random massive staff cuts. Management was a bit outspoken of their personal backwoods beliefs. All employees were given sufficient breaks within their shift.
good,"This job entitles helping customers find products, perform hair, skin, or nail services up to standards, be friendly, upbeat, polite and courteous."
good,"Loved working in the east, and the oppurtunities were great. Moved to the north region and didn't think the environment was as good."
good,"Culture driven environment, great executive staff, lack of growth potential. Lack of training for internal promotions."
good,"A typical day at work is very fun, I don't normally have days that I wish I wasn't there. They keep you busy, so the time flies by, which I absolutely love. I have learned a lot about their company values and customer relations. The management up to the General Manager is great, they care about you and are involved with your life, however the upper management into corporate doesn't really value the employees as much, in my opinion. The hardest part of the job is that the hours really aren't great. It is awesome for a college student who has set hours, but for someone trying to live and survive, they do not provide. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to make people feel better about themselves, and that is really a beautiful thing."
good,For a college student to start working it is ideal to work here. I've learn customer service skills and team base projects.
good,It was great helping customers find new products and color matching them. I loved being in an environment where I was surrounded by what I loved. The hardest part would have to be how hard I would work. I am very young but my feet were swollen almost every day I would go home. My joints would hurt so bad also. You have to stand the entire time and it catches up to you. Fun place to work though.
good,I love working here there is just not enough hours to give out and little room for advancement in the company. The managers and co-workings are great and you learn a lot of lessons and builds your selling ability
good,When working for Ulta Beauty I expected (as I think you should) that being that this was a retail job I would be working long hours for minimal pay. However what I did not realize is that not only would I be working in this kind of environment I would also meet wonderful hardworking people and learn so much in respect to the cosmetics industry. However even with all of that wonderful atmosphere I also had  to deal with a horrible store manager who could not separate her personal issues with the responsibilities that came with her job.
good,"A typical day at Ulta included counting register to ensure that totals were correcting and opening the store. While in this position I oversaw several employees and made sure that daily sales goals and procedures were followed. I learned how to transition from Cashier to Mangaing several cashiers under me. The hardest part of the job was unwillingness to change, although I enjoyed the overall learning experience."
good,"I loved working there because I love makeup and skin care. I got to try new products on myself and on clients. I loved the feeling when a client lit up when they saw themselves in the mirror when I was done with a demonstration. That made everything worthwhile. "
good,I enjoyed the job.  It was a retail sales position. I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Not a lot of gossip going on in the work place.
good,I was employed as a licensed cosmetologist.  My main area of work was in the salon.  I also supported the store staff in sales and customer service.  I enjoyed the fast paced environment.  I was in an assistant salon manager program to train for salon manager positions.
good,"Cashier, helping guests, ive learned how to deal with customers accordingly, learned alot of new things when it comes to beauty, management could be better, hardest part would be attempting to make guests 100& satisfied 100% of the time."
good,"While working for ULTA i enjoyed my coworkers and the customers.  Managment was fair and i learned how to do inventory, multitask, and I learned that at work your coworkers can also become your friends."
good,"it is possible to move up in the company, but if you are like me and you dont push products down peoples throats, its next to impossible to get higher than a tier 2."
good,"A typical day at work included planagrams, applying makeup on costumers, cleaning and organizing the store. I learned a lot about different beauty supplies and how they affect the body. Management could improve tremendously. General manager didn't respect every employees' job. i enjoyed my co-workers, we all shared the same goal of putting our customers first. The hardest part of my job was working the floor alone during busy hours. Without help from a manager during those times was stressful. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my customers. I made a personal relationship with them to show them that every time they visit there will always be a person looking after their best interest."
good,"Upon arrival to Ulta, there is always a chat in with the shift manager, keeping the communication line open. I enjoy the position because I can relate to our customers and successfully perform as a sales woman. My co-workers are all welcoming and lighthearted. The only difficulty I've had is that there are not enough hours available, being that we are a low volume store. My favorite part of my job is that I can exchange information with both employees and customers pertaining to all beauty product, making myself more interested in my job and even outside of work."
good,"Retail environment with many opportunities to advance. However, the management is lacking overall support of their teams and is starts from the district manager down. No positive reinforcement."
good,"Ulta is a very good environment to work in. There is always positivity and everyone always strives to be better. Everyday is about prestigious customer service, maintenance of the store to code, and working as a team player. It is always pleasant working with all types of people both customers and co-workers. Management always cares about all the workers and maintained a great balance that allowed everyone to feel appreciated. Time restraints did not always allow everyone to work to the standards of the store, but everyone always strived for success. I have learned to communicate, adapt to change, and work in a fast paced environment here at ulta."
good,"The salon was always busy with clients getting their hair done, I was the appointment maker for each of the stylists and I also helped maintain the salon area by sweeping, cleaning color off the bar and I even became a shampoo girl and did laundry so that the Stylists had towels and smocks."
good,I’m not saying the entire company is like this but the Greene location definitely deserves the ratings I gave. It’s a great company to move up and get raises!
good,"Didn't like being laid off with no notice right before Christmas. Company is very good about giving products away to employees..."
good,"As long as you're willing to put in the time and effort, you'll be noticed and can move up if you so desire. It does take time though. Hours can be inconsistent sometimes but if you keep asking and are adaptable, more shifts become available to you. Can be fun, exciting, and a great way to try new things."
good,"I loved and enjoyed working at Ulta very much. I felt very much appreciated by the staff, management and customers. I got to learn various techniques from brand reps and fellow artists. I do feel as if the work and the compensation didn't quite match up but I don't blame the store or management for that."
good,It is a Great place to work. It is a nice environment to work. The employees make the job more interesting. It is great to experience new customers each day.
good,Ulta is definitely a great place to work.  They are constantly growing and it is a fun and friendly atmosphere to work in.  It's great to be able to help people feel more beautiful and be able to assist them with their makeup and skincare needs.  I've been able to improve my artistry skills working here in two different locations with two different brands.  There could be better training for management and more accountability on their end.
good,"There was nothing hard about this job. Management was great at helping when needed, and always made sure I knew the right way to do something. I was always learning something new."
good,"Ulta is a great company to work for. While there are some downsides, such as inundated ah hoc analysis, everyone is happy to be there and they all generally care about the health and well being of the company."
good,"Fun place to work. Surrounded by great employee's. You tend to get close, as they are around a young age, everyone there is laid back and proficient in their work. You create good memories and get to play with makeup and assist others to find their perfect match in anything cosmetic. One is able to speak freely on their opinions regarding products with no judgments."
good,"Ulta is not a bad place to work at, granted when I did work here I was in beauty school. My manager at the time was very high strung  and put that energy on everyone else, which is not good."
good,"I worked morning shifts, which were great. Only females worked there (& you know how females are). Great if you need hours otherwise. Never felt as appreciated as I did a lot and took my time to make sure things were perfect."
good,I was treated fairly. Work life balance is followed for most of the year except during the holidays.  Promoting up is difficult and discouraging.  They are very generous in raising money for breast cancer research.
good,"I love working for Ulta I have for years. Great health benefits for full time positions and fair amount of paid time off. It takes a lot to move up in the company and got recognized, it can be very competitive."
good,"Fun people to work with. Job wasn’t fair....pay was not what expected, was promised a lot when hired but they never followed through. Wasn’t scheduled the amount promised either."
good,"Its retail, customers can be a pain, and the pay is kind of low but the management is nice and helpful. If you're new to retail, you may feel a little lost for a little. Its great if you're really really into makeup because then you know more."
good,"Great people, fun environment, amazing coupons/sales. The hours were flexible, the pay was good. I didn’t get to work as much as I needed, I worked only 4 hours a day."
good,typical work days included talking with customers and comforting new customers helping customers find items and suggesting appropriate product to fit their needs
good,"It was a fun place to work part time. I started there as a temp worker helping to relocate an old store to a new location. While ding this, I spoke with my manager and asked if I could stay on as a beauty advisor, she agreed and I started working at the cash wrap. Overall some days (especially holiday) were challenging, but I always had a good time!"
good,"Fast work day."
good,ok place to work would tell anyone to apply....i dont have anything bad to say about the company... if you love to work with cosmetics and skincare this is the place
good,"The GM position is very hard to advance to because so many current GM’s aren’t looking to retire anytime soon. Unless your looking to relocate, you have a higher chance."
good,"- little to no work life balance, i.e. likely no holiday's off, black out periods, long shifts during peak hours/weekends "
good,"You must be Fast pased, fast problem solving, customer service skill are a must. you'll need to have a open availability to succeed. MUST HAVE basic phone skills as well as make people feel welcomed"
good,Amazing management team and good team work ethic. I enjoy learning from my fellow employees and even from my customers. I appreciate the challenges this job brings me because I have learned from all of them.
good,A fun great job if makeup and beauty are your passion. Unless you are manager hours are not so great. Hours are always flexible as long as you request within time. Great work environment.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is making people feel beautiful. The hardest part is dealing with angry customers. The work culture at ULTA is very supportive, no matter who you like, what religion you are or what color you are.  This job gives you good customer service experience."
good,I loves what my job title was and what I got to do for the company Ulta! The only thing about where I worked was that all the girls were very rude to work with and no one was very warm or friendly to each other.
good,"While the structure and dependability was what you would expect from a large company, so was management's concern for my personal career advancement. At this point in my life it's important to me to make more money and be influential and I believe I have that potential."
good,They honestly train you to succeed within the company and within this area of work. There are prosperous opportunities within the company to create a diverse work environment.
good,"The wages could be higher. The company provides great perks with discounts on products, services and occassional free products if you do very well. It is a competitive work enviorment."
good,"Its good, enjoy my days. The company is very supportive in growth and believe anything is possible. The best days are the busiest, manager helps meet goals. Ive learned confidence in myself and supporting other. The most enjoyable part of my job is brings a smile to my clients face after their salon wow experience."
good,"Ulta was a nice place to work overall, and it was great for job experience for a beginning worker. The pay was normal, and the hours weren't fantastic but they also weren't horrible. Working the seasonal times for Ulta was nice because it was fast-paced and there were a lot of events and sales going on due to the holidays."
good,"Ulta overall is not a bad place to work.  There are some great associates and supervisors who work there.  They preach culture which is amazing but sometimes, they can lose sight of what they are preaching.  Work days can vary from extremely busy and hectic to really slow and short.  Senior management varies by department.  A lot of the tough pulling is done by the mid-level management team.  Hardest part of the job would have to be ensuring that you are being fair and impartial across the board, you are expected to not develop any close relationship with you team, which can be hard if you are a personal type of person.  The easiest part of the job is motivating your team.  The associates want to do great and they are extremely hard workers.  Senior management at times does not give new supervisors time to really learn and grow, they are expected to make miracles happen in an extremely short period of time with their new teams."
good,"Great people, fun environment, decent Benefits, advancement opportunities, constantly educating, skill development, flexible hours and schedules,  friendly atmosphere"
good,It was a decent job no complaints from me nothing to serious but also something enjoyable definitely great to build that Christmas fund every year if necessary
good,"While I worked at Ulta for only a brief time, I found it provided an excellent foundation in retail. A typical day at work included a briefing on sales within the store, customer surveys, sales goals, and events happening at that location. If you worked in Prestige, you were given your individual goal for that day and may have had modules that you needed to complete specific to your product line. "
good,Ulta was a great place to advance my career. The only problem that I had was when I had concerns about my GM my district manager did not hear me out. I felt that she and the company valued the GM more than the associates.
good,"I enjoy this job usually most of the time. I help customers check out and find makeup products. Customers are typically nice, minus a few rude ones. I enjoy going to work at Ulta. A downside would be that most of my pay-check goes to me buying things at Ulta."
good,I enjoyed working here because there was always something to do whether it be tasking and reset of the store or selling product on the floor or working the cash register. I was constantly learning and interacting which I loved.
good,"This place is a lot of fun to work for. You get to tail and play with makeup all day. It isn't just that though. You are responsible for goals and maintaining them. It is not just playing with makeup, it is very customer service based. Management needs some more kinks worked out but overall it is a great place to work with many opportunities."
good,Love my team that I worked with..would.totally go back to Ulta we has such a fun environment to.work in. Needed tonseprate work and life though...otherwise fun
good,Fun and healthy working environment. Not much room for growth. Job was pretty easy and simple at the end of the day. Management needed to check in more on the managers.
good,I worked at Ulta in a part time seasonal position. My time their was a pleasant experience. All the employees that I had contact with were always kind. It was a fun working environment.
good,"A typical work day at Ulta is greeting guests and helping them find whatever they came in for. I learned a lot about new products coming out, I learned to not be so shy and I learned how to properly merchandise. Management was good. Workplace was most of the time fun and productive. The hardest part was having to deal with very rude customers and also dealing with drama. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with all types of people and building special bonds with some customers."
good,Ulta is a fun place to work and I really enjoyed it the hours did not work for me unfortunately and I did not get very many most weeks very lovely employee discount very amazing place to work
good,"Loved the culture and my coworkers!! Gratis is amazing! However, not much room for advancement and compensation is VERY LOW! Had it not"
good,"I enjoyed the beauty atmosphere, events even my co workers. However, at the time I worked at Ulta my manager was very rude and seemed to take pleasure out of making my work life miserable."
good,Usually slow and lots of walking around warehouse looking for productive things to do. Other than that very positive energy and fun filled workers and management .
good,"Great company to work for but the pay is not that great. Love the work culture. Everyone gets along with each other. Always something new in the store, great product and lots of fun interacting with the customers."
good,"It's a great place to work. For the most part it's upbeat and fun. Unfortunately, working every Saturday and having blackout days during the holiday season left me little time with my daughter. If you are in management the work-life balance is hard."
good,"It's too much stress otherwise, I wasn't interested in anything other than part-time and it started to become too much expectation and not enough organization or direction. The people are great but they all have a lot of stress and expectations of them and their worried about keeping their jobs I think. The benefits (part-time employees immediately eligible for dental and vision) were really nice."
good,"great one stop shop for all the beauty needs salon ,makeup,hair care.everyone is very friendly  and helpful with any questions you may have.everyone gets along and works as a team"
good,Watch out for the mean girls club the district manager has her favorites. You usually don’t have to run into them unless they have meetings in your store. I really enjoyed the Ulta environment and the development aspect. It’s very tough to get promoted from beauty advisor to prestige or management although they practically have you doing their job at times.
good,"I moved my way up so to say, started off as a regular beauty advisor, moved up as a lead then merchandising service coordinator.. i love the company but there are some flaws. As a MSC i was very underpaid for the amount of hours and type of work i did. "
good,"Loved my job! Love my co-workers. It was unfortunate when I had issues with my manager that those above him didn't seem concerned at all. I didn't quit my job. I quit my boss."
good,Very customer service based. Training was provided on new products. Management was flexible with shifts. Work culture was positive. Best part of the job was making people feel good about themselves.
good,I gained the confidence and experience to become a very highly accomplished manager for the skills that I received from Ulta Beauty. I had a very good mentor and trainer that showed me the truth valuable of leadership
good,"I really don’t mind working at Ulta! Good environment with normal ups and downs like any other job!! Good breaks, good team, and nice discounts. Advancement opportunities are fairly good and full time benefits are nice too!"
good,"Ulta was a really fun job, I was quickly promoted from a Beauty Advisor to a Lead Beauty Advisor after about a month with the company. Being a Lead my main focus was training new employees on the cash registers and keeping a clean and orderly cash wrap area.  The only downside of working at Ulta (let's be real, retail in general) was the hours. Some days it was good and then it gradually became less and less hours I was scheduled to work. It was also really difficult to find time to be on the floor assisting customers and maintaining the registers. I think that was mainly due to the fact of not enough people being scheduled on busy days. All in all it was a fun place to work and I got training from vendors like Philosophy, Smashbox, Murad, etc. which also meant GRATIS (free products!)."
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with at Ulta, but not receiving hours caused me to rethink my employment. I was only working morning shift, minimum 4 to 5 hours. Working 15 to 18 hours every 2 weeks; my checks would maybe range in between $100 to $120 dollars. Other than the hours, Ulta is a wonderful working environment."
good,"Overall a fun environment for someone who loves makeup and loves to learn about new makeup products. A lot of pressure ot meet goals for loyalty sign ups, especially when you first start out. Customers can be very entitled at times. Experience fully depends on what your managers are like. My first GM who hired me was very fake and made employees feel afraid to ask questions, but my new GM is very friendly and professional and appreciates any feedback we give her."
good,"I worked as a packer and scanned items in.  I learned how to use a hand scanner.  The managment was very laid back and very easy to work with if you had any questions.  The hardest part of the job was during peak season, when it was mandatory that you work 6 out 7 days per week, 12 hour shifts.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the managment and working close to your peers to get the job done."
good,"Although it was good experience to work around beauticians, i found the work pace to be slow and most days i was either working at the register or stocking inventory."
good,"love the company, just lack of education. growing company that is focused on bring new brands into store but does not provide the education and training for team."
good,I am going to school for cosmetology and they are interested in helping me achieve that dream and have also offered me a position in their salon once i receive my license.
good,Working in two different stores showed me a lot. The two stores were completely different. The first was much more developed with sales and management. They were also more organized and had less room for error. I felt that they were better to their employees and had a better management team that made it feel more like a family. The second store is newer and recently received a remodel and a new team of unseasoned managers. There has been more trial and error and learning for me and everyone involved.
good,"This was a fun job and perfect for part time. There were good discounts and gratis, but management was vastly different from store to store. Some were excellent with little staff turn over, others were plain awful and  should never have been in management. These caused constant turnover due to poor training, poor hiring choices,  and just plain incompetence."
good,Managers really want to see you succeed and work with your schedule.  It is a perfect job for girls that love cosmetics and love to help people find the right cosmetic products they need.
good,"I am torn with my experience at Ulta. While the culture, training I received, and customers I worked with were fantastic, there we some things that didn't work out for me."
good,"For the most part, I love my job at Ulta Beauty. I love working wtih makeup and learning about all the new products coming out, as well as learning new techniques through trainings. The only thing I do not like about my job, is that sometimes the work is busy work and sometimes I am not doing what I actually am supposed to be doing (selling product) because I am being asked to do other tasks. The store can tend to be under staffed."
good,"I enjoyed working for Benefit at the Ulta Brow Bar. I was part time and received good gratis from Benefit.  There was a lack of communication from the Benefit trainer though,"
good,"Really enjoyed working there , I learned a lot about different types of skin and shades of makeup to apply on customers. Also learned many things about skin care, such as how to treat oily or dry skin"
good,Good management and friendly co-workers. Management made sure that my work schedule and school schedule didn't overlap. Best part of the job was being surrounded by other makeup lovers.
good,"Fun, salon management is kind and encouraging. Culture is great, I would recommend working here. I've found hours for estheticians are not steady. Depending on where your store is the better you'll do. More flow in the store = more clients aka you might actually receive commission checks instead of the low hourly wage. They really push getting your own clients out on the floor which is understandable and I'm sure with good management would be easier with kind encouragement.  At my store it's pushed (towards the skin therapists and hair designers) with passive aggressive comments and jokes from the GM. I've heard things about bad management at other stores from friends working at other Ulta's so maybe they need to be better at finding good GMs. Other than that and the fact that they don't advertise the skin part so it's pretty slow I enjoy the job a lot. Salon team is great support for the Skin Therapists and you can work together to promote one another. With the right store and team this could be an amazing job for experience in this field."
good,"Ulta is making big moves and has been fun to work for. They are advancing because of great management. There have been hiccups along the way, but if you work hard and have the same goals as them you can well be on your way to an Ulta Career. Right now is the best time to become involved."
good,I loved working for Ulta Beauty for the time that I did. I was able to learn and build my knowledge of brands and products on the floor while helping guests and making sure they were satisfied with their experience. I would love to work for Ulta again and work my way up to becoming an esthetician there.
good,"pretty straight foward job. fun, alot of nice girls. items are kept clean. high theft is a problem seems with every ulta. "
good,I love working at Ulta! The people and environment work outstanding. Working every weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and holiday but Christmas Day and barely making ends meet while living with my mom is what ultimately led me to look for work elsewhere.
good,"I definitely loved my job, especially as an associate with many opportunities for growth and classes to learn from. Definitely a fun environment especially working with makeup. Even though you have to keep up with rewards cards and credit cards, the guest and services you provide make it very easy to do."
good,"The day-to-day business was very high paced. There was always something to do, so it was never a dull day at work. The energy was always up making it a place you wanted to work at."
good,"I loved working at ulta but I didn't feel like I was welcome with some of the other employees. I liked that my hours were somewhat decent but at the same time, the hours weren't the best. It was a nice experience but I just feel that they need to work on not judging their employees and making them feel uncomfortable and not welcome."
good,I liked the idea of working at Ulta and what benefits I could possibly gain from it but the hours offered are not enough for me to live on perosnally.
good,"My day would consist of cleaning aisles, making sure the stations were stocked for customer use. Also putting out and organizing products on the floor. This job taught me how to interact with customers on a much more personal level to achieve what they really want to make sure they are happy with their visit. The hardest part of this job for me was my time management and the point system. I still love this job very much. I was sad I had to go."
good,"Ulta is a great company to work for. Where they lack is training their management team in LEADERSHIP, especially and specifically their General Managers since they set the tone and pace for the store."
good,Great training was provided. Fun environment. There is endless amounts of opportunities to grow and enhance your career field with in the company. Clear and direct expectations.
good,"Job preparation was very intuitive.  Make up application, cash handling, and customer service is the main three focus points.  Schedules were flexible."
good,productive place to work with good culture i learned outbound and inbound learned to drive pallet rider management is fair hardest part of the job is keeping a high percentage daily
good,"The hardest part of the job is being able to multi-task different things at one time. I love the job, but I am just ready to move on and find something new."
good,"Typical day= Arrive at work as the opening manger . I would access our Aim system and delegate the necessary duties to my opening associate. Next view emails then access kronos for payroll, attendance, budget, and scheduling information from previous business day to input in data base. Next, open the store and prep a strategic chat-in sheet for the team. I would Gem for my period , then pass the torch to the next Gem. I would join my prestige team In my department after lunch for our prestige departmental duties. "
good,I loved my co workers but it’s too robotic to enjoy being a stylist here. It’s great walk in traffic but I would rather enjoy my job than have it feel like a chore to do anything. You need to have an open atmosphere and it just feels too micromanaged.
good,"I enjoyed my time here. It was a temporary seasonal position that taught me a lot. Everyone I worked with was nice and nonjudgmental, sometimes a bunch of girls can be chatty. Overall a fine job. Good discount too."
good,"I loved working at Ulta, it allowed me to further my knowledge of the makeup, skincare products, and so much more in just my short time there. Management was always extremely nice and flexible."
good,"Just another job. Its more of a labor intensive job."
good,"Totally a makeup freak's job. It is a great experience on how to work with a team and get to know customers and how to handle a work side compared to a normal you side. I loved my job, and it was a huge learning experience"
good,"Overall a good company and positive work environment. Each location will have it's own cadence, but in general the expectation is very reasonable. Many locations are small, and therefore you will find yourself doing a variety of tasks on any given day."
good,Ulta is a great place to work. Especially if you enjoy EVERYTHING beauty. Everyone is helpful and usually work well together.  The salon at Ulta is very sanitary and well kept as well.
good,Awesome for the most part although they do have an issue with being loyal to their employees. You could work there 20 years with nothing on your record and then get fired for drinking a salon water bottle instead of store water bottle.
good,"I enjoyed working there, they had many educational opportunities and classes and the energy was great. Pay could have been better, but it was worth the commute for the time being, I had a better opportunity arise though and resigned."
good,"I loved working here for three years but sadly had to leave due to poor management. Hopefully, I will return in the future. Previous managers and other locations were excellent and I wish I could return back and work for them."
good,I had a great manager but she left and everything was terrible after that. Customer based not the best and Ulta did very little to advertise their services.
good,"There was always a positive environment going into work. The employees are all nice and fun to work with. Hours weren't too long, with the exception being holiday season. management was overall easy to work with, only sometimes would hit a wall in respects to communicating on tasks. Overall it is very fun helping people with makeup and beauty tips because people look up to your opinions and tips."
good,"Fun slow paced job. Usually just checking customers out, answering any questions they have, and cleaning up the store.  Closing was easy usually just sweeping and moping and counting your drawer.  Training was quick but the job was easy."
good,"I loved building a relationship with my co-workers, and I loved performing my every day duties.  My only complaint was that I was promised a promotion twice and never received either.  I just wish things hadn't gone down the way that they did, because the job itself was great, the opportunity for advancement just didn't evolve when I needed it to."
good,"typical time of working in a cosmetic company. competitive"
good,"I would recommend this position and this company, but not this location and district. Like many large corporations the district manager and store manager really dictate your experience."
good,"Ulta has benefits like insurance (which I did not take advantage of) and employee discounts, as well as the occasional gratis item; as well, for the first part of my employment, we were entitled to a 30-minute lunch break if we're on the clock longer than 5 hours. However, I find it very difficult to get hours because it seems like we are always hiring new beauty advisors, meanwhile current employees are getting 4 and 8 hours a week (at least at my store). In addition, it seems like hours are always being cut after the schedule has already been made; and so it can be frustrating to lose half your shift(s) if you're intending to support yourself on wages as a beauty advisor at Ulta."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here. I learned a lot about new products and how to actually put makeup on my face and I absolutely loved teaching people things. For some people, it was life changing (the things I taught them) and that felt really good. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was getting in trouble any time I came in with no make up on, even if I had to be there at 4 am to stock after I left at 1 am because I was stocking. You get lots of free product and you get a heck of an experience!"
good,"I have learned a lot from working here, that's for sure. Easy, up to date technology, like the registers, headsets, and the ULTA.net were all easy to learn and familiarize. I feel like most of my coworkers are very unhappy working under the company and certain managers."
good,"Ulta is a great place to work at if you want to feel like your're part of a family. The managers have an open door policy and it is nice to be able to go to your leads with anything! "
good,"this was a great learning experience and a good work environment.  I enjoy the co-workers and the customers that come,  however I am looking to find another position that will offer better hours."
good,I worked at Ulta for nearly 3 years. Great environment and place to work. That being said we had a great team with awesome managers and employees. Its a good part-time job to have. Usually scheduling around other commitments is not an issue. Only complaint is too short of shifts and it's minimum wage. You do get a very small raise at each yearly review.
good,Ulta managers were great to work with. Working on the early morning shifts could be a lot of fun if you let it. Ulta sells amazing products that you had the opportunity to promote to customers.
good,"Wonderful job. Had to get order amounts correct, orders shipped in time, and so on. Easy work, good pay. Excellent seasonal position. Also we received free makeup samples and samples of hair products."
good,It was fun. I grand opened the store as the salon manager and I got to hand pick my team. It was awesome. The manager was great and she and I worked really well together. She was very supportive and wanted to learn as much as she could about the salon.
good,Great starting place for Estheticians or anyone in the beauty industry. you learn so much from the staff and support team of vendors! lots of room for advancement.
good,"I enjoy working in such a positive, fun, inviting environment. There is a lot of room for advancement and the management works hard to ensure each employee is making progressive strides."
good,"I liked working at Ulta , It was a very good learning experience and would do it again. They have various positions and one can move up quickly if so desired to so."
good,"It's okay as a part-time job but not sustainable if you have bills to pay. Over emphasis on getting credit card sign-ups. if you do your work and have a high loyalty percentage, you'll be fine."
good,"no flexible hours. deal with a lot rude customers as a cashier and no decent training to handle it properly, cashiers come and go no stable training, benefit is amazing to work"
good,Ulta was a Fun company to work for.   They focus on customer service and the guest experience which I appreciate.  I enjoyed being able to assist the guests with finding solutions to their beauty concerns and have them leave happy and confident.
good,"Working with makeup can be fun but challenging. The makeup is fun and exciting, however, bad interactions with customers can really ruin your day. However you do get work with many brand reps."
good,It's a good company to work for if you're starting out in the work force. A perfect first job. If you love beauty products and makeup this is the place to be!
good,"It is a good job, they provide great tools for you to be able to move up in the company. Very strict policies set in place for employees. Not steady work for part time employees if you are looking for a consistent schedule."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ulta, the management was very understanding and flexible with my school schedule and second job. I learned a lot through the trainings the company provided as well as everyday experiences."
good,Enjoyable environment. The Staff is similar to family and very fun to work with. Discounts are nice however I think it should be a little bit more. Overall fun place to work
good,I loved my job at ULTA but General Manager was not professional at all. Would get angry and blame everyone for her mistakes. Did not like to work so she made the environment very unpleasant to work with.
good,I loved what I did and the team I had. Never a boring day and it was always fun to go to work. Vendors always continued our education in new brands...
good,"Onsite Rep couldn't answer questions asked about this seasonal position. What was require to become full time, what company was looking for etc.  When to work sometime to be sent right back home with no minimum pay."
good,Good place to work. But promotions seem to be based on throwing a hissy fit on management. The discount is nice. Excellent opportunity to learn more about makeup.
good,"Working at Ulta has been an ok experience so far. I have a very open availability to work but i need more hours and i've voiced that many times but still nothing has happened, in fact my hours were cut a little bit more. A typical day at work would be either stocking products on shelves and putting backstock away, or cashiering and signing people up for our loyalty card, or helping guests find what they need in our store. I learned alot about working with difficult customers, and hard transactions. The hardest part of the job is honestly keeping an eye out for shoplifters, it happens all throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of my day is when i have customers understand that retail is actually not the easiest job, as well as getting along with my coworkers is the most enjoyable."
good,"Typical day at work as a Beauty Advisor would be cleaning the shelves replenishing, cashiering and assisting customer with the help in finding what they are looking for."
good,"I would have to say i had the delightful pleasure of working for suck an open-minded company where you can be you. I loved all the staff including managers, it was a delight to be able to help people out with makeup and other in-store products that i had vast knowledge on. There really isn't much of a ""hard"" , or ""difficult"" thing to the job because when you do something you love, then its always easy. The only reason they didn't keep me was because the two weeks after Christmas, the scheduling went back to normal hours (off season) and since i was looking for other work and getting money for doing odd jobs i was deemed ""unreliable"" because i wasn't able to come in when they wanted me (on call). On a typical day of work i would mostly be doing go-backs, returns, making DMG tags for returns/ in-store damages, and as well as customer service and being cashier."
good,"Steady paced work shifts, scheduling is a bit everywhere, worked under a great GM, Prestige Manager, & team leads. Throughout my time employed there i made a couple good friends."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in and getting your assignment (cashier,stocking,roaming) management was nice and professional, my coworker were very nice people. the job is Very easy and fun"
good,"great place to work if you want a little side money, but not to pay bills. The managers are really cool and understanding."
good,"You'll do great at Ulta if you can handle a generally busy, fast paced environment and are good with the public. "
good,"This is a great place to work, however, they can be very unorganized. You get your schedule a week in advance, you do not get sick days, there are not a lot of opportunities to move up in the company."
good,I enjoyed my job working wit ULTA fun staff and great environment. Flexiable scheudles and friendly management. Hard working staff and productive team effort. I learned a lot from working at this company. Most fun I've ever had at a job.
good,"I find this job to be very easy, and enjoyable. This is a great job if your a college student or working two jobs. The only thing about the job that I dislike is they threaten a loss in hours if your not gaining loyalty reward customers. I enjoy being surrounded by makeup and being able to help the customers choose which beauty product is for them."
good,"A typical day as an Ulta Manager is office work, giving great customer service, managing payroll and overlooking associates. The most enjoyable part of working at Ulta Beauty is helping our guests with all their needs and making each of them feel great about themselves."
good,"A typical Day."
good,"Fun place to work delivering customer service within the cosmetics industry. Fast paced, busy workplace. Store offers salon services along with brow waxing and skin care. Carries most major and high end brand name cosmetics."
good,This is a great place to work but at time management is afraid of taking stand for things that happen throughout the workplace and just let things slide. Your hours fluctuate depending on their budget so nothing is ever set in stone unless considered a full time employee
good,"A typical day at work was running the cashwrap, making sure my employees had guidence on what they should be doing for thier shifts, preventing theft, closing the store the nights that I worked, and making sure that all signage and product was properly in its place. My co workers were wonderful. We all got along. My management team in the store was great. I learned how to be a better hard working person, and how to manage a team. The hardest part was Friday mornings I had to open the store at 4am to receive the shipment with my team, break it down and put the product on the floor."
good,"Working here has been eye opening as far as cosmetic sales are concerned. During a typical day at work I would be expected to meet sales goals for a department as a whole, which would mean assisting customers (most of which I did see on a regular basis; more of a clientele atmosphere), recommending customers to seek lines in which vendors were available to speak more intelligently about their own lines, or recommending that customers consult with an associate who worked in one of our in-store boutiques. Management is very active in work culture and cultivating associates as people and not just an employee. Time is taken to build upon the skills of every staff member. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the things that needed improvement, like the break room, or the makeup stations. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the customers. I loved building rapport with everyone who came in, and taking the time to get to know them and their needs. I get so much satisfaction out of helping someone bring out their inner beauty. I got into cosmetics to help everyone feel empowered and confident."
good,"Great experience and fun work atmosphere. Great products that are easy to sell. It is a fast growing company and such great, friendly people to work with. Hardest part of the job was Operations. So much to do with little time to complete operational tasks. Most fun was educating customers on products."
good,Only get 25% off and manager hogg all the gratis. Hard to move up in the company and get trained on everything in the store yet they expect you to know everything. Work place is great at giving days off.
good,"Learned how to be one of the team. "
good,"Product knowledge on skin care and other beauty products.	Maximize sales by demonstrating the proper products for the customer."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Ulta. I always had fun with most guests and the environment is great. I had some trouble adjusting to the schedule ( lots of evenings and weekends). My co-workers were great! Management needed some work, but the DM was wonderful"
good,Overall Ulta is a good company in providing exceptional customer service. Meeting the needs of the customer is always first priority. We always make sure each person leaves with the ultimate guest experience.
good,"Cashier and beauty consultant at Ulta Beauty. Fun environment, great employees, demanding but flexible managers. Always left a smile on my face at the end of the day even during the busiest of shifts."
good,"I have 30 years of retail experience - mostly in management.  Typically, I open and close the store, hire, train and coach new associates.  I handle difficult guests and resolve their situations.  I set the store for new ads.  I run the shipment process.  I take care of merchandising and inventory.  Theft prevention.  "
good,"Working as a beauty advisor for Ulta taught me the significance of team work, communication, and customer satisfaction in a customer oriented industry. The coworkers I have are overall fun and bubbly people, the managers prove to be understanding and open to any thoughts or concerns, and the overall treatment of the employees fair and pleasant. Since this is my first job, I couldn't tell anyone how much better or worse this company is compared to other stores, but my only complaint is how absolutely inconsistent hours are. Some weeks I worked 15+ hours, others none at all. Also the schedules are occasionally changed without employees knowing. I've been ""late"" when my shift was bumped up two hours earlier and no one even bothered to call. I've also missed days I thought I had off when managers decide to once again change the schedule on me and didn't call. I don't know how common this is in retail, but it's honestly my only complaint otherwise. Just a bit more communication as far ahead as possible would suffice! Working in retail requires flexibility, but communication helps."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of marketing the salon and bringing clients back for a hair or makeup service with also the intent to sell products. What I learned about the company was it is a great stepping ground for new or experienced stylists to learn u to date salon styling and selling techniques o grow their business. Management was helpful and I had great leadership in the salon. My coworkers were friendly and eager to help if needed. The hardest part of the job was the pay, we wee started off at minimum wage. It was not enough to maintain my apartment, bills etc. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smiles on the faces of my clients from a service I had provided on them."
good,This company has good benefits.  Opportunity to advance if you apply yourself.  Learned team building and work/task balance.  Extremely busy and always a lot to accomplish in a days schedule.
good,"I never had enough hours, they would call me last minute and tell me not to come in. the manager needed a chill pill. she was way too high stung. but the environment was alright. working in the beauty industry always has something for you to learn. I was learning about new product everyday."
good,"I occasionally enjoyed going into work, I had managers who would gossip and choose favorites due to personal and not work related experiences. Other than that, I loved working with the public. I see my self as strongly out going and very much a people person. So working in this retail store was enjoyable. I learned working on cash registers, engaging customers to see what they are looking for and help them find the correct products."
good,"•	Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
good,"Lots of make-up fun environment, challenging sales goals."
good,"During my tenure as a Cashier, I would handle the shipment very Wednesday, which included around 3,000 items for the store and company. I would also have to familiarize and educate myself on product that was sold there. Customers would come in with questions and concerns about items they bought. I would also handle returns for this company."
good,"I worked for Ulta for 8 1/2 years and in that timeframe I made great friendships and connections with everyone. I had a good amount of friends/co-workers in my wedding and all were invited as well. Some of my managers were great to work for, and were very accomodating.  I learned a great deal being able to move within the company and work in various departments. The hardest part of the job was completing the designated deadlines.  They were completed on time, but it was a lot of pressure on the departments.  Being that we were all a team and worked together, deadlines were met."
good,"I make and receive phone calls all day long, and also receive emails for appointments. I assign scheduled times to each company who requests a delivery appointment based on a SAP date that I look up by the PO numbers. I have learned how to speak professionally to others, and how to manage my time. I have also learned how to be a supervisor, and help assign job positions to the receiving team. The hardest part of the job to me has been learning how to help somebody who is not reaching the expected goals for the department. When they are having problems with their life outside of work that is interfering with their job function. I enjoy all aspects of my job. I like to learn new thing whenever I am giving the chance."
good,"- Staring out the day with a budget of what we need in sales."
good,I love that place a lot. Only reason I quit was my study. I needed more time to study. 
good,"A typical day of work involves me greeting customers promptly, operating the cash wrap, maintaining the general appearance of the store, preforming makeup demos, and helping customers promptly and sweetly."
good,"A typical day at work is started with assisted customers and accepting payment at the cash register. With every customer I ask if they found what they were looking for and if they have a ULTAmate rewards card with our company. If they do not have a rewards card, I offer them one and go over the money saving benefits. Depending on the shift I work I am responsible for some cleaning and re stocking. At least one manager is on the floor at all times and assists cashiers with returns and customer complaints and questions. The hardest part of the job is when the store gets busy and management is busy with other customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is making women feel beautiful and more confident."
good,I would be in charge of helping people with their purcheses ans applying makeup.
good,"I loved my time at ULTA. I never felt stressed or overwhelmed, and their employee support system for complaints or comments is fantastic. They really care about what their employees think about the company. Also, they offer lots of free products for winning sales competitions. I once got a free HUGE bottle of Juicy Couture perfume. AWESOME. I truly loved this job. I didn't feel like there was much room for advancement, but I didn't care. I enjoyed where I was at. Unfortunately, I got a new manager that felt that my tasteful tattoos needed to be completely covered with make-up, so I quit. My previous manager didn't have a problem and I felt as though this was extremely unfair and biased. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about ULTA. I would go back for a second job if I wasn't still a bit put off by my last manager."
good,Ulta would be a great first job for any person’s interested in the beauty/ cosmetics/ hair world. this would not ideal for older more established artists.
good,"It’s a great first job as a new esthetician. You get to gain knowledge about many different products and services as well as hands on experience. Versatility within the whole store ranging from skincare, makeup, hair, and everything beauty."
good,My experience here was nice. I learned a lot along the way. I learned a lot about communication. I had good leaders. I grew as a person. Overall I have nothing really bad to say at all.
good,"It’s an amazing place to work! There are a few things that bug me though, one being that they promised me the amount of hours I wanted and then three month in have completely cut it in half, they also haven’t been balancing out truck shifts which exhaust"
good,They teach you how to better multitask in order to be more efficient. As well as keeping the customer #1 in the workplace. I felt like the culture was amazing.
good,"Ulta is a great place to work for any beauty enthusiast.  The workload is excessive though, just like any retailer.  You are expected to meet sales goals and maintain product standards throughout the store."
good,"my job and work setting is very pleasant. "
good,The company is great to work for because it provides job culture and everyone there is great and welcomes you with open arms; they treat employees as family while making sure to provide great customer service to the guests at the same time!
good,"It’s a great seasonal job, everyone is super sweet! There is a strict dress code on what colors you’re allowed to wear but it’s fine. The managers are really welcoming and understanding. And you get a 25% employee discount."
good,"It was a basic retail job, but I love makeup so it was an ideal position for me at the time. The people I worked with made the job bearable. I had great managers and great co workers."
good,I thoroughly have enjoyed working for the Butler Ulta Beauty due to the staff who works their tail off to make it a fun and enjoyable place. They are understanding and do their best to accommodate each person to the  best of their abilities and continue to thrive amongst other stores in the town. Great small close-knit family atmosphere with co-workers!
good,"Because I provided services, I had a set working schedule. The benefits for full time employees are pretty good, however part time employees basically are working for the discount, as hours aren't as consistent."
good,"My review is that i loved working for Ulta. I loved the location which was the Tustin Marketplace location in Orange County, CA. And i loved my managers and my fellow co workers. i REGRET not putting in my two weeks when i left. The reason i left is cause i ended up moving out of town for personally reasons and ended up coming back because it didn't end well. I don't know if anybody from Ulta corporate reads this but the reason i didn't give my two weeks (which now i am regretting) is because i worked on a Thurs, closing shift. And i didn't have another shift until 11 days later, due too not having enough hours. I may try and contact Corporate and plead my case because i LOVED working for this company and it would be a honor and a privilege to be able to work here again. Truly was the best place i have ever worked. I do freelance makeup artist and its my absolute passion. So when i got hired (you can ask management) i was ecstatic because makeup, beauty, cosmetics & skin care is the absolute passion of every fiber of my being"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and the products and training available to the salon team. "
good,"I really enjoy working at Ulta, mostly because of my coworkers. I became really close to many, and there is a great support system! I also enjoyed getting to see new product coming in, and enjoyed sharing my love of beauty with customers."
good,"You get 25% off all merchandise which is really nice. Brands also do additional associate discounts on top of the 25% off. If you need a job just for spending money (in high school or college), then I would recommend, but if you work for a living I would not recommend unless you are looking at this as a second job. Very little hours, maybe 2 shifts a week unless you sell lots of credit cards (5+ a shift), that's why I say you can't live off of this job. Most of the people I worked with had 2 or more jobs. They are very flexible with scheduling."
good,ULTA BEAUTY is one of my favortite places. It is always filled with such much joy and motivation to do the job. Interacting with guests is by far my favorite part. Not only does it improve your communication skills but it gets you out of your comfort zone. Ulta is also always a place where you can grow in the company.
good,"Overall was a great job, just wish I was able to work more. The  management team was very polite and always made sure you stayed on task. Pay was $9 which is pretty good, but the hours you got made for fairly small checks. A really good part-time job though!"
good,I was full time Clinique Boutique manager working 40Hrs a week. I had my own goals for my boutique but I also would help in other parts of the store. I had fun and enjoyed my time there. Unfortunately the schedule didnt work for me.
good,I love my area of work at Ulta Beauty. I experience different customers / people on a daily basis as well as have my set clientele which is just as great.
good,"I love working here! I get a sense of belonging, and it's a fun and fast pace work environment. I also love that classes are provided to enhance our skills. Just wish I made more as a stylist."
good,"The salon environment was fun, but it was difficult to get benefits."
good,"In terms of the vibe, I love working here!! My co-workers are amazing, and I genuinely really like most of my managers as well. The employee discount is also a plus, as they give us extra discounts on things all the time. The actual work is pretty simple, and the shifts tend to go fast as there is always something to do. However, the hours are terrible, and they seem to get lower every week. They are also completely inconsistent. One week I may have 10 hours, another week I may have 25 hours. It makes it really hard to plan your finances, especially since we don't get the schedule more than 2/2.5 weeks in advance. Which days I work and which shifts are also completely random, making the life-work balance difficult. The only other real negative is that the loyalty is really pushed on the cashiers to keep the numbers up, which a lot of the time can be totally out of our control, since many people refuse to give you their information. There also isn't really room for makeup training, so if you are looking for a job that will give you that, Ulta isn't really for you. You have to be certified to actually apply makeup on a client besides a shade match or demonstration. Overall I genuinely like my job, but the hours are the main issue. I also think it depends on what location you are at."
good,"I have worked at Ulta Beauty since college as a part time associate. I decided to pursue a career in management and found it stressful. Some stores have a lot of drama and poor management but luckily I worked at decent stores, one of which was absolutely the best and had I been the manager there I would have stayed! I resigned due to lack of upper management support. The training from upper management is stressful because there was basically none. I was never given a proper learning development plan or schedule, just kind of thrown into the mix then reprimanded over trivial things like simple policy violations that I really didn’t know because of the lack of training. Anyway, could be good if you have the training and I highly recommend this job to anyone who is a self starter motivated individual who will take initiative to establish a good training program for themselves - bc your upper management won’t help."
good,"early morning crew unloads new product and stocks shelves, replaces signage, gets prepared for opening. the hardest part of the job is finding where things belong. most enjoyable part its quiet, there's a team to help when needed and managers are great and inclusive"
good,"Ulta creates an environment where most, if not all, of the employees get along. It truly feels like you're working in a family when working at Ulta. The biggest drawback is that there aren't any benefits starting out, and scheduling can sometimes be a bit of a mess."
good,I was working at Ulta as a Tempo worker helping set up for the opening of a brand new store. Setting up everyday was nice working with friendly people. I learned more about makeup which was awesome.
good,"If you like all things beauty related, you would like working at Ulta Beauty. It was such an enjoyment learning more about products each day and passing the information on to customers. If you arrive to work with a positive attitude, you wont have a problem there."
good,"Be flexible and compliant. I enjoyed the opportunity to build relationships, grow personal leadership skills in a complex multi-business envirionment."
good,"Fun seasonal job. The typical day included zoning your area, helping with cashiering and assisting guests on the floor. The hardest part of the job was balancing what needed to be fixed in the store."
good,"Ulta beauty is a fun and productive place to work, getting discounts on make up and salon! One of the best places I worked at so far. Everyone always has a positive attitude."
good,"I don’t feel that this part of the review process is necessary for me to complete but I can continue until I complete this so.. I feel like this was a good company to work for, for a few years. Depending on if you are relocatable, there is room for advancement but if you can’t move then it’s hard to move up in the company. Just like any retail company"
good,"They do not advertise the salon all that much. I started at a new location and no one knew they even had a salon. The staff is very clicky. Also, they give little product training on makeup but expect you to sell it which is fine but you'd think they would allow you to do the training and get free products too if you're required to sell it like every other employee. You get paid less than makeup artists less hours and you end up doing your job as a hairdresser and as a retail person for the makeup as well."
good,"Ulta was a fun place to work, the only issue I had was the fact that people didnt know that there was a full service salon onsite. Even though there was a lot of foot traffic. I wasn't as busy as I would've liked. overall the job was fun I met so many amazing people from my coworkers to clients, it was a good experience I would definitely work here again."
good,Scheduling is not consistent enough. Other than that great place to work if you have a good GM and team. Typical retail job but better than a clothing store.
good,"I absolutely love working at the Seminole Ulta. I was hired seasonal but have worked here for almost three years now. "
good,It was okay for the time i was there. Some members of management werent the greatest and there was always some form of drama but as far as the work itself it was easy and a lil boring at times
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Ulta, however, the management gave me no direction, would cut my hours out of nowhere, and threatened my job because of a lie they heard."
good,"Everyday was a busy day, lots to focus on and lots to get done. There were some issues with associate management but it was overall an enjoyable time."
good,"During my time working at ULTA, I had no complaints. All of my managers and supervisors were awesome, and I loved working with fellow colleagues. Even the customers were all amazing (a majority of the time) and I rarely had a bad customer interaction while working there. The biggest issue I had with the job was the lack of hours I received. During the first couple weeks of my employment, I would get 20+ hours a week, but after that, it went down to one or two 4 hours shifts a week, and would constantly fluctuate. It was very inconsistent, which isn't a surprise given the position was part-time seasonal, but when the pay is bi-weekly it can be a little frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was easily the relations and conversations I had with the customers, as well as learning from colleagues and managers. Overall I would love to work here again someday!"
good,Great place to start a management position and grow skills . Very rewarding customers and fast paced learning environment. Optional overtime and wonderful benefits
good,"Good people,Good environment, although no place to grow into a larger title. The pay is non negotiable and no raises at all. Expect way too much for The pay."
good,Good place to work. At the time great team environment. Opportunities for training are endless. If you’re good at sales this place is for you. Good luck!
good,"Friendly environment , I was in charge of operations of approximately 36 team members. My job was to build a well trained team. Responsibilities include but not limited to thr imports and exports of commercial goods, executing details passed down from Company."
good,Ulta has lots of room for their people to grow and develop in their career.  They need to do a better job on their work/life balance.  There is so much to do in a day that you feel you never can get it all done.
good,"Fast paced environment with a chance to grow. Challenging, engaging, and a fun experience. Inconsistent schedules make work/life balance difficult with late nights and early mornings."
good,"I loved Ulta, but the hours were not the best. They try to schedule for 35 hours so they don't have to give benefits. The environment is great and management is awesome."
good,I loved working here! I miss my ULTA family. I decided to move on reluctantly for a better paying job with benefits. I would work there again in a heartbeat.
good,"The expectations at work are entirely reasonable and the managers work with you, at the location I work at. The management is considerate and fair. As long as you do your job, you will be fine."
good,"There was never a day at Ulta that you didn't have something to do, regardless of customer traffic in the store. There are endless tasks that they always have for employees, and managers are never off their feet. You really find a workplace family in Ulta, and have a lot of drive behind every step. The company culture and mission is admirable, as well as CEO Mary Dillon, and it showcases that throughout every store."
good,"They truly are driven by their core values and are flexible in meeting the needs of their employees. I loved the positive energy and vibe of my coworkers/ management team. I wish it were easier to go to the District Managers about promotions, and that they would promote from within more often to give employees more opportunity to grow with the company. When I was there I felt like I was not compensated appropriately for my knowledge of the industry and for how many other roles I was taking on. I was teaching the General Manager and her friend, (another Sales Manager hired along side her without appropriate qualifications) new things constantly! The raises were very small and only came once or twice a year. The reviews didn’t provide much feedback either. After working there for years, I also didn’t feel like they allowed me any room for advancement. I felt stuck in a position where I was not making enough money, knowing I was more valuable. Overall I had a good experience, but was disappointed in the lack of advancement."
good,Love working and assisting with the customers and co-workers are a pleasure to work with as well. Management makes the job enjoyable and they are understanding when unexpected events happen.
good,"Not too bad of a place to work if you're going to school. You also get an employee discount! I believe you do have to be 18 to work here. The starting pay isn't the greatest, but you do get to work in a fun environment."
good,"Great place to work if your recently licensed.  You learn how to talk to customers and convert them from the retail floor into your treatment room.  You learn a lot about various prestige brands in makeup and skin care.  However the treatment room is a open concept setting which most customers don't really find appealing, its not sound proof and you can hear all the noise caused by the salon (conversations, blow-dryers, crying babies, sometimes barking dogs..? yup.)"
good,I worked merchandise most of the time at ulta because i was rally good at freight and putting together displays. My group of people i worked with was amazing!!!!! I couldnt ask for a better merch manager. our general manager wasnt the best person to go to to talk and seemed a little out of place when it came to her job but i didnt have to see her often because i worked before and after store hours and mostly worked alongside my merch manager. The best part about the job was when I did work the floor during store hours and when you helped someone and they wanted to make it known that you did a great job and were so thankful for all the help and when they come back to remember you.
good,"Very customer service oriented.  l "
good,"The management was good. Not enough traffic in the salon. Pay was layer than wanted/needed. Overall good experience, but could have been better. There was a lack of teamwork."
good,"It was a good job, just wish they made better judgment when to sign new people. Other then that. No complaints on the job. The people there were great. Very friendly && always opened to assist you when needed to be."
good,"I love working at Ulta Beauty! It was definitely my dream job. I feel that some people should get paid more depending on what they are doing, but life isn't always fair."
good,Ulta Beauty has a strong culture and vision that guides the stores and corporate team.  The store teams are empowered to make decisions to drive the business.
good,High-speed working environment for this role. Marketing. Merchandising. Inventory processing. Guests services. Sales goals. Leading operational group projects.
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Ulta. I definitely took advantage of the employee discount and all of the classes. It is always something a little different so it was always interesting.
good,Working at Ulta was so much fun! I highly enjoyed it. It is a great place to start off as an esthetician and makeup artist. I got to experience many opportunities. In management there isn't a lot of room to have a personal life and made it difficult for me to go back to school a few days a week.
good,I leved working here. The managers were awasome in helping and advising you how to better your pay. Thy helped out a lot. When I had questions on products someone always was willing to help out.
good,I am a hairstylist so my typical day is different than the Beauty Advisors/Cashiers that work there. Depending on the day there is lots of foot traffic for converting clientele.
good,This is a fun place to work. It is a fast-paced job. My managers were nice and easy to work for. The hardest place about the job is being able to help a lot of people.
good,"I didn't have a lot of color experience with their product line. I was left alone to close by myself. "
good,"Not a bad a company, great for starting position if you're looking to work in makeup. Life/work balance is okay depending on your position. Pay could be a little higher."
good,"Company is great to work for as a whole, but the management was not very forgiving. Typically the scheduling was handled well, but there was a lot of micro-managing happening which made it hard to work."
good,The staff is amazing make you feel right at home but work/life flexibility is hard to maintain you must be committed if something comes up you MUST find a replacement or it will fall upon you and may result in you losing the job. But the managers and staff are amazing to work with you make life long friends !
good,"getting to meet new people within the beauty community is great, gratis is great, the pay is okay, the culture is very much based on the management so bad manager, bad vibes,i have been with the company for 2 years and my only complaint would be the limited opportunities for job advancements and the low pay."
good,I love working here. The hours are very flexible and you get paid pretty well. The only thing I didn’t like was that you can’t have full-time hours unless you’re a manager or working at a different part of the store where you need licensing.
good,I learned more information about beauty products. Some customers can be very hard to deal with but its worth it. I love making people feel beautiful and better about themselves.
good,if you enjoy sales and cosmetics its a great place to work. good training programs to keep you updated on product lines. Fun work environment with great coworkers.
good,I liked working at ulta for the time  I was there. I like the fact that you meet new people even day and get to help them with what every problems that they had. however I end up leaving and went elsewhere do to lack of hours that I was receiving.
good,"Great work environment, friendly co-workers for the most part. Management works with you more than not to resolve any issues one may have when it comes to the company. Very understanding company."
good,I never had an issue with my superiors and they taught me a lot about customer service and advertising. Every customer experience had me learning and pushing to help everyone to the best of my knowledge.
good,Great Products and people  loved my market and my team. I had a lot of great experiences at this company.  Loved opening new locations and the remodel process was very smooth
good,"The good: they can provide good benefits for full time, after one year, my work schedule was ok, product discounts. Commission was decent, but getting a promotion is very difficult."
good,"Excellent clientele at location. Was very difficult to build into full-time, as the salon was not very busy -- therefore, pay was awful. When I didn't have a client, it was fun to work on the sales floor assisting customer with make up and skin care needs."
good,"A typical day at work for a Beauty Advisor could include running the cash register, helping guests with their selections or doing task. The culture is amazing, they encourage you to learn new things and encourage your advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is the product training and gratis. The hardest part of the job is that it is almost always understaffed and puts a lot of pressure on the other employees."
good,"While working at ULTA, I have been able to learn how more of the stocking and product management side of the business. I have also been able to continue to build my customer service skills."
good,Great place for artist to work. Very accepting of expression of self through makeup artistry and hair styles. Lots of great professionals to learn from
good,"Ulta is a decent company to work for. Only problem is, like any retail establishment, the hours are inconsistent and not always guaranteed. One week I would have 4 hours and then the next I could have 40. Not very good to live off of."
good,"I love the vast majority of my job. Helping guests, of course, but also the little things involved in preparing for new sales on Sundays, or cleaning and re-doing the shelves for a brand's update. Things keep changing, at least aesthetically, and it's fun to keep up with all the newness. The management team at my store is also great; some scheduling and communication frustrations aside, they always try to do right by their associates. There's a lot of flexibility on hours, which can be a good thing; even lead cashiers aren't limited in the number of days they can take off, though there's the caveat that only managers get paid vacation. There's also the occasional gratis from the GM when she comes back from conferences!"
good,its a good place to work. A typical day consist of a 6am start time going to a startup meeting and getting your work assignment from our supervisor.We get a paid lunch and out the door by 4pm.
good,I enjoyed working for Ulta specifically because the managers seemed to care about their employees on a personal level. The company as a whole was well structured and worked well in nearly every aspect.
good,"A typical day at work some times, enjoyed working there. Some time to much overtime, it felt like there wasn't  a day off. Management always changing there  minds on issues."
good,"Pay is not great, but you have to start somewhere. This is a good place to start. Managers are everything. always make sure your Salon manager and you work well together!"
good,WOnderful company... as they grew more politics became apparent in promotion.  I do not wish to write this review and am really annoyed that it making this field mandatory to move on.  Enjoyed my time with the company was looking for a change and less work pressure and more balalnce
good,"Interaction with a variety of people "
good,"This is about as fun as retail can get. Mostly just the customers who can be annoying but then again, that is how retail is. Management is strict, but we get things done."
good,I enjoy working at ulta meeting new customers each day! It is a fast paced environment with new exciting promotions and products to learn about each day!
good,"Ulta is a great company to work for you are willing to work.  It is innovative, fun and always is bringing in the newest and greatest products in the industry.  "
good,"A typical day would include restocking shelves, helping customers find products they need, and working the register. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers or handling situations when busy. The most enjoyable part would be the relaxed work environment."
good,Great place for anyone looking into the cosmetics field. It is heavily centered around customer service but it's a fun environment to work in if you enjoy makeup.
good,"This was a very fun job, however, the pay was really low and I lived 45 minutes away so it was a long drive for such little pay.  I did enjoy the great discount and meeting new people. It was also a really challenging job but I enjoyed that."
good,"Management was very flexible with the schedule and were willing to work around your own personal life. The majority of the employees were female and had to always wear makeup (at least 5 visible products on their face). Everyone working there was extremely friendly and were always willing to help you out with any problem you might have. If you showed passion and love for your job, you would most likely get promoted within 3 months or whenever the position was open."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I was surrounded with (my managers and coworkers as well as the customers). The location I worked at was always fairly busy, I was also doing something which I liked. I was constantly surrounded by people that were excited about makeup which was fun. I was able to help people find things that they have grown to love and come back and rebuy which is important to me."
good,I worked at Ulta longer than any job I have ever had. I love the culture and getting to play with makeup and help customers feel beautiful. I only left because I had no room for advancement where I was.
good,It has its days . It was a fun  environment over all.  You meet a lot of people and become friends  with majority of them . Breaks we're only 30 minutes but it was enough time to eat and get back  On the sales floor
good,"Ulta Beauty has been a great place to work for me, especially as a makeup lover. Helping guests find their holy grail products is always a pleasure, and the variety of work that the job offers is nice. As a Beauty Advisor you get to cashier, work the sales floor, stock shelves, reset sections of the store, etc. You are never, ever bored! The discount is also a great perk and access to products before they hit the sales floor is always a plus."
good,my typical day at work starts out with having a chat in with my manager to talk about what we have planned for the day my management is much better the it was when I started. The hardest part of my job is that when can always be slow
good,Busy salon that is geared toward developing the clientele of their stylists. Provided excellent training on up and coming hair and make up trends biannually. Stylists work in a team environment collaborating with each other to create the hairstyles requested by our clientele.
good,"It's always something new going on at work and it is a fun place to work. Great environment to work in with amazing people. Ulta has a whole gives you opportunity to advance or if you would like to relocate, they give you that option as well."
good,"I participated in a Point of Sale system upgrade and Salon scheduling software deployment during my short time at this company..  The culture and management was very inclusive. Compensation at the entry level was a bit low for the industry at the time, but may be a good choice for someone starting out in the IT field."
good,"quick paced, but enjoyable if you are into the beauty industry. you get to be trained on certain brands to help sell. 25% discount and 50% at the salon"
good,"While working at Ulta I met many great people. The management, for the most part, was good. It could have been better. I do not want to be negative but I did have some inconveniences with them during holidays. Overall the experience was great. I learned a lot from employees that have been working there for years. I learned about so many products that we sold. My days at work would be talking to customers and answering any questions that they had, checking out their items for them, putting things back on shelves, and letting customers know about our rewards program and credit cards. The hardest part of the job was when we had truck days. I would have to go in at four-thirty in the morning to help with all the shipments we got in. We had to sort boxes to the right section of the store and then unbox and shelf all the products. The most enjoyable part was being able to learn so much about cosmetics, skin-care, and hair-care products. I also made some friends while working there."
good,"Loved my job, but it was required I work 11-7. Thats my whole day!! I have kids so I couldn't do this for long. Good and bad management experience. Not too much room for advancement."
good,The people you meet there and coworkers are friends you still call upon even after you leave. It was a fun environment with everyone always smiling and having fun.
good,"This is a great job to start off in. It is fun if you like the type of things you are selling like makeup, etc. There is not a lot of hours though and you don't make enough hours to become full time."
good,I started as a cashier and quickly advanced to management. Genuinely enjoyed working here and was sad to have to leave to go to school out of town. The management was great and helpful at all times.
good,"I honestly loved working at ULTA Beauty. It's really fun to work there. Its very competitive, and hours are based on how many people you can get to sign up for the loyalty care and credit card."
good,They gave me a chance to do what I went to school for. Being the skin therapist and working along with others gave me more knowledge in the beauty industry.
good,"work with consumer "
good,"Handled sales, returns and exchanges while offering exceptional customer service."
good,"productive work days"
good,"I had a fun time working at Ulta, because of the team I had.  Dealing with customers is always hard but that is the nature of retail.  Ulta is a very good company that is consistently growing and offering their employees great incentives.  Though they could offer a little more in pay, they make up for it in other benefits such as employee discount and 401K contribution.  Like any business, if you get a bad manager people leave, and that is what happened.  They want an older work force, but are bombarded with young employees and do not promote very quickly."
good,"I do enjoy working at Ulta. It is a great company to work for, but I do wish that there were more opportunities for all management to be full time. Since I am the merchandise manager and since I am responsible for all shipments for the entire store, I do think that I should be full time with benefits like every other manager. Rather than no benefits, and considered part time. Plus, I think corporate should send the company hours rather than cutting them most weeks. More hours make it easier for the list of things to be completed on time."
good,I loved working for Ulta Beauty. The managers were very helpful and nice. I loved the products that the business sales they are east to promote to customers.
good,Great discounts for employees if you like to buy cosmetics and such. Not enough hours given or opportunities to grow. Hardest part of the job was the lack of working hours given.
good,"While there are many great opportunities with Ulta Beauty, the company does not have good policies in place when it comes to clients cancelling and no showing. Skin is also not as heavily advertised as the rest of salon services. The access to advanced training from the International Dermal Institute is a very big perk of the job."
good,"Ulta is a fun beauty environment to work for. It does have its cons, for example having to assist as a sales floor rep throughout the whole store if you are not busy enough."
good,"Since working at ULTA, I love it! The environment is always up beat and the girls are always willing to help a customer in need. The salon is better than most ULTA salons that I have ever looked into and the managers are fantastic."
good,"Learned many techniques. "
good,"If you love working with makeup, Ulta is the job for you. It combines  your makeup skills with work making it a fun environment. It does not involve much physical labor. It is also a pretty easy job to learn"
good,always fun with a great team. Work environment is fun can be stressful at times but is always rewarding. Management always works hard for their employees
good,"I enjoy helping out customers who are looking for help about anything that ULTA has to offer. Easy going job with clear cut responsibilities. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers. Most enjoyable part would be learning about new products and giving advice/opinions to those who want help. Management is very patient and understanding. Customer service is always the most important part. Can sometimes be repetitive with daily tasks and constantly being at the register, but not a hard job to do. Hours are not the greatest, but it can be beneficial for those who are working another job or going to school."
good,Really enjoyed working here. Management was great and flexible with needs of employees. Room for growth. Great people to work with. Good discount for employees.
good,They offer a lot of training for their stylists and prestige team.  Its a fun place to work that is always evolving.  It's a warm professional work environment.
good,"I worked at Ulta for about a year and a half. I truly enjoyed my time there. However, I don't think my idea of managing went along with my store manager's idea of managing. She eventually wanted to shove me over to a role with little advancement so she could place someone she favored more in my place. That did not sit very well with me. "
good,"This job was fun while I was there, but it was just cashiering temporarily. As far as temp jobs go though it was a good starting job while i was in school"
good,"Fun place to work but not enough hours to give workers to cover more of the store. Very fasted paced, high expectations but are attainable with hard work."
good,"A typical day at Ultra Beauty is a busy, fast paced day. My position in the store is Beauty Advisor, I help customers find the right product for their skin. The management at Ultra is strict but fun, I enjoy the co-workers that I work with. The hardest part of the job is upset customers or uncomfortable situations but we always work something out. The mot enjoyable part of the job is helping women feel beautiful and power about themselves."
good,"They weren't flexible with schedules, and would call to have me fill in for others at all hours of the day. Management wasn't consistent. I learned a lot about retail and how to properly handle customers as well as sales. Hardest part of the job was dealing with particularly difficult customers who were simply having a bad day. Favorite part of the job was helping customers and seeing that I made them feel better about themselves then when the walked into the store- I really miss that."
good,"Great team of employees to work with, and good compensation for the job asked to perform.  A typical day at work was laid back and focused on customer needs.  I learned more about luxury beauty products and sales.  Management was great except the head store manager.  She was replaced while I worked there, but her replacement (whom was hired due to her friendship with the old manager) made choices which also resulted in bad consequences for customers, the store, and employees.  The culture was focused on cheerfulness and beauty, which is a fun mixture.  Hardest part of the job was the poor management of the store managers, although assistant managers were great to work with."
good,"My typical day at work is to put product on shelves, create testers for products that need to be made, apply makeup on customers and help back up at the registers. What I learned at Ulta Beauty is that you have to always be on top of things whether it's customer service or help fix and clean the store. My Managers are great, they have trained me very well to make me feel comfortable on what task that needs to be done. My managers definitely know how to talk to me about what I have done wrong on my task and how to improve on it. They notice everything I do and always appreciate and thank me for my hard work. There is not one thing that is hard about my job, I love what I do and ask my managers what else I can do when things are slow in our store. The most enjoyable part of my job is my fellow co-workers and my customers that come in regularly and actually remember me and that I can have a regular conversation with them."
good,"Vendors will come and hold makeup events which are so fun."
good,Upper Management was a hit or miss deal there were some that were wonderful and others that woke up on the wrong side of the bed often. The pay was fair and the environment was fun and energetic. I really liked this company. I learned another aspect to Management and that is attention to detail.
good,Every shift was something new and generally enjoyable. Client's come first and foremost with the expectation of getting your work completed efficiently.
good,I enjoyed my time at Ulta. At a short time working there I was promoted to management. My job consist of managing 15-20 associates and overseein the operations on the floor. Helping customer find their beuty items would have to be the best part if the job.
good,"Great place to work AND advance in IF your looking for retail management as a career. I love working here. Hours may vary due to time being given based on retail sales but if you're a hard worker with in Ulta, you'll get plenty of time to work."
good,"Ulta has a pleasant work environment with a good management team. One of the most organized companies I've ever worked for. High job security, and decent wages."
good,"I have a passion for makeup, so being able to work with makeup was my dream. I also loved working with costumers and being able to help them find good products that worked for them."
good,"A typical day at Shale Mountain is a pretty relaxed atmosphere, record keeping is easily completed each day. You are your own boss."
good,"Working part time is enjoyable. I get to meet new people and interact with customers. My day would start out in the morning having to finish the tasks that need to be completed before the store would open. Tasks would be setting up planograms for updated products or new products, restocking shelfs with excessive items that are in the stock room. Days we have shipment, would be to restock the entire store with the shipment pallets we get from the distribution centers."
good,"A typical day at work is everyone coming in, getting there work items, listening to the meeting, and going to the cart that is assigned to you.  I learned that you have to be fast when working a picking job"
good,"Great employees, work environment, supervisor. Ulta has good pay but the downside is short breaks and short notice on work hours"
good,"A typical day at work for me involved catering to every guest's unique needs, giving excellent customer service, and tasking to complete necessary store tasks such as completing planograms, setting up the weekly ad, and putting out new product. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my guests and finding out what products best fit their needs. If I can supply them with a product that will boost their self esteem, then I am thrilled and have successfully fulfilled my duties."
good,it has its ups and downs but if you dont mind low hours its fine. Not all managers are terrible to work with. I like the product but not ultas choice in managers and unwillingness to demote bad ones. they should focus more on constant traning.
good,"operational manager, performed day to day operational tasks"
good,Going company with a lot of opportunities with new store openings. Company has expanded into many new markets. Overall a great company to work for
good,The management was very supportive and understanding of each employee's situations. Felt happy and excited to go to work. However there was barely any hours ever given and there wasn't a ton of room for advancement in the company.
good,"Always an adventure, many great people and lots of different trends in make up, hair and fashion, "
good,"A typical day at Ulta requires a great personality, quick thinking, strong problem solving skills and the ability to work and learn independently. I have learned how manage my time, get things done, and provide excellent customer service at a fast pace in a high volume store. Management is both stable and supportive. My co-workers are fun people who like to get things done. The hardest part of my job is keeping my team motivated and moving in a positive direction through the all day, every day challenges that occur at a high volume store. I enjoy the atmosphere at Ulta."
good,"The management is horrible. I basically taught myself the skin treatments. My co-works were okay, most were petty and unprofessional, others were nice and professional. The hardest part was being around my co-workers that caused drama all the time. they would talk horrible about you behind you're back. The most enjoyable was getting to play around with make up all day."
good,Overall nice working environment. Customers are usually nice. Very clean environment. Usually all workers are positive and shifts go smoothly without drama.
good,"So many Lines and Beauty products to acknowledge. From hair, Make up, skincare, etc. Universal store indeed. Always learning about New Products and trainings are Amazing. Very fun & exciting"
good,Good place to learn how to properly handle customer service and get good experience with handling money. Management is easy to get along with.
good,"Supervise and oversee a $10+ million stores’ operations to drive store performance, superior guest service, and maintain operational excellence to meet or exceed established budgeted sales, control expenses, and achieve productivity goals; Hire and train new and existing staff; Motivate and coach staff to exceed daily goals on a pathway to advancement; Manage the sales floor and drive both retail and salon sales."
good,I enjoyed working at Ulta. Work for Ulta was a different matter.
good,"A typical day at work would be running around busy with multiple clients at a time all with color on their head. I learned how to work with a team very well and how to multitask, as my job had many different duties. I got along with my co-workers and many of them are still very close to me, we were a tight team. The hardest part of the job was around the holidays when the salon and store would be slammed, but we always made it work. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people, sales, and making women feel confident."
good,"I like working for this company, this was my first design job.  I was very excited and was really trying to do my best to achieved all goal they had set for me."
good,ULTA was a very fun and energetic place to work.  It was only part time with limited hours but for someone who is going to school it would be perfect. You get to learn about makeup and all of the name brands.  The management is wonderful and friendly
good,"This company is honestly one of the newest and fastest growing beauty ""industries"" I love working for Ulta, however, I am going to school full time and would like to transition into a job setting more set in my career direction.  I am majoring in business and marketing, and retail offers a lot of great experience, but I want more. If you work in the right areas this company as a lot to offer especially with promoting from within. Ulta loves and believes in having leaders that know Ulta and the products, so in the long run they are more willing to promote from within for a management opening rather than bring in an outsider."
good,"Always something to learn about color, cuts, gel nails , the hardest part was filling your booking when you didn't have clientele."
good,"Working at Ulta was a good experience for me. There will always be bad days wherever you work but the good days definitely weighed out the bad. I was a task team member so on the days that I wasn't cashiering I would helping to unload the truck shipments and then stock the shelves. It was hard work but I enjoyed it. Management was good as well. The only thing I really have negative to say is regarding the hours, but you have to expect that when working in retail. That is the reason I am looking for a different job. Being a single mom you need consistent hours. "
good,"Ulta is mecca to anyone with an interest in cosmetics, skin care, and hair. The store carries the best variety from professional products to mass products that are usually cheaper which makes it wonderful for any budget. We pride ourselves on customer service and I feel that guest get the whole package without any intimidation."
good,"Great job for people interested in cosmetics and skincare, great place to learn and grow."
good,"Maximize sales, while performing guest merchandise checkout "
good,working in a fun enviorment with a bunch a females. Being a manager was one of the best jobs I had.  Working with the stylist so they could advance was very rewarding for me.
good,"Basic day of work, come into the store. begin working as soon as you get there, even if its a few minutes early. "
good,I enjoyed my experience with ulta. The time I joined the ulta team was when a new location opened. the GM left and a associate manager resigned. The second assistant manager resigned as well and it only left me. I was able to adjust and handle the assistant management and GM positions. it was really hard to adjust but I was able to put my mind to it and do. the new management team focused on making changes. Although I out in a lot of hard work without them there my hours got cut drastically. I had to find another job.
good,I've met so many amazing clients and have learned so much working for Benefit and Ulta!
good,"When I first started with Ulta, I felt totally out of my element. I didn't know that much about makeup or lots of different beauty products. But I needed a job while I was going to school and I thought it sounded like a fun place to work. A typical day for me is coming in a few hours before the store opens to make sure all of the signage is correct, the sale prices go up, the store is clean and organized accordingly, and after the store is open, to help the guests any way I can. Ulta is like a family separated into little families. Each section is most close to each other, because that's who we see most often but we still all care about everyone. There really isn't that much inner-work related drama. The hardest part of my job is when I get a customer that expects me to know everything about all the products we sell. I realize this would be ideal but it's not always plausible. Between the people who are on staff, we do our best to keep the customer happy which is one of the things I love about working there. We all help each other when we don't know an answer or if we're interested in learning more about a product so that we can increase sales for our store.  "
good,Managing eleven salons on a daily basis. I learned how to build a clientele. Management has  a great incentive program. Co-workers were a perfect fit for company.Hardest part was trying to be at more than one place at all times.Being able to travel was wonderful.
good,"A typical day for me is cleaning my area of work and preparing my supplies for my clients (I have a few return clients but most of them are walk-ins).  I restock any make up or skin care by Benefit Cosmetics that are getting low and then I help everyone that walks in the door when I am not performing a facial wax service.  I help ladies with color matching and direction them to the areas of cosmetics or skin care that they are looking for.  I have learned a great way to multi-task, which usually is not my strong point, but I have gotten great at it.  I enjoy working with my co-workers.  I enjoy being part of a team.  It makes my easier when everyone I work with gets along with each other.  Management is great.  The hardest part about my job is I work weird hours during the week and weekends (11-8) so it makes it hard to have any sort of life.  I am totally grateful that I have a job in these hard economic days."
good,"I currently work for ULTA, and i would have to say that I love my job! But as all jobs, there are flaws with ULTA, one being the amount of money paid per hour for the amount of work you do as an employee. I am a cashier, but I also am on the floor from stocking to helping color match in the prestige area I do it all. In my state the hourly pay is only $8.00 so it is up to you if that is worth it. Ulta only provides employees with part time hours that could range from 1 day a week to possibly 5 days a week. It is fun being able to work around beauty products but I feel that there should be way more in store training on prestige brands such as bare minerals, urban decay, laura geller, LORAC, etc. These are BIG brands in the stores and if you dont know all the specifics about the brands that people want to know, it becomes hard to do your job. Overall great place to work if you are a full time college student looking for a little pocket change but I would not expect high pay or treatment in the store. You have to kiss butt to be moved up from one position to another even if you work your butt off daily above and beyond expectations."
good,"Engaged clients to ensure sales, profit, and client service objectives are met"
good,Ulta was a fun experience because I was trained with a lot of different products and gained a lot of experience and knowledge that allowed me to move to higher things. I also liked that there were no sales goals.
good,"A typical day could range determined on duty performed. I love to merchandise and process shipment. As a lead cashier there are many obstacles and challenges to overcome while dealing with difficult guests but making a true, genuine connection with one person makes it all worth it. I find that every manager has their own style of management that could be considered a good and bad thing and every co-worker has there own quirk that makes them unique. I do feel like the brand has a hard time marketing themselves to a higher end clientele.. the coupons make the shopping experience very hard for both the guest and the cashier in certain situations."
good,A day in Ulta Beauty was organized and fun. You would walk in and have no reason to stand anywhere and do nothing. There was always something to clean up and organize. My co workers felt like distant family members and I always felt if I needed help all I had to do was ask. I am proud to have been apart of such an awesome team.
good,"I learned to take control of situations and become more comfortable with my leadership style and skills. I was nervous to lead a group of such strong personalities, but I learned to trust myself and my staff. It has been some of my most rewarding work making them happy and the guests we serve."
good,They stay pretty busy and they provide all the tools you need to complete your tasks. The only difficulty I had was with catty co workers but that happens anywhere.
good,"I worked here for 10 days to set up the store. Our shifts were 8 hours long and consisted of being on our feet every minute! The managers in charge of the set up were very straight forward with the directions and were helpful in the process as well. Our tasks were to place all of the beauty products on the correct shelves with the corresponding barcodes beneath the product tags. Also, we had to set up the digital merchandise for certain brands."
good,I loved working there but the management wouldn’t communicate between each other and would schedule people last minute without notice and they didn’t have much hours to give people
good,"What you put in at ULTA you get out. I was there for many years and saw the company grow. Once you can get into management the benefits and your ""value"" increase greatly. Take that however you want. I had alot of fun and learned so much  during my time there."
good,Ulta Beauty is a great place to work at if you love all things beauty! The place gives you hands on experience with new products and more and they train you to ensure that you're 110% proficient and knowledgeable on the products so you can recommend them to future guests.
good,"It’s a great place to work if you’re passionate about the beauty industry. The biggest drawbacks are those that come with retail as a whole. Customers can be rude, and your feet get tired, and the pay isn’t great. But there is good opportunity for advancement and infinite learning experiences."
good,"If the day was slow, we would walk on the floor to help customers with their beauty needs and to also let clientele know about our salon and what services we provided. I liked that about Ulta Beauty, because we were always pushed to not stand around. Always be productive and push to continue growing as a person and in the company."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working there and was always happy to see my coworkers when I went in. There was a lot of work, but we were able to have fun while we worked. Sometimes you do feel under appreciated though."
good,I like working at ulta because there are awesome benefits and you really get to learn more about the products. I gained some confidence in my customer service skills as well by interacting with customers
good,"You can really work your way up, may stall out once you get to store management to make that jump to becoming a general manager. Unless you are willing to relocate."
good,have had a good experience in my time at Ulta. Have worked with some great management that have helped me get to the place i am at today. Would recommend this job
good,"Ulta is a great place to work if you like high pace, work that is always different and you own what you do.  You won’t like it if you want to just stand around and chat with your coworkers! It’s hard work!!"
good,"Depending on what position you are in this can be a fun place to work. Be prepared to work rather than doing makeup, since they have a salon in store you are there mainly to provide customer service to guests."
good,"A typical day would include servicing guests whether it be through sales or on the cash register. There are also a variety of shift times so it's flexible in that respect. Managers took turns being the on the floor, and they would help guide the employees on what to focus on. The hardest part is working with fussy customers, but that's just a problem with retail in general. Management will also vary by location, therefore I can't comment on the 'typical' personality type. In terms of work place culture, the majority of people help each other succeed and service guests. If you're looking to grow with a company, then this is a good place to start."
good,Ulta was a good place to work at for those who have an interest in the beauty community. You keep up to date on lots of beauty trends and maintain a good knowledge of brands. Ulta is very strict about selling their credit cards and loyalty program to customers.
good,"I enjoyed the fun fast pace atmosphere at Ulta. Many great salon benefits, the best tools provided for the salon, and great training. I had great coworkers and great management within our store!"
good,I liked it because it was fun and you get to learn a lot about makeup the only bad thing was they aren’t really flexible hours but I did love working there
good,A fun and productive workspace. Learned a lot about make up an application in learning different skin tones. A great job to work if you’re in high school or if you want to become a make up artist.
good,Everyone on the team supported each other through high stress situations. Management would support us as best as they could whenever there were problematic situations with guests.
good,"Great for all beauty products, nice people to work with. It was a great fit at the time as I enjoy working with people and different personalities. I had a productive time but felt I wanted to pursue home health care full time."
good,"It was a wonderful experience.   "
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Ulta. Although I liked the work, and many of my coworkers, the store management was terrible. I would work for Ulta again, but never in this specific role. The MSC is sort of the ""mini manager"" position. Its coded as part time, but your hours may vary between 15 to 55 a week. This position offers no benefits, no healthcare, no paid time off, and no said sick days. The biggest issue is that management sets you up for failure, if you are managing the shipment shift. You are constantly in trouble for not getting everything completed, or in trouble for keeping your team too late. Its a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" scenario, and burn out in this position happens quickly."
good,"Store management was a great team and as a Store Manager I coached and trained management team. The workplace dynamics were good, however, the hardest part of the job was the challenge to change disgruntled employees who were negative about the previous  management team.  It took time to change their opinion and I was successful within time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was changing the workplace culture and recognizing skill sets the store staff had and promoting from within."
good,If you’re in college or high school it’s a great place to work if your not management but if you’re not in school this place can not be your main source of income you would need a second job
good,A typical day at work you deal with multiple customers asking about all different brands. It helped me learn the diversity of makeup and customer needs. The management here was always there to back you up when you needed help for a difficult situation.  They also encouraged you to express yourself with your makeup and hair. I worked with very open minded and loving employees.
good,"Working for Ulta is nice/fun, however you might end up spending a lot of your check at the store. Coworker relations are wonderful. It is a very good environment and working with the customers is rarely difficult and really mostly pleasant."
good,overall can be a great place to work. Big turnover rate and have goals to make. Great discounts available for purchases. Amazing benefits offered when you can get them.
good,Productive and a fun work environment. Management wes understanding and helpful. Flexible hours. Getting cut from the schedules was a possibility to be worried about.
good,It was a good and fun experience to work at Ulta. The management and the coworkers were friendly and easy-going. It was easy to help customers once you knew where everything was organized and placed. The hardest parts of working at Ulta was the managers cutting hours when they were over there quota enjoyed every aspect of the job especially the people I have met. T
good,Ulta has the very best employee training for new stylists or stylists looking to increase their current knowledge.  The environment is very dependent on whom you work with.  I have had both amazing experiences working for the company and some really horrible ones. The lack of flexibility within the position was one of the main reasons I left.
good,My peers and management were open and honest about performances and sales goals as well as improvement critique. Managers will let us know to ask them for more product knowledge and to utilize our online training. They will put us aside to talk about our weekly progress and how we can grow.
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, who wouldn't love to work around their favorite beauty brands all day? Definitely enjoyed working for this company, but it wasn't all fun and games. We were pushed to meet goals, including credit card sign-ups. There were times especially during their big annual sales where I would have to be at the store to 'set-up'/decorate before 5 am and times where I didn't get home until after midnight from taking down displays. Overall, it was a fun job but definitely more to it than just the stereotypical 'selling-makeup'."
good,Working for Ulta was one of my favorite jobs I have ever had. I'd really like to work for the conpany again and I am really trying to. I enjoyed the job a lot because the beauty industry is a place where I have a lot of passion.
good,An enjoyable place to spend my time and get paid for it. I actually enjoy coming in for work which is something I never thought I would be able to say.
good,"I was a full-time employee but was only scheduled to work for 8 hours a week. I had to drive for almost an hour (even though many other employees lived in Kailua) every Friday morning to clock in at 5 a.m. just to work for four hours that day and drive home for almost another hour. Not to mention that other full-time employees had the same amount of hours as me or a tad more, and they were paid more. "
good,This Job has been great for the last 5 years. It is a job where being a strong multi tasking is a MUST. Lots of communication from the Company but it is always growing and changing which is great if you constantly like to learn and grow your knowledge.
good,"I believe Ulta is a great place to work, however unless you are the GM (General Manager), I don’t feel like it’s a job you can support yourself financially from."
good,"I only worked at Ulta in West Des Moines, IA for a couple months part-time. For the short period of time I worked there, it was perfectly fine! Not the best place I have ever worked but I would still recommend it to my friends and family! When I was in training, they did a very good job and I believe I was trained correctly. Employees were very friendly and made working there very enjoyable. Management was very nice as well. The main manager was very intense and pushy in a way, but I dont think it was in a bad way, she just wanted people to do their jobs and do it right!"
good,"It was fine. A lot of gossip in all areas, as well as lower pay and threats to cut my hours when I’ve only been here a month. I would stay if I got paid enough to survive on it, but I can’t."
good,You must be a self starter and stay out of drama.   You can make a great wage if you are a seasoned stylist.  The store manager and Salon manager will make or break your expierience
good,I was with the company for almost three years when I transfered locations to open a new store and be closer to family. I didn't agree with my new Store Manager's training tactics and was severly disappointed in her HR knowledge.
good,Really nice if you are looking to build skills and clientele. Company overall works to help you succeed. You really can build your business if you have an effective managers support.
good,"I love that I manage my boutique on my own.  If I ever need help or have questions I will go to management or my Clinique rep and they will help.  I love that it is hands on, applying, skin care and makeup. Also building my clientele because they trust in what I'm doing.  The best part of my job is working on clients and seeing them leave happy and confident"
good,Being ready to help and serve any customers needs learning how products are stocked and handled very upbeat place to work nice and very friendly customers hardest part of the job is having to destroy makeup when it needs to be damaged being able to help the customer find just what they need it's the most enjoyable part of the job
good,Flexible with your schedule and the managers make sure to meet with employees to see how things are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interact with customers and the flow of the store during the holiday. It sure does get busy but makes time goes by faster.
good,"I have been working at Ulta for 2 years now and I love it. The managers at my location are wonderful and helpful and want you to succeed! They are very flexible with scheduling, I am a theatre major so I have a very limited scheduling, and they were more than happy to work it all out. The only downside of working at Ulta is that sometimes the . Some times it will be a week where you are working for 19 hours then it will be a week of 5 hours."
good,"I loved the fast pace nature and the work environment, but if you're looking for insurance/dental, only work here if you plan to become a manager. Otherwise, the rare free product (2-3 a yr. maybe) and discounts will have to suffice."
good,"great place to work, management is okay but definitely could be better. overall my favorite job so far. nothing to complain about but hope you like being organized bc it is a huge part of ULTA."
good,Only reason im leaving is due to the fact dc is shutting down because of a closer warehouse built in CA. Otherwise I probably would have retired from this company great place to work.
good,I really enjoyed working at Ulta. Over all I was very happy with management and the experience I had working there. Everyone acted as a team to get things done. I left due to lack of hours being available for my position.
good,"I've enjoyed working at the Ulta Beauty Distribution Center in Greenwood, IN.  I wish that there was better opportunities for advancement.  In the past few months, more and more Supervisors are being hired from outside of the company, rather than promoting associates from within who have the right qualifications and direct experience.  And many Supervisors get looked over when they are a prime candidate for open Manager/PC positions.  Instead, they are stuck being a Supervisor, but get shuffled around to the less desirable shifts (weekends, nights)."
good,It's a great work place to advance in...its a fast pace and challenging at times. You can learn alot at ulta and get trained in multiple departments through out the distribution center
good,"For the most part, working at Ulta was a dream experience. You're surrounded by makeup all day long and you get to help people look and feel amazing. Even during the frustrating times and drama between coworkers, Ulta was great because you got to watch a woman's confidence go up as you blended contour or filled in eyebrows and enhanced the beauty you so clearly saw when they sat in your chair. Plus the boss is amazing. Best boss I've ever had. She bent over backwards and would give the shirt off her back for any one of her employees."
good,"Its a fast pace working environment, friendly environment, management is very friendly and understanding. It's a very nice place to work at. Pay and benefits are good"
good,"This job is basically amazing aside from not many opportunities to advance and not enough prestige training. Management is fairly good, could use better training in my opining. The general manager is the best part of the job, she is absolutely amazing,"
good,i have been a part of the ulta team for 9 years and its the best job so far. fun and relax place to work. my supervisor is a person anyone would like to work for. good benefits and good vacation as well.
good,One thing I could say about Ulta is that when new products were to hit the sales floor we would all work as a team and make it very successful and a one of a kind experience for the customer.
good,I had an amazing manager and team.  When a new store openned the majority of the team and the store manager moved to a new store and we got new management.  Kind of a tough transition but we made it work.
good,"Loved working here. Great managers, pretty flexible schedule, everything is always changing, working in the beauty industry is really fun and they give plenty of opportunities"
good,"I love working here, but you shouldn't try to get this job if you aren't a positive upbeat person willing to put 110% into your job. It is a fun environment but you are expected to hit your goals(RETAIL). As a beauty advisor you are expected to get people to sign up for credit cards. The majority of management is awesome. Hours do change week by week and if you don't work hard you wont get as many hours. Also discount is ONLY in the store not online, which I think that should change, but that's at a corporate level."
good,"Typically fast paced during, sales, weekends, and holidays. Pay was above minimum wage but could've been a bit better. Worked part time, but could've used more hours No benefits as a cashier other than store discounts."
good,loved working for benefit and having the opportunity to grow and learn and be taught skills that I was able to take with me to my next job placement!!
good,Ulta was a fun and knowledgeable place to work. I learned a lot about being a leader and a role model to those around me. The management team made each employee feel welcomed and appreciated.
good,"My job in tails answering emails from stores, field members, corporate employees and vendors.  Also, working on your queue of work requests the store submits.  For some work requests we have to reach out to the stores to ask follow-up questions.  My department is in charge of badge access for each employee.  To work in this position you need to be good at mutual tasking and time management.  For my department, we have monthly birthday celebrations. My manager is there to help when you have questions."
good,"I love working here, the customers are usually pleasant and the management teams are great. One big con is only having your schedule a week prior, it makes it difficult to make any plans tat far ahead of time. It's also difficult when some guests are rude and act out, but that's with any job."
good,"I liked working at Ulta, most of the managers were great. I didn't agree with the way they handled damaged/returned items that unused. Overall, a good place to work."
good,I really enjoyed this job working hands-on with customers they needed help on make up tips and applications I would go back to this sort of job any day it’s also easy to do as a part-time job while you’re in school as is what I did !
good,A typical day at Ulta was assisting and greeting customers. The hardest part of the job was doing color matches because its nerve wrecking if you select the wrong shade for the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was asking the customers about their skin types and recommended certain products for each of those particular skin type.
good,"A typical day at work is fixing and perfecting shelves, answering phones and making appointments, helping customers find products, and using the cash register."
good,"I have worked at Ulta several times over the past couple of years. I love the environment and my team. We get pretty close, and we strive together. The only issue is that you work long hours and do not get raises very often."
good,coworkers were always there for emotional support but management wasn't a good ear to talk to. the brushed things often. The promos from the third parties were very helpful with their brands.
good,"If you love make up, this is your place to be. To be surrounded by make up is great because you get to see what is new in stock.  If you love helping people make decisions regarding make up or giving advice this is a great opportunity"
good,"Work daily is high pased and in depth research. I have learned how to stay organized and what it's like to work for a real company.  The culture at Ulta Beauty has high standards and is a comfortable environment to work in."
good,"It's a fun and fast paced environment with a lot of great benefits, not just health, but opportunities to learn about makeup and skincare."
good,"I worked mostly part-time night shifts and it was a stress-free, enjoyable job to have, everyone was nice and helpful with everything throughout my journey."
good,"I was impressed by the classes they gave us for new trends. The benefits were very good and I enjoyed the employee discounts. The salon got busy and there was enough for everyone to do. It was easy to build a clientele and in about 6 months I had a full chair. As a manager, I liked mentoring the new stylists. That was most rewarding."
good,"Depending on your General Manager and your staff, Ulta can be a great place to work.  I had the same team for over 3 years and we ran a top notch store.  We had more turn over in District Management than store management.  Our team worked great to make sure family/work was balances.  Not all stores work that well, but our did. Only left after last DM was hired.  Disrupted a store that was producing big numbers by seperating the management and letting others go."
good,"Over all it was slow, never busy. Hours were very minimal and very few staff on the  schedule at one time.Training was very detailed but way to long and require travel. Not willing to help me relocate when needed."
good,it was a good job but they was a little unprofessional I like working at ulta the money was good the benefits and all that....I just hate the way they did me
good,My position at Ulta really helped me learn how to communicate with the public and help me learn how to put me best effort into everything I do and stay positive with all customers no matter the circumstance.
good,"Growing Company - Good Company to work for. Opportunity to Progress. The best part of the company is the culture. Hardest part is collaboration with corporate partners and accountability,"
good,Fun atmosphere to work in. Understanding store manager that was willing to work around family conflicts. Great discount on all products and services provided by store.
good,"The ULTA I work at is new, located in a new complex. Business has yet to pick up so there isn't much to say yet, since it still feels like an introduction. Especially now with the holidays over, and only one shift a week."
good,"I'm seasonal BA. I like it because its busy and fast paced at times. The staff is nice, we have a very diverse crew. They did an awesome job with training me before holiday rush."
good,"I only worked there for a short time, but enjoyed it.  I am comfortable in the beauty industry and so this was a good fit for me at the time.  However, I now need to seek full time employment."
good,Ulta is a good camping to work for. Definetly learned a lot from fellow managers. At times was a bit trying although overall a learning experience. Loved the experience!
good,"I don't feel like I can give a quality review, being that I worked there for such a short period. However, it was a fun environment to work in but it was hectic at times. Occasionally I had to deal with random schedule changes, showing up to a scheduled shift to find out i was taken off the day before and had no idea. Other than that, I would work there again just not as a seasonal employee."
good,A good company to work for if you love beauty and are exploring the retail industry. Never had any issues with coworkers; I was lucky to have a great team.
good,A typical workday changes as the amount of customers fluctuate. I have sharpened my communication and customer service skills. The workplace culture is amazing at my location. The hardest part of working for Ulta is being asked to reach sales goals that are often hard to reach.
good,"I loved helping others, but I could not do a full makeover due to not being licensed, which is why I left to go to beauty school full time. depending on the management, work was good, always seeing the latest products come out. busy days were always in effect, which made the day go by faster. I loved my job, but the salon was where my heart belonged. retail is something that is not a long term goal, especially when unloading truck shipments, not worth the pain in my back for that kind of pay, regardless of the discounts."
good,"it is a very fast paced job but you learn quick, the only downside is the hours for a part time worker. As a beauty advisor you get a 25% off retail and 50% off salon services which is pretty decent."
good,"Ulta was a productive place where you constantly are busy, but the pay is very low. The gratis was amazing, you constantly receive new products for now launches."
good,"I liked ulta, because of hours, overtime, free makeup, clean warehouse. Reason for leaving ulta was that I found a better oppurtunity working with us army."
good,If you are in the right store it can be a very fun place to work. Ulta as a corp is a very good company with a great mission.  Some work needs to be done at the store level to ensure the right culture is being promoted among the whole team.
good,ULTA is a great start for hairstylist that are just coming in the business. ULTA can help you build clientele quickly you just have to be ready and willing.
good,I am a cashier lead and also a beauty advisor you don't have to know how to do make up when you work there because it is a great place to learn for beginners
good,"Working at Ulta is very fast-paced, and employees work together to maintain customer satisfaction while reaching all necessary goals. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job is advancing to a higher position. For me, it seems my work goes unnoticed, especially at times where I am exceeding expectations. Nevertheless, Ulta has a wonderful atmosphere. Working with new people everyday is one of the most enjoyable aspects as a Beauty Advisor. Every customer has his or her own needs, making some days more challenging than others. My communication skills improved with time, and I gained more knowledge of makeup application and skincare."
good,It's a great job.  I love helping people find the perfect makeup within Lancome. I just wished the store i worked at was a little bit more organized and had a better plan of action to work together and succeed.
good,"I truly did love working at Ulta Beauty as it's one of my favorite stores. The management was absolutely amazing. They did whatever possible to make schedules work for employees and truly care about the Beauty Advisors (cashiers). The employee discount is really nice and is really a fun place to work. "
good,"Working at Ulta.. Hmm, lemme see. It's fun for like the first couple of weeks and then they drop your hours. I went from 25 hours a week to almost none. Don't get me started on the pay. It's not that impressive for all the stuff employees are expected to do. The employee discount is 25%, which is pretty cool. Gratis isn't guaranteed. It's mostly just for hard workers and people who know how to schmooze management."
good,"Great place to work if you love retail and working with cosmetics. However, I recommend having a second job if you have real bills to pay! Hours are not plentiful in most locations."
good,Honestly this job gives you what you give. Most days I've spent it learning about beauty. They assist you as much as possible. Hardest part about the job would be asking questions.
good,I was a seasonal associate that helped set up the store before the grand opening. I learned so much about the cosmetics and skincare that they sell. The management is fantastic. I enjoyed this job so much and would love to work for this company again. The CEO is an amazing woman that I hope I have the chance to meet someday. I loved doing mini-makeovers for the customers as well as learning so much about the industry that I love so much.
good,Its a good company in a competitive industry that is still growing. Beauty is taking over and ULTA is poised to lead the charge in that endeavor. Great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, but the lack of communication definitely was a downfall. Some workers-workers, or workers-managers were not on the same page at times."
good,"Ulta was great and taught me a lot about sales , we had some difficult people like in every job but it was nothing too bad. I learned a lot about beauty and the industry and was able to get a lot of practice and meet some amazing people. the hardest part of shipment days but nothing too bad"
good,left cause I have a degree. Was not offered anything and was not interested in any available advances. Would not pay me for forklift driving. was driver for 4 months and never gave me my forklift pay.
good,"I usually just restock, organize products and the warehouse, clean and take out the trash. i learn more about retail with every shift. Management is good but the schedule system isn't that great, i never know the next week till a day before, they sometimes schedule us without letting us know, and there is no online way to see your schedule. the hardest part of the job is probably the schedule because it is unpredictable, i prefer a full time job like a 8am-4pm or 9am-5pm and working holidays. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people i work with, everyone there is nice and fun to work with and sometimes we bring snacks for everyone because i work early morning shifts so the managers treat us sometimes by bringing donuts or bagels."
good,"I loved working at Ulta Beauty. The environment was welcoming and friendly. My team is an amazing group to work with always making sure that we are excelling and progressing in the work place. Even though I do not work at Ulta Beauty any longer, I know I can trust the team of amazing people there to continue to shine."
good,"A typical day at work at Ulta consisted of keeping shelves stocked, answering customer questions regarding beauty product, running the cash register, etc. I learned a lot of different product knowledge, how to communicate with different kinds of people, and about different brands of hair and makeup products. Management was probably my least favorite part of the job. Certain managers were amazing and a joy to be around, but 2 out of the 4 made shifts unenjoyable. The hardest part of the job was unruly customers. It could be a bit challenging at time to try and explain certain things to some customers, primarily in regards to store policies about returns, exchanges, etc. Overall, working at Ulta was a fun experience. It was any girl's dream job who loves all things hair and makeup!"
good,"Fun place to work, and lots of things to try. Great place for makeup lovers. All he managers are equally good. Overall the job isn't hard, but, it can get overwhelming at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is the makeup because I love it."
good,"I enjoy the environment working at Ulta. The discounts are amazing and the amount of products are great. I also enjoy the customers that I help while I'm there, they are extremely eager to learn!"
good,"Minimal hours as a part time worker, but very understanding managers and flexible scheduling. Coworkers are very nice and helpful. You must have an interest in beauty to enjoy working here"
good,I loved working for company. always had out going people. always able to help people out by making them feel good. always could up sale. got free graddas every other day to try out. everyone was easy to get a long and work with or for. great team work
good,"It was an amazing experience to work with Ulta in Flower Mound, TX. My typical day was opening up the store ensuring that all work stations were clean and fully stocked for the day. If any signs or promotions needed t be updated I would get them done before the store opened.  My direct overhead manger was absolutely amazing and ensured that received fair treatment and pushed for my promotions. The environment was very nice, I was able to create many relationships with customers and coworkers. Truthfully the most difficult part was meeting the appointment requirements for in store appointments, but i would push to make our goals. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to meet and interact with such a wide variety of customers and see them walk away with a smile."
good,All employees along with management were passionate about their job and quite knowledgeable. Everyone is helpful and super friendly. The discount and company sales were a great bonus.
good,A typical day consists of lots of tasks and constantly managing all aspects of the business. The guests is the focus but there are a lot of projects and tasks that happen that you would guess occur from the outside looking in. There is a lot of inventory constantly being moved and revamped and its important to constantly be merchandising.
good,I applied thinking that I would be walking around looking cute given people my opinions about makeup all day but I was mistaken. Working at ulta is tough especially when we had to stock and got large shipments. Most mornings we would have to come in at 5am or 6am when the store didn't open until 10am or 11am. It was brutal during christmas time to make sure the store was in order but overall I loved working there. The managers all serve a purpose and are so sweet!  We hosted a lot of events at our store and got 25% off of everything in the store and 50% off of anything in the salon and brow bar. We didn't really get gratis unfortunately but you really don't have time to sit and think about that.I had a big issue with hours because I was getting maybe 12hrs and with the 8/hr pay that wasent squat. I would also get sent home early some days I would be happy but most time no because obviously I needed my hours. On the flip side when I never left on time I would be told to say 2 1/2 hrs late which is annoying!!!!! but... Working at ulta is definitely not a cake walk but I liked it and would do it again but change my availabity and definitely more pay!
good,A typical day at ulta depending on what you do there is you get to work and head up to the registers to be chatted in by a manager. They basically tell you what the plans are for the day and the sales also what they expect of you. You spend your day rining people up and helping customers find the products that they need. There wasn't anything to hard about this job. I really enjoyed the fun outfits I got to wear and having my makeup fun and pretty everday.
good,its okay but needs to pay more when it comes to doing certain task and other duties Sephora get $10 starting so they have some comp overall great experience here
good,I loved the atmosphere and the coworkers I had however the management was poor. For my first interview I was asked three questions as she told me she didn't prepare for anything. The clientele were awful and to get a thirty minute break you had to work for many hours.
good,I enjoy working for Ulta because I get to work with people that has the same passion as I. I also love to see guests face you help them the exact product they want.
good,"This is a great place to work if you like being busy! "
good,Ulta is a great place to work if you're truly passionate about beauty and helping people achieve their best look and stay up to date on all the latest beauty products/trends. Only drawback is pay and hours are sparse.
good,"if your trying to move up in the beauty field its an okay start, not the best. low on hours, could use better management. amazing products but messy stores."
good,"My typical day at work was the same as most retail businesses, but the thing that made me enjoy my job is my passion for the beauty industry. I loved helping customers find their perfect makeup look, color, etc. it felt like shopping with a friend."
good,"This place is a great place to be at if you love informing others of beauty products. Management is great and so are co-workers."
good,Ultra is a great company to work for and you learn a lot. Management is very respectful. Great atmosphere and everyone is great. Everyone works as a team.
good,only worked there like 2 months they don't give many hours to part timers its not hard just the typical retail job. I would just go into work and be on the register and putting products away
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Ulta Beauty. I would recommend for individuals interested in working in the make-up field and want to get their foot in the door. It was great experience for me overall learning retail, customer interaction and playing with new make-up. It was part-time for any employee who wasn't a manager. Moving up in the business I believe would take a long time. The only negative was that their was hardly any advancement or growth."
good,"Everyone was professional and gave great customer service. I assist customers, distribute merchandise and served my clients. The hardest part of work would have to be trying to apply makeup to customers.My most enjoyable part of work was doing hair."
good,"I worked for Benefit at Ulta. Benefit, Lancome, and now Clinique hire associates to represent that brand in that store. Those associates- aside from management- are the only ones who will receive full-time and steady hours. You also get paid a few dollars more an hour working for these brands, but the jobs are harder to come by. At Benefit, I was able to make my own schedule for my appointments. I used an alternating A/B week schedule. "
good,The company is not paying well for the jobs employees do. Can not make a good living at ulta if live in a big city. Work life balance is ok. Some managers are great some are not. District managers don't really care about growth.
good,"I absolutely love working for Ulta. From the awesome people I get to work with to the amazing products and services this company provides, I have enjoyed building my career with this team day in and day out. I have attended every class offered within my district to keep my skills up to date, appreciate my management staff and love the feeling of accomplishment when my guests leave happy. It's been an amazing experience to work with such great people while building a clientele and getting my name out there."
good,"Like any retail job it has its ups and downs."
good,"I love to put out shipments because I love seeing new and old products. Love to know more about make up and hair products and skin care. I love to help customer find what they like to use daily for their make up, hair, and skin."
good,"Greeting costumers, having one on one interactions with clients. Making big sales and educating and informing the client on current beauty trends and techniques. I have learned to be time efficient while still having the customer leaving happy and informed on how to use their new products. So there are no returns. "
good,"Working for Ulta was a very great experience. My coworkers and manager, even the customers were all so friendly and cheerful. Was probably my favorite job I have worked for so far. The only downfall to this position is they did not pay me enough to dress in professional attire and attend work meetings."
good,It was a fun place to work at. They use to provide us with the best training and tools that they had at the time. They compensated us for our work by taking us on outings and bonuses. The training was great and enjoyable and I learned a lot about business from the time that I was an employee
good,"I have always loved to help the guest with whatever it is they are looking for or may have questions or concerns about."
good,Mostly busy which is good. Lots of variety of people come into ulta to shop. Management and coworkers are friendly and helpful. I enjoy working with beauty products.
good,A typical workday includes creating a fun atmosphere to work. The most challenging is finding exactly what type of personal items the guest is looking for.
good,"I like working at Ulta, the job is easy and my co-workers are nice. I enjoy working at Ulta because I like helping people find the products that they need."
good,I loved working at Ulta it was an ideal place of business that i was lucky enough to get hired at.
good,"I love working at ulta, I just need a higher level of pay in order to pay my bills without working a second job."
good,I would stock the products that would come from the trucks. The hardest parts were when we were understaffed and we would have a large shipment of products arriving. Dealing with my coworkers was the most enjoyable part
good,ULTA has provided me the ability to learn so much about the beauty industry without having a cosmetology license. It has been a great place to learn from my coworkers as well as our loyal customers. Must be customer driven and willingness to help and suggest to the clientele.
good,"The work day way routine which is fine, I really cant think of anything that I really learned, little differences maybe. Management was good, alittle tough at times which they need to be. New business so its a little rough at times  I guess for them. Co-workers were the worst there is no type of team work, None, Thats the hardest part of the job, the co-workers, got along fine with all but no team work which I feel is very important."
good,learned  alot in sales and customer services. This company does a lot of training in product knowledge with is good they like educating there employees on product.
good,"I loved working at Ulta. I had a great mamnger, loved all the girls. I stopped working only because at that time in my life the salary was not worth the added resposnsiblities I had at home, being a mom, housekeeper, and care giver to an elder parent."
good,"When busy season can be a great place to work at, not very many opportunities for advancement or even full-time positions"
good,"I learned working here that you have to be efficient, and well organized."
good,"The Management is great, very laid back environment, lots of gratis and free make- up for doing a good job."
good,The opportunity to make someone feel beautiful and embrace their own individual beauty is something I love. I got to teach and educate individuals on whatever they want to learn. Getting to develop a friendship with the costumer and developing clientele. The management was always very understanding and got a long great together. 
good,"had a fun time working there,lerned a lot of skills there, great place to work on your customer service skills"
good,"Nice place to work. Everyone usually in happy, working mood and that's important."
good,"While working at Ulta, a typical day would be stocking shelves and organizing the overstock of products. We would focus on a section, such as Mass Cosmetics, and short by brand to then put everything in it's appropriate place. I learn that there is a lot of work put into setting up and opening a store. There are also many products that I was not aware existed. The management team was nice, but very stressed out. The environment was very frantic. My co-workers were wonderful. We all got along and worked nicely together. The hardest part of the job was trying to ask the management questions while they were running around. It was hard to be sure you were doing thing correctly. The best part of the job was seeing the store come together. It is very cool seeing the process and being apart of that process to open a store."
good,"Ulta is a good place to work. A typical day would be a five hour shift for any non management employee. For store stock shifts, I would unload truck and stock the shelves. If a truck did not come in that day I would set planograms, process damaged items, send recalled items back and other various tasks. Management is open to anything you would like to tell them. They are very flexible with your schedule, as well."
good,"From a District Manager who was always supportive and allowed for open lines of communication, to the Management Team, full time and part time employees who supported me, working long hours of labor intensive tasks- this one was of the finest groups I have had the honor of working with."
good,"this company has taught me so much, i have grown as an adult so much faster because of all the knowledge they have come to me with.i love this company but there comes a time when the luxury of having a great job that doesnt pay enough is not good for your life style anymore."
good,"as a manager, gives great freedsom to coach your team in the way of the well defined ulta culture. good communication umongst all mangers of the business not the employees. Great manager training!"
good,"Ulta is a great place to work for those looking for a part time job maybe while going to school. Management is very flexible with your schedule and is willing to work with you. It's not all about makeup and beauty. There is a lot of work that goes on during closed hours. Shipment is at 4am to stock shelves to make sure the store is at its best to keep customers happy. I really enjoyed working there and met so many great people. If you are willing to work early mornings and late nights, Ulta is a great fit for you!"
good,My experience was good. I was very good at my job. We got a lot of over time which was nice. Some over time is mandatory so keep that in mind like if you have family.
good,This is a great place to work if you love people. Each day your shift is filled with building connections with people. Its also a great place to work if you are about driving sales and making goals. My two main focuses when I am working in a retail setting.
good,My experience working with Ulta beauty is very fun and easy job.everyone there is vary nice and helpful when ever you need help and the other thing I like is that my fist week of work there they come by and check up and she if u need help with anything just because I was new to the job and there work environment is vary nice and clean
good,"I loved working at Ulta Beauty! There's a lot of room for growth. It's extremely family oriented and I loved the people I worked with. I had an amazing general manager for the most part but towards the end that completely changed. I wish it hadn't, I wouldn't loved to stay and further my career."
good,"Its easy to get on the job but you do need to have a professional resume. Be on time and dont miss days and you'll move up quick in the company."
good,Always changing environment. Made new friends and met a new customer base. Had to ability to stock shelves and train ew employees which was rewarding and beneficial.
good,"I enjoy my fellow coworkers. They believe in inclusion, having a diverse group employees. If we are not sure about a brand or product we help each other out. Sometimes there are 2 of us who help one customer, which makes the customer happy."
good,"Great seasonal job, filled with lots of opportunities and a place to grow. The pay is great, employee discounts included. The staff is super friendly."
good,Flexible with hours. Good job to have as a student and if you are interested in makeup. The pay is good and easy to move position up if you are a diligent worker.
good,"I should have received a raise and a key holder position but at the time, there was a little game of favorites going on. The manager also was keeping all the gratis for herself and her other employee manager friend and was not very nice to me and a couple other employees."
good,"I adored working with my team and thoroughly enjoyed the work I did (resetting planograms, stocking, truck, ect.). My manager was great at choosing tasks that were well suited for each individual person (ie. She took me off the cash wrap because I was better on the floor). Overall a good experience that I miss."
good,Ulta is a very good company to work with. I worked there as a contractor from a Vendor.I did not feel any discrimination. I worked there on ecommerce system upgradation.
good,I have nothing to say about this company. I worked for them but my time was cut short because of a few misunderstandings. Wish I could had stayed for longer than I actually worked there.
good,"The job was fun and I enjoyed working there for the most part. I enjoyed the work environment, but felt as if the management of my store in specific is lacking."
good,"Everyday is never the same"
good,Ulta was a fast paced environment good place to work. Not to stressful and plenty of room to grow if you wanted to. During peak season people get frustrated with the hours but that is the buisness.
good,"Good job to work if you like beauty. "
good,They do not pay you enough to live off of. And refuse to work with your schedule. If you need extra support they typically do not give it when it comes to needing time off or needing more hours.
good,"Aspiring to go get my NYS Esthetics license.  Looking forward to a FT career working in an Ulta Salon.  Unfortunately, the only issue I have working at Ulta is that I can't get a FT position in almost 6 months.  I love the culture, management, and Company.  But surviving as a single mother of two on Long Island is impossible.  Hoping education will move me into a  FT position so I can enjoy my career, as well as, the Company."
good,Loved everyone I worked with and the managers were great. The computers are easy to learn. The only thing I didn't like were the early morning (5am) stocking shifts. But it was overall an easy job.
good,As with any retail company the day can be busy/slow within a matter of minutes. As MSC I’m mainly behind the scenes of the store sorting and organizing products from shipment or doing planograms.
good,"At work, I was able to connect with the customers through helping them find what they were looking for. I loved getting to help people find what they were looking for, and helping them with any problems they had."
good,Great benefits and advancements. Loved working there. Manager was excellent. It was there that I decided that my education wasn’t done. Makeup discounts were amazing. The floor associates were great.
good,While I worked at Ulta my team was awesome. I never really had any issues with coworkers or any management staff. My team was vey interactive and did many group bondings and trainings with other stores. I was able to not only build a business relationship with my team but also some personal friendships.
good,"I would work in a beauty supply store again I just choose to work full time "
good,My experience in this company was exciting and full of development. There was a variety of skills that I was able to learn and the people there were very helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working there very much! i loved the classes, so informative! Also very great incentives for salon staff (you received free facials and got your hair done for free!) "
good,I had an amazing time working at Ulta Beauty. I enjoyed my co-worker's company and the management team. They provided plenty of communication when dealing with scheduling. The only downside was the hourly wage.
good,Great place to work and learn. Great culture.  Promote from within. Inclusions and diversity is prominent.  Great learning.  Involvement of management is very good.  Succession planning and development is good.
good,"It was a very friendly environment. The training at my particular location could have been a little better. However, my time here was great. these are very nice ladies."
good,"I learned a lot while I worked here about skin care and makeup just via osmosis. I really became close with all of my coworkers and I am still friends with them even after I stopped working there! It's a good place to work if you have an interest in cosmetics. Seeing as it is a female dominated workplace, if you appreciate girl power it's just icing."
good,"Was a very great work environment for me. Team work very oriented,as well for supervising managers. Everyone was willing to be great team members when help was needed."
good,Ulta is what you make it. Great discounts but tedious work. Truck and ad shifts are tedious and get passed up a lot but are the most fun. Cashier shifts can be difficult if you're the only person.
good,"Especially great place to work for hair dressers. Great benefits for full-time employees. Awesome discount. Worked here before they went public, things changed a bit after that. If you want a career path with them, make it known, they are not going to beg you and hold your hand. But, they will help if that's what you want."
good,"Great place to learn about makeup, Great staff, learning opportunity for everyone to enjoy, Great benefits, fun place to meet new people, friends for life."
good,Stocking was not hard at all. The atmosphere was fun. A typical day was to come in and get right to work to get the store opened on time. The managers were great.
good,"A day at work consisted of working with customers to ensure customer satisfactory, advising them of promotional offers and makeup selections. I  would also perform makeup applications in accordance to the customers desires. I set and designed new displays to make products appealing to customers.  As well as operating the register, I also performed various tasks that the manager desired. I learned the most about how to be a proficient sales women by the means of an enthusiastic and resilient attitude, identification of daily goals, and up-selling product. My favorite part of my job at Ulta was makeup application and display designing as they both allowed me to express my creative outlook."
good,"I enjoy working with the public in this capacity.  It is fun way to meet new people while providing clients with extraordinary service. My location has the unique profile of feast and famine as ""snowbirds"" come and go. Clients can book appts. online as well as by phone. "
good,"Ulta allows you to express creativity through cosmetics. For many, cosmetics is a bonding experience and Ulta is the ultimate supplier for prestige and mass cosmestics."
good,fast paced clean environment. paid lunch with plenty of time off for dr apt and or other reasons. wiliness to work with you when need time off. good benefits.
good,Enjoyed my time at Ulta but was only a stepping stone to my career ahead. I would recommend this place to new comers wanting to explore retail and the sales profession.
good,"A typical day at work would include stocking, organizing, greeting and fulfilling the needs of customers on a timely, yet balanced schedule. The hardest part about working for Ulta is unloading damaged shipments. The most enjoyable part is bringing back prior customers and seeing how happy we can truly make them as a team."
good,"The job was pretty okay the pay wasn’t worth it due to the demands of the job "
good,"I really enjoyed working there, and having such a large team working together at once. It was helpful having headsets to communicate around the store and mention and tips and deals going on. The only struggle I had was when our corporate house got cut by 100 hours. Both workers and managers hours were cut greatly. I shortly put in my two weeks after because I wasn’t making enough hours as needed."
good,"Its a brand new store/ location. Loved working there, the people were great. Very understanding of emergency situations. Great management team. and very flexible scheduling."
good,"So I’m the skin therapist at my location and I LOVE working with the people I work with BUT it’s frustrating most of the time. For example, I have been in the industry for about a year now and my clientele is absolutely the WORST. the starting pay is right above minimum wage, it’s really hard to commission out and make more money and I feel like the store I work at cares MORE about the cosmetologist than both cosmetologist AND esthetician. Like I said I absolutely love this job and I’m really hopeful after all the changes in the store are done, I’ll start getting busier BUT if you’re JUST starting out, I’d pass..."
good,"At Ulta they have opportunities for growth. Great work place environment. Safety is very important, they have a safety committee. Great warm ups to start the day right and recognition. They strive for a work culture that everyone liked. There was overtime for more departments than another which was good and bad. Working as a supervisor I was given the opportunity to improve certain areas and succeeded."
good,Big workplace with a lot of workers from all sorts of departments. Sometimes fast paced place to work in. Fun incentives and prizes for reaching goals.
good,"Working in the salon is rewarding, if you put in the work and understand the business aspect. Flexible schedule for part-timers and easy to re-locate to another state."
good,"Aside from a few minor issues, Ulta is a great company to work for. If you work hard and take initiative, there is plenty of room for advancement. It was a lot of fun working there."
good,"Good place to work. Benefits are more than fair in comparison to other distribution companies in the area."
good,my overall experience at ulta was ok the pay was the only thing that i had to complain about sometimes things would be out of order and some people wouldnt really speak about it or leave things to the manager.
good,I love my job! Highly recommend for people who would like to work part time. Flexibility when it comes to working with your schedule. Management is great at communicating the goals of the day.
good,I rather enjoyed working at ulta. They ad strict goals they wanted to reach and they did what they could as a team to make the goals work. They are very organized and friendly.
good,"A typical day included working as a cashier, helping people find their desired product, giving the best possible customer service that we could provide."
good,Ulta is a good job to have if you love makeup its definitely a hands on job. I wouldn't consider this job as a career just either a side job or a temporary job. Depending on what you role is at the job i definitely would work part-time
good,Ulta was a very fun job. While working there it was awesome to help other women feel pretty. With every place there are people you don’t get along with but for the most part everyone was great
good,working at ulta was a good experience in all.The management was very nice and they trained me very well . They took there time to make sure i understood what they was talking about and how to do things.
good,"Ulta is a very good place to work and offers many opportunities, to those who do their job. I learned many things about the products we sold in the store. And the management wa very fair. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they wanted."
good,After working for the company for so long you grow friendship with in the people you work with daily its makes it completely easier to communicate and work proficiently.
good,"Great place to work, coworkers are great as well as managers. Inconsistent shifts made outside life difficult to plan but overall a great company to work for. Get a LOT of discounts as an employee. Pay was minimum."
good,"Energetic business with fast paced culture. Management is generally supportive of new ideas and mindful of work-life balance. Staff is fun and easy to work with, generous discounts."
good,"Most of the employees there were very kind and helpful while I was training. I learned a lot about time management due to the large work load they had there. The hardest part of the job would have to be inconsistent associate work schedules. While I worked there, there were many unreliable workers even though management was great. My favorite part about the job was gettin to meet new customers every day and learning so much not only about makeup and business,but also people."
good,"A typical day started off with a team meeting lasting no longer than 10 minutes going over what needed to be styled and shot for the day. Work place culture was easy going, lots of great loud music to keep the flow of the day. The management was great, very team oriented. The best part of the job was being able to get into a flow and style a scene. The hardest part of the job would be not always having the design team be on the same creative flow as the photo team, and having to redo sometimes an entire set."
good,It’s a good company it should just have more good organizational skills and managers running the stores better. The benefits are not very good and should be improved
good,I loved working for the company and would go back there to work in a heart beat! I enjoyed the overall culture that ULTA created for their employees and customers!
good,"Loved working there. I had to work almost every Saturday which is why I left ultimately (poor work/life balance) but, that comes with retail. Overall, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot while working there."
good,I liked the discounts. We got 25% off the entire purchase and 50 % off all salon visits. The management there were very professional and made working there a lot easier than I thought.
good,I've always enjoyed working for Ulta. They have a nice relaxing work environment with management who is there to help you succeed and will do anything to help you so that.
good,"I always had a productive day at work whether or not I was at the registers or doing labor work around the store I was always doing something. I always liked doing work because it made time go faster and I felt satisfied when I did a lot of work. Most of the time the hardest part of the job, when there really was problems was the problematic customers. You always have to try to make the customer feel better and help them but in some situations it was very hard to help them and or tell them what they want to hear because sometimes its not my place as a beauty advisor to lets say give them a discount just because they think they should get it, that's the managers job to decide that."
good,"Great Company, motivated leadership that help you learn and succeed in the beauty industry.  Many possibilities for growth. They also offer flexible schedules."
good,"I loved my time at Ulta, some awesome opportunities to learn about new products and assist guests. I loved my job and helping guests.  I learned so much about skin care and cosmetics.  I'm very grateful for everything I learned.   Alot of employee turn over and hours are based on sales."
good,"fun place to work, continuing education. not many walk in clients. friendly staff, opportunity to build clientele. employee discount on all products. clean environment"
good,"our team members were like a family, I really enjoyed going to work.  I left because they never promoted the salon like they did retail.  You have to work for many months to be able to get full-time hours, with the non-compete clause, I was unable to supplement my income at another location."
good,"A typical day at work started with a check in with management, then you would be assigned to either cash/wrap or task... sometimes both. The workplace was always a happy and fast paced environment where all my co-workers were very friendly and excited to help if you had a question."
good,Most of the advantages of a company going public will be for the GM’s and above. There’s more pressure for results with less resources. Intro wages are lowered and raises are scarce.
good,"I loved working at Ulta, unfortunately because of family issues I could only be part time. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone who loves make-up."
good,It was a fun place to work and definitely one of my favorite jobs that I've had. The people that I worked really made the job however. I used to stock the shelves and then was put on the sales floor which I did not mind. it was not a stressful job whatsoever. I would recommend it to anybody that has an interest in beauty supplies. I went in with no knowledge and pursued a career in cosmetology because of this job.
good,"My time with this company was very short , with that said it was still a great experience for the amount of time there and I learned alot about  beauty and skincare."
good,Haven't work long enough to give an accurate review but so far it has helped to give me extra cash when I needed it. I was hired on the spot so I didn't go through a rigorous process.
good,Very competitive enjoyed been busy! A great opportunity to build your strength and skills in the beauty industry and they have ongoing supportive training.
good,The hardest part was being behind with technology. Overall the company is a great starter retail company to work for. I enjoyed how diverse Ulta was in growing within the beauty industry.
good,"Ulta was a great place to work and my time spent I enjoyed.  The management team was great and the employees hired were great team players for the most part.  I was able to to grow with Ulta professionally and personally.  I would recommend working at Ulta, especially if you have a creative talent."
good,"A typical day working at Ulta is fast-paced, and full of excitement. There is NEVER  dull day working at Ulta. Management is on top of their game, and associates are well trained and prepared for questions clientele may have about products Ulta carries. Sales and benefits are plentiful for guests. Management is always willing to do their best to accommodate the clients. I have learned sincere professionalism working at Ulta. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sheer brilliance of connecting a customer to a product that does absolute wonders for them. Happy customers makes a happy customer service department."
good,Fast paced...easy to get points but fall off same day 1 yr later. This is good to help not loose your job for attendance. New mangers are not easy to work with
good,Great supportive environment. I was able to showcase my skills and I was able to work well with everyone there. It's a great job to have and provides a space for growth.
good,"I learned a lot at ULTA about all different sectors of the beauty industry. The  prestige department could have been run a little more smoothly and better hiring decisions could have been made, but overall I enjoyed my time there"
good,"Being an associate at Ulta Beauty was great! I was able to advance my position as Beauty Advisor to Prestige Beauty Advisor. It was said to be difficult but if you really worked hard, they gave you the position. At Ulta, they taught me everything and I never felt like I didn't know how to do certain tasks. Management fluctuated often but they were always great to work with and accommodated to the associate's needs. I learned about a lot of brands which definitely expanded my knowledge on makeup and skincare."
good,"Awesome environment, assist with improving skills. "
good,"Overall, it was a nice place to work! It was upbeat and fun and I always had a great time at work. Managers and my coworkers were very nice. If i can go back to work there then i definitely will!"
good,"Typical day, get chatted in you'll hear the daily goal what and where we are at, what we need to do to make up for whatever hasn't been made you'll be directed toward your designated areas by the on duty manager you can guest service people, build a bag and maintain a well rounded clean atmosphere. I defiantly learned how to multitask, take the lead in the situations be an effective team player, and up-sale introduce and sign people up for any current events going on. My location was super busy so it definitely helped me learn how to work under pressure while still enjoying my job. The management at my location is good I loved them, they're definitely there to help you but be prepared to have thick skin and never take anything personal. Hardest part is getting hired on a lot of girls aren't use to how busy and fast paced my location was so just pay attention as much as possible and you'll get the hang of things its definitely a good learning experience. Most enjoyable part is the customer satisfaction I got building relationships with certain guests and having them come back time and time again looking for me specifically to help them out was such an amazing feeling you get free makeup but makeup comes and makeup goes its not a huge deal to me but the relationships that I built and experience I got was super amazing."
good,"Rang customers, helped customers with make up consulting also skin care consulting. Beauty Adviser is what I loved doing. Was also a fragrance specialist. Did multiple duties during the day."
good,Ulta is a great company that is growing by the day.  They offer so much to their employees and it has been a wonderful place for me to work.  I would recommend it for anyone looking to get into the beauty industry.
good,"Ulta was a fun place to work at. Although the pay wasn't enough to live off of solely I did thoroughly enjoy my job and my coworkers. The discounts you get working there are decent although if you're a spender you might find your small paycheck is going to go directly back into the company."
good,fast paced environment. needed a strong know-how to be able to do the job. it was enjoyable and the computer work was challenging but it was fun for me.
good,"Fun place to work, with great people and a good discount for employees. Good job for college students or people who want some extra money. Very flexible when it comes to hours and scheduling"
good,"Ulta was a really fun place to work, one of my favorite jobs so far. I recommend it to anyone looking for part-time work to supplement another job or school. It's a great way to step in to the world of beauty. Although you can work your way up, it is a slow process and there is usually a play of favoritism. Pay is fair, and you're paid more if you have good experience. In my opinion, you will like the job depending on the team you are with. The team will make or break your experience at Ulta - if you have a good team and management, you will love it."
good,"All of the workers seem to be friends in and out of work. Not a lot of problems with drama. However, there seems to be a problem with hours being cut."
good,Fun and relaxed work environment. Managers are great and understanding. Enjoyed my time working with this company. Would suggest anyone looking to get into beauty.
good,"I work at Ulta doing Ad Sets/planograms and truck in the mornings. Everything is run really smoothly and I love working here. I have nothing to complain about, my store location is great."
good,"It was a fun job getting to see all the different and interesting things people buy, I worked on register the whole time so it was easy and simple. Anyone can do it if they know how to work on register"
good,i love makeup so this job was really easy and plus i got discounts to the products it was a sweet job giving people makeovers sharing tips and trick to others
good,No work life balance. I have health problems and my manager sees that as an inconvenience. Your schedule is all over the place. I never get days off in a row.
good,"I did picking/packing,drove sit down forklift i kept my work spot clean and they are a good place to work i would tell anybody to go work there they are a clean organized"
good,Our location is really slow for the salon but working the retail portion isn't bad. What you would expect from retail but with like minded people and the benefit of helping other beauty enthusiasts
good,I really enjoyed working at Ulta. Management and co workers were great. Our particular location had a ton of special events which always kept us on our toes.
good,Company is very stable. Customers return due to disposable product being purchased. Company treats you very respectful. Just needed better leadership on the district level. More training opportunities. Need a district trainer to go from store to store and help out with training.
good,Quick paced work environment very fun and artistic. Best part was having fun with the customers and showing them all that Ulta has to offer and finding the right product for each individual.
good,"Ulta is a very fun place, the customers are great. Not a very stressful job, sales are easy to make. The benefits are great if you are a full time employee."
good,"I enjoy the environment, and working surrounded by something I enjoy, like makeup and skin care. I've worked several different areas within the store, and have enjoyed every position so far."
good,I love working at ULTA the Teams are great & I love working with people so it's definitely my place to be.Most of the managers are open to hearing feedback & make you feel appreciated.
good,"I had Point of Sales everyday a goal to reach and I learned the computer system quickly. I worked cashier and Sales floor, I helped female or male guest find their makeup and color match them. I would help inventory and stocking"
good,"This job will keep you busy. Not only do you get to learn about makeup, skincare, and hair...you also get to test it out daily and use it on customers. Its fun, it can be difficult and stressful at times. Most of the management staff was great to work with but the GM unfortunately..is never around to assist or help out in situations."
good,I love working at Ulta the atmosphere is amazing and the management is pretty great. They offer really good benefits but the pay varies too much from all the positions and feel is unfair.
good,"Loved working there. Everyone was kind and lovely. The managers were very helping and educated me, everyday. I loved working with makeup and educating customers and employees about makeup/ skin care products."
good,"I've been with ULTA for over a year and they've ask me to work because, I work hard when I come to work! I dont work to socialize nor gossip even better, I do what's expected of me while I'm at work! When you dedicated yourself to your job and do it well Managment notices! I get told all the time by my Managers they want me to work there shifts because they know, I work hard! If you put in what you want out of it you'll benefit by getting asked to work more hours. I was asked to work 6 day's the last 2 weeks! My Managers are amazing and they understand my work and home life balance! They all care about my career goals in the Medical field! Thank you ULTA for being such a great company! I'm truly blessed with an amazing team in Temecula <3 "
good,"great place to work, fun fast pace place to work, great group of people to work with. management is amazing and they treat you well there. anyone would be lucky to work there."
good,It's a fantastic company but I wish there were raises based on merit. I'm training girls now that get paid more than me and I have a leadership position at my store because they are naturally getting hired at higher and higher rates.
good,"My typical day consisted of interacting with customers, peers and management. I was responsible for meeting and exceeding sales quotas for women's cosmetic, skin care and fragrance lines."
good,Awesome place to work. Great place to start a management career. Company takes care of its employees and engages a work life balance. Communication is great with upper management and employees
good,"Ulta has taught me so many skills that will come of use to me in any future jobs. I have been taught customer service skills, inventory skills, leaderships skills and teamwork skills. The only downside is the pay, I wish it was higher. It is a great startup job if you are entering retail."
good,Everyone I worked with was so nice but I know it’s not like that everywhere. Sometimes it would be slow and the days would drag but most days were busy and filed with things stay busy
good,"Its a balanced, neatstore that carries most of your beauty needs at man different price ranges. They put you through trainging to learn the new products before going on the shelves."
good,"Lots of changes, good changes.. If you are looking for a challenge Ulta is the place for you..The DCs offer a different look at how the company operates to the stores that offer the retail view.. to the corporate office."
good,"1. Always clean "
good,"It's fun being around people that love the art of makeup and being able to express that daily. "
good,"-fun place to work and many different options day to day"
good,"Ulta is a great place to work. The people are super friendly. But it is more than just playing with makeup and applying it to customers. The majority of Ulta Beauty participation includes loss prevention, stocking shelves, and waking up very early to work before the store opens."
good,"Working at ULTA Beauty has been awesome - a dream really. I have a passion for makeup and being around it was awesome for me. My managers are great and my co-workers are as well. The only problem that I have is that I need a full-time job that pays a good bit more, so that my significant other and I can spend time together."
good,"Ulta is a great place to work, aside from some poor management that I have encountered. I have always had fun coming into work, even on a bad day, most of my coworkers have turned my bad day into a fun, learning experience. I have had many great managers and leaders that have pushed me to be better today than I was yesterday. There are so many things to learn, improve on, and so many brands and people to meet and collaborate with."
good,"Great with working with hours, enjoyed the customer interaction . I learned more about organizing and sales . No real hard parts about the job very simple easy work place ."
good,"Exciting work for a beauty retail job, given high chances to advance within the company, and the customers are fun. The company is encouraging and fast pace."
good,"Ulta has been one of my best work experiences because of my managers. I have a team of high energy and determined managers who are the biggest source of support and motivation for all of the Beauty Advisors. The customers can be very difficult to deal with, but the benefits are worth it."
good,"A typical day will include coming in and prepping the store to open, stocking shelves, cleaning up the store. Then you open and start guest servicing and give them the wow experiences they are looking for. You'll perform a color match or five, maybe have to explain a certain technique but it's truly a good feeling empowering women (and men). I've learned so many leadership skills to take with me wherever I end up. They love to promote from within so there are great opportunities to grow within the company. The management can be iffy, they just need to have strong communication and all be on the same page. The hardest part of the job is not allowing myself to become too close with my staff, we have all became a huge family which is great but at times it can cause issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the beauty industry is constantly growing, they are always coming out with better items with better ingredients so you are always learning something new."
good,"Typical day of work included stocking shelves, customer interactions, and client services. Co-workers were nice and management was understanding and worked well with employees."
good,"work place was like swimming with sharks. Co workers were rude, selfish, and full of gossip. very unprofessional. management was great on certain days."
good,"Always learning things, everything from better makeup application to better management and leadership skills. All of this makes for a much more fun work environment which creates excellent employees and loyal guests."
good,"Beauty consultations on how to pick the best product that matches the customers skin tone , hair texture and skin care,  different products to customers depending on their skin type , hair type and providing knowledge on different ingredients and vitamins in products to customer satisfaction"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Ulta. Great company, with great people. Not too many hours though, which became my greatest issue, but better pay rate starting out than I had when I left my previous job I had been at for a year and a half."
good,"Ulta is a company with many opportunities for growth.  Whether you are looking to improve yourself, your business or your knowledge of other products and services."
good,Good Job. People care about their positions. Management is good. There is room for advancement. The employee discount is nice and he salon discount is even better.
good,"I leaned about everithing because they send my to diferents deparments to work and its good because I can learn every day something new. "
good,"Very fast-growing company that hires primarily within but has severe disconnect between retail store and corporate office.  Great benefits and discounts, but lack competitive pay."
good,"Ulta is a wonderful company to work for if you're looking for advancement opportunities.  The only downside would be that there isn't much of a work life balance with retail management.  The reps for the prestige brands are fantastic people!  Being able to learn things from them about new products, as well as from the salon stylists was a top notch perk."
good,"Overall, this job was enjoyable. I worked there for about 5 1/2 months before heading off to college, and for a high school student it wasn't the easiest job. However, the management at my store was friendly and helpful almost all the time. It wasn't a necessarily difficult job, however, some lazy workers can ruin it for the rest (not unpacking things completely from the packaging before shelving, that sort of thing). I still have good connections with my former managers, however, the corporate people that work for this company always were terrifying. Things changed completely when they showed up, not that anything our store was doing wasn't accurate or was against policy. Things had to be literally PERFECT when they were there, and my understanding is that they could be really difficult with employees. I never had that experience. "
good,They work with your schedule and they are all like a small family. We have our problems but they get sorted very fast. Everyone helps each other out when they can.
good,"This was a fast paced 24x7 operation. It was a model corporate environment with Application Development, It Infrastructure, and Store Operation department reporting to the CIO.  I was heading the IT Infrastructure and challenges with this high paced environment were great and very satisfying."
good,It was an enjoyable place to work at . It had continue education  free lunch occasionally and the customer were GREAT. The manager that I work with was FANTASIC.
good,"This was my second retail job and was levels above my first retail job! The people where so open minded and welcoming. Typical cashier duties where performed, management was great and communicated well, the customers where both the best and worst part of the job though."
good,"They are pretty cool about days off and the managers were nice. You always had the breaks you were supposed to get, but they had silly policies. Honestly I enjoyed the job."
good,"This isn't a terrible place to work. It is tough to move up, but that us pretty much standard in a retain position. All in all, I would say it was an overall good experience."
good,I love makeup so I thought this would be a great place to work for the Christmas season to make extra money. I liked working there but I wish I would have been allowed to try out different positions other than a cashier.
good,"Work was pretty relaxed at Ulta, I would ring up guests, and do all the other tasks assigned. Everyone was friendly and honest. The workplace followed its guidelines and was pretty relaxed for a store. The only hard part was my commute since I took the bus, and sometimes my hours didn't always meet with the bus schedule. The most enjoyable part about working for Ulta would have to be working with the guests, and making them happy and making sure they got the best deals."
good,"Very professional company that prioritizes education and customer satisfaction. "
good,"Working at Ulta can be fun and you learn a lot about makeup and beauty services. "
good,"Cool to be apart of an amazing company and brand if you're a serious beauty and makeup geek like myself. A sigh of relief to be working along side women and men who also enjoy the same things as you, whether it's the newest trend of beauty and style or the classics and originals."
good,"Ulta Beauty's staff were friendly, kind, supportive and hardworking. There was constant room for growth. Managers were kind and patient. The most difficult part of the job was facing the public, which is the same for any job that requires working with the public."
good,"The job was just like any other retail job. Some days were great, other days were horrible. An average day at Ulta: you clock in, get with the managers & talk about sales goals, go to your station & attend to customers/clients, clean & replenish as needed. It was the perfect job (at least for me) however, hours are not guaranteed. Other than that, everything else was good, even the management was awesome."
good,Very well organzied. Great management. Its a great place to work and a great place to shop with great deals all the time. They also have a great brow bar and salon. I was very happy with my hair cut it was exactly what i wanted and my eye brows where done to perfection by baliey.
good,Co-workers and managers are all professional. The management are all willing to help and offer guidance to anyone who needs it.  The work environment can range from easy to hectic depending on the workload and the customers.  I learned to be patient and also to just provide the very best customer service to customers.  To be able to adjust to the ever changing situation in retail.
good,Pick and pack items. Stack and unstack pallets. I enjoyed the employees and the experience. Management was very upstanding and leaders. The hardest part was the long hours.
good,A company that is willing to coach and guide their employees. A company that does have the opportunity for on to grow and flourished with hard work. The hardest past of the job is when we were understaff.
good,"very fast pace job , great culture . I learned alot about the product industry. management was good very good with communication i always enjoyed coming into work."
good,"I have learned a lot from ulta, great team environment. Great opportunity. Conference calls,meetings, celebations, promotions."
good,"I loved my job at ULTA! "
good,clock in grab bin with box cutter marker box cutter glove and calculator and head over to quick meeting with stretch and head over to aisles to break open boxes to put into slots ....pretty much it. If you want to be at a place where its entertaining happy environment  and flexible hours and schedule this isn't for you if you want to go to a place with good pay relaxed but productive hard working mentality with relaxed management this is it ...remember guys this is a warehouse not a happy family office desk job its going to be hot sometimes boring and acceptable strict rules ..give 100 percent even if you don't like the job better to leave then take it out on the workplace.
good,"Days are either really busy or really slow, which can make time drag a bit. Beauty advisors normally just work the register or fix the items on the shelves. But overall it was a pretty great job."
good,"It's a good place to work.Meet customers, provide good customer service and give them the fabulous experience every day."
good,"I love working for Ulta. I love my coworkers. I want to grow within the company, Ulta loves their employees and customers, Ulta makes sure everyone needs are filled."
good,Ulta was a nice place to work. I enjoyed learning about the new beauty products as they came out. The management was really nice as were my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was probably standing for long periods of time.
good,"I would open the store making sure that all registers are turned on, and that every employee is aware of their daily tasks. Also attend to customers needs."
good,Great company to work for......moving to Indiana and trying to transfer with the company.  Would love to continue my career.
good,"Very good coworkers, extremely good managers who cared about you personally and would talk to you. Fun environment, with fun and nice clients. Very well set up system and up to date technology. Only thing I would wish is that they would train all associates no matter what position on the makeup, since customers assume everyone knows. All in all I had a very nice time working here."
good,"I enjoyed working for Ulta because they take the time to train you about new trends in the world of makeup, fragrance and hair so you have the learning curve of implementing such training on customers of all walks of life. Pay is not at all competitive with stores in the similar industry so that is a con."
good,It is a wonderful place to assist customers with their beauty and hair care needs. Sometimes my hours can be unpredictable and long. I love the relationships I have built with my customers and co workers. This job has given me stability for 5 years.
good,Loved the openness and ability to be able to take your slow day and help customers in the store with beauty tips. Was a great way to get more people in your chair.
good,"Ulta is a Top Notch company in its support for the working parent, and understanding the needs of work life balance. I enjoyed working with various vendors, while creating a professional network."
good,"Ulta is a great environment for learning and achieving goals."
good,Ulta is a great place to work. Fun fast paced. Great management staff. Lack of payroll is the worst part of the job. They teach you great information about the product and how to help the guest
good,"Great work environment with supportive management. I learned a lot about skin care and the ingredients inside of different skin care products for sensitive, normal or dry skin. Each of my co workers have something to teach and something to learn from me as well we all carry different information on products that makes the environment a learning experience everyday. Dealing with not very nice customers , just have to always remember to be professional."
good,"Its never a slow or boring day at work, there is always something to do and makes your day go back quicker. Ulta supplies with all you need to know and resources to have a successful job."
good,"Easy going work place with incredible coworkers and great clientele. Very focused on helping you improve your future as a stylist. Unfortunately, management is constantly changing and in need of something more permanent. Mostly due to the size of the company."
good,love being able to help my clients. loved being able to lean more than I thought I could and go on fun training trips. love my coworkers all so bubbly! hardest is converting. enjoyable would be helping my clients feel and look better.
good,"Good company, just ready to advance in my area of expertise. good work environment, lots of new faces, and good perks."
good,"A typical day at Ulta is me opening the store and doing opening paper work, opening the registers making sure opening tasks are done before the store open at 10am, cheat-inn so that everybody know what they doing through out the day. GEMing (walking around the store making sure guest are doing ok) Taking care of returns. Answer phone when guest call making salons appointments. What I learned from Ulta how to handle difficult situation weather its a unhappy guest or tasks my general manager  may have given me. My management team and co-workers is a hard working motivating team. I have learned so much from them, build friendships with some of them.  The hardest part of my job is when I do not have enough coverage that's when co-worker and guest seemed to need me the most  so I have to be at 20 different places at once. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is meeting so many different vendors and learning the different brands and trying new products."
good,learned alot great company to work with . There was nothing hard about the job.i enjoyed everything about the job. co workers were helpful when needed them
good,"Fast food definitely wasn't my thing, but I did enjoy working there when I did. All my co-workers were friendly but there seemed to be to much drama."
good,"Working at Ulta I learned how to multi-task,work effectively with a team and perfect my customer service skills. "
good,"I was a part-time seasonal worker at one of the highest grossing Ulta stores in the country. During the weeks before the holidays, the store was extremely busy and the checkout line was never-ending.  As a cashier I learned how to handle different types of transactions including store and online returns and purchases via reward accounts. My co-workers were helpful and answered all my questions (as a new employee). The management was very friendly and organized, and overall the store ran wonderfully. "
good,"In this position you provide customer service ensuring that guests have a memorable experience. You will handle all customer complaints, concerns, questions, returns/exchanges, and all other cashier functions. You will supervises employees as well as train all new associates. You are responsible for all shipment procedures, stocking, ad sets, floor changes, planograms and all other daily management functions."
good,my favorite retail job thus far...the upper management needs a bit of work with ensuring that communication and day to day environment is up to standards.
good,i worked here for many years off and on and enjoyed it every time i went back. staff changed but everything stayed the same and that's what i loved about it. i would go back and work there again if i didnt need a better paying job.
good,decent place to work. fun envirement. I worked as a cashier mostly even though my job title is beauty advisor.
good,Great job if you like makeup and customers.  Lots of great products to work with.
good,We basically give optimal customer service while driving sales. I learned how to pickup on body language and how to cater to it. We at Ulta are self managers and challenge each other to do better. The hardest part of the job is being a shopper on a off day and some how people just know you work there and ask for help; The most enjoyable part is clocking in.
good,I really like working here. Only complaint is that they need better hours.
good,I enjoyed working for Ulta and saw the advancements within the company. Its exciting to see people growing within the company.
good,A fun and good place to work for. I learned alot from this company and should the oppertunity happen I would definitly go back to work for them.
good,"Assistant store manager, supervised staff,trained,operations, customer care. would work for again"
good,Very nice manager.  Very nice co-workers.  Fast pace salon. Extensive customer service.
good,"Great place to work at.  lots of opportunities."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of merchandising the store, cash handling, greeting customers, and sales!! The best part about the job was  making customers feel empowered and confident within themselves."
good,"Ulta is a fun store to work in.  I run the cash register and mostly work evenings as just a part time job.  Most of the management is very great to deal with.  There is a lot of favoritism with some members of management, and if you're a cashier you do not get nearly the treatment that the girls that work in prestige do. "
good,"ULTA has a excellent benefits"
good,Very nice company to work for. Nice employees with hard work ethics.
good,This is a good place to work. They give you opportunities to grow.
good,"I was able to help customers find products that they needed. Co-workers we all got a long and worked well togethers which made the the fun and enjoyable. I was always learning new techniques from sales representatives, managers, and co-workers. The hardest part of the job with when the store was slow, this did give me time to clean and get to learn about the products more."
good,"I have been able to move up through the company, because they are a fast growing company, and provide the proper training for advancement."
good,It was a okay part time job as it being my first job. Wasn't complicated at all. Felt good working there. Would of liked to stay with them.
good,"Ulta Beauty is a great place to work. I have learned a lot not only from the company but the employees too. The down falls for the company is the hours of work per week, for each employee. Also, only mangers can be full-time. There are no other employee that are allowed to work 40 hours a week. Overall, I love this job."
good,"it was overall a good experience as a start to the makeup industry. I learned a lot about customer service, and enjoyed meeting with the other brand reps on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure all the aisles look nice.Your working area is nice and tidy.I have learned how to do register,how to do returns. The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule."
good,"The culture is really what makes the job. My store has great synergy, collaboration, and strong connections to the customer. It is my favorite place I've worked as a manager to be honest. I've heard other locations aren't as nice, but I love my location."
good,"Ulta is a fun, energetic place to work with a fast paced setting. Ulta provides great benefits to their full time employees and they are always looking to advance and grow their employees for promotions."
good,I had a great time. There are a few things Ulta can improve but other than that I had a great experience working with everyone. The work site was nice and had lots of parking spots.
good,Great environment to work in especially if you love beauty. They are very flexible with scheduling and the hours are great. Love the one in one with customer’s being able to show them your favorite products. It was a great job to show your skills but also learn allot of new things.
good,"I loved working at Ulta because my team pushed me to go above and beyond my goals there. I love sharing my goals with my team members and helping them achieve theirs. I definitely grew as a retail worker while there, and my customer service skills increased immensely! I also loved the freebies I got for achieving my goals there. The only hard part was working with customers at times. That's a given with any job, however. If you love to learn about beauty and want to push yourself, working at Ulta would be fun for you!"
good,"Working at Ulta was overall a good experience. It is great for hairdressers who are looking to build a clientele. They have training classes and supportive management. Unfortunately, retail work is required if you are not busy. It takes time to fill your books, about a year, but the money is great once that happens. There is base pay, but opportunities to make commission."
good,"It was a good company to work for. However, I enjoy serving more than retail due to the change of pace in the workplace. I enjoy serving customers and pleasing guests."
good,"Constantly on your feet and moving, but you have fun with the people you work with and the environment is usually pretty upbeat. Good room for growth within the company."
good,The workplace culture was positive and friendly. The only issue was the hours and distribution of work. The environment really motivates you to want to try hard and improve.
good,"Wonderful staff, other than management. Fair pay, good environment, realistic goals. The staff I felt was very encouraging of each other. Easy to move up in the company"
good,"I loved working for Ulta. Mostly I loved the positive and supportive team of women I worked with and the uplifting atmosphere they created. However, I was not compensated well enough for the amount of work I put in and for my set of skills. I asked for raises and to be given my rightful bonuses yet never received them. It broke my heart to leave, but it would have broken my wallet had I stayed."
good,"Fun and flexible place to work at, will love it, specially make up lovers. Very diverse company. Management could improve and so could their communication."
good,"I learned so much at ULTA, I’ve always loved makeup but working there you really learn about the ingredients and which brands have more variety for all skin types, it’s very interesting. I’ve gained confidence in myself, my appearance and my knowledge in skincare, hair products and cosmetics, both drugstore and highend. The only downside is the pay, I was lucky enough to have an amazing group of managers who were always open to listen to any concerns. They really try to help their employees and make sure we’re all happy."
good,"The workplace was great. It was clean, organised. the people that worked there were very nice. A lot of diversity in culture. The most enjoyable part was to meet bunch of people."
good,"i  would help ring up customers at a register, as well as recommend the best beauty products for their specific needs. i helped to close the store at the end of the day as well."
good,ULTA is an amazing place to work. They look to promote from within all of the time. They have amazing associate discounts for both products and for salon services.
good,"I enjoyed working for Ulta. I had encountered  a medical issue and needed a hysterectomy. I was worried that I would not be covered and I was. It was amazing the support I received. I was approached after my return with a job opportunity making more money, better benefits etc and although it was difficult to leave I had to do what was best for me"
good,"I love the people, everyone is so sweet and kind. It makes the overall work environment really great. The only complaint that I have is that I have very few hours, which would be fine - however, they keep hiring more people even though there's already not enough hours to go around. I would say that this is a flaw in management, but it' s not really my place to say since I don't know the things management have to do or how they decide these things. It's just really annoying because I'm going to have to get a second job. Still, I do really enjoy working there."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Ulta Beauty! Great management. If you love makeup and sharing your knowledge on cosmetics, skin care and hair care definitely apply at Ulta beauty! You don't only get paid to do what you love but you have a lot of room to grow in this company!"
good,"Absolutely love working with Ulta, I just wish they had a better work life balance. The training is great, management is dependable and uplifting of their team, and there is always opportunity for advancement."
good,"Ulta was a very good place to work at, especially being a young adult. There are so many different places that you can go within the company. The people genuinely care and the workplace culture is overall fantastic."
good,"They help you find where you fit best whether it be pushing sales, operations, advanced cosmetic knowledge and application. They always ask where you want to go within the company."
good,"I loved working here for the longest! Unfortunately, when new management stepped in, I felt undervalued and overworked. I tried to express my concerns but felt as though they were not heard to the extent that I would have liked. I learned so much with this company. A few examples are improvement in customer service, critical thinking on the spot, multitasking, and being flexible. A typical day at work could range from making new displays to working the cashwrap to putting on makeup for a guest. I highly recommend working here if you are a college student trying to gain experience."
good,The workplace culture was great. It was always fun to be there and the advancement opportunities were there if you were willing to ask for them and wait for the right position to open up.
good,Awesome team when i worked there!  hardest part waking up at 4am  easy part being out by noon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111it was ok was there for 5 years!!!!!!!!
good,I started out as a Benefit Arch expert in ulta store 786. A year later I was promoted to Prestige Manager. Ulta is always promoting from within while also giving jobs to bright and cheerful candidates.
good,Good place to work in peak season. Management is good. As long as you work there should be no problems.                                                        B-
good,"In my opinion, working for ULTA was a great experience, I was in charge of ensuring my payroll was accurate. Time management skills were definitely gained."
good,"There is no such thing as dragging a co-worker down in order for someone else to come out on top. Everyone is supportive and provide assistance to anyone who needs it, especially for new employees."
good,"I've always loved makeup, and working at Ulta gave me a good fresh perspective of all of the different brands and beauty products out there.  I really liked the environment, although the dress code was enforced more with some employees, and less with others.  The hardest part of the job was probably the constant walking and standing.  I do have arthritis so it was a little more difficult for me to move around and I noticed I wasn't eating enough during my shifts.  But, I loved the people I worked with, and the manager was amazing.  I also thought the training videos were very in depth and helpful."
good,"I worked as an esthetician and would start out by checking my schedule and setting my area up for clients.  I would make sure my department was clean and organized at all times.  Any down time I had, I would be on the floor talking to customers about services and products. The hardest part of working here was building clientele.  The best part about working at Ulta was making people happy and feel good about themselves."
good,only issue I ever had working there was its a store for females.  I only worked here one day a week to help with the incoming freight. Overall very fun job.
good,"Management is friendly and respond in a timely manner to any questions or concerns one may have. Hours are flexible, the pay is a little low, and I wish they offered raises for their associates. The environment is clean and fun to work in."
good,"I appreciated my opportunity to learn about products to be able to correctly recommend products to guests. "
good,"I love working for Ulta, it is a wonderful environment, I just can't afford to pay all of my bills with the hours I'm working. I would love to stay, and I definitely will if I can find another place of employment to work with my hours."
good,It was great team leadership and we had fun at advanced training classes. I didn't really think much of Redken brand products when I first got there but they taught you how to use them all together. We had team meetings twice a month.
good,I have loved working here for the two years I have been hired. All my managers are encouraging as well as my employees. I love all of them like a family and would extremely recommend working here.
good,"Hired as temp to perm to open a new location. worked as floor set and clean up, moved to cashier after open and shipment during early morning hours before am store opening. Loved working there. Great managers, good discount,  only reason I left was because I got a permanent job offer elsewhere for more money."
good,"Good company to work for. Promotions are very possible, and have good benefits if working full time. Managers sometimes aren't sure what's going on, but all in all it's a good environment."
good,"This was the best job I have had so far. I would loved to have stayed there longer, but for health reasons I couldnt. I loved how laid back the job was. I would recomend this job to anyone who loves makeup."
good,"I wish they can offer Full time, hours will depend on the season.............""..............................................""................ .......... hardest oart of the job is carrying boxes of shampoos to go to the display area...it is killing our backs..."
good,The management is always very active with the employees. Everyone makes a point to work together. Pretty good communication between employees. Definitely enjoyed working here.
good,"I loved working here. There are a lot of opportunities and lots of different jobs within the company that are open and welcoming. Great training, pay increases, communication, and contests."
good,"Would get to work, check my book, and if i had clients first thing i would take care of them, help them find anything in the store. Kept the salon clean while doing the service. Booked, and rebooked clients to maintain their new look. Helped out on the floor when the salon was slow."
good,"A typical day at work requires you to be on your feet the entire shift. You will be stocking, running the cash register, assisting customers, answering the telephone, and opening boxes of new merchandise from the trucks, as well as avoiding theft. What I learned from this job is how to better my sales approach towards customers as well as how to use the products in the store to better assist the customers. The management will only respect you if you prove yourself to be a serious, dedicated team player, also if you get a lot of customers to sign up for the stores rewards system. The managers are very helpful and constructively critical to help you better yourself. The culture in this workplace is vast and everyone in the store is unique. The hardest part of the job is getting the most loyalty points from the customers by just getting them to say yes towards the rewards. Getting high loyalty decifers how many shifts you get a week. The most enjoyably part of the job is wearing makeup your way, and getting to know the variety of people that work there and that come to the store to shop."
good,"I love working here, this is a great place to work and I love the people I work with. We have a great discount but it could be better. But the training is also slacking so be prepared to jump right in. With a team like ours, that has your back you don't have to worry. We however have a high turn over rate but that because its retail."
good,my location didnt really have too many customers so it would be a bit borninf but when it did get busy time did fly by if you're a cashier you just stay behind the cashwrep the whole time so it was easy
good,"I experienced a chance of a life time by being a good worker because they brought it out of me by being enthusiastic, kind and helpful.  We had events that catered to the needs of everyone.  And every employee was accommodated accordingly"
good,"Ulta is such a fun place to work at. Everyone is friendly, there is never any pressure, its a fun and easy job to do. Only downside is the hours suck so if you are a person who has responsibilities such as, bills to pay then I wouldn't recommend you apply here unless you work two jobs."
good,Great experience to have on resume and very fun to help people with their makeup choices and make them feel beautiful. The management was very understanding and always helpful.
good,"I always hear people saying ""a job is a job"" but at ULTA I actually enjoyed coming into work everyday. Working there for 2 years, I made a ton of connections with people who became my friends, people who were working on my level but also management. I learned valuable customer service techniques, how to be a team player, how to work and have fun at the same time without sacrificing one or the other. I wouldn't say there was a stand out ""hardest part"" of this job, the most frustrating was some of the customers but there's nothing you can do about that, really. The most enjoyable part was working and having fun at the same time. It really is a great environment and, for anyone who enjoys cosmetics, it's an awesome place to work."
good,I love what I do and my clients make it even better. Working for Benefit Cosmetics is the best company! they are so much fun and uplifting!!
good,"It's not great and it's not terrible. It is the perfect definition of ""meh."" The company doesn't care about it's employees much but it's a great work enviroment for the chump change you'll be making/"
good,A typical day at work was providing excellent customer service helping customers find the right product for them. It was a fun atmosphere and I really enjoyed working there because you made people feel good about themselves.
good,One of the best career decisions I've  made. I needed a change in my life that would lead to something great. Along came ulta I haven't regreted taking the chance and going for it.
good,"Huge distribution center. Good enviroment. Overall, it is good place to work. Coworkers are ncie. It was my pleasure to work with them. Good memories."
good,"Ulta is an amazing company that caters to every women's need to feel and look beautiful."
good,"I've worked for Ulta for a little over a year and in two different stores. In both stores, the managers have been engaging and helped to drive employees' motivation by creating different types of competitions or recognitions for completing different amounts of sales goals or driving up the stores loyalty through issuing loyalty cards. The discount you recieve on makeup is amazing, but winning 'gratis,' also greatly improves worker's motivation for helping in completing store goals. Another great thing about Ulta is they give employees all of their breaks, without causing any issues! Other places I've worked in the past you might go all 8 hours without a single break- not even taking a lunch period if it was too busy. Ulta has definitely taught me a lot about sales, in addition to giving guests great customer service."
good,If you love makeup then this is the job for you. Management and coworkers are nice. Work load is no too much. You learn new things about beauty everyday.
good,"When I worked for Ulta, it was growing rapidly in all directions. By far the best benefits I have ever received in retail. Management was focused on talent development and store environment was like family."
good,A typical day at Ulta Beauty is fun filled with helping customers find what they are looking for and beyond. Delivering a wow experience is what we strive for with every customer. I have learned that going above and beyond can truly make all the difference for the customer. All the co-workers have a close bond and we all share a passion for cosmetics and trending fashion. The hardest part of working at Ulta is trying not to buy they're amazing products all the time! The most enjoyable part of working at Ulta is being able to share my knowledge of the beauty industry with people who need guidance and would like a new perspective on cosmetics.
good,"Very busy, but if you love the cosmetic world ULTA is the place to be! Always staying up on trends & is a great place to build your clientele."
good,"Fun place to work and good people. This isn't somewhere to work to support yourself, but it is nice for extra cash. If you enjoy beauty,makeup, making people feel better about themselves, give this job a try."
good,Clean and healthy environment that I were given the chance at performing the necessary roles and tasks to get the building up and running!
good,Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop your career. Concentrated on customer needs. Great co-workers.
good,Loved working here loved my managers and they work with your schedule if you have another job or go to school and you receive awesome gratis .
good,Women in the beauty industry are a whole different breed of cat. I have grown and learned a lot from this job.
good,"My typical day at work involves greeting customers and trying to convert them into getting a service done (facials, microdermabrasion or power resurfacing peels) as well as making sales within my stores main focused skincare brand called Dermalogica.  I've learned how to gain clientele and to keep my clients coming back for more.  The management is great, my GM and all other managers are so kind and caring to every one of us.  As for my co-workers, they've become family to me and they are always willing to help you out with anything at work.  There is nothing but all smiles and laughter throughout the work day.  Everyone is so outgoing and fun to work with, there is never a dull moment.  The hardest part of my job as a skin therapist is making sure I get as many rebooks with my clients as possible.  What I do enjoy most about my job is the smile a client gets on their face after looking into a mirror and the gain of confidence in themselves after they've had a service.  They're always amazed by how much of a difference they see in their skin.  It's an amazing feeling seeing how much of a change you've made to an existing clients skin and watching how much progress has been made."
good,"Good place to work, worked as seasonal and hired on as part time after."
good,I love my job and I learn a lot from Ulta and got a lot of experience I don't have any hard part of my job because if you are hard worker we should able to do any job in any place...
good,I had a great learning experience and training program in becoming a successful manager! I really enjoyed leading and coaching a team of 7!
good,I started working in the beginning of October. The training was very hands on. Managers are patient and know what work needs to be done. Co workers always help each other out in any situation. During the Holliday season many people were in a hurry and very distraught. This job taught me how to handle people in those situations.
good,"Ulta is a wonderful place to work.  A typical day as the manager on duty is to serve as the Guest Experience Manager.  This lets you walk the store and interact with both the external and internal guests.  Offering reinforcement of Ulta's core values and coaching opportunities.  Ulta believes in bringing in top talent, and my co workers are no exception.  We all call on each other for guidance.  The hardest part of the job is having to breakaway from your guests.  It's somewhat two fold.  Although we want to create raving fans and provide excellence service to each guests, there are times we need to breakaway to assist other guests that need our attention.  Not because it's hard to step away, but you feel torn because you want to help the guest from beginning to end.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the guest walk out with their head a little higher.  They may be having a really bad day, or going through something in their life that is traumatic, and we get to take them away from that even for the briefest amount of time.  As a leader, I really enjoy coaching and and developing my team to reach their full potential.  I enjoy seeing my associates go on and thrive in their careers."
good,"I was taught EVERYTHING the right way at my store in Pearland! We All said ""HELLO & WELCOME TO ULTA"", EVERYTIME we heard the chime of the door, no-matter where we were in the store! We ALL worked as a team, and I absolutely loved my job, so there for I gave it my ALL! When I transferred to the store in Tulsa, I'll never forget their was 6 of us girls, all on the registers, & everytime someone walked through the door, I was the ONLY 1 to greet them & I thought for sure after I had heard myself about 8 times that for sure 1 of them would chime in with me, but NO. An hour before closing everyone was suppossed 2 start facing the store, which means making sure everything is pulled forward, & anything out of place, return it, to sum it up, make sure the store looked perfect for in the morning, but again I found myself to be the only 1 doing it. At my store in TX we did a walk-through at night with the manager on duty, but in Tulsa, we never did. I can say this, I was glad to get trained the right way, but it just wasnt the same when I transferred. Of course the managers thought I was great, but it was supposssed to be a team effort, and it just wasn't. All in all, it was an awesome experience because I LOVE MAKE-UP!"
good,"On a typical day at work, I will go in and get started on my first client. If I do not have clients, I will go throughout the store talking to customers to convert them to salon clients. I've learned how to create clientele and how to flourish in this business. The management is somewhat strict and they follow all their rules, not just some of their rules, so it's easy to follow them also. My co-workers are kind and helpful and help me to work more efficiently. The hardest part of the job would be to try to convert customers into clients on slow days for the business, but the most enjoyable part of the job is finishing a client and knowing I've done the best I can do and seeing how happy my clients are with their new look."
good,"I worked at ULTA while I was in college,  I was a prestige consultant.  If you are a make up lover it is a fabulous part time job!  Basic duties included; making sales, cleaning testers, restocking products, completing planograms, and taking part in training sessions.  "
good,Ulta has some of the best benefits for their employees! The work environment is professional yet comfortable. We are like a little family.
good,A typical day at Ulta Warehouse will be started off bye doing a check expectation list on forklift it was a good place to work where they  helped  people  to work safely and efficiently good management good people to work with pretty much a good environment to work.
good,"This company is a good company overall with excellent benefits, pay and flexible schedules to accommodate ANY type of worker. They do alot of employee appreciation things like prizes, and bingo boxes. Also they offer overtime consistently and are always rehiring employees who wish to come back. Great place to work 👍"
good,Honestly I really liked working here. One of the managers was a little rude but there are  pros and cons to every place that you work at. There was plenty employee benefits and a lot to keep you busy throughout the day.
good,"There was a time that I really contemplated quitting everyday I had to come to work here, but when we got a new GM maybe a year ago and the previous one went to open a new store, my whole perspective of Ulta was changed.  Managers now are encouraging and take time to develop us and we never had that before.  I love my job with the team we have and I come to work wanting to succeed, because our store does so many awesome things it’s fun to be winning."
good,"Ulta Beauty offers benefits, retirement, and opportunity for advancement, education, and a fun work environment.  There are always opportunities for learning and improving your skills.  The work environment can be busy at times, but the management tries to make it fun."
good,"Fun, Upbeat, and fast paced work environment with great opportunities for  growth within the company. They are always looking to promote from within and give you a lot of resources for learning and expanding your knowledge of the company and products. Although, it can be challenging to maintain a work/life balance, it can be very rewarding for those who are naturally multi-taskers and who love to be challenged."
good,"It was lovely working at Ulta, everyone that I worked with was so kind and willing to help. It was a fun customer service environment where I got to work on every aspect of store operations."
good,I am able to always keep learning new things as well as interact with all kinds of people in my day to day work life. My coworkers are all very diverse with different kinds of knowledge as well. We are all able to learn from each other.
good,I work with an amazing group of women and men. The management team is amazing and the GM is the best we've had in years. Over all a good  way to work my way up.
good,"Ulta has great opportunities for its employees.  It has do many options for career advancement, great benefits as well.  I really enjoyed my career at Ulta  I would go back someday."
good,"Overall it is a great place to work, friendly people, flexible managers and fair pay. Coworkers work well together and the environment is a safe place. There is always something to do and people to interact with."
good,I had a fun time working at Ulta. Selling makeup and getting to talk about makeup with customers and associates was great. The pay was good for a retail job. I only left because I needed to go full time but they were not hiring any full time positions.
good,"It's not that bad, the pay is  good and if you like makeup then this is the place for you. When peek season(Holidays)starts its 12 hr shifts . Different departments so you dont get to pick . In summer it does get really hot in there ."
good,"I have gained lots of experience thru working with other CST, or attending classes at  IDI. Creating loyal customers after treating their skin conditions, has help maintain some of the same customers for over 6-7 years."
good,"Great Experience Learned a lot while working there. Staff was very helpful and friendly "
good,"I got a position at Ulta right after I graduated college and have been here ever since. I work with a great team of people including the management. We strive to help our customers, better our team, and drive sales for our stores."
good,"My managers were kind and relatable, always making work enjoyable. If there was ever a problem, they were there to either help teach me how to fix it. I enjoyed working here a lot. The space was bright and colorful and I learned so much about products and how a business works."
good,My job was a skin therapist position. As a cosmetologist I feel the range of work was amazing. The position is based on how much work and effort you put in to it. You have to work to build your client base or your paychecks will suffer.
good,"Allowed job advancement and personal growth. Learned equipment operations. Had a rate to make daily. Picked items per hour. Allowed for team work, but rates were individual."
good,"I loved working with Ulta as a prestige beauty advisor, "
good,"Ulta Beauty is a wonderful company to work for. It is a great place if you want to advance in the cosmetic industry. It is very much like a normal retail job, I would suggest some basic product and application knowledge in order to feel confident in the job. If you do not have that knowledge you will learn very quickly."
good,employees an clients make it worth it. also offers amazing benefits for full time employees. Also can start 401k and other programs with the company. Usually hires from within.
good,"I enjoy my short time there, friendly staff, opportunity for growth. I was seasonal only. Ulta is willing to allow staff to learn and grow, possibly leading to various promotions. "
good,"Working at Ulta  was a great learning experience with customer service, and the diversity of not only doing hair but makeup and helping customers outside of the salon. I was close to home and enjoyed discounts from purchased products ."
good,"I love working at Ulta, but I definitley don't make enough money to live. I would like my paychecks to be higher, but I almost seem stuck. Other than that it is a good work envirnment & the management team really does take what you say into consideration."
good,"I worked at the Benefit Brow Bar and the services we offered were waxing, lashes, and brow tinting. I learned that the customers love when you spend time and go over all their concerns regarding makeup, skin care, or sales going on in store. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with sale performance. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers faces light up when I helped them fix or correct their eyebrows or seeing their face light up from the makeup I helped them find and giving them tips and tricks."
good,"I would go back to this place for my summer job if I could. Everyone was nice and helpful with any questions I had, and no one made me feel dumb for asking. I enjoyed who I worked with and I enjoyed the hours they gave me, and were willing to let me switch my hours for school."
good,"Working at Ulta gave me more customer experience and the ability to express myself in a comfortable and safe environment. I adored my coworkers and my managers were nothing but supportive and helpful. Work was never too strenuous and I was always able to be doing something.  The hardest part was the early morning deliveries and restocking the entire floor but again, my coworkers made it enjoyable."
good,Typical days at work are fun and learning experience! Managers are always trying to assure employees are taken care of as well as their customers! Nothing is hard as long as you set your mind forth.
good,The management was really great! From the co-workers that i met there seemed really great to work with. Great start if you are looking at a career in cosmetology.
good,I love the staff at Ulta and the managers are flexible with the schedule since I am a full-time student. I would absolutely recommend working in an environment like this.
good,Upper level management team was very professional and cared deeply about employees. Great incentives given to employees. Great health benefits. I definitely recommend Ulta.
good,"Was hired for part time Beauty Advisor but mostly worked on delivery day and stocking instead of being a cashier (fine with me). I always got time I requested off and management was very understanding when I had to quit due to my husband's health. They sent me a card that coworkers signed after I left and the manager/supervisors all thanked me for my hard work. Constructive criticism was helpful and all employees were friendly/approachable if I had questions. The only con was that most days, never given a break (especially on Sunday)."
good,"I enjoy working here, I love the store however the fact that i am not able to grab as much hours as i need is definitely a con for me It is a work environment where gossip can spread..However depending on your managers all should be fine."
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Ulta. The holiday season was a bit stressful but it was still fun! Everyone worked together as a team and it was a great environment to be in.
good,"Ulta has a full service salon, including skin care. You have room to grow your business.  It's a great starter job for an esthetician.  You can't do peels here though. That's a major con for me."
good,Fun coworker and enjoyed my time there the termination of seasonal employees was a little cutthroat but I loved my job their and stocking and working the cash register was a fun experience for me but I preferred working the floor and stock work over the cash wrap.
good,"Fun team, great place to work, amazing discounts. Not enough pay. The management is awesome. I love working here I just wish the pay was better. I am part-time and only make $9 an hour when business is slow. Otherwise, I make 43% of what i put in behind the chair."
good,Greet customers and meet thier needs. Demostrate how to use products and educate client and staff on benefits and application of skincare and cosmetics. I managed the sale floor ensuring all displays and merchandise are as they should be.
good,I was the Merchandise Manager which entailed my team and me to set the new tab as well as put daily freight out. I was responsible for inventory controls adjusting PI.
good,"They do not give too many hours, so this is a good second job to have or a good job if you are still going to school full time. We do not get paid as much as we should per hour. However, the vibe there makes up for the low pay. Managers are nice, discount is amazing, and they are flexible with other job schedules, school schedules, and anything else you may need to work around."
good,"Great place to grow with from a little over 300 stores to nearly 1200 stores. The combination of the growth curve, innovation, willingness to invest in the business, and how plugged into the business the senior team leadership is. There will always be more work than time, more opportunities than resources while they're in this growth mode. You'll pick-up 2-3 years of experience for every 1 here."
good,"My experience at Ulta in Chapel Hill, NC was a great experience. I had wonderful managers and co-workers. A typical day at Ulta for me was restocking shelves, keeping stations clean and helping customers find the right product for them. Helping customers was my favorite part of my job. I would say the hardest part of the job was inconsistent hours, sometimes you would work 15+ hours in one week and other weeks you may only work 4 hours."
good,"Ensures accuracy of cash drawer"
good,"Loved the job overall, just did not think it was right that gm at the time harassed me for calling in because my mother was in the hospital, and the district manager did nothing about it. Other than that it was great! Benefits were perfect, medical, 401k, ect."
good,"•	Makes eye contact, smiles, and promptly acknowledges and greets each guest entering the store, or guests within close proximity while moving throughout the store."
good,Ulta is a store that provides all around customer experience to all customers who walk through the door. Ulta works together as a team to provide a positive working experience.
good,"busy and enjoyable place to work, able to learn a lot about wide range of products from professional hair care to prestige makeup."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting all our customers that come in the door, assisting them with any questions they have and check them out at the front, as a prestige beauty advisor, I would have to make sure we are stocked in all brands throughout the store, and at the end of the day I would change all trash bags and clean up the prestige area and be walked out by a manager. I've learned how you should treat your clients/customers is ""treat them the way they would like to be treated"" instead of ""treat them how you would like to be treated"".  Management and co-workers at Ulta were great, the team there was very knowledgeable and very kind. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job has to be when inventory comes in at four on Thursday mornings and we have to be there to stock. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be when I help the customers find the perfect lipstick (or whatever it is they're looking for) that makes them feel beautiful."
good,"I have learned so much working for Ulta. I have, in my two years, learn to excel in my selling skills, How to improve my customer service relations, Manage employees fairly and with accountability and expand my love of retail operations."
good,Ulta is an exciting place to work. There are a variety of cosmetics. Something for everyone in their price range. Management and colleagues are a pleasure to work with. The guest are very pleasant.
good,Such a fun and inviting workplace. Enjoyed the constant training provided to better serve our customers. Always staying up to date with the assortment of product.
good,One of the key parts of a beauty adviser at Ulta includes making sure to go the extra mile to make sure that guest leaves completely happy with the products you present them with and also being  able to educate them on how to use them at home.
good,This is a nice place to work if you are new to retail. Sales associates don't have personal sales goals but are required to contribute to the goal of each department and line if working in the prestige department. Some heavy lifting is required if you don't work in the salon but it's not too bad. At times it may get hectic due to sales but nothing too crazy. Good experience to see how every aspect of a store should be ran.
good,"The discount is awesome, and the company really cares about its employees. There is alot of heavy lifting, and time on your feet though. If you can get past that its a wonderful atmosphere!"
good,"I joined the Ulta team in 2013 for the opening of a new store.  A typical day at Ulta consists of either opening or closing the store and in between interacting with customers and helping them find the products they need or services they wish to have done.  Management  seem to have a short sighted view on workplace relations and how the employees interact with each other.  But most of the time it is an amazing place with equally amazing employees that can make your entire day.  The hardest part of the job would have to be accepting some of the decisions that management make, but it is part of the job."
good,"I loved working for Ulta because of the amazing management team that they have on Colorado Blvd. They have endless opportunities for education on products, service skills, and customer relations. The women I worked with and for are hard working and dedicated to the company. The one drawback is the extremely strict attendance policy and somewhat outdated timeclock management. No matter how legitimate the reason may be for missing work, you can be dismissed after an extremely limited number of days or in the case of the timeclock you cannot punch in or out within 5 minutes of scheduled time. I enjoyed working her very much. They do show their appreciation to their employees in many ways and the gratis (free products) is outstanding."
good,"A day at work... busy day- running from one end of the store to the other, stocking, selling things, cashiering, security, janitorial, etc. Quiet day- cleaning."
good,"This is a company that you want to work for! They treat you as a person not a number. They care about your growth and help you develop to get where you need to be! They are a frugal company which allows them to grow and open around 30 stores each year! With this economy, they are very smart. As a manager, you get the tools you need to develop your team, as well as your business! It's fool proof. I LOVE MY JOB."
good,i enjoy working for ULTA. i love the people i work for and with. i just cant make the 3hr round trip drive anymore.
good,"Good temporary job, smooth paces, fun environment. Very easy to learn the system, point of sale is very efficient and Upbeat environment with a diverse population."
good,Working at Ulta was very fun. I enjoyed learning about new products. Also demonstrating the new products was very fun. My coworkers and management were very nice.
good,"Every employee at ulta is extremely friendly and definitely makes you feel like you're part of a family. I adore working there. From the salon to the retail employees, everyone is upbeat and ready to get things done every day."
good,"Fun and exciting, needs more staff and a little better training. Great place to work if your a manger or working for a brand. beauty advisor might just be a cashier or tasking but there is room for growth."
good,"I have really enjoyed my time with Ulta Beauty. I have learned a lot about sales and leadership skills, which I am required to use for every shift. Highly Recommend this employer!"
good,"Knowledgeable associates, skilled and experienced management, outstanding general management. Ample break/rest periods, flexible holiday hours, great weekend hours"
good,"A typical day at work for me was coming in at 7 am to clean the store and restock items, making sure everything was faced and put in its right place. I learned a lot more about products and where everything is in the store. I also learned more about everything in Pro Hair than I did before. The management was fine. I noticed they over hired a bit and then hours would be scarce. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job would have to be upset customers, from it being where we were completely out of a product and they didn't want us to order it for them or us being out of a free gift with purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be who I got to work with. There was people that definitely made the job more fun and the day go by faster."
good,Ulta beauty gave me an opportunity to grow within myself and with my work career. It helped me advance my customer service and relationship with customers. Working with beauty it helped me analyze different fields in the industry.
good,"Ulta is an amazing place to work for students, good pay and Felixable schedules however there are no commission and bonuses and it is hard to move up."
good,There are numbers you have to hit in order to get a raise or even more hours. There is no potential in you moving up in the company. A lot of the times the numbers sound unreasonable.
good,"Love the job.. "
good,I have been working at Ulta for almost a year. Within my first three months I was promoted from Beauty Advisor to Lead Cashier. I enjoy working there. My manager assures to provide leadership development opportunities and collaborative environment.
good,"Sometimes the customers just dont make it worth it. ulta is a great company and its a great job if you love makeup and customer service. Events are fun and my managers are great, but the selling push and credit card and loyalty requirements kind of suck."
good,Managers are easy to communicate with. The culture at work always made us feel connected. I enjoyed how we would always have set goals at work that we were able to progress to. Maybe the hardest part about this job was waking up for shipment days.
good,"it was a lot of fun working at ultra. all the managers were really great, and always worked with your schedule. the best part for me was organizing all the products, and the discount was great."
good,"They have a percentage chart on your productivity posted on the board so it motivates you to be faster which helps the day go by faster. My manager was great. He was very understanding, helpful, and motivating."
good,"It’s a good place to work for. It’s a company owned by women for men and women interested in the beauty industry. Friends become family after a while and it’s a team effort environment. working at Ulta you can get a great start to your career as a hairdresser. You will get a base pay which most salons don't offer while building your clientele. Redken is a good brand and trusted by many. I do feel like they drag their feet on new services involving nails, extensions, available tools and many other areas of cosmetology education. It's also very difficult because you are in a retail environment which means you are going to be interrupted constantly by the phone, retail team who don't know hair and guests in the store. The company also manages the salon like a retail environment losing that quality feeling from a higher end salon"
good,"Great customer relations, great products, clean stores and very nice coworkers and management. The customers were super nice and it was easy to bond with everyone."
good,Ulta was a great place to work. I was new to the area and working at ulta made me gain friends quickly. The management was great and so understanding when my husband deployed and I had to get surgery. I had to relocate mid year to a location with no ulta and was truly disappointed that I couldn't relocate. the discount there is also pretty great considering the prices of prestige brands.
good,"It's a fun place to work, I'd say there isn't any favoritism and everyone gets treated equally. If you want lots of hours this job isn't for you, it's definitely a part time gig. It's rare to get scheduled over 30 hours, but you can definitely pick up shifts."
good,I really like working here. I love to interact with my customer with new products we have on the shelves. You only wear black and white which make getting ready for work easy. There make up all over the place so you never go bare and you also get to try new when the come to the store
good,"Ulta is a very pleasant place to work. I thoroughly enjoy the environment I work in and the people I work with, especially my managers. This job is not hard as long as you're a determine individual."
good,"I loved working there. Benefits were good for management except for the merchandise service coordinator that was not offered health insurance or vacation, but had great dental insurance. The atmosphere is fun and they really consider employee opinions. Mostly felt appreciated for my work. Great opportunities to move up quickly."
good,As soon as you walk in and begin working you feel at home. Everyone is kind and very helpful if there's any problems. A typical day is a steady pace and relaxing.
good,"My typical day her at Ulta includes cashing out customers, answering customer questions and stocking inventory. I love my co-workers only because they are all girls and I have met some new friends. The most stressful part about the job is working in a fast paced environment when stocking our shelves for truck day because we have only a short amount of time to get all the product on the shelves before the store opens. The best part of the job is how fun the work environment is."
good,What i learned working here is everyone is friendly. Working there was pretty easy and slow. Overall it was a good working experience.
good,Ulta was a really fun place to work. You got to meet people from other companies and learn about their product to get a true knowledge of what they were selling so you knew you could stand behind it. Management still needed training. Co-Workers were enthusiastic but lacked in getting the job done.
good,"I loved working at ulta, it is a terrific place! Management was wonderful as well. It was a long commute for me and thats the only reason why I left."
good,"Typical day at work I would Stock and replenish items on shelves , work at cash register and answer phone calls. "
good,"I had a seasonal position during the winter season. The work environment was fun because I love makeup, and I wish I could've advanced to another position but there wasn't one available after the holiday."
good,"A typical day at ULTA is busy because you have to be able to multi-task and be able to complete your job. While doing all of this you have to be able to help the guest. Operationally there are many different things that have to be completed such as damages, returns, go backs, planograms, ad-set, replenishment, return to vendor, cycle counts, and processing truck. The management in the store is for the most part able to work together however if a new manager is hired and is not operationally sound and cannot adapt to ULTA's culture they will struggle. The co-workers are easy to work with and take little direction with following up. I learned how to wear multiple hats at ULTA because of the limited payroll and learned how to have patience with the guests and other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the guests."
good,my only regret was  leaving this place. had good pay good benefits before i moved pisitions i loved the people i worked with there were always room for advancement. some of the managers were difficult to work with (the reason why i left) if i would have stayed in my first position i would still be working there.
good,normal day is stock/ cash and help customers. learn about different makeup and hair products. some issues with management/ lack of managers needed. nice coworkers. enjoyed helping customers and learning about makeup
good,I love love LOVE working for Ulta Beauty. Everyone gets a long and it's just a peaceful and fun upbeat work place. Only down fall is that I haven't been scheduled to work in two weeks due to budget. Other than that I love working there. Work can get busy but it makes the day go by faster!
good,Always something going on! Enjoyable work atmosphere! Had to constantly think on your feet.
good,"Picking and packing items from conveyor using scan gun. It was a seasonal job, i made top scanner three times in my first two weeks. Fast paced weekly pay."
good,I enjoy the atmosphere of Ulta Beauty because the salon crew makes me feel like part of the family. They are helpful in answering all questions I have.
good,I loved working at ulta; however i only worked there a short time. i loved learning about an working with makeup and the workplace culture was competitive but nice. the hardest part of the job was stocking the store because i helped open the store. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and generally being around makeup
good,The company has amazing benefits as far as associate discounts and additional discounts are given. It is not a high-pressure job and the people that work there are fun to work with. I have worked at two different Ulta locations and loved both.
good,"I loved my job at ULTA!! The company itself is all about inclusion and work-life balance was awesome! As a company they value their employees. Being a GM there was wonderful, just make sure you build a strong team to back you."
good,"I love makeup and I enjoy assisting customers with their questions. I am a prestige advisor so I get paid slightly more than others, I attend a good amount of makeup and skincare trainings,  I color match guests, and I assist them hands-on in selecting products. I am happy with my job. The only downfall is the extreme lack of hours given to employees that aren't managers or full-time employees. I average out about 12 hours a week since I started working for the company about 4 months ago. This job would be ideal as a secondary job on the side to make pocket change."
good,Fun place to work with plenty of opportunity for advancement. Great Company overall with lots of growth.Training could be more comprehensive so expect to be thrown right in to your role.
good,"Overall happy with my job at Ulta. it’s just time to look for something less taxing on my body and i enjoy doing. The people are great, management is great."
good,"I love this job and the store manager. No complaints. Holidays in retail are always tough but we were prepared. Everyone gets aolng, drama free workplace for the most part."
good,Working at ULTA is very enjoyable and time passes very fast.  The team is very friendly and welcoming to new members. I had an easy transition when I began working there; the team trained me and helped me feel comfortable.
good,Typically a day at work at Ulta you either are stationed in the prestige makeup section for your whole shift or you are at the cash wrap for your whole shift. Both are fun places to be and I don't mind staying in once place the whole time because you will usually only work 4 or 5 hour shifts. The discount you get on makeup is great and is definitely the best part of the job. The worst part of the job is that the corporation of Ulta only gives each stores a limit of hours and it makes it hard for anyone to get hours. Pretty much no one but the managers work over 20 hours a week. It is better as a second job but hard to keep as your only job. Management is great especially at the store I work at and between that and the discount I like keeping it as a second job that earns me a little extra money.
good,"a typical day is talking to customers about new products, giving the best recommendations for products. color matching customers, sometimes going to brand training if recommended by management."
good,"I would work with a lot of complaints and management problems, I would have to figure out a solution that was both fair for the customer and the worker. "
good,"I had a great time working for ULTA. I gained the confidence, customer service, and technical skills I needed to help me build my business as a stylist which later lead to a promotion as the Assistant Salon Manager."
good,"I absolutely love my job at Ulta, if you apply yourself you can make a lot of money as a stylist, the management team is always supportive and there to boost you to meet certain goals. "
good,"I would usually start at 7am and do morning paperwork and tasking depending on what day it was, specific tasks to be completed. I managed the schedule, the associates and the floor. I would do planograms, worked on damages, sorting and gathering money, merchandising the store to company standards. The hardest part of the job was the demanded hours of retail. The most enjoyable part of the job was tasking."
good,I loved getting to meet some amazing clients and learn some great new techniques. My co-workers at The Ulta Salon were always energetic and made sure quality was always a top priority. From my time at Ulta I learned how to work efficiently and upsell to a higher ticket price.
good,"i enjoyed it but they expected more than what i was told to give them. i mean im not saying im not  a people person. but if my job entitles me to do 4 things , i shouldnt be responsible for 12 . if i am to be responsible for 12 , i should be told ."
good,"There could be some improvements within the staff but over all it was a good place to work in and i got my job done, ive been in the makeup industry for a while"
good,"Good people to work with and great and friendly environment,good place to learn all departments of a warehouse. The best part of working here is the 3 day weekends."
good,My time working at ULTA Beauty Distribution Center was cut short due to unexpected events but i’d keep working there because it was a good working experience for me and also a good environment. I learned a lot of new things and challenged myself with my work in a good way to better my working.
good,It's a great place to work. It inproved my life style and helped me over come my shy personality. I usually started my day off by opening the store and making sure everything was in place. I really enjoyed meeting new customers every day.
good,"Ulta was fun to work at first but they make it impossible for you to move up in the company. The pay is terrible. The customers are rude. And management is no help. If you are sick and need days off they put ""points"" against you and will fire you even if you were hospitalized."
good,"They never hire enough associates which creates a really hostike, full of tension environment: ( what u love doing becomes highly stressful and dreadful"
good,Ulta at first was an amazing company to work for until you've been there for awhile then they treat you like poo...not competitive pay at all and they expect you to work your butt off. There is no opportunity for advancement in this company either.
good,"Not enough steady hours, unfortunately. I would have loved working there longer if I could have gotten a set, full-time schedule. It was a great job overall,"
good,"The manager makes or breaks the team "
good,"I love the company itself and the policies but my personal experience with managers and girls that work there was not good. I would say, it’s a great company to work for but go in a few times and get to know the staff a little. Some of the people I worked with sabotaged each other or created drama. The managers were unprofessional in managing the workplace and would often join in with others to create drama."
good,I loved working for this retailer and would work for them again. The hours are really crazy and inconsistent so it's not a good place if you have young children but overall a great company!
good,"fun co-workers, managment could use some tweeking, for the most part the customers and co-workers make it both enjoyable and hard at the same time."
good,"I was one of the girls who got hired as a beauty adviser and was super excited to work at ulta. After our training was done, me and a group of about 15 other girls were stuck coming in at 5 am to unload and restock merchandise. While all the other girls met with vendors and got free stuff, we would have to watch. When we all finally got fed up and expressed our concerns, management said they would take care and rotate our shift and that never happened. Long story short, i left after a few months. Hired in May, left in july"
good,i loved working for ulta beauty but the only thing was that they would make a job schedule and if an employee has the day off they would call and be upset that you did not have the day to be at work and help. If you didn't show up when you would tell them you are out of town they would threaten you.
good,This job lacked employment advancement and was so unorganized. The management was very messy with the employees and showed lack of interest for the job.
good,Learned alot. Got to work daily on team building. Dealing with a variety of customers. Didnt get as many hours as needed. Overall I loved my experience with Ulta.
good,"It’s alright for a job you just deal with a lot of dumba ss customers. The discount is a plus but I wish it was more. My coworkers are pretty good cool, but management could do a l o t better in communication"
good,"I worked here while I was in college. The pay is not very good, but they are very flexible with hours, which made it ideal for a student like myself. This job teaches you organizational, time management, as well as multitasking skills. The best part of the job was being around people who are interested in the products that the store sells."
good,"Ulta was a stressful work place but I loved the environment, my co workers were very friendly and helpful. although the management could improve. if I could have gotten more hours and a little bit higher of a pay I would have never left."
good,Lancome is a wonderful line ..i really enjoyed the products  and  Lancome rep was super helpful and and extreme joy..my coworkwrs were a joy as well..the management was extremely strict and didn t allow for  any artistic freedom
good,"This company started out well and I was able to go to the next level in the company at my site and when I was offered a position, I left pressured to accept the position then when I turned it down, I was not an,e to go out for another position and after months later it was still effecting me. I left since I left the company would not allow me to move pass my position."
good,I had a great time working with customers and giving advice. I enjoyed how fast paced it was. I learned how to keep my composure when customers are unhappy and how to help them.
good,"Very sad that this job was only temporary. I learned so much about beauty products, make up, hair colors, what was healthy for your body and skin. Everyone was real nice, the management worked with you on your schedule."
good,The work was great the issue is the layers of management. The layers of management is crazy with many managers working at the same time. The managers couldn't agree with priorities or assignments.
good,Loved working there but the pay was minimum wage. Great if you want to get your foot in the door for the beauty industry. All staff are nice but need better managers
good,Managers manipulative of rules and with holding information. Handle the gratis very shady. Lots of favoritsm. Very catty workplace. But moral and goals of ulta as a company great. Good brands good loyalty program and services.
good,"Training always hasn’t been the best. Trial and error is how I’ve learned to become a better manager. Our old manager always had favorite associates that got away with everything from stealing time to not being held accountable for absences. This is a great company but, unfortunately isn’t ran by great people sometimes."
good,"Training available but management wasn’t the greatest. Some of the managers were great but as whole, the corporate management wasn’t good. Very quick to dismiss over opinions vs actual work or how I added to the environment."
good,"Working at ulta had the typical disadvantages of retail i.e. varying hours, crazy customers, and working for managers who are not always professional.  I worked in two different stores and one was amazing but the store manager at the other was a nightmare very unprofessional and rude.  With that being said it was a fun job i love makeup so getting to work with it everyday and do various training with brands was amazing.  The product and services discount was amazing."
good,"I love working for ULTA. My coworkers are amazing, and the atmosphere is very positive, and family like environment. I love that I get to do what I love all the time."
good,"open to only license stylist and barbers. Ok pay and benefits when I was there. Can be boring, due to nature of the business and staffed mostly only single coverage."
good,"Nice girls, surrounded by makeup and people who love it. A typical day is running the cash wrap or answering questions about products. Also doing color matches and swatches."
good,"I loved the job, but the management was bias and unfair. They did underhanded things with confidential information. If you ever had a discrimination issue, it wont be handeled properly."
good,"It was my dream job but not enough hours to live on. I started at 25 hours a week hoping to get to full time, but after a few months they hired a few more stylists & my hours were cut."
good,Love love love the company but the pay isnt enough and no benefits are given to one of the managment positions. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the constant changes within the compay.
good,"working for ulta was always fun, seeing new products and helping customers find what they needed and making them happy was my favorite parts. i loved my coworkers and managers, they always seemed to make things more fun."
good,"Not a lot future as a carrer provider poor management, so many corporate rules made in a desk with no idea of how is done. Complicated young kids with CEL Phone on their hands with all the time in their life"
good,Ulta is a decent place to work for a decent check. Just like any other retail store they have high expectations for small pay
good,"I enjoyed working around the make-up and wearing make-up to work daily, but there were a lot of problems."
good,Was able to have room for advancement within my first year of working at  Ulta. Was promoted to lead cashier. Very enjoyable interacting with different guests that would come in.
good,"A wonderful place to work Full time. If you go part time then there are not many opportunities for you. Also, if you want to advance in the Ulta world, you need to be willing to relocate to any store in the district. Being a key holder and having all of the same responsibilities as the other managers, but not being offered fulltime or benefits, or even a decent pay is the reason i am finally leaving."
good,"Motivation to do more with my passion of makeup. I enjoyed being able to work hands on with customers, providing them with my expertise. Making their day was the best part."
good,"Ulta in Oxford, MS does have poor management, but if you're going to work there, you would enjoy it. The cons are there aren't many hours and management is not all the time good."
good,"there was a lot of turnover rates for both employees and managers. nobody was on the same page, and rules changed a lot, therefore employees were getting in trouble because ""it wasn't what they were taught"""
good,"I loved working at Ulta! It was busy during the holidays, but overall it was a good experience.  The people I worked with were great and everyone helped everyone.  It was quite sometime ago so I am not sure what the culture is like now."
good,Everyone I worked with was always fun and upbeat. With a passion for beauty and makeup there was rarely a boring day in my location. Always busy and always something to do.
good,A typical work day for a Designer at Ulta consists of occasional guests during your early career and stocking shelves. I felt as if the expectations for the Designer 1 are rather high as you are just starting to build your clientele. I enjoy the people I work around everyday.
good,I only worked here for about a Monthe but I hated it due to the fact that the Managers were so disorginized
good,"I get to do the thing I love the most, hair. I enjoy getting to know my clients and meeting new people every day. Seeing someone feel transformed because of their new look."
good,"The ulta corporation is a work experience full of customer service. I am constantly assisting the customers needs. For example by being a hair receptionist in the salon taking appointments, doing inventory accounts in the computer."
good,Working here has its perks and the people are great.  they provide a Creative and positive space. your in a team of positivity and you are to give it to customers. Definitely a rewarding job and position.
good,I liked being able to work with makeup and skin care. I was able to help customers pick out cosmetics and skin care that was perfect their skin type. Keeping the store clean and stocked.
good,Very easy going and nice work flow. Managers are very helpful and want to see employees move up in the company. Would go back to work there anytime. Would reccomend
good,Had to walk around the plant to make sure all the machines were running correct. Had to do prevented maintenance on all machines. Clean shop. Stayed until they moved out.  I was committed.
good,"I loved it there! There just came a better opportunity for my career so I had to leave. Great customer services skills were learned! It’s about teamwork, with you love working with others & the beauty industry is for you, I’d suggest applying"
good,"Really loved working for Ulta. Great atmosphere, friendly, informative, flexible hours, management was great. They were fair. Really loved working with customers. Also loved learning new things everyday"
good,"Sometimes understaffed, but overall a great place to learn and work in an environment you enjoy. Sales goals are encouraged to be met, and you meet a lot of brand reps."
good,The employees and customers made me feel so welcomed. I was excited to view and sale new products. I cared about what I sold to customers and gave them my honest option and suggestions that would compliment them.
good,"My time at Ulta Beauty was short but it was such a great experience and so fun being able to work there. I loved my time there, everyone was very motivational and helpful."
good,"If you care about hours : management, boutiques, lead cashier, task"
good,Ulta was a great job to work at and also had amazing benefits i would recommend this job to anyone super easy and great pay also lots of opportunity to move up.
good,LOVED the job and the place! Management was horrible and played favorites a lot! That made me sad and I ultimately quit. It happens at a lot of places.
good,Work at ulta has really been a privilege.  Even to see it expand the way it has. If I could work here the rest of my life doing different functions I would. The head leaders dont tolerate and disrespect from employees or supervisors.  This is not the type of job where you have a problem with a supervisor and they overlook it. They will get it squared away. Nobody is above anyone at Ulta. We are a family there.
good,"Working at Ulta is a life-changing experience. Being able to return after an 18-month absence was a lifesaver for me. Working with customers was a great opportunity for growth. Thank you, Ulta!"
good,"Ulta Beauty Inc. was an awesome experience for me, and I enjoyed my years working there. I would love to bring the skills I learned at Ulta to a new job opportunity!"
good,"great place to work for the pay"
good,"Slow at times, pay was okay for short work days, was hired as full time but only worked part time hours, general manager was great, salon manager at the time preferred to be pushy and argue. She is no longer there though and the new salon manager is absolutely incredible."
good,"The first Ulta I worked at, I loved. After I transferred though, I didn’t love my job as much. I really think it just depends on which Ulta you work at, but overall it’s a great company."
good,Overall a good company to work for. I worked as a technician in the maintenance dept @ the Dallas dc. It is a nice air conditioned facility. They often give employees large boxes of product which my wife really enjoyed.
good,can be a veryfast paced environment but its fun to work here. The benefits are a plus. Most of the costumer are great and some no so much. Coworkers are cool.
good,"Enjoy the people who work here, the brand vendors who take the time to visit the stores and train the staff on new products. Wonderful company participates in Second chance hiring for people with criminal back grounds, very diverse and open minded. Highlights new challenges and embraces change, decent pay but it is a lot of work. Not always easy but the payoff is full filling."
good,"Such a fabulous place to work.  Management is extremely fair and objective, where they specialize in situational leadership.  I have always felt welcome and amongst my people.  We are a family and I know that no matter what,  at the end of the day,  ANY coworker would drop anything for you.  Everyone has each other's back and I am PROUD to be a part of such a team.   We graciously accept all newcomers as a part of our ULTA family.   Work is fun while being simultaneously productive, We work hard without feeling pressuredand take great pride in staying in the top spot"
good,"There isn't a hard day at work here, if you love what you do then you'll be perfect. Everyone is amazing to work with. Overall great work environment."
good,Sometime the job is difficult but it is fun. I enjoy working with the customers in finding what they need around the store. I have also made many friends working there.
good,This company is fast paced with a high need for attention to detail. Great company and is pretty flexible with outside of work but you can plan on always working weekends.
good,"The environment is great as long as you have the right people working with you. It’s not a hard job, but it can be a little demanding. Overall, it’s a decent job."
good,There is I very high and pressuring demand to meal goals. Our salon was brand new and our upper management expected us to be able to make $4000 weekly... unreal
good,Great work environment. Positive vibes. Hard to get more hours. Great place to start when trying to get into the beauty industry but not to stay u less you’re a manager or lead.
good,I really enjoyed the experience I had at Ultra.  Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances I had to relocate to be with family.  I enjoyed the environment and loved helping the customers.
good,A typical day was upbeat and enjoyable. Employers were very kind to one another and helpful when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all of customers and trying to satisfy their needs.
good,I had a great manager. I worked part time but wanted a full time position. If they had anything available I would have stayed. I am thinking of going back next year. I miss it a lot.
good,I think that all mangers make a difference and that store manager at the time was awesome. she taught me lots and helped me to grow. I had the freedom to create and train a team with no turn over... I left because corporate said they weren't giving anymore raises and It was time to grow
good,"Ulta is a amazing place to work for, from free training too the amazing holiday partys. Ive never had a job that was so welcoming. Ive learned alot about not just makeup but how to run a business like a well oiled machine. Even the management was welcoming to any questions."
good,"I enjoyed coming to work everyday. Co-workers and manager were amazing. They made me feel comfortable with them, and also with the work place by ensuring that i knew what needed to be done and what was expected. I was able to learn more about cosmetics/beauty/skincare/fragrances/hair and what works for different people. I loved this job very much."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Was able to work within the region and make a path for new opportunities. Provided an autonomous work place. The company provided a fun work environment.
good,the hardest part of my job was never knowing when i was going to get off for the day. other than that ot was a fun work environment and i would encourage others to work with them i feel like they had the best manager there is
good,Ulta Beauty strives to guarantee 100% customer service satisfaction. Ulta beauty has strong rules and benefits. Always puts the guest first. fun work environment.
good,Great atmosphere. Great staff. Majority of the employees are experienced and have vast skills to perform the job to complete standards. Worked to maintain the store.
good,overall I had a wonderful experience and only left to better opportunities. my managers coworkers and vendors all work well together. its retail what do you expect
good,"Lets start off with an amazing first job, though not long term they knew my wants and needs of experience and fulfilled them to the fullest. I did start cosmetology school which lead me to unfortunately having to say goodbye to an amazing group of now lifelong friends and co-workers"
good,"Great place for young people looking to work in cosmetics, and gain retail and management experience! You will get to know your clients well, because it's a great place to shop and learn!!"
good,The managers were friendly and encouraging. A regular work day is fast paced. Because I was part time I could unexpectedly go from 30 hours a week to 12. I could be very inconvenient.
good,No matter your position Ulta offers a variety of positions that you can advance into. Management is always understanding and fair to it's employees. You may also apply for health care and 401k benefits.
good,I enjoyed the team that I worked with. I left because I started school and the location of my school. My management team was awesome and the training perks were exciting.
good,I loved setting up the Ulta sales floor and putting the products on the shelves. I always felt appreciated and I felt pride knowing that the work I was doing was helping set up a beautiful new store.
good,daily chat ins to discuss weekly and monthly goals
good,"Hands on training, proactive employees. Great opportunity for continuous education in skin care, makeup and cosmetics. Room for advancement and growth is always possible with effort."
good,New To The Hair Industry.Great place to start and build up clientele. Able to work with a teacher from school. It was Great. Easy to meet new people and build your own salary
good,Started my cosmetology experience here. Very Comfortable atmospher to adapt to. Very similar to school. Meeting customers in the store shopping made it easy to build your own clientle.
good,I enjoy going into work. My coworkers and the current management are very friendly and encouraging. The most enjoyable part is helping customers with makeup.
good,Great atmosphere! think that managers should not have to work behind the chair. They should focus more on the operations of the salon. Doing both is a great experience though.
good,Its a great company to work for if the right people are doing the right jobs. I generally enjoys working there but the hours were inconsistent and its hard to balance work life with personal when you have children.
good,Working at Ulta Beauty was an amazing learning experience as far as product information. During my time with Ulta my job was to arrive  just before the shipment truck arrived. Upon shipment arrival management would then assign each receiving employee a specific section of the store to distribute store products out to the store floor. The most enjoyable part of working for Ulta was taking customer consultations and seeing new products come through the store. The hardest part of the job was down-stacking of products off shipment pallets.
good,Veey awesome place to work for a second job. Doesn't give you very much work though. Just enjoy the time you get becauase most people get about four hours a week.
good,"Nothing wrong with other employees, managers were lacking in training over time as new managers came in and current employees not given an opportunity to advance."
good,I like working here but I am looking for a full time job with benefits. The management is supportive and I am happy with the work I perform. I like meeting new people and this job affords me that opportunity.
good,I liked working there. I made lifelong friends. I love makeup so that is a plus. I met many new people and made them feel beautiful just by applying a little makeup on them.
good,I love meeting new people each and everyday. I get to do shat I enjoy most which is helping others. I would have to say the hardest part of the job would be how busy we can get being such a successful business.
good,"Learned a lot about different skin care and make-up items, companies, brands, etc. The events they held were very informative also and the employees always had an opportunity to participate in them for some added knowledge about the products."
good,"The general manager of the store never really knew my name, and because she continuously thought I was someone different who would never show up to work, my seasonal position was not continued. However Ulta is a wonderful place to work."
good,"Great selections, Peopled feel welcomed in the store. They are very helpful, the treat all customers with respect. They keep the store very clean also"
good,Great place to work. Great hours. Easy and fun. Would recommend this job to anyone. everyone i talked to there also loved it. Wasnt a bad place to work at all.
good,"If you work in any way for the salon, you get free services whenever there are openings in stylists schedule. It's pretty lax, you just gotta clean stuff and deal with entitled women"
good,"As a Beauty Adviser my job is to maintain the front and work the cashier, Help customers, Answer questions and give advice on new products, also once a week i would do truck and shipments and help restock all merchandise. Not to much labor and can get very busy especially if a new product were released that day."
good,This job kept me on my toes in the best way possible. The experience with beauty products and techniques has helped with my sales experience. Would highly recommend working at this store.
good,"Love the store, hate the management! This is an awesome place as far as pay and benefits, but the salon is all about numbers and nothing about you. In store the salon manager is the most disrespected manager there is and upper management is an absolute nightmare! Multiple people aren't saying this for no reason. The workload is overwhelming at times. If you are desperate for a high paying job and you have your own clientele in a busy location go for it! Other than that don't waste your time."
good,I enjoyed working here. There was always somebody willing to help others. Co-workers and management worked together to better the customers experience.
good,"great environment, fun people. learn a lot about cosmetics, hair products, skin products. you also learn what formulas go great with different types of skin"
good,"I got to learn how to work with difficult management, but resolve issues. I also got to have the experience of networking and building a business. I also got a lot of education of my skills in esthetics and client service."
good,"Working with the ladies a Ulta was a great experiance. I love the enviorment in this industry. Helping a custumer feel good about themselves makes me feel good about myself as well. This is why I became a hairstylist. Learning the lastest products and teaching someone else is the best part of being a consultant because when they walk out the door you give them confedance to be and feel beautiful. The hardest part is not always convincing someone to spend a lil more money for the best, But i always had an alternitive cheaper compatiable product in mind. it all about customer satisfaction."
good,I would recommend this company to anyone willing to work with make up and beauty products also anyone who is a stylist can work in the built in salon in store
good,"ULTA spa is one of the best Spa in town, anyone is recommended to visit and enjoy the super exiting healthy treatment for state of the art customer care and services that exceeds expectation."
good,"good company, moves with the times needs to work harder on relations toward employees. normal company procedures in retail"
good,I loved my time at Ulta. I was hired as the store was just opening and got to see the whole place come together. It was very high energy and the management was very fair and awesome to work with.
good,"Great coworkers, also very respectful"
good,"Loved working there. Everyone is nice to each other, and my job position is awesome because the store isn't open yet. Sometimes it doesn't feel like work because of the environment."
good,Enjoy the fast paced atmosphere. Fun associates and managers. Great moral. customer service and at times trying due to quality in hiring. Great managers
good,It was nice while I was there. I ended up leaving shortly after due to lack of hours and schooling. I did end up having to travel outside of my city limits.
good,"It's a great place to work, with discounts the manager is great but I'm not getting enough hours and insurance is not provided and I have bills to pay."
good,Thanks to Ulta I became a great manager. They tough me everything I know today and of course i've acquired a few things through experience but I will never forget the good instructors who helped me get where i am today.
good,"loved this salon, I loved the training the people, the management, the education, the opportunities, the advancement, the great staff and the classes"
good,Kept together and organized. Great team skills with management and associates. Problems were solved quickly. Communication played a big role in our success
good,The staffing agency I went three was very demanding I could not keep up with the staffing requirements.. I have a family and children that depend on me...
good,"I loved working at Ulta. The salon was inside a beauty supply store. When I didn't have a client, I would walk the sales floor and help various customer, and sometimes give them free consultations."
good,"interacting with customers and learning about retail. management always making sure things are the way there suppose to be. co workers are friendly and know how to work as a team. hardest part of the job is getting people to realize the benefits of rewards card. most enjoyable part of the job is working and interacting with people who love and enjoy makeup, accessories and skin care."
good,"Stick to the sales model, be beauty experts you will have success.  Flexible schedule and perks to help you get products at an employee discounted rate."

good,"I enjoyed my time working for ULTA and loved being able to help customers feel welcomed. My managers were always great and flexible with scheduling, and also worked to provide a fun atmosphere as well."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be greeting customers and being able to be a part of there shopping experience. Showing and teaching the makeup application is so much fun and making them feel much more confident makes me feel like I've done my job.
good,"Either opening or closing the store.  Completing daily tasks.  Sending reports to district managers.  Customer service.  Finding creative and innovative ways of taking care of issues as they arise.  Complete plograms, coach employees, fix schedules, take payments, stock merchandise, send out ups packages, prevent theft with amazing customer service, complete payroll, add or eliminate hours, ordering salon supplies, ordering money for registers, approve sales and return adjustments, markdown merchandise, selling products, putting makeup on customers, color matching foundation and so much more."
good,"A typical day at work if I were opening that day would be to come in and start out of stocks or damages.  I would box certain damages to send back to the maker or simply throw away the damaged items, depending on brand.  Restock shelves.  Check emails.  Then get the tills ready to be counted out.  Get the store ready to be opened and looking nice."
good,"Great place for continuous growth and opportunities to grow with the company."
good,Ulta Beauty is a fabulous place to work for a beauty enthusiast.  Ulta Beauty provides great education and career opportunities.
good,"Loved working here, so much fun! Demanding sales environment but fun products. I learned a lot about the products we sold and also sales techniques. The hardest part of this job was the physical demands of receiving and warehouse that was done on a weekly basis."
good,"The job in general was a very fun, bubbly atmosphere and the other employees and managers were nice and fun. It never really got too busy so it was never really that stressful."

good,"Managing clients' schedule"
good,Its a great company to grow with. Educational classes always provided to give you the tools and knowledge for advancement. Fellow employee's are more like family than co-workers. Enjoyable work environment. You get to go to work everyday and make people look and feel beautiful.

good,"Exciting and productive."
good,"Typical work day was starting the day off by setting batteries in forklifts and making sure they all ran. then assist employees and help supervisor with orders and pulls. "
good,"Great culture, low pay.  GMs bonus from unused payroll, therefore offer minimum wage to part time associates, and no raises for management."
good,"Job duties included:"
good,"lead cashier"
good,"Stock shelves, do planograms, customer service.  All my co-workers are younger than me by at least 20 years.  I play Mom to them a lot.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the special customer.  I like to make a customer happy with little freebies we have."

good,"After greeting every customer, I taught them where to find and how to apply the products best suited for them."

good,what girl doesn't want to get paid to play with makeup all day and communicate with other women.
good,I worked here for a long time and I loved every minute of it. we had fun in the back room with my team and also had fun with the customers out on the floor. I learned how to manage a team and direct them in right direction.
good,"A day at Ulta is a little slow in the morning, but once it hits about 12 and pace speeds up and you get to really interact with the customers and come to know their needs and wants. The management team is awesome, really encouraging the work team to keep us upbeat and cheery. The best part about Ulta is the customers and getting to know them."

good,ULTA Beauty is a fun and exciting place to work at. A typical day consists of ensuring the customer is happy and all of their questions are answered. I am part of the management team and they are a wonderful group to work for. Everyone is understanding and very supportive of one another. The co-workers are exciting to work with and they are always happy and willing to help one another out. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer we are out of a supply or we don't carry a particular product. ULTA Beauty is all about making the customers happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out each customer and finding all of the product they want. Then when that customer comes back and raves about how much they love that product and thank you for your help.
good,This job was a lot of fun because I got to play with make-up all day.Sometimes I would be ask to help to do make-overs. I loved this job because I loved the fact that I was able to help people accentuate their looks! There are all types of different vendors that would come to the store to teach employees about their products so then it would be easy for us to sell.
good,"Great place to work, and the people are wonderful! At the end of the day, you sell makeup and help people look their best; it can't get any better than that!"
good,ULTA is a great place to work. The employees are fun and the managers are respectable.
good,"Ulta is a great company to work for. We have stores everywhere so there is plenty of opportunity for relocating and advancement. "
good,Working at Ulta was really amazing for me. It was wonderful helping guest with anything they needed help with. The employees were very genuine.  The only thing I could say while I was working there I didn’t like how some mangers treated the employees.
good,"I have worked for Ulta for over 7 years, its a fun, fast passed environment that makes it fun working with makeup, the people you work with really make the job, learning new products every time I work!"
good,Good job for a college student or for someone who doesnt have kids or bills. Can move up the ladder quickly if you do great at your job but dont exspect to be a manager.
good,"Fun place to work part time, received 25% off purchases, co-workers were very friendly and management team was awesome. It was only a seasonal job...."
good,My experience at Ulta was great. The worst thing o could complain about was some of the management. But all the customers are super friendly and most of the staff was amazing.
good,I love working for Ulta as a Company but management at my location is terrible. The store needs more structure and order and that starts with management.
good,"I loved working at Ulta and I only quit due to a bad manager who I understand is no longer there. I would absolutely work there again. Everyone is nice, you get to swatch and work with the makeup, plus the occasional gratis is much appreciated"
good,"It served it's purpose, its a really cool job to start out, definetly not the job you are looking for if being a makeup artist is your passion. They only like to book hair appoitments not facials"
good,"I loved working for the company. Going to work every day as a part of the Beauty Culture is fun and exciting. Helping open other locations helped me learn about the company and gave me the opportunity to move up quickly but my experience with the management left me feeling, ""thrown to the wolves""."
good,Always a great friendly place . Meeting different people everyday . Teaching and learning about different makeup skills . Showing great customer service .
good,Ulta was a great experience to have working with make up is one of my passions . I really did enjoy being part of the ulta team and helping customers to find what fits perfectly for them . Making them feel good and confident when they leave with the product was a great feeling.
good,"There are a lot of politics in this business. You barely have any time for family and friends. You do get great health benefits and free products but if you’re looking for something more laid back, this isn’t for you. Be sure to grow thick skin."
good,"I actually loved everyone I worked with. It was a second job to have, and I worked hard. It was a great experience. I even miss it sometimes. I'm sorry they didn't have something closer to me."
good,Who wouldn't like to play with hair and work around your favorite makeup all day? I wish I was able to work full-time there. I'm not used to working such short days and having so many days off. I have to find a second job to have enough money to pay bills and fill in the hours I lost. I was doing 40+ a week but I needed to leave the last business I was with due to poor management and bouncing paychecks so I took a big pay cut to get into the right salon.
good,"I love the friends that I have gained through working here, but the management is not the best at helping you move up in the company. Or giving it to people with everyone having a fair chance. But, I do love the family culture."
good,"This was a great job. The managers were amazing, the customers were nice, sadly I got very few hours. If I had been given more hours I probably would have liked this job more."
good,"I loved working here, learning about the different makeup and products helped me out in the long run, my sisters never had a problem with getting makeup."
good,"Being a lead cashier, there are a lot responsibilities. You are in charge of the front cashier area, but also can be put on the floor to help guests with makeup applications or questions."
good,I loved the customer service opportunities I got to learn by going to conventions and makeup release parties. Getting to work one on one with top brands is always an amazing perk.
good,"The hours just weren't what I was told I would receive. I loved the job itself. Some of the management was great while the others seemed like they didn't care. A typical shift was pretty fun. The same thing never really happened twice. "
good,I did stocking so I stocked all merchandise and ran the register when I was needed. I learned how to apply make up and how to use all the tools to use. My co workers were awesome and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the lack of hours which I had to find another job to live on. The most enjoyable part was seeing all the new brands and trying out to products that came in so I could tell my customers all about them.
good,I loved interacting with customers and always helping them find what they need. I cashiered a lot so I was always talking to people and finding out new things about different people. Management wasn't so great always unorganized.
good,"This company has such high hopes but failed to understand the location of this particular store is going to struggle. I enjoyed being with my co workers very much. We all got along so well. We were all a team no matter what department you worked in. Beings I have previous warehouse experience it was nothing for me to help them stock the shelves when I didn't have any clients and they appreciated it very much, so much that I received recognition for going above and beyond by job title to help them. The hardest part of the job was learning the salonbiz system for appointments but I caught on very quickly."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Co-workers became lifelong friends, good money and fun place to work."
good,"Learned a lot about make up and beauty products."
good,"Honestly, this is the type of retail you want to work in. The people are fun and the products are amazing."
good,New employees should have a lot of knowledge about what's trendy in cosmetics. They should also have losts of patience with customers whose not familiar with make-up.
good,"Great environment, Great management but no room for growth  Typical day as a beauty advisor Basic requirements for cashier, also helping customers with makeup,  color matching, keeping store tidy."
good,Had a great experience working here only left due to health issues at the time and it was only a part time position.  Would of liked a full time position with the company
good,"Good place to work, good pay, good benefits i really like working in a fast pace environment, never got bored. customers were always friendly as well."
good,Enjoyed my time working there.  Great workers and customers sometimes lol. Pay could be better cause we have to deal with different women personalities.
good,"A serious!"
good,Working at Ulta is fun. There are immense opportunities as long at you are doing the job successfully. They train you well. There's always an answer for every situation. Ulta will take you where you want to go.
good,"Working with Ulta was a dream! With the opportunity to advance as you do (cosmotology school, etc). Each customer that came in left feeling better than when they came due to OUR team work and my individual efforts to make sure my clients were happy."
good,"I loved working for ULTA as a company but not for the Alaska district. The associates and most managers are great! But the District Manager and GM are very toxic. The DM just looks the other way to avoid coming to realize she makes poor hiring decisions for higher management. If she doesnt like you she will get rid of you. Voicing to HR got me fired, so doing whats right to her is considered being a cancer. HR let me down. ONCE AGAIN WORKING FOR ULTA AS A COMPANY IS AMAZING as long as your not in ALASKA/HAWAII district. Fired for calling the cops and going to retrieve a license plate number a whole month later since I've been calling HR. Always do the right thing, yet not if your in AK they dont like you for calling them out on their faults then you get fired."
good,"Very fun and lively place to work! Hours are terrible, but that's retail management. The pay is excellent, with decent benefits! Product training is minimal, so advocate to take home samples! They are stingy about gratis, but it's crucial to know how the products perform. Fast-paced, creative and stimulating work environment. A lot of late nights during peak business days (Christmas, summertime)"
good,It is an ok company to work for they have great benefits they could use a little help with work life balance. I really enjoyed my job there and had the most amazing team members.
good,"I was promoted to Lancome boutique Counter Mgr. position after 8 months after performing as top sales beauty advisor. The company job duties, sales goals and business metrix are aligned with Lancome's sales objectives."
good,It is a wonderful company to work for. i wish they would make it easier to get full time hours. You don't get paid time off or sick days unless you are a full time employee but make it almost impossible to be full time.
good,We get new products everyday. We get products to test. Very fast paced. Store is busy from the time it opens till close! Management kept us informed of all new and upcoming promotions.
good,"I enjoyed working at Ulta. They offer a lot of education on products. Flexible with your schedule. Everyone works well together, everyone is very friendly and is all about the customer experience."
good,"I loved working with fun, lovable and exciting team with management. It's definitely a very cool, classy and stress free  working environment where i could learn and grow with the company."
good,"Great place to get beauty knowledge and sales experience. You get to build great relationships with upper management, and they really care  about you."
good,"Fun upbeat bright environment to work in. Flexible work hours. Growth within store walls such as cashier, makeup expert, floor sales,shipment and stock associate."
good,"If you love makeup, this is a wonderful place to work!"
good,"Never a dull moment and teamwork is a huge part of making this job work for you. Managers are very positive and outgoing, high traffic locations can get stressful during holiday."
good,"Working at Ulta is a great experience, managers are extremely friendly and willing to work with you. Hours may be a little low but is worth staying and working."
good,Any key holder position within Ulta is a wonderful growing and learning process for anyone with no more than a day prior to managerial work. It helps with teaching a person the basic roles to being a keyholder and operational manager. The MSC has a primary job of unloading and dispatching products to their designated shelves and product homes. Be prepared to open and unload heavy boxes/pallates because this will be your primary duty.
good,"I love love love this company in my experience there we were all like on big family, the literal only drawback was there wasn't enough hours to be able to make a living unless you reached management but the culture and environment of the work place was truly amazing by far the best job I've ever had."
good,"for the most part this is an ideal job for someone who enjoys the beauty industry. theres lots of interactions with vendors from many different brands and lots of knowledge provided in online training, but unfortunately not enough budget allotted to the stores making all those things difficult to enjoy. if there was not a long line there were countless tasks uncompleted. the audit process was pretty much non existent but held to a high degree of importance. stress was a constant in this position but was well worth it in most cases because the friends who became family that you get to work with everyday and those types of interactions that you can carry with you even after leaving the company that made it well worth the effort and stress"
good,"I really enjoy working at ulta because I love the upbeat environment, I love helping people and getting 25% off of my beauty needs is pretty neat as well."
good,"Its a fun work environment to work in. I really enjoy helping guests find the perfect makeup for them, it makes them feel good about themselves and i love that! who doesnt want to play with makeup and get paid!"
good,I love the company and what they stand for as far as where they want to grow and develop and utilizing technology and resources to improve every day life. A typical day at Ulta is non stop and there is never enough time to complete everything. I loved my team and co workers and the connections I have made through this company.
good,"work there as a temp stock member. good location to work at. great people. close to lots of other locations."
good,I have never worked as hard as when I was employed with ULTA.  I didn't mind as the work was interesting and challenging and the people I worked with and for were wonderful.
good,"Good management, treats their employees fairly."
good,Started as a tomboy and with a little love and TLC. This company has molded a primadonna.
good,"I worked for this company for almost two years and was promoted twice within the first 9 months I was employed there at LOVED it at first. I became great friends with my co-workers, there was a great level of teamwork, everyone was there to help, the management was great at coaching and guiding everyone if there were and questions or concerns and I LOVED my clients. Once I moved states and switched stores and management it changed a bit. The management wasn't there for me as much as I felt they should have been. I was employed at a full time position and my hours were continuously being cut down to almost part time hours. While I was very fortunate to meet some great new friends and build and new client base I felt I was not being coached like an employee should and my concerns were not being addressed in way that they should have been."
good,i had fun getting to learn about all the mae up and hair products.
good,No room for advancement. DM was unfair and picked her favorites. One bad part time manager ruined the morale for the entire store. She was dishonest but still have a job.
good,Able to help customers with makeup which is a passion of mine. Management was a mess. A typical day at work was stocking product or working on the register.
good,I'm working in a seasonal position. I might stay full  time if needed. My co workers are nice and I have enjoyed learning about different products I use.
good,I loved getting to work in a beauty based environment with tons of girls. Management was so great. We continued to have a great relationship after seasons were over. Very helpful staff.
good,"Working there I acquired a great degree of knowledge on how to sell products, how to help guests find what they need, as well as making recommendations when needed, and working effectively with others."
good,Most enjoyable part of my job was learning about new products; we had training almost every week about a new products.  The only con in this job was working the holidays.
good,"Very detailed day to day"
good,"It was really fun, just at the time management was lacking due to conflict outside of the workplace regarding their health and attendance. However as far as technical training and support from the company was just incomparable to any company I worked with before."
good,I loved the products and people at Ulta. I enjoyed working with products they interested me. I was always excited to see new products. The sales incentives were fun products and such. Really fun. The schedule was hectic. The set changes and designs we challenging and usually done overnite or really early morning. The management was a bit disorganized. I also felt I needed more product training. Overall it was a good experience.
good,I enjoyed working at The Salon at Ulta Beauty. It was an amazing first step into the world of beauty because everything was right there for use. There was a ton of learning opportunities and room for growth.
good,"Good place to work, especially if you are in high school or college. I worked there a lot over breaks and they were always able to get me on the schedule if I wanted to work more."
good,"I throughly enjoyed working for Ulta Beauty. Although I couldn’t stay very long due to just becoming a new mother at the time, I really enjoyed the time I did spend there. I not only learned a lot about products and brands, but I also felt very welcomed and valued while working there."
good,loved it but was seasonal work was let go right after holiday season.  was not intended to keep seasonal help....would have liked opportunity to stay on
good,Love it and nice people to work with but I don’t think i would go back just not for me want something with more hours and could stand to have nicer people there
good,Loved working here but was a seasonal position. A typical day at work can be stressful with so many customers coming in but over all was a great experience
good,I liked working at Ulta a lot. Had to leave due to moving but it was a fun job! You get to have the inside scoop on exclusive makeup and fragrances. Stocking isn’t the most fun but it helps you know where everything is in the store. Management was great
good,Ulta as a company is constantly improving and developing new techniques and methods to insure the guest have ana amazing experience each and every visit.
good,I had a great time working at Ulta. I was introduced to products and brands i have never heard so that made it even more exciting! Fun work place and easy to work at.
good,It was a great environment. Co-workers were friendly and willing to help if asked upon. Fast paced job for the most part. Customers were very friendly.
good,"Great people, fun work if you love beauty, self care & etc but there is a lot of favoritism with current employees and managers that sometimes makes it not worth it."
good,"I just loved working here. my team was incredibly awesome, we always tried to be on top and always were. I had an amazing talented team who was always willing to go the extra mile for the guest"
good,On a daily basis I ran the operations team and received truck shipments. Made sure all sections of the store were fully stocked and clean.  I opened and closed the store and performed all manager duties on a daily basis.
good,Overall highly recommend. Fun place to work and room for growth! They promote within which is really nice. Also they pay hourly instead of salary which is nice
good,"Would work there again, I miss it. It was fun to be around stuff I was passionate about and work with those who were also passionate about it. Customers were usually nice"
good,"Working at my pace putting away the product and feeling accomplished once your goal was completed, also the pace of having more than one responsibility kept my focus on the task at hand."
good,I would recommend ULTA to anyone! The company is very caring and they like to promote within. They treat there employees with kindness and the teams that I have meet have been very nice!
good,I love the company and it is steadily evolving. But the education track is based on corporate favoritism. Would love to advance but everything is based on numbers. Not artistry or customer service.
good,I loved working at Ulta. I didn’t feel supported as far as loss prevention goes. It’s extremely difficult to sell and provide a great customer experience when you have people stealing left and right. If they provided loss prevention officers it would take such a huge weight off the staff shoulders.
good,"Ulta is a great place to work at. There are several tools in place to help you succeed. The planograms are very fun, as well as learning about new products."
good,"The workplace was very open and friendly, always felt welcome. Management was good and very constructive. I enjoyed helping people feel beautiful about themselves"
good,i was a temporary task and I loved how I always had something to keep myself busy. The managers thought i came from another location but it wa just my productivity that impressed them.
good,"My job and time spent at Ulta Beauty was a fun and exciting learning experience. I unfortunately just found no room for growth, they continuously hired from the outside, or transferred people in instead of hiring from within. Their would have been less training involved had they done it that way, just frustrating that the company you work for can't see you as a beneficial employee.j"
good,"Ulta was a fun, light place to work at, but had many stressful aspects. It's hardcore retail work with credit card sign ups, loyalty cards, extra product selling. The demographic Ulta appeals to are particularly the worst customers to have, unfortunately.  Very through training program, a lot to absorb for anyone who may not have any experience in retail, but it is easy once you're hands on. They push REALLY hard for credit card sign ups, to the point where they evaluate you every single day before you work, so not the place for socially shy workers."
good,I enjoy ulta and highly reccomend asnyone who loves beauty to apply! The staff is very friendly and much more inviting than you would expect. not everyone is judgemental.
good,Fun and friendly place to work. Great place for the people person. Consistent and ongoing training. Fair supervisors and pay. Cool work culture and environment.
good,"A typical day at work as a beauty advisor would consist of greeting guests, stocking merchandise, attentive customer service and managing cash registers."
good,"If you like last minute changes to your schedule, stressful about production and they equipment is not functioning correctly and they want to be on you about faulty rf scanners etc."
good,"love the discounts and products they sell, they work with rewards and points, so the points turn into money which you can use towards the products that are from prestige. meaning high end makeup and salon products too, basically the whole store."
good,"I worked at ULTA for a year I loved it If I could go back I would, it tends to get rough around peak which can be a bit stressful but at the end its well worth it, there are awesome perks that come along with it special gifts for mothers days. ULTA does take very good care of their employees. hands down the best place I've probably ever worked at being different, clean, and most importantly treated like a employee rather than just a number. we put our customer's first we want to make sure they have a awesome experience with ordering so they will make us busy and order more awesome beauty products! :)"
good,Being around so many great products can be dangerous to your bank account. Learned a lot about skin care and makeup application while working there.  Great salon associates!
good,loved product and customers. The hands on with clients was a great experience and really helped make my experience there memorable. Seeing a customer smile when you helped her achieve a look is priceless.
good,"the job itself is very customer service oriented, requires high levels of sales to ensure the store meets its daily, weekly, and monthly goals. The job also includes working with outside agencies to ensure sales are being met."
good,"Cool to be apart of an amazing company and brand if you're a serious beauty and makeup geek like myself. A sigh of relief to be working along side women and men who also enjoy the same things as you, wether it's the newest trend of beauty and style or the classics and originals."
good,"Good place to work, lots of learning and experiences with room for growth. Management is helpful and you get to help people feel good about themselves."
good,Geared towards female guests only. All training videos primarily deal with female and makes me as a male uncomfortable due to the atmosphere that men do not care to take care of themselves.
good,"High stress level"
good,"love the people there and would like to enjoy getting to know them better, and learning new things. want to learn as much as I possibly can"
good,"The pay was adequate for the size of the  store.  It is  tough to run a salon along with the store, but I found it interesting to learn that biz too.  As a store manager one of the fun things was going to the store manager conference and getting all the free gratis!"
good,On a typical day I would keep the store tidy while interacting with customers. I would maintain current knowledge about products as well as specials in store. I learned how to interact on a professional level more socially. The management was very organized and helpful  while co-workers were reliable. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the organization of merchandise. The most enjoyable part was the opportunity to interact with new people everyday in such an appealing environment.
good,I loved the people. They made everyday a joy to go to work. I loved the clients that came in and always had a good time helping them find what they were looking for.
good,the best part of the job was providing every customer with a winning experience. seeing the smile that comes across their face when I show them a new makeup technique or a new product that makes them feel like a million bucks!
good,"if u love make up and customer service this is the js for you"
good,"A typical day consisted of unpacking boxes, reshelving items, cleaning shelves, greeting customers, some checking.  I started working with Ulta before it opened so I learned what was involved in opening a new store.  I enjoyed working with new people.  They were excited to be in on the ground floor of a new business coming to Jopliin.  The hardest part of the job was the schedule.  I had to be in at 5 am and it interfered with the scheduling of another evening job I had at the time."
good,"Have enjoyed this high energy work place, fast paced, always changing environment. The hardest part was listening to our customers stories during Breast Cancer Awareness and trying not to become emotional with those who lost their loved ones. Driving my team to success, coaching, training and growing my team was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Loved working here!!! Everyone is very friendly. I loved the the work environment.
good,"I love Ulta!!! As an esthetician I am able to execute my skills as an esthetician, and give a plethora of information if needed to anyone. I gave suggestions, and product knowledge on skin care, hair, cosmetics, and perfumes. I learned something new everyday! Whether it be information on makeup and applications, a new product thats being displayed on the floor, or another language to simply say hello, and thank you."
good,By working at Ulta I gained valuable sales and customer skills. Ulta offered wonderful work environment filled with top of the line products. Ulta offered an easy to use rewards-based system.
good,The main thing we do is making sure the customer is always happy and satisfied. Helping guest find what they need and accommodating to their needs. Management try to be there for you constantly and are very understanding. The hardest part of the job can be the customers. The most enjoyable of this job is the friendships you make with everyone at work.
good,Long girls get pay grade environment great people just be ready to work managers are cool you'll get along with mostly everybody that works there love my job
good,"I loved working for ULTA Beauty. I welcomed customers in with the biggest smile and joy in my heart. Even on the busiest days with rude customers, the God in me always left me ecstatic to help customers as much as I could. The only downside of this job was moving out of state so I could not transfer my job. ULTA Beauty will forever be family in my heart!"
good,It was a great place to work just make sure your spirits are up because working in retail can be a bit draining. The managers were fun and very helpful.
good,"You need to know a lot about beauty to really succeed. You have to know the brands that Ulta carries, learn the makeup basics, you have to sell certain brands first like benefit and clinique."
good,I love working for this company because of how fun and exciting it is to be apart of such an amazing team that genuinely cares for their employers and treats each other with respect and dignity.
good,it has been a good experencie and fun environment has everything you need when it comes to beauty. Managemt is awesome I would recommend this place to go for your beauty needs and also a great work enviorment.
good,Springfield's Ulta Beauty has always been one of my favorite spots to shop. The people there have always been so kind. That did not change when they became coworkers. It was a team environment. It made the job fun and there was never a dull moment. The management was fantastic and always there to be a helping hand.
good,I have learned a lot of things. Ulta Beauty has so much different product. It has been rewarding to be able just to remember where 80% of product are. I enjoy the challenge of stocking.
good,"Be ready to be BUSY."
good,"Goal oriented work environment, management encourages you to meet goals throughout the day. Room to learn and grow with the company. Overall a fun but focused work environment."
good,Ulta was a great place to start out as an esthetician. It got me in the habit of taking clients and setting up appointments as well as retail work. Would recommend starting estheticians to work at Ulta.
good,A great place for growth but depends on your region. The daily work is normal to retail experiences and at times the guest are the only down part.  If you have an unhappy management team it's hard to get jobs done. Ulta doesn't give you enough time to finish projects assign.
good,Great work environment with a great management team who is very helpful. You learn a lot about new products and about the beauty industry. You feel very welcomed.
good,"Ulta was your average part-time job. I loved having the ability to work around makeup, so this was perfect for me. You could have been promoted to a Prestige Makeup Advisor, but it wasn't easy."
good,This place is fun an upbeat. All about your management team. If you have a good set of managers your store will flow and grow in a great way. Makes it an enjoyable place to work.
good,Enjoyed my seasonal job with ulta i had alotof fun was my first warehouse job was easy and enjoyed myself very much. Had perfect attendance and good pay.
good,"I was a seasonal beauty advisor for the holiday months. I had another job that had benefits, so I did not need any from Ulta. I believe I worked in a great store, with a great management team. For the time I was there, I did not notice any drama or issues with the team."
good,"It was a great opportunity, just not enough hours were able to be given, plus it was too far of a commute to make it worth it. I really loved my manager and my team though."
good,"Hour lunch "
good,You learn a lot about hair and make up even as a guy. The girls before starting there shift would put make up on and never really had to worry about go backs.
good,"I LOVED working at Ulta and I honestly might apply to another one when I move. Very nice hours even though I was seasonal and mostly all of my coworkers were great. I learned how to do truck, I was put on the register a lot then of course on the floor to help guests. I loved coming into work. My problem I had was with management. I would give my calendar to my GM and tell her that I couldn't come in before 9am, and I was still scheduled at 8am and on days that I could Not come into work. I was also paid less than Everyone working there which confused me for a Long time. Other than that, it was honestly The best. I've never had so much fun at work. I REALLY liked truck and the days where I was just at cash wrap tho!"
good,"Ulta Beauty provided a very clean, safe, secure, and encouraging work experience. If you are truly interested in the products, the work experience will be even better for you."
good,I have learned more about how to take care of customers who come in looking for specific items. I enjoyed working at ulta as well as with the people who I worked with.
good,"Management at Ulta was the best I have experienced out of any job I have worked. It was fun, upbeat, and everyone was happy to be at work even if they were having a bad day. There wasn't any petty drama, and everyone was positive with one another. Entitled customers were the trickiest part of the job, and on occasion, it was stressful to make sure all of our tasks were completed on time (especially during the holidays). My team was like a second family to me, and they were what made my job so enjoyable."
good,Great company to work for. The workplace culture is very friendly and innovative. This company provides a lot of advanced training opportunities for employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for Ulta, the management always worked with my schedule and offered me opportunities to earn more and had special incentives. The team had great cooperation in completing whatever tasks were at hand."
good,"All in all, I would love to work for Ulta Beauty, again. I made memorable friends and learned so much from those around me. "
good,"This is a great place to start your professional career into aesthetics.  Ulta teaches you how to build your clientele, sale retail, and encourage rebooks and conversions."
good,"I have owned and run businesses for others most of my adult life and I never really found that place that I really loved to be at all the time. This is that place where I don't feel like it's work due to the love I have for Ulta, all managers and all of my co workers."
good,I love working at Ulta. The environment is welcoming and the customers are very nice. Management is amazing and the job itself is pretty easy. Depending on your title you have completely different duties so everyone gets their work done.
good,I learned a lot about the products and people in general working for this company. They always try very hard to give each guest the best experience possible. The work environment is great and everyone is amazing
good,"Runs tight shift, trust to make work fun by being competitive and being rewarded in the end. The manager is always understanding they also provide the supplies"
good,Pretty good place to work and start off at definitely good training and cool stuff to discover fun work place fun events sometimes a expect you to be a little too perfect
good,Ulta has great potential and leaves you with great skills and experience in cosmetics I think its a perfect job for those of us into cosmetology and everyday fashion
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Ulta. I had problems with the managers and scheduling which led to my leaving of the job, but loved everything else about the job!"
good,"During shifts my job responsibility included greeting customers, cashing in guests items, setting up promotes during closing shifts and organizing the stock, assisting our new and reoccurring guests with finding beauty products, giving beauty tips, and helping sell products. Each shift I was given at least an 15 minute break with my minimum 5 hour working shifts. The time I spent working with the Ulta Beauty Company was very enjoyable, within the job I gained friends and even more knowledge of the beauty world."
good,"Paid lunch, room for advancement, great culture, overall a good experience. Only downfall is that if you work graveyard it is very difficult to get a hold of management because they are only there during the day. Supervisors are very efficient and try to accommodate your needs as best as they can."
good,"I loved working there the customers we're okay and the employes that I worked with we're freindly I still have freinds for there. I also learned more about the cosmetics industy while working there,"
good,Lucky for me my store manger valued our learning just as much as we did and work with our school schedule.  The environment was fun and encouraging. Go 308!
good,Ulta Beauty is a fast paced entry job within the beauty industry. They're very collaborative and flexible. A lot of what you'll do is very task based. They are also very flexible with your schedule. Just gotta give enough notice.
good,"I personally love working at ULTA. Sometimes it gets catty but mainly it is not stressful and little drama. Only con is the stress they put on gaining customer loyalty/member sign ups. As long as you know what you are talking about product wise, customers/clientele are great to work with."
good,"Some days it was pretty laid back, nights were pretty busy. always busy doing something if it wasn't retail it was restocking. The most enjoyable part was being free to be creative."
good,Great employees and a fun environment to work in. Good hours and good training. The pay is reasonable as well. Overall a good place to work. Its always fun to go into work
good,"I enjoy to work at Ulta. They have a 401 K , and good benifits. We have been without a manager and an assistant manager p/t for too long!Over all i like working here."
good,The people and environment at work is great everybody works together to achieve all of our goals. You learn excellent customer service and phone etiquette in the workplace.
good,"I enjoy working at Ulta. The people, the environment, everything about it is phenomenal. I would like to move up in the business towards a manager position."
good,"In Monroeville PA Gm was great.  In Washington PA was good but she had too many friends working under her that she associated with on regular basis outside of store.  I felt really like an outsider due to rest managers and associates visited, lived at her house. All where always speaking of their after work gatherings.  Really uncomfortable situation.."
good,"Loved my job as a salon manager, great pay and benefits! Ulta provides great training and an inspirable culture. Management above isn't great though. Great company values though!"
good,"great company but terrible hours. pretty much unless youre higher staff ie. manager, shift leader, you will get no more than 12 hours a week. Overall, i really enjoy working there."
good,It’s a great company to work for. But I just don’t see too many opportunities for advancement. They should start offering more positions within the store.. and give a better employee discount!
good,If you're fast on your feet its a good place to work at. great customers and you meet great people. you learn about new products that are good. great.
good,I always connected well with my coworkers and the managers were really awesome in seeing my point of vies. I have never gotten into an arguments and it was a very positive environment.
good,"Good company to work for, I have learned a lot about the retail industry management is great and understanding, friendly culture,  work with kind people."
good,Great place to work. Great environment with the people who work there. Management is their for you if you need help. Workplace is nice witheveryone being a team player. Would recommend applying.
good,"They're pretty good at living up to what they stand for. They are very professional for a retail job, and they're very open and accepting. They also treat everyone with respect."
good,"My typical day is well balanced and joyful. I have learned how to operate their cash registers and how to do inventory. The managers are understanding and easy going. The workplace is full of well rounded, kind hearted people. I love my coworkers and the job itself. The hardest part of the job is assisting unhappy customers without being able to do anything about their problems."
good,Great place to work. Benefits Included which you normally do not get at most salons. Management is great. Lots of opportunity for growth. Plus you can make hourly and commission so you always have something to fall back on if your commission is low that week
good,"Although I didn't like the fact that we couldn't get more hours to work since we weren't managers, working for Ulta has been great since the workers and managers there were really understanding and perks of working there is that you get discounts on anything in the store plus you find out first on what's new."
good,I loved working where I had fun. The energy in the store is electric. It's a fast paced environment that is focussed mainly on the satisfaction of the guests. The actual job is great. The only problem I had was some of the culture changes with new management.
good,I love working at Ulta. I learned so much that I'd like to further my career in the beauty industry. The best job thus so far I came across. Looking to become a manager soon
good,Being a hair stylist there you are are paid to go to technical and business trainings 2-3 times a year. This company is AMAZING to work for. Everything is really good at helping you grow your business and develope the skills in order to do so.
good,"I remember when it was brand new to Saint Louis! I helped open the store, putting up the shelving and the products. This was when tutorials didn't exist, so I definitely self taught myself by playing in makeup, looking at the display units and images of their models and I would recreate those looks on customers! My mother has been a cosmetologist her whole life so I followed in her footsteps and makeup became a knack for me! Management recognized my work and kept me over in the prestige area to guide customers in the right direction."
good,management is really involved within the store to make sure all associates are where they need to be and how they can improve. i love working the floor to help sell to customers
good,"management was a hot big mess, but it was fun to work there.you get a nice discount on the products as well. opportunities for growth within the company"
good,I really enjoyed working at Ulta. The environment was very fun and very laid back.  The management was great and the employees were very friendly and all looked out for each other.
good,a typical day at work what you learned management work place culture the hardest part fhb job the enjoyable part of the job enjoyable part of the job enjoyed
good,Ulta was a such a fun place to work. Everyone got along with one another. It never felt like I was stuck in one position. They were flexible with scheduling. And the discount on makeup was an added bonus!
good,"I love helping customers and I enjoy buying makeup with my discount. Sometimes it can be stressful when it comes to holiday and special sales in the store because majority of customers would go nuts. But in the end, it's worth it."
good,"Set up register and balances at the beginning and end of the work day. great customers, help customers with ticket purchases. keep the work place clean."
good,Everyday carried new knowledge about skin care and ways to better improve make up techniques. It was a friendly environment with affordable prices and ways to look and feel beautiful
good,"Being an employee with Ulta Beauty for a year, is an unforgettable experience. Meeting and talking with new people everyday and being able to provide excellent customer service to everyone who walks through the door. Being  lead cashier and also a sales associate on the floor, I get to provide customer service every minute of my scheduled shift. Being able to help a customer with their beauty needs, matching their skin tone to a face foundation."
good,If you work your tail off its rewarding. Love the fact that you get to check stuff out before it launches. I learned to be the go to person for anything!
good,"Working for this company was great, its indoors, I greet customers and look out for shoplifters, the staffs are friendly and the management is good. I enjoyed working there."
good,Management was really great. Co-workers were fun. Had lessons about products and new services. Break room was always a blast!
good,"A typical day is stocking benefit cosmetics, clean work area.  Review appointments for the day or supply orders. Keep up with upcoming events. Review sale and service numbers. Consult with guest regarding brow mapping and perform wax. I mostly enjoy educating each guest that sits in my chair regarding eye brows or any other service or cosmetics they are interested in,"
good,Very interactive. Helping out costumers at all times. Always making sure the costumers are doing fine and asking if they need assistance. Love helping people.
good,"Within the first month of working at Ulta the Prestige Beauty Advisers got many free product so we can obtain knowledge and experience with the items. On top of our discount, we got free treatments in the brow bar and salon. Every customer that can in to shop or make a return always left happy because of our friendly environment and staff."
good,"Busy fun place with diverse of employee and customers. The enjoyable part of this job was making customers happy with the result of their hair, educating customers with products and their needs."
good,"great place to work and advance in the company, great co-workers and management. learned a lot about different makeup, and gained more customer service experience. a busy day would be stocking, cleaning and helping customers around the store also taking phone calls and helping book appointments for brow bar and salon.A positive place to work."
good,"Ulta can be a little challenging, but a good challenge.  Work hard daily and you could go far.  Typical work day can consist of busy cash wrap lines, helping guests with their needs, stocking and facing products, directing guests or guest calls to the appropriate manager or salon. Management is great as well as my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job here is the short hours.  Most enjoyable part of my job is a smile on a guest who may not have had a good day until coming in contact with me or my co-workers."
good,I really enjoyed working at ulta I feel I would probably still be there if I lived in around one! We always had good communication between the management and the floor staff the co workers were amazing you knew they had your back if you needed help our if you were knew and still learning someone was there to help you!
good,"Your day would be to generally cater to the customers who visited. Help the customers with selections that would better fit the skin type and color. I learned about many different skin care products, makeup, etc.. The team that we had was very respectful,loving, and helpful. The hardest part was to not to try to spend you whole pay in the actual store. This store has lots of goodies for the women. I enjoyed going to work to meet new people."
good,"I love working with people. I am currently obtaining a bachelors in Speech Communication with an emphasis is public relations; therefore, interaction is the base for my professional future. I was the lead over fragrance, and I was responsible for stocking, labeling, updating, and maintaining the fragrance section. I also delegated tasks to two individuals who also worked in fragrance. I loved my job."
good,"this is a wonderful place to work if you love makeup , applying make up, and beauty products. You learned alot about new products and services. There are various shifts and great perks of working for ulta.  Unfortunately the managers at this location got rid of everyone who is spanish or had a bit of color to their skin."
good,I learned how to be a better leader when it came to my management position. They really helped me be the best I can be. My staff was/is great and they are very hardworking. I enjoyed the amount of responsibility that I had because of the fact that I like to be busy and I like to learn.
good,"I do merchandising and task for this company. I handle shipment, I place product, I do inventory, ad set, plano, reflows and many other things. I've learned many things in this position that can translate to other jobs. I love the company however the pay is not great and I've been held back from advancing for reasons that are not just."
good,"I was hired on originally as a seasonal employee for the upcoming holidays in late 2013. I mostly handled the cashier and retail sales. A typical day would consist of checking guests out, answering questions about promotional offers, and restocking. The most that I learned in the short amount of time with the company was about the prestige cosmetics. I learned proper application and technique as well as brand ingredients and information. All of my co-workers were upbeat and always in a wonderful mood. I always looked forward to a work day because of the pleasant atmosphere. The hardest part of the job I'd say was the standing for hours. At the time I was employed with Ulta, I was pregnant and the swelling of my feet contributed quite a bit to the stress of being on my feet for long periods of time, but I'm proud to say that I was able to perform my job with no complaints. What I enjoyed most about my job was the information I was able to learn about the products in the store. Helping customers find what was essential to their lifestyles helped me learn what people look for and what products I could recommend to help maximize optimum results."
good,"You Have to be a real self starter, you will not be recognized for advancement if you do not go above and beyond. Company would prefer an open schedule, but will work with you. "
good,Pick and ship out orders also including loading trucks on the dock and searching for data errors
good,"My co-workers were all very friendly and I got along with them very well, I made some new friends who I still keep in touch with. A typical workday involved stocking shelves, doing inventory, working the cash registers, or overseeing different sections of the store."
good,"A typical work day at Ulta for me as Prestige Manger was making sure my department was fully stocked, cleaned, check appointment book, and assisting customers Which I love doing I have always been a people person the hardest part of my job was just trying to please the customers but in retail  the customers are always right But what I loved most about my job was  the people I work with they where like my family we where a strong team some days I would have to jump on the cash register  and help out or fill in for another manager I loved assisting customers with make up who had no idea how to even apply make up and one of the things I loved about my job was when the customer would come back and ask for me that made me feel so good made me feel like I made someone else feel good about themselves."
good,"A typical day at work for me at ULTA was opening the store ready to start the day, getting my station ready for clients, meeting clients and making sure they walked out with a smile on their face from the experience, manning the register when needed, and helping anyone around the store. I learned a lot from the company and my co-workers. We all worked well together and were able to quietly and quickly fix any problems between the team. My immediate management was fantastic and kept everything & everyone working smoothly. The hardest part of this job or previous jobs was making sure that the customer was happy, and although I pride myself in that area, some clients/customers are never happy. My goal in every area of my life is to see everyone in a smooth running flow with everyone in a good/productive mood! What was most enjoyable to me working for ULTA or anyone is to be heard by also being respectful to those above me. One thing I've learned from the beauty industry is it is important to make people smile, have fun within the boundaries of work, and staying cool, calm and collected."
good,I loved working for Ulta. I had the opportunity to meet alot of different people and learn new products!
good,"Fun place to work, Everyone was really nice and helpful. the job is super easy fast pace. I loved helping people find there make up. "
good,Fun and informative environment. The management is stern with attendance but flexible with scheduling.
good,"Its great if your interested and knowledgeable in cosmetics and hair care. mangers were flexible with schedule and required excellence in customer service and performance. This job would get hectic and had to remain focused and on point. great part was I always knew about new wonderful products to use or suggest for friends and loved ones, and customers."
good,They are a great company to work for they really try to make it a comfortable enviroment to work in.
good,A typical day starts by doing a plan-o-gram or finishing the shipment we received. I am constantly learning new things because management does not hesitate to thoroughly explain everything we need to do. My co-workers are fantastic and we are constantly having fun as a team. The hardest part of the job would be to remember where each product in the store goes because it is constantly changing. But the most enjoyable part would be to keep learning new things about the products we sell and use ourselves.
good,"I love the culture at Ulta. Not every store is the same, but when you have a great team you can create incredible wins. That is what makes a great day at work."
good,"I adored working at Ulta. I loved my managers - they were nice, understanding, and always willing to acknowledge when you impressed them or had a good day. I loved what i did, from helping people find new brands or products to trying to decide what product was best for their skin. I did not want to leave the job but i had to in order to do an internship for college. I enjoyed working for the company and would love to go back some day."
good,"Being able to connect with customers was the icing of the cake , and them engaging with you and keeping conversation was great too. I adored all of there questions mostly because they really wanted my help and that felt really good."
good,"I worked part time for a short period while being active duty military and the atmosphere was amazing. Everyone there was super sweet and welcoming at first, and nothing changed about that. Managers were uplifting and helpful."
good,Working at Ulta was an overall great experience but i do not suggest this job for adults with bill unless it's a side job. The conditions are great and its a great place to learn about makeup and they do not discriminate.
good,"I really enjoyed work at Ulta, especially during the holiday season. The mangers are all very encouraging, but they are not all on the same page. Some managers do things completely different than the other managers. The different procedures take some getting used to. Some managers will ask that we go above and beyond for the customers, others want you to just sit at the register and not go out of your way to assist guewith issues they have"
good,"Management was always the best at helping through the training process. Ulta is a very inclusive work environment, everybody goes out of their way to make you feel included"
good,I truly enjoyed my time working at Ulta throughout the years. Particularly because of management and coworkers. Wouldn't really change anything about my experience.
good,I love makeup brows waxing and every perk of being apart of the beauty industry. My job allowed me to be me in every aspect. They allow room for creativity
good,Hard part is the lines and how they get so long at times. Hours are based on how you perform in sales that can be discouraging for some people. Not the biggest location so there is not many events for prestige
good,Everyone Was Super Friendly And I Even Though I Wasn’t There Long It Was The Best Job Ever. My Coworkers Was Very Welcoming To Me. Not Hard To Find Some To Click With At All
good,Great experience. Great coworkers. Had fun working with what I loved doing. Everyone was super nice. Managers were awesome. Can’t complain much was lucky to have worked with great people.
good,"Working at ulta was fun and easy work. Definitely if you have a passion for your job, you’re going to love it! "
good,"If you’re seeking success,education,& growth, Ulta has it all !"
good,"Ive been at Ulta for two years and they are one of the few companies that have been extremely flexible and always so supportive. I was hired originally as a seasonal hire but was kept as a permanent after holidays."
good,"Management was amazing and treated you like family. You learn so much everyday and get to continually work with new faces and cultures. Everyone worked as a team, if there was a problem everyone helped to make it better."
good,"Good company to work for, much room for advancement and growth.  Excellent benefits and flexibility.   Advance training offered and encouraged.  Fun, up beat atmosphere.  Very often poor management and unprofessional staff, fast turnover in staffing due to mostly young emoyees."
good,"Nice to work, lots of hours but pay isn't high enough. The workers are lovely and lots of fun things to do. They are extremely flexible with hours and changing around as. needed."
good,"I worked with an amazing staff at my time with Ulta. The managers were very patient during the training process. Their system was very easy to understand at checkout. Working for shipment was an excellent way ti understand where the inventory and displays were located in the store, This helped for assisting customers efficiently."
good,"i loved my time in ulta  , always busy and productive, perfect for students. also you will have an opportunity to grow with a company if they let you !"
good,It was a sales position and customer service. I love being around cosmetics and helping customers learn about cosmetics. The hardest part of my job was getting a compensated for the hard work I accomplished.
good,"Great place to learn and grow as an individual, it teaches you to ha e an open kind and of course, customer service. with the support of you colleagues and management you’re unstoppable"
good,"I love my job and I don't need them hiring new people to take away my hours."
good,"Love the Break room the vending machines. How they catered to the employees , how we all were looked at and treated like a whole.  It felt like family"
good,"I worked at Ulta for almost 4 months, for one school semester. It was during the holidays which made it a lot more hectic. It is a fun environment to work in if you have good superiors but can require a lot physically. For me, it just took a lot out of my body every week. I was so tired that didn’t have the energy to go out. However, once you push through and adjust, it is very fun company that is somewhat flexible with your schedule needs and is focusing on your improvement. The discounts makes the difficult tasks worth it. If you like retail and don’t have a problem with being on your feet for long periods of time, Ulta is an amazing place to work. I really enjoyed it and will most likely be returning this summer."
good,"Ulta is the best job ive ever had, and ive worked at a few places. Not only were the coworkers amazing but it was overall a fun environment. Of course it had its downfalls but all jobs do, especially when theres a big change in management. The discount alone was more than enough reason to stay. I just wish they would have offered something full time so that I could have stayed."
good,"I loved working at Ulta, Due to a Home life situation I had to resign. However, I would go back if I could. If you have a passion for makeup this is the place to work. "
good,I enjoy my job  overall but I need higher pay to afford cost of living in my area. Good benefits and nice hours for the field of work I am in. Would recommend.
good,"pay could be better"
good,"This job can be very fast pace especially with sales going on all the time and free gifts with purchases. Also trying to upsell products but a day at work can be pretty chill and fun if your into makeup and know what your talking about, there are usually meetings and they definitely work as a team so it’s a good company to work for."
good,I loved the atmosphere at Ulta and all of the people who work there. Very professional but still caring for each employee. I have loved Ulta since my interview and could see a future careeer in Ulta HQ.
good,"When I first started working at Ulta I was very shy and did not really talk to anyone. After a couple of days i started to make friends and I started to feel more comfortable, but I  was also working my other job as well. I was not really into the dress code at first, but overtime I liked it because I felt confident and I started wearing make up and enjoying life. I was tired all the time though due two working both jobs in the same day, so at the beginning of the year I left Ulta and continued working my other job."
good,You work M-T so you have 3 day weekend if there is no work to do then then they ask if you want to stay or go home. Around the holidays it can be a bit crazy Nd stressful. They do give you gift bag around Christmas with a lot of good stuff
good,"I worked for Ulta for a little under a year and it was one of my easiest jobs. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and gained some valuable experience. However, I left because I didn't feel as valued as I should have. At my store, I was one of 2 women of color.  was the only employee who spoke Spanish (which came in handy for customers who came in only speaking Spanish) and I picked up more shift than I can remember. Yet, I got passed up for promotions  while I saw my less-experienced coworkers get promoted. "
good,"If you love beauty, you'll love Ulta. Very good communication all around, and managers do their best to work with your schedule. Meetings were required every couple months for updates and such."
good,I enjoy working with my associates. We work as a team and support each other without any drama.  I have learned  a lot in my time there. I also sharpened my skill set in many different areas.
good,"A typical day at work I would immediately start with the sanitation of the salon area. Check my schedule for the day.  See how many services i was scheduled to do and assess my time management for the day."
good,"For every male or female that dreams about beauty. This is your palace. Super fun, friendly customers and amazing staff. Ultas are always kept clean and neat because that is the culture of the brand. Although we want the ""guests"" to feel like they've entered our grand beauty room at home, we also want them to know that we care about our appearance and how they are treated. It helps with retention and helps you with customer service."
good,I enjoyed working at ulta and all of the benefits they provided. It was always moving and it was never boring. We were always getting to learn about new products and educate the clients.
good,"I enjoy my salon management position. However, after many years behind the chair and obtaining several degrees, moving from behind the chair and into a field position or upper (corporate) management role is slim to none. I have a great general manager and the team that I work with is awesome. However, I am looking for advancement more on the business side."
good,"I got so lucky with this job. We always hire from within and my store is full of amazing, creative people. We always have something to giggle about and the makeup events are always upbeat and a great learning experience. You learn something new everyday."
good,I love my role working at Ulta. I enjoy working with the other employees. My managers are amazing and very understanding. It’s a great energy and workplace.
good,Working for Ulta Beauty is fun and and upbeat. Sales/Goals are driven. You always feel welcome. Flexible working hours. Easy to communicate with managers.
good,"Good place to work          "
good,"A typical work day either consisted of me either working on the floor with shipment or at the register customer servicing our customers. As a seasonal employee, I always felt very welcomed and encouraged whenever I would return for the holiday season."
good,"Love working here, the girls are fantastic and the management is great. We are like a family here and take care of one another. I felt like i had a ton of opporitunities working here."
good,"-surprisingly very friendly staff"
good,"A typical work day would be to punch in, discuss the goals of the day with the manager, then stay at the register to check out guests or work on the floor. We split tasks with the co-workers if it is slow at work and keep a look out that all customers are being assisted."
good,I honestly enjoyed working for ulta unfortunately they don’t offer enough hours. you only get more hours if your a part of management and for a grown adult with bills to pay it did not cut it at all. I love the discount and I loved the fact that I could be extremely creative while at work and helping women and men look there absolute best really put joy in my heart. im actually about to move to Savannah GA and I’m considering applying for a management position with the company.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, and that everyone is passionate about the beauty industry. The only difficult part of this job is being able to retain all the information you receive on countless amounts of products. Great perks of working here!"
good,Great starting point. There are always customers in the store that you can talk to and introduce yourself and your services to. Friendly work environment.
good,I enjoyed the working environment and the brand I worked for because they were encouraging and employee and customer oriented that promoted positivity.
good,"Employees were friendly; atmosphere was fun and laid back, while still maintaining professionalism. Management was easy to talk to and eager to assist in learning additional job duties"
good,I love the work environment there. It is fantastic with great management. I learned how to help customers the way they needed. They always have great staff.
good,If you are passionate about makeup and skin care can handle a sales driven atmosphere then Ulta may be for you! You meet so many people from diverse backgrounds sharing their expertise and experience!
good,"The tasks are easy enough to learn, it just requires diligence on your part to maintain a steady pace to meet production.  Occasional heavy lifting but there is help.  Some warehouses have a stressful work culture- this one is staffed mainly by family oriented people.  There are different shift options available so ask if you are looking for something different, Ulta might have what you need.  This is retail so there are peak seasons and times of voluntary time off.  If you are an Ulta team associate, you can get your 40 hrs p/w or VTO if your schedule needs that flexibility.  Ulta associates also get a discount and occasional free products.  If you're looking for fairly steady employment that fits into a busy family life, Ulta is worth checking out."
good,"I haven't worked there very long, but I always find on the days I'm scheduled, it quickly becomes a good day. Our guests are amazing, and the employees are so much fun. If I could survive off of what they pay me, I'd stay for many years. It's still worth the experience and memories"
good,The Ulta Culture is the same at every single ulta but EVERY ULTA IS DIFFERENT depending on location as far as sales which greatly affects how many hours are given. no sales = less hours and no shifts or cut shifts...
good,"Working at Ulta was amazing. Being able to do what I love; facials, makeup and waxing. Wonderful place all around. Great people to be around and work with."
good,I enjoy working at Ulta. I am just a beauty advisor so I spend most the day behind the register but I get to meet and assist a lot of interesting people. I learn a lot about the products and skincare which is helpful to me. I am able to observe how the managers take care of their business and discuss it with them. The hardest part is juggling multiple tasks at once while keeping customers happy.
good,"Ulta is such an amazing company to work for! The pay could definelty be better, but I love it. I actually look forward to my shifts there and enjoy working!"
good,"Great place to work, get learning opportunities when brand reps come into town to teach you about the newest beauty products! Really great part time job."
good,"Working at Ulta has been my favorite place to work so far. They provided a clean, friendly, fun environment.  The management was great and I met a lot of amazing people. I would definitely recommend working here if you have a love for beauty, skincare, makeup, and helping customers find the right product for them."
good,This began as a full time job for me but as I got a new job with better pay I went down to part time as I still wanted to work here. It was a great atmosphere with great discounts and sometimes free for sales contest and fun things like that! They did christmas parties and work events and it was a really close team. I wish it wouldve been commission based as makeup is really expensive and it was a lot of work to help people but overall i loved it and had a lot of fun working there.
good,"I love working at Ulta. It is a great place for a stylist to build their business. There are thousands of walk-ins per week, free education, and they also provide tools and equipment. My experience has been great. It has been the best job I have ever had and i hope to keep working for this company for many years!"
good,Communication needs improvement on management level. There is a lot of conflicting information. Co-workers are fun and seem to genuinely enjoy working with all of the products.  The products need to come with more brand education.
good,"I learned more and more about face and hair products than I ever did before, there was more to it than what I already knew. It was fun for the most part."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is spending time with coworkers and managers and when you help a customer find a product that they like! Seeing the look on the customers face when you help them find a product that just absolutely suites them is one of the best feelings ever!
good,"Ulta has been the most enjoyable job I have ever worked at!! The management and employees all get along, I was a cashier and occasionally the fragrance girl or worked in prestige and helped the guests. Guests are what they called the customers. Super fun place to work if you love make up and beauty."
good,I love working at ulta.  I've learned a lot with making sure that the customers get that WOW experience. Management is just like any other place of work. They're some good ones and bad ones.  most importantly everyone gets along.  There really isn't a hard part of my job. I do what i'm told and that's it. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers feel beautiful.
good,"Working Ulta being a beauty advisor you task varies between checking out customers, helping customers on the floor, working on shipment, and straighten up the store."
good,"My review on Ulta Beauty, it's a wonderful place to get great customer service. I also got to learn how to be a supervisor of my cash wrap, and keeping it clean and dealing with customers that my girls had a little trouble with. I also got to learn on how to approve the right returns and make sure every guest that came through my line was  greeted and had the best experience at the end of their shopping."
good,"You learn a lot and they train you pretty well depending on how willing you are to learn and take on new tasks, however moving up was hard due to certain managers. Be consistent and you'll get what you want or to where you want, push hard. Great company over all, really great benefits. :)"
good,Fun place to work and I enjoyed my experience with the company. The gratis was an extra bonus and the benefits for management are great. Not enough hours given to regular employees though.
good,"Loved working here. I was able to experience a world I never imagined learned a lot about skin, hair and makeup as well as other beauty secrets and tips."
good,"Fun workplace. If you love the beauty industry I highly suggest applying. Stay up to date on new trends and familiarize yourself with all brands, especially ones you personally wouldn't use. The Ulta customer is great to work with."
good,Ulta is by far one of the best companies to work for if you want growth and development! You learn alot and have a wonderful team beside you. I resigned from my position for personal reasons and would love to be a part of the team again in the future. If you love the beauty industry ULTA is your place!
good,"My experience with the company as a whole was they operate to empower and celebrate women! But not just women, All who work for this company are given the tools to better themselves, most of my experience was wonderful. There is dramatic attitudes of behavior everywhere, but I must admit overall this company brings people together."
good,"4-8 hour work days. Very fast paced environment. It was a joy working for Ulta. The management have always been understanding and accommodating. It is a drama-free, no nonsense environment. The goal as a team is to help each and every guest in the most efficient manner. The team is comprised of 3 different departments, each operating with its own set of skills. In the prestige department you will find some of the friendliest and most skilled makeup artists, who can answer any question on cosmetics in the blink of an eye. The cashiers are friendly, and can help locate product. The salon team are highly skilled and trained individuals who can answer any question that may come up about a hair issue, while also running a full service salon."
good,I work with an amazing team at Ulta. The management team is incredibly encouraging and they're great people to work with. I love the environment and opportunities to grow.
good,Very fast paced. Management has had too many issues though. The co-workers and customers are amazing. Pay is great as long as you're actually getting hours but management sometimes plays favoritism. Absolutely no room for error so be on your A game all the time.
good,I really enjoyed this job. It was one of the only jobs that I really enjoyed working at. They were great with working around my school schedule and I was constantly learning new information about the products. I worked under the best General Manager who made work a happy and fun environment. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and helping the guests with anything they needed. It was the best job I had every had!
good,Over all working at Ulta has been great! Love my co-workers/management.  I have learned how a store really works.  It take a lot of hard work and teamwork to make a store what it really is.  Over all this has been a very enjoyable place to work.
good,Everyone is friendly and part of a team and we all work together as a team. I have nothing negative to say about anything or anyone that works or manages the Ulta Beauty Salon/Store.
good,ulta is good place to work the only thing is numbers  mean everything managment is good but high turn over with employes would still be there is i didnt have to move
good,"The management team was amazing, and all co-workers were amazing. customers were often not always very rude and nasty. the management team seemed to play favoritism, but other than that great place to work."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working at Ulta. A typical day will consist of front facing the store, completing transactions, advising customers on different products, and keeping the front clean and organized."
good,"Working at Ulta was every girly girls dream. I had the opportunity to be around makeup and beauty products all day. The staff was one big family and we truly enjoyed working together. A typical day at Ulta involved applying makeup to several customers, as well as personal selling and using the register. I developed my strong selling skills because of this job and also had training in makeup application. The most enjoyable part was being around products that I love and use. One of the harder parts was the management. The GM was not the best with scheduling and having tasks set out for employees."
good,"I was the management, I managed five salons at one but good enought for the stylist cause they were out ot get my  job. But all they had to do is ask for it and I would have given it to them. Cause I was getting tired of working 24/7."
good,"Typical day at work included cleaning products, brushes, floor, etc. Assisting guest in all kinds of needs including knowledge of products, recommending ones that suit there preferences, providing make-up, waxing, and eyelash application. Also working with my managers to follow every instruction given to me. Started on what the daily goal was and working on whatever else needed to be done. The management could not have been better. They were friendly and understanding, Stern yet flexible. They did their jobs exactly as they were supposed to and I could not have asked for anything better. My coworkers also couldn't have been more fun and uplifting. Barely any drama brought to the work place and if there was ever a problem, it was taken to the back away from any guest which is what everyone followed and kept guests happy and continuing to shop and purchase. Hardest part was working with difficult guests. There were times that we dealt with certain guests just not in the right mood but everything was handled professionally. Most enjoyable part was just doing what I love. Working with/meeting new people, selling products, and just the job in general. Through personal issues came into my effect that lead to leaving, I would recommend working here to anyone."
good,"Talking to people and helping them out is one of the number one things at Ulta. Talking to everyone that steps foot in the door. I learned that customer service is really a big deal, and being friendly and kind even when the customer is not is the upmost important thing. The management was amazing there, they did everything and anything they needed to make the store and the salon members succeed. The hardest part of my job was not getting enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the smiles on peoples faces when i helped them find something they were struggling to find, or helped them find a product perfect for their hair, or the smile i see when they get up from my salon chair."
good,Working at Ulta Beauty was very different from working in a Salon in that the potential clients are coming in to shop and try new products. I made new friends with the clients who came to see me regularly. The results that we were able to achieve for their skin concerns was rewarding to them and to myself in being able to assist them with their skin care goals. Ulta Beauty wants their employees to succeed. They work with you to achieve personal and financial goals. I left only on account of moving to another city. I would work for Ulta again.
good,"Great and equal advancement opportunities! the company is a great system and concept. With every corporation, there are bad seeds(co-workers) that may get hired, but overall I had a great experience with the company. I advanced at a rapid rate!"
good,its a nice pretty store LOved it very nice people to work with all women but you have to build clientale in a store like this
good,you meet new people you learn to overcome your fears and also you communicate more and learn more about the neighborhood
good,"This was a seasonal job but it was a lot of fun. The management was great, they were all very nice and understanding, my co-workers were nice as well, really easy place to go into."
good,Sorting product that has been shipped on pallets. Detail comparison with packing lists.
good,"Actually love going to work now, everyday is a new challenge"
good,Fabulous Company to work for!  I have always considered myself very lucky to work in a field that I love and this job is no exception.  It is like every day is Christmas!  I love doing product resets and I feel that helps me in my position because I know the outgoing products and the new products and I also know that the area hasn't just been reset but cleaned and reset correctly!  This is a perfect job is you are detail oriented and love talking to people constantly.  The ability to multi-task is a must!  You have the opportunity to go as far as you desire with Ulta.  I have worked for them for over two years and look forward to continuing with this company!
good,"Working at Ulta, I gained great experience with learning the knowledge of various products, and how I must sell these products to new or loyal customers. We had the option to attend informative classes per different product, in which I attended all. The management team showed great leadership, and were willing to help and answer questions within every aspect of the company. As a sales team, we were challenged to meet certain sales quotas, with the benefit of winning prizes. I am thankful to have had the opportunity to learn important sales techniques, as well as the strive to meet certain sales goals"
good,"Good fun place to work, Always something going on. Like events, or salon promos."
good,"The people are easy to work with. Everyday is a learning experience. I clock in, make sure I'm equipped with my headset and register key, get filled in on what the concentration of the day is while also following on top of my everyday tasks."
good,"A typical day at work consist of providing above average customer service, busy store settings, and meeting a wide variety of people. I have learned to be more efficient at work, with the added responsibility I have learned that what I do impacts the rest of the team and the company. It is important to do my best everyday that I work. I really enjoy the my co-workers and supervisors, each one has a great personalities that makes work more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is when a customer leaves upset or unsatisfied, I feel as though I have not done my job effectively if all my customers leave satisfied with their visits. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I get to meet and the connections that I make with regular customer, and helping people find what they need."
good,Every day at Ulta was different. I was always running around helping customers. It was always my goal to help the store get good reviews. I was always keeping my station clean.
good,One of the best companies for all of your beauty needs! You can work any shift and they find out what your strengths and weaknesses are and are very much a friendly and fun atmosphere full of talented beautiful people with no discrimination accepted!
good,You never know how someone’s going to react when you first greet them at the door so it’s always key to make them feel welcome and that if they have any questions they can feel comfortable enough to ask about a product or it’s location in the store
good,The management was super encouraging and was willing to help me advance in the company. I loved the people I worked with and the whole staff was super accepting of me and my personality.
good,"Ulta is an amazing establishment, I really enjoyed my time here, it is easy to do your job and get work done, although some workers may not try as hard as I, the work I did never went unnoticed"
good,I only worked at Ulta for a year but overall it was a great experience. They are super flexible with scheduling and have a great work environment. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with them.
good,Working at ulta beauty was a nice experience to communicate with the coworkers. The work ethnic was pretty good and everyone had great communication and the management was great as well.
good,Loved working for this company. I worker here for the last year of college and enjoyed it! Managers were great and always wanted to help out when they could.
good,"The high growth opportunity at ULTA, and in a fashion forward set of categories, makes for a dynamic, interactive work experience. The constant influx of new brands and products keeps the creative and merchandising challenges fresh and relevant. Every season affords new creative opportunities."
good,"Ulta is a cosmetics store where we are tasked with providing customer assistance for individuals to meet all their  beauty needs. The managers and other staff are friendly and inclusive. There are a lot of incentives such as free products, store meetings/parties, and events with fun themes and opportunities to learn more about  makeup."
good,I felt mostly at peace and I could fully be myself and do my job proficiently. This is the first job I had that introduced and placed me into the beauty world. It made me who I am today .
good,"I love my job and the managers of course everyone wants to make more,  it’s a great friendly place to work I love all my coworkers !! Every place has its ups and downs but not here we are all happy"
good,"People enjoy what they do and work to do well. There isn't any complacency, so you are expected to create and meet goals for the store and yourself. You are encouraged to try new sales tactics in order to help the store achieve daily sales goals."
good,"I loved working at Ulta and I miss my work family there. I wasn't there for long but it is a very high-energy place to work. All of the girls I worked with were super nice, the hours were manageable, and I really loved my interactions with customers there. I think the only thing I didn't like was stocking early in the mornings or late at night but we definitely made it a good time."
good,My work experience with Ulta was great. I truly enjoyed working for the company. I was able to have a great work/life balance with them and they worked will with my schedule. I also really enjoyed that the higher ups including the CEO were willing visit local stores in my area.
good,"The managers come and go in the salon like they've got a revolving door. They managers that were there when I was working there were ridiculous,  but the job in general was nice. There's heavy traffic so that made it easy for me to book clients."
good,"I honestly have loved my time at Ulta, it is a very welcoming group of people and a lot of people that love makeup and enjoy their work, the people you work with are all very friendly and get along nicely"
good,Over all great experience. Love the culture behind ulta beauty. Benefits were great and paid time off was reasonable. Only reason leaving was because I moved.
good,"It's a good place as a starter job part time with the opportunity to grow into full time to management positions. Each section in Ulta has it's differences. The hardest part of the job(management) is the hours worked, I missed a lot of family functions due to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the products, from learning to giving the knowledge to customers and meeting your sales."
good,It's a great place to work. Amazing culture. Senior leadership are very transparent. Great benefits.Team and guest are most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Gooood Pay 17. 00 hour  weekend start pay work is stressful during peek but the OT pay an incentives made up for it. Great benefits paid sick time an personal days at start.
good,"Typical work day included selling makeup and running the cash register. "
good,"Overall, Ulta was a great place to work. I loved the environment. The people I worked with were all so nice and supportive. I learned about makeup while also educating others."
good,I recommend this job to people that are people person. That’s loves makeup. And that can multitasker and can stand up for a couple of hours. Also loves to show and sale products.
good,"I loved the company and the wonderful women and men that I worked with and the beautiful  customers that I was fortunate enough to work with!!! To me their is nothing  more satisfying then  helping a customer look and feel their best as their going to buy all their new  Products that they absolutely love and cannot wait to tell them about their new skin care, makeup,lipstick and person that helped them (that would be me) and that would be my satisfaction for the day !!!"
good,"Productive, Outgoing, Great Place to work! Was given the opportunity to grow within the company. The staff and management was very helpful and supportive."
good,Workplace culture is outstanding and the management is a joy to work with. I really enjoy engaging with regulars and developing relationships with them. Learning how to own the business results is a HUGE focus. Be ready to learn a lot and grow professionally.
good,"I had wonderful and very professional co-workers, the managers were amazing, helping to grow you business as a skin therapist."
good,"A typical day at ulta required answeing phone calls ringing items up in the checkout, signing customers up for beauty rewards which entailed 20 percent off of their purchase, selling ulta beauty credit cards, while providing friendly customer service. Items customers would end up not buying would be stored in the go-backs container then later whether it be when you have time on your hands or until the end of your shift the items would have to be put back in their proper places. Other items which were returned or used would be placed in the damaged items container. walking around the store and assisting customers with finding thier desired product was also a big part of the job."
good,Everyday we talk business. Everyone is on the same page. Honestly is a work family. Everyone is supportive and generally positive. The only down fall is the pay for right now I’m still building my clientele so I don’t make much right now but eventually I will make more via commission.
good,"It was a very fun and accepting place to have your first job. The management was amazing; however, they tended to be disorganized. I loved every minute of working there besides the dress code."
good,Overall ulta is a very good place to work I just had a career change I didn’t want to be a stylist anymore because I felt it wasn’t for me but from that I did play in other roll like helping people in store find what they need and helping with signage and stocking
good,"Ulta is an amazing place to work at if you love all things beauty as much as I do. This is my dream job for this time in my life, all you have to do is sell a lot and make goals and your good!"
good,"I’ve been reading a lot of reviews and youtube videos about the experience at different Ulta locations and they’re really bad (based on the reviews and what the people say) but that’s not the case at my location. I LOVE my store, I love the managers they’re really nice, my co-workers and everything in general. I really enjoy working there! I have good amount of hours a week (I’m a Beauty Advisor). The only thing are the benefits, we don’t have any but well. It’s a good place to start in the Beauty Industry if you want to start your career as a Makeup Artist. You can easily move up and work for an especific brand if you desire."
good,"I love working here, there are times where I do have to question myself due to management but it is still a great place to work if you are a huge makeup junkie and just someone who love to care for their appearance. They also are really good for helping you move up in the company if you want. It's just a great company to work for."
good,"Ulta is a great company where you are encouraged to express yourself, and embrace your individuality. It is incredible in terms of job growth for Salon Professionals, however there is not quite as much grown opportunity on the retail side"
good,"During my time working here, I enjoyed it a lot. I would have stayed if an office position was available for more pay. The atmosphere here is pleasant. I really enjoyed the beginning of the year PTO compensation they gave us."
good,"I’ve worked for Ulta for 6 months, i got the job at my interview. I started just as a beauty advisor, and already got promoted as a lead. I love my managers, they are so nice and helpful. My co workers are great! No drama with who I work with. The discounts are great, as brands will give us more of a discount and gratius. This was my first retail job, and I’ve learned a lot. If you’re 18 years old, need a job, and love makeup- i’d definitely recomment working here. The customers can be either amazing people, or nasty- but my co workers make up for it. The biggest thing to worry about is selling enough credit cards, and signing everyone up for a loyalty account. Hours will differ every week, you need to work your way to having consitent hours. new employees will get comfortable with 6am shifts. Your work ethnic will vary on how much hours you get a week."
good,Great place to for anyone looking to begin a career and anyone who loves beauty. There are chances to move up within the company and there is always room for growth.
good,"Very upbeat place to work, you were kept in the ""know"" about new products and what was trending in the beauty community, training was easy. Definitely became my second family away from home."
good,"Loved the work, the staff. Not enough hours. Great experience.  Loved my clients. Loved the perks! Free salon services. Free gratis from benders. Tips were good."
good,"Customer service, sales, register. My duties were to make sure every customer was welcomed as well"
good,I really enjoyed working at Ulta. Some days are great and busy but other days you feel like you're wasting your time. I worked there for additional income.
good,"There is a place for everyone here! I was incredibly blessed to be a part of the Ulta Team while I could. Opportunities open when working for companies like this. "
good,Ulta provides everything you will ever need to have a great day at work. They provide training to help you to build your business. You will get support!
good,"I loved working there, they treat their employees like family. The work environment is upbeat and productive. My coworkers are very nice people and they are pleasant to work with."
good,"Working at this company for almost 3 years has been eye opening. After my first 3 months of being at the company I was asked to become a lead cashier and I accepted and am in the current role. My mother worked as the PM for over 4 years and growing up watching her lead by example, the makeup world was always something I wanted to do and be apart of. Ulta is a fun company to work for but at times it can be stressful, I am a lead and the role puts weight upon your shoulders. Leading by example is something I have taken upon myself for quite sometime now and being able to strive and learn to grow with this company has been a blessing all these years."
good,"Ulta was a very good place to work. Good co-workers and management. It was a fun and challenging work environment. The only downside was the scheduling, i.e. closing at 10PM during holidays and then going in the next day at 5AM. Other than that it was a rewarding place to work."
good,"working environment was very supportive of learning and there were always opportunities to build your skills. "
good,It  was a  professional and well structured company. Good training for the job. The managers were very helpful.  The employees were professional and friendly. Unfortunately in was a seasonal position.
good,Love the feeling of being somewhere with a group of women and not to be judged and everyone welcomes you with open arms. Of course you have your days but working here with the big group of women I had the privilege to work with was amazing.
good,I really enjoyed my time working at ulta . I really felt like I belonged and I feel as though I was treated like I was part of the team. I would refer people
good,"Exciting company to work for, great team effort and management. Flexible hours. Sometimes the tasks are too demanding for the time alotted but overall it is worth it when it comes to satisfying customers."
good,I was excited to work there in the beginning. i didn't get many hours and when i did i was mainly doing truck at night. I rarely got hours during the day to do what I actually applied to do
good,"overall it was a very positive experience to work at ulta.  It is hard work, and gets stressful, however I had a great team of co-workers and management to get through the rough parts."
good,"I enjoyed working here part time , in school. it also provided a lot of oppurtunity to learn about make up skin care hair care and other thingss that interested me outside of work."
good,"Ulta Beauty was an amazing experience, with wonderful management. Hours are flexible and you can ask for an extra day during the week. The store it's self is clean and neat, workers are constantly taking time to make the store perfect, wether it would be rearranging products in to their right spot, to sweeping floors. I would recommend working for ulta."
good,Going to your station gathering your tools scanners equipment. Motivated by fellow workers and upper management. quick pace scanning stocking or prepping products at desired locations. Getting a 15min break every 2 hours making the day go by that much faster getting a quick rest and a burst of energy getting back to work. constantly being on high alert of multiple transactions being made back and forth.
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Ulta. The managers were great, other employees were helpful, and just overall a great job to have. I was able to start as a cashier, I joined the truck team that stocked on Friday nights, and right when I found a full time position, there was a lead cashier position opening up with a pay raise. Training was always fun as well!"
good,Love the team work. I love the opportunities that have been available to me. I am very happy with the location I am at and the understanding of work/family life. Very understanding.
good,I loved working with Ulta Beauty. I met a lot of awesome coworkers and interesting guests.I always enjoyed doing the floor plans after hours where we redo some of the displays. The only reason I left was because I was looking for a change of pace in the workplace.
good,A typical day at work: 
good,"I had an amazing time with Ulta. I learned a lot and was given the opportunity to advance many times. Of course there are always going to be bad reviews but, what I can say is Ulta is great tool if you love what you do you will get where you want to be."
good,"At Ulta, you must come in dressed professionally and within dress code (which they're strict on in some stores). I have learned a lot in this work environment. It has taught me how to sell the different products and how to advertise certain brands. I really enjoy being able to help people find what best suits them and their skin type/needs."
good,Ulta has give multiple opportunities technically to work along with excellent talented team.Always prefer and willing to work in this company Ulta Beauty.
good,I loved working at Ulta . They were always willing to work with my schedule and all the employees I got along with well. the location was a great place right outside the mall.
good,"All of my coworkers and managers were incredible friendly and helpful when I had any questions. I love working here, just needed more hours to obtain more money for my livelihood."
good,very laid back environment. staff is very friendly. I love my job. management is very caring and works well with scheduling. I would recommend anyone to work here
good,"Ulta beauty is a great job for anyone involved in makeup, skincare or even hair care. you can learn more about products while on the jobs. Most days have a steady foot traffic. Hardest part of the job is memorizing where every product line in at in the store (not required but helpful to know)."
good,Every morning Id come into work dressed in all black and a face full of makeup to help customers feel comfortable asking me for help. The work hours weren't much and the location was mainly empty since it was a new store.
good,"I typically work truck shifts on the weekends.  I enjoy being able to come into work early am and getting off in plenty of time to enjoy the rest of my Saturday or Sunday.  I occasionally pick up a shift during the week as well.  I enjoy helping customers get their desired look and trying to new makeup techniques.  I do not get to interact with customers at my Bank position, so it is nice to have that interaction with the public at Ulta."
good,"Great environment surrounded by people who wanted to strive for more.  Had a great relationship with the management team there.  Motivated me to be better at my job, and handle more then I thought I could take."
good,Ulta is definitely a great company to work for. They have helped me develop my skills as a leader and as a team player. I get the opportunity to be around all things beauty in an environment that i am comfortable to work in. I would like to see change in compensation and benefits and for them to add more payroll to the stores so that we are able to really execute our roles and give wow experiences.
good,"Working at ULTA is so enjoyable as long as you have the right management and team, they offer flexible hours, and discounts are amazing. They do work around your schedule if they are really interested in you."
good,"I absolutely love the company overall, I've had the best year of my life being at ULTA. They really take care of their employees and express how important they are. I've learned so much about my trade and have been able to perfect it even more. All the girls I work with are so friendly, I've never made more friends in a work environment. This has been the best team, we all care for each other and make sure everyone is alright. The clientele/ customers are also wonderful, it's been a real honor to be a part of my store."
good,"Working at Ulta was an amazing experience for me. I had amazing coworkers and managers. I really enjoyed my time as a beauty advisor and if I didn't have to move for college, I'd still be there."
good,"I didn't really work during store hours, I was more a behind the scenes kind of employee and I loved it. After working in the store for a year, I then went to work at the warehouse which was actually very interesting and educational."
good,I enjoyed everyday at Ulta Beauty. Everyone is very nice and helpful. I will be returning to work there for the next holiday position. I learned a lot about beauty and makeup. I would recommend this job to any woman looking for a place she feels welcome.
good,"A typical day was fast paced and fun. The store is kept clean and orderly, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, the items available for purchase are vast in both quantity and price range."
good,This was an extremely fun place to work at as a female due to being surrounded by multiple beauty products. It was great to be able to help the customers in finding exactly what they needed.
good,Ulta is so generous with their employee discount. The management staff is absolutely wonderful and very personable. It's a very fun upbeat place to work.
good,I love working for ulta beauty The hardest part of my day is pleasing each and every guest. A typical day would be greeting each guest as they walk in
good,"A day a Ulta is peaceful. The work place is stress free and comfortable to be in. I had my own office and the people there were great to be around. The things that I learned while working at Ulta was how to reset RF guns, follow all the incoming and outgoing network traffic on the servers. I would send out emails stating what I did that day and what may be needed to fix a certain cart."
good,In this role I get to help guests find the perfect skin care or makeup product they need. I perform full skin treatments using professional and prestige product. I also get to build connections with people and help them feel and look their best.
good,Great place to work if you like working in a fast paced facility. Get great experience in learning new things. Only thing I didn't like was they kept me overnight and didn't discuss switching my hours after I had my baby in August.
good,"This job is perfect for individuals who are into and knows make-up, cosmetics, and perfumes and colognes. If you like to do make overs or help others make over this is the job for you"
good,"a lot of infomation jammed into you while training but to be succesful beauty advisor it would take 2-3 months to fully trained, "
good,Everything is balanced nicely. Salon and retail are never out of sync there is little to no drama we always have service with a smile and customers are always satisfied
good,"Beautiful stores, fun place to work, challenging but fun. Full service salon in all locations. Very fast pace environment. High volume. Open on thanksgiving."
good,Ulta was an incredible place to work. My only regret is that the company puts certain policies before their people. Management was great. Advancement was easily outlined.
good,The only thing i didn't like about my job was the General Manager when i was employed there... she was unprofessional and heard she's no longer employed through Ulta
good,"I loved working at Ulta, I always looked forward to coming in! My team members were so friendly, the store was always kept clean and organized, and the management was amazing!"
good,"I absolutely love working for this company! The management and the way things are run from time to time could be worked on. But for the most part i loved working in the store, co-workers are always pleasant and training is great."
good,"ULTA BEAUTY was and is a dream job. For a fanatic of makeup and beauty and skin care, who wouldn't want to work there. Customer service is always great we put our guest as our number one priority and the fact that we can grow within the company is always amazing."
good,A fun place to work with a great atmosphere. The beauty advisors and management are friendly and always helpful.  I love learning about all the latest beauty products and the gratis is great so we can advise the customers on what we think about the products.
good,Management was great. Discount is definitely a plus. Most shifts available for sales positions are only part time. They also have a salon which requires a license.
good,"*hard work. sweaty."
good,"Really great people and management at this Ulta. Hours and benefits are not the greatest, but the discount makes it worth it. Overall a fun place to work."
good,"The job itself was very enjoyable and I never dreaded coming to work. If it hadn't been for some poor management, it'd be 5 stars all around. Furthering my career in a cosmetic based field has been my goal since I was young and I was really hoping to be able to do that here, so off to better things?"
good,"Excellent product knowledge is key in any position at ULTA Beauty, along with a commitment to providing great a customer experience in all aspects.  "
good,"I have been with Ulta Beauty for about six months now and a typical day at work has become a relaxed and great work environment. I open the store with another manager and we do some work before we open in two ours and the opening cashier arrives. This work could include cycle counts, out of stocks, finding claims, assessing damages, stocking the isles with product from the back, assembling or disassembling planograms or just facing the store. I love the people I work with and they have become an essential aspect to my success at work. I was trained excellently when I first started and I attribute my store knowledge and skill set expertise to the two managers that trained me. Another day at work would be doing the new shipment early in the morning and stocking the store. It is hard work and definitely the hardest part of the job but i like the early morning start and it is a great workout as well as a great way to stay current with all our products. I think it is important to be apart of new product arrivals because it engages you in the stores inventory and allows for more genuine and accurate customer service. I have never enjoyed working for a company or felt more like a family at any other job I have held before and I plan on being with the company for years to come."
good,My co-workers were helpful and friendly. Stocking kept me busy and I had multiple tasks that were fairly easy to follow. The management was professional and well kept.
good,"I normally work either a 5 or 7 hour shift a day, it was pretty easy there would normally be a few rude customers but that's normal considering it is retail. Management is very nice and considers your feelings and time, co-workers are great and really sweet and hardworking. Would definitely recommend people send in an application."
good,"Some days can be slow some can be very fast paced and have you running all around, but staying busy is what drives me and keeps me going, To sit and do nothing but day dream is a drought to me so I love more productive work settings."
good,"Working in beauty is a fun environment that almost any girl would love to work in. It was great working with customers and helping them find everything they need to help them feel beautiful. It makes you feel good when you help better someone and your client leaves very happy, that was my favorite part of the day. I learned to talk to a variety of different people. The management was very friendly but did not train for the position. My co-workers were great we all worked together as a team everyday to make our goals and be one of the top stores in the district."
good,"Working for Ulta keeps you constantly busy. Whether tasking, coaching, assisting guests with their needs; there is never a time to stand around and do nothing."
good,Salon not promoted enough and awkwardly located in the store. Stylists are often made to do the retail employee's work.
good,This company is a great starting off position for any hairdresser in the industry. They work hard to push their designers to the next level and ensure all education is up to date and technical skills are improved.
good,The ability able to help people is a rewarding opportunity. I enjoy assisting people and introducing them to new ways of doing things.
good,I love working with all my coworkers and managers to help customers find what they are looking for. I am always finding and trying to products that I like and I love getting to share that information with others.
good,This company is a great place to learn of all the new trends and makeup techniques. The wide verity of brands allow you to choose the right make-up raging from price and category variations.
good,While employed with ULTA . I was able to implement my product knowledge and customer service skills to help maintain a good customer base.
good,"I greeted and assisted customers daily in purchasing items. I learned about the great variety of cosmetics, fragrance, and styling products. My managers were very down-to-earth but professional to work with. I enjoyed looking forward to going to work because I had a more positive outlook on life interacting in that type of environment."
good,"A typical day at work for me is fun and exciting"
good,Overall I loved being the first and last person a costumer sees. I loved the smiles I was happy to see everyday and the many thank you's I got. Very fun place to work at. I had an amazing team that will always look out for eachother so that means I was NEVER alone. If I needed help I can always go to my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the hours were not always the same.
good,"I love skin!! As an Esthetician in the beauty industry, its a constant competition for clients in the retail world. People are always looking for a deal or bargain. However, people are also always looking for someone they can trust with they way they look. I have been busy and worked extremely hard to get from where I was to where I am, and still have a lot of growing and climbing to do. The training provided by Dermalogica is unlike any other. The educators know their stuff and training is paid for by ULTA. Tolls and gas are reimbursed, although sometimes at a snails pace. I work under a great salon manager and have never had any personal issues with her. She is very understanding and willing to see each succeed in their own aspect as well as a very flexable person, easy to get along with as long as you stay busy, as that's what they pay you for. Hardest part of the job is not waiting for the ""customer bus"" to pull up and bring you all your clients, you have to be willing to network, set up and do demos, pass out cards, talk to clients getting hair or nail services, etc. Most enjoyable part of my job is working on a clients skin and 2 weeks later having them come back and seeing leaps and bounds of improvement in issues they were having initially. My coworkers are surprisingly low-drama and we all get along great. We get the occasional worker that takes advantage of leaving early too often, being sick more than usual or not helping the salon run smoothly by messing up the schedule book or not cleaning before they leave. Over all, ULTA is a great place to build your business,"
good,"if you love makeup and beauty this is the place to work. They educate you on makeup applications and brands so it makes selling the products easier and fun."
good,"Work place wre well organized and ready to just be there to preform your best."
good,"Dependent on your goals an ambitions for growth in your career, Ulta can offer limitless opportunity to grow. The company is growing rapidly and as it is one that fosters internal growth, they are always looking to develop talents in house to bring those with the skill and the will to next."
good,A typical day consisted either of starting work at 5am and unloading the merchandise truck sorting it into different areas of the store and then stocking the merchandise which lasted til 11am. Other days I was basically just cashiering and making sure customers were greeted and satisfied with their purchases.
good,"Typical day at Ulta involves cleaning and LOTS of customer interaction! I gained a lot of experience from working at Ulta, including with how to effectively deal with problem situations in a timely manner. The best part of the job is meeting lots of interesting people. Weekend and holiday hours are not very employee friendly, though."
good,retail sales
good,Working in Ulta Cosmetics gave me opportunity to branch my skills as a makeup artist.
good,"If willing, you can learn everything about the ins and outs of the store. Managers are open to teaching what is necessary for the store. The hardest part of working here is the fast-paced culture because it can seem like nothing gets done, but this is where teamwork is open to grow."
good,A Typical Day AT work would be kinda exhausted but overall I learned many new things . I also meet new people different environment. I did have a con of the job some Of staff
good,"Plenty of hours. Great work environment."
good,"All positions are part-time until you become management, work for a boutique, or a master stylist with Ulta. "
good,"Nice environment to work in. The bosses were cool and the employees were friendly. Pretty easy schedule, as I worked the weekend shift. The pay was competitive as well."
good,"They are great company and the supervisor is are friendly and understanding. The long hours can kill your feet if your not use to it, I do recommend some souls for your feet to relieve them. I now know how to sort out items into totes/bins and pack up the items/orders in to boxes to be shipped out."
good,"I have worked at 3 different Ulta's and each one is very different, but they're all fun because I'm doing what I love. I get to learn new tricks about makeup and help guests answer questions. If I don't know the answer, I get someone to who does know to help and I get to learn something new to expand my knowledge of the makeup world."
good,Great for those that are looking to have a career and not just a job. There are many opportunities for growth. Managers will work with you to help you evolve in the company and get to where you want to be career wise.
good,I adored working for this company and I loved my team! Ulta is such a fun and inviting place to work and I actually couldn’t wait to come to work! The only downside was we had a lot of executive turnover and I didn’t feel I was able to move into a higher position at the rate I wanted. I tried to return to Ulta after gaining executive experience elsewhere and was told via recruiter that Ulta would not consider me for ANY role which was heart breaking especially since I left on such fabulous terms. If you want a job and want to stay in that role forever this place is perfect just don’t count on advancement unfortunately
good,"I've worked at this location for nearly four years and it has been a pleasure working for Ulta."
good,I love the value and the way they take care of their employees and empower each employee to succeed. My manager at the time taught me a lot of lessons I use in daily life.
good,"When working at ulta, you must want to work and be able to work in different areas such as stocking, helping guest, working the cash register, and cleaning up the store around the clock as necessary."
good,Managers are great. Always making sure that everything runs smoothly. Definitely a good teaming working place for employment. Always ready to answer questions. Rules easy to follow.
good,"This is a great a place to learn about many different beauty brands, from makeup to hair to skin to nails. There are Also opportunities to move up in the company, expanding your career in many different directions."
good,"A work day at Ulta consisted of helping customers, scheduling appointments for clients, answering phone calls, looking up product, and greeting guest as they come in and out of the store. "
good,"Ulta consistently provided opportunity for advancement also while enhancing knowledge of product and service. As a sales associate, you get to interact with very fun customers, and other sales representatives from brand name makeup retailers."
good,Working at Ulta has shown me how to become comfortable in public speaking. We would have meetings and questions were being asked and answered. A typical day would be advising customers in products they are looking for.
good,I learned more than I thought I would in this position not only from management but from my other team members as well. the culture is warm and welcoming and also makes for an enjoyable day at every shift. the only difficult part is the fact that it's retail.
good,"Ulta was by far my favourite job. I loved my team, and the managers actually cared about their staff. I learned a lot about beauty and skincare working there and I have been able to use that knowledge every day and also help others."

good,"If you love make-up and working with a great group of girls then ulta would be a great place to work."
good,There is definitely opportunities to grow and advance in the company. Management is very welcoming. Customer service skills are a must here. There are different departments to work in like operations which is behind the scenes or more on the front lines with MAC counter or the Prestige section.
good,Ulta Beauty offers a lot of room for growth. There are different brands and many other positions to be trained in. Its very tedious in a sense the store is so big there's always something to do.
good,"My experience with Ulta was very pleasant. I furthered my knowledge as far as management skills, and client relations. Management was very skilled and helped all employees advance in their careers."
good,"I enjoy working at Ulta, not only for the tools I have to be able to achieve what I need to do, but also for the environment.They hire fantastic managers who will listen, guide, and set you up for success. It is a very ""we/us"" type of place. If one of us fails, we all do and work towards getting that goal taken care of. It's either all of us win, or all of us lose together, but with the team work we have, we are able to make our goals."
good,Such a great place to be apart of and work for! You get to help customers with any of their needs or questions about products and really help them find what best suits them! You also get to meet new people who share I love for makeup just as much as you do!
good,I was a Sales Manager with Ulta Beauty. I absolutely loved every part of it! Upper management was very active in our sales and stores but still gave store managers the freedom to do what they needed to do in order to bring sales in. I couldn't be happier with a company!
good,"It was fun to learn about the new make-up, skincare and haircare lines coming into the store. Being able to get samples to try so we could sell the products was a def plus."
good,Weekends and holidays are busy but still fun to work. On slow days we sticked and got stuff that needed to be done. Sometimes cut hours if we were to slow. Truck deliveries were stressful because of being crunched for time. Ad set and planograms were always fun to do.
good,As a beauty fanatic Ulta is the perfect place to work part-time. It is a job where I can use my passion for cosmetics and the beauty industry while not having to have a full career. I would recommend the company to anyone that has a passion for the industry and is looking for a job that can balance with a busy life.

good,"its a fun workplace "
good,"I loved every second of working here, it was the best job to date I ever had and I miss it so much. I loved helping out clients with any questions that they had, but doing inventory was my favorite part of it all. I just wish I could've been full time or that they offered it because had they do that, I would have loved to stay there forever."
good,"Love working at ulta, wish I could work full time. I have to find another part time job because I only work 4 days a week and only about 6 hours when I am working."
good,Was a great job and a great store. Gave me great customer service experience. Taught me valuable lessons in working in warehouse and back room stocking
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Ulta is the inclusiveness of others. Ulta is great about providing everybody with the tools to beauty. This is much more than cosmetics, skincare or haircare but the freedom to express yourself based on your desires. Everyone has a different definition of beauty and thats what makes it so exciting."
good,"This is a place for a people person who loves to make connections, open to learn new knowledge, as well as offer knowledge to customers based on their personal needs."
good,I think my time working with this compay was grea. My shifts would go by fast and i loved getting dolled up for work. only down side was minimum wage.
good,I love helping my clients on any beauty/skin care question they might have and helping them learn and feel more comfortable and better in their own skin/beauty routine.
good,"I loved working at Ulta. It was a fun environment with a great team. There was always something that needed to be done, so we weren't ever standing around with nothing to do."
good,"What I have gained from working at Ulta is how well to work as apart of a team, getting a project finished on time, sales experience. The hardest part was missing my kids at home. The workplace culture is very professional, you always have to look nice dressing in black. It was easy, but I needed more hours."
good,I learned a lot at Ulta. Customer service and we always always worked as a team. Never a dull moment  we were always encouraged to make our goals in a timely manner.
good,I enjoy working at Ulta. I have been here for quite some time now. My favorite part is helping people look their best and being that person they can come to for beauty advise.

good,Working at Ulta is never a task. If you like makeup this job will be a breeze. There's also plenty of ways to move up in the company so that's a huge plus.
good,"If I could put in 40 hours a week and be able to leave by 5:00 pm it would be the perfect job for me."
good,"I loved working at ulta. It was laid back, hours were awesome, pay was good, and everyone was so friendly and caring. Also, the benefits they provide have been the best I’ve ever received."
good,"I loved my time working at Ulta and even got offered the position of Assistant manager. Unfortunately I could not take it because of the financial aspects and had another full time job. If I had the opportunity to do it over again I would have definitely taken my shot and stayed with the company. I have many friends that still work for Ulta that have done amazing things. Great company, great management, great opportunities for advancement, great products, no bad things to be said!"
good,It's most busy not the weekends but talking bout makeup all day with customers is never anything bad. The hardest part of the job is stocking in the morning because you don't always have time.
good,"A typical day at work for a beauty advisor is stocking floor and cashier. Most times you walk into work and I would always get their early so I wasn't allowed to clock in until it was my time so I could go around see what needed to be done. I would then clock in at my time and take my attention where it was directed by a manager or where I saw fit. It terms of helping out customers, a lot of beauty advisors don't really do much of that unless you make it a point to. I loved talking to customers and helping them out so I often found myself helping the customers out as often as possible. There are also gifts with purchases you would need to remember to give the guest the their purchases qualified."
good,My manager quickly became one of my best allies. I was in a training store. I loved my job and I loved how all of us had each others back. I learned so much from my trainings and enjoyed my time working here. We would help the other departments from time to time. I found it fun and invigorating. I felt spoiled and loved every second I worked there.
good,I am grateful for the opportunity to work at Ulta. We had a great team and worked well together. I was able to help them get store ready to open and it was a great experience.

good,I love getting to work with what I absolutely love.  Working at Ulta has really opened my eyes to show me my passions and I want to continue to work with it in the future.  I want to go work everyday in a job that I love and I get to do that working at Ulta.
good,"Amazing place and people i love the atmosphere and would recommend to anybody as a job if you love beauty. The management was okay, i didn't receive much training i basically had to train myself. But the job was so interesting and changed everyday it was worth it to me. I also seen it as a challenge and loved every bit of it."
good,It’s a good place to work for. It’s a company owned by women for men and women interested in the beauty industry. Friends become family after a while and it’s a team effort environment.
good,"I loved working at Ulta in Columbus, Ms. My managers and cowokers were awesome! There was always a great atmosphere and very helpful staff available when I was there."
good,Instantly I felt like I was part of the team. Staff members ensure everyone is in synch and ready to go with our day to make our goals. I had fun helping guests find what they needed and seeing their faces light up when they get to use points on their purchases.

good,I enjoyed working for ulta. My mangers were excellent and hard working. the job itself is fun and challenging. I'd go back again if I still lived in that area.
good,"Ulta is an amazing company to work for. They continue to grow and expand on all beauty trends. They offer tuition reimbursement, continued education, great employee benefits and a fabulous employee discount."
good,"Relaxed work environment. Managers truly had best interests of employees and customers in mind. Discounts were great. Many opportunities to learn cosmetics, skincare, and haircare."
good,"Love working for ulta because we have a great opportunity to grow with the company. Sometimes get gratis (free product). As a company we do a lot for charity, example for October we help raise money for Breast Cancer Research Foundation."
good,Perks are great! Love the discount on products and the hair salon.  The manager is very flexible with the schedule.  Learning all the types of products can be overwhelming but with time it's very rewarding to help customers one on one
good,"Always busy and very challenging. i have learned so much working @ Ulta Research. Great people, environment etc... Work environment is very comfortable and enjoyable."
good,i enjoyed my time working at Ulta. I was an employee for about 5 years and i enjoyed so much working in the beauty field. You are the first to see new products and learn new techniques. i do wish that they were a little more giving when it came to gratis. maybe it was just the managers at my store but we hardly got anything.
good,"The job itself is not hard if you actually enjoy the beauty industry. Definitely room for advancement. Some managers are childish, but the GM is wonderful. Starting pay for beauty advisor is 8.50 and they don't offer full time."
good,Noisy place but I enjoyed working there I would go back if I get the opportunity to get hired back I enjoyed the Bingo Boxes it was fun to play Bingo and receive products from there and the discounts at the ULTA stores.
good,"The pay is not the best, but it is such a fun job. You also get to work very close with people and they carry the best products so it makes it easy to give people advice on the best products."
good,Working at Ulta I learned how to work well with customers as well as fellow employees. Constructive criticism helped me to grow and I enjoyed working with all those involved.
good,A typical day involves helping customers channel their inner beauty while trying to find the best topical products to make them more confident and love themselves even more! Cashier responsibilities and makeup application as well. Stocking. Organizing. Great attitude
good,If you are a knowledgeable person in makeup and skincare then you will thrive here. I really enjoyed working here and I learned a lot of different brands during my time at Ulta. All of the people who work there are personable and nice. I never really had any drama as a problem.
good,"Fun, Great Place to Work."
good,"I LOVED working at Ulta and wish I could've stayed, but I received another offer that I could not refuse so that is why I left. Worked with a wonderful group of people, received tons of free gifts, learned a lot about the beauty industry, and genuinely enjoyed helping women feel better about themselves. The hard part was not having a set schedule but that is retail :-)"
good,"Easy to work with the product and stocking them. You learn a lot about the product, different departments, team work. Friendly place to work with your co-workers and management. The hardest part at first is to get your productive to a percent. The most enjoyable part of the job is everybody helps everybody out and works as a team. Management helps you to make your percent and if you are having and trouble with your assignment."
good,"Great company for new stylist that need to grow their clientele and keep learning with continuous classes. As well as for established stylist who like to keep up with the trends. A lot of opportunities to grow, travel, train, or manage."
good,"Company invests in employees by promoting from within."
good,I absolutely loved working for this company. The only reason I left was to pursue the area in the field i went to school for and Ulta did  not offer tuition reimbursement or attempting to move to a higher department seemed impossible. I try almost every month to get back in but so far no bueno.
good,Ulta Beauty is a great place to work. The management is extremely friendly and will do just about anything to make their employees comfortable. There is something new to be learned everyday working at Ulta and the variety is great.
good,This job is very rewarding in the sense of being able to help your customers feel better about themselves and help with confidence. The management was stable but there were just a few slip ups along the way which is expected; I also loved my co-workers they made the job even better. The most enjoyable part of my job was not having to dread showing up because I loved what I was doing.
good,Great management staff. Enjoyed working here immensely. I loved the diversity that they incorporated into their team. I love makeup and hair products so this was my cup of tea. The ladies I worked with were extremely amazing talented women.
good,Working at Ulta Beauty was a great job to have in order to get started in the cosmetic industry. It is a team oriented environment and management is very supportive. Encouraged to constantly know about new products and trends to be able to efficiently aid guests find what they need. Overall have enjoyed working with the company.
good,"operational manager, performed day to day operational tasks"
good,"I was responsible for receiving freight and sorting items and stocking shelves. We had a great team of people working together to obtain our goals.I especially enjoyed setting up new displays and planograms for new,discontinued and promotional items.I liked the management team and was flexible if they needed me to work on short notice. I also was asked to work to set up for a brand new store."

good,"Being able to interact with clients and customers daily was awesome, and being able to help them with their skin care needs was very rewarding"
good,Always looked forward to coming in to work each and every day. The boss' always appreciated the great work from my co workers and I.
good,"You can really jump start your business quickly if you put it in the effort. It's easy to build your business since you can convert retail guests to the salon. Great benefits, and as you move up thru the levels of your position you gain a higher percent of your commission, which is pretty generous to start. Salon staff got services for free. Retail staff gets 50% off, and you get a product discount of 20% off.  Also the company provides continuing education."
good,"A typical day at ULTA Beauty as the Merchant Sales Coordinator includes chat-in/chat-out's with employees, coordinating tasking and customer service, solving employee and customer issues or complains, opening/closing procedures, and completing daily tasks."
good,I absolutely love working at Ulta. The staff and management are so friendly and willing to help and teach whenever they can. It is a great creative outlet. I love helping customers find products they need as well as showing them products they are not familiar with in order to broaden their horizons.
good,I really enjoyed the staff.  I had a great group of ladies that worked under me.  We really enjoyed each other and had a great time at work!  Management was good.  The other salon managers that I had the honor of working with were a great support.
good,"Managing and opening several stores and Ulta salons . Hiring new teams for the salons. Training, I really enjoyed Ulta  it was a fun and exciting time in my life. I enjoyed Traveling for continuous education and experiencing new and exciting trends with the company. The people I worked with were a joy to be around and the management teams were amazing."
good,"I worked here during the 2013 holiday and it was so enjoyable! Talking to customers about hair and makeup was a dream to do and seeing everyone satisfied with their purchases and given advice. "
good,"General product knowledge of all brands carried"
good,"Awesome place, loved my co workers, loved my management team.  I did not get a whole lot of hours but all in all it was great working there."
good,managment was the reason I left. but now they have a brand new manager whom i love!
good,"Very fast pace, great work environment. Love the team unity, hardest part of the job is leaving the store... going home at an appropriate time leaving the guest and the associates, they all make the job so enjoyable."
good,No day is ever the same at Ulta! A typical day at Ulta was exciting working with many new cosmetic brands. The most gratifying part of the job was assisting guests and their needs. Co-workers were upbeat and fun. The hardest or most challenging was being able to get all the tasking completed in the time allotted.
good,Good Place to work. Plus the Discount is Great!
good,"These were the greatest ladies anyone could ask to work with. Everyone worked well with each other and we got the job done, all while having fun! all of the management was great and i felt comfortable going to any of them about anything at any time. the hardest part of the job would be the early start time but at the same time it made it one of the best things about the job also, leaving me the rest of my day to get other things done. I have no negativity about this job. had i been able to get more hours or become full time I would be still today."
good,"Typical work day consists of assisting customers, cashiering, up-selling, go backs, and cleaning. Product knowledge is key. Learning about different types of products such as foundations, eyeliners, blushes, facial cleansers, anti-aging, and even hair products is important when it comes to helping customers find the best product(s) for them. Management is always encouraging and positive, they're always willing to help you get to your next level and push you to do your best and beyond. The hardest part of the job is putting away all the shipment. The job is most enjoyable when helping customers and suggesting complementary items and really seeing them appreciate the service."
good,Love showing people who want to learn about new products and love all the new items that come out almost every week. A downside is some customers can be rude and not understanding when you are trying to help.
good,"Great atmosphere, supervisors always on top of everything. Employees were always nice and cross training was always available. I learned a lot in that company"
good,Really fun and professional workplace and wonderful place to start a career and endless opportunities and I experienced so much that helped me after my journey
good,Ulta was by far one of my favorite jobs. There are all kinds of different people there but everyone got along beautifully. There is so much love and support in this company I'd recommend working here to anybody.
good,"You learn a lot from the other employees about the beauty world and the health of your skin and hair. you also get to help young kids find their style in the beauty world and help them find what works for them  and you also learn so much from the customers as well like tips on how to use specific products as well as dupes for others,"
good,"great experience with the company. gratis, great managers. "
good,This is by far the best company I’ve ever worked for. I absolutely love it. All my coworkers and managers were so welcoming and made me feel at home. That makes a huge difference in your job. I love  coming to work. I learn something new every single day.
good,"I constantly find myself wanting to go back to Ulta, but I need a higher compensated job. It was a well run business, easy to work with the employees and customers."
good,"Ulta Beauty DC was a great place to work for but unfortunately the warehouse closed down. Management was great, minimal supervision. Very safe environment."
good,"Walked  in 10 minutes early for my shift, clocked in and gave my 100% until I clocked out.   I learned qualities of beauty and being a better cashier."
good,"It obviously depends on the management but my ulta is stress free, fun, and i honestly don’t do too much. I’m paid well and never had any type of issues with my managers or co workers only complaint is that the hours aren’t the best."
good,Ulta is a great salon to work in because they offer opportunities to advance. They encourage you to gain clients from the sales floor. It was fun to interact and work together with other coworkers.
good,"I worked exclusively as a tasker for my store, and it was a job that I learned a lot from. I was part of the ""heavy lifting"" group who had to work some not fun hours but we reset planograms, stocked shelves, reset displays, changed window banners, and all the behind the scenes stuff. "
good,Welcoming company and crew is amazing. Hard working staff and always drives to be great. Being the only location in this borrow we go hard to prove we the best.
good,I enjoyed my time here. We got a good amount of gratis pretty regularly and the discount was nice. They were very strict about attire and clocking in and out.
good,"A typical day at ULTA Beauty is very fast paced, you are always doing something. Working as a cashier means you have to be patient, yet fast, and you have to complete all of your other tasks in between ringing up guests. You are never bored. "
good,I loved working at ulta. I loved my managers and the incentives I was given to meet goals and work harder. I am very diligent and organized at work so I got along with just about everyone!
good,"Continued education!  Encouraging management that promotes career growth and development. The commission out rate potential is amazing!  It's diversified position, you can do makeup, hair, and eyebrow waxing."
good,"I was a lead skin therapist at the ULTA in Buffalo, NY and I have to say, this by far the most fun I have ever had working anywhere. I would 100% go back. The Salon Manager was honestly so understanding of my life and the disaster it was in at the time. There were times I had emergencies come up and it was either call in or bring my daughter with me. She let me bring her. The ULTA family was one I will never forget!!!"
good,"Ulta is a great place to work, they are great about working with your schedule and pride themselves on diversity and overall culture of associates. Management is very interactive and friendly!"

good,Learned a lot about customer service and product analysis. Great on your feet type of job and your mind is always willing to expand on product knowledge
good,Ulta is a great company theirs a lot of team work . If you want to learn every department is always a yes . Ulta is always giving away stuff to their employees. In the holidays every employee receives a Christmas box . Weekly they always play bingo depending in the production.  Great experience
good,Typical day involves helping the customers with their beauty needs and trying new make-up that has come in the store. You are given the freedom to express your style at work as long as you are dressed appropriately.
good,"From the interview to my last day of working with store 423. Its been nothing but love an learning,the best job i've ever had. its hard work but it pays off. Great company."
good,"I love being an esthetician, I love Dermalogica. I love for my customers take care of their skin. I admire them. Most people think makeup is great because it covers. That is not the answer. The best way your makeup and skin to look good is by skincare. My manager hired me, she wanted success for me. But the way she came across seemed kind of unprofessional. Yelling in front of customers or calling me when I am off. You handle that in the back so customers don’t hear you or complain. She has a good heart. She is a good person."
good,"Ulta Beauty had a positive working environment and motivated employees to meet their goals. Every employee was expected to go through customer service training guided by managers. Every shift, employees would meet with the managers and discuss the day’s sales goals. While the goals were challenging, with our location averaging four times to goal of any other location, I found them attainable."
good,"1st real job after college as an Entry Level Graphic Design Consultant which has opened many doors for me in my previous 4 years in the Health & Beauty industry. I’m so fortunate to have been given just a 4-5 month Creative freelance gig fresh out of college. I learned how a successful, well structured, organized and driven powerhouse company, that remains the industry leader, operates. I learned more in those few short months than I have in the last 4-5 years as a graphic designer and as a professional. ULTA Beauty gave me my best work even to date."
good,Ulta beauty was actually a very fun place to work! Most of the employees were very friendly people. The task I was asked to perform wasn't too difficult.
good,"I liked working at Ulta. Always something new going on. Daily challenges. Kind of a busy rollercoaster ride. In a fun environment with everything beauty you could think of. Sometimes Corporate action was lacking compassion, you must adhere to the rules or be terminated. There are many simple rules, just follow them and you'll do great!"
good,Ulta beauty warehouse was a good warehouse to work at. It was where coworkers became family. The culture there was fun. Management cared about their employees and so on. To bad it had to shut down.
good,"My ulta store is great. The company at this time is growing at astronomical rates and opened over 1,000 stores since the two years that I’ve been working with them. Because the company has been growing I feel as though that contributes to a slightly slower process when we need something done with our store. If we have any issues however, our managers are great. Customer service is the absolute most important thing to this company. Moving up in the chain is fairly easy and there are several possible positions that are available. I’m personally a prestige beauty advisor which is above the regular beauty advisor position or cashier."
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience working at Ulta. The management team is so fun and friendly and they're able to maintain healthy, professional relationships with employees. The current GM wants all the employees to enjoy where they work and she has made many positive impacts on this store. Our team meshes really well together and that makes collaboration easy."
good,Working at ulta was really fun and I had many teaching moments with my manager. My fellow employees and I would carry out or tasks but at the same time made professional relationships with our guests
good,"The managers are very understanding and are there to help. Coworkers are friendly and there to help along with put forth a team effort, hours are a struggle unfortunately. I would definitely stay if I got more."
good,I love working at Ulta. I've heard stories of people not loving the store they work in but mine is absolutely amazing. I love all the managers that I work with and all of the other associates. Ulta is really a place where we work together to make people (women especially) feel confident in themselves to be successful. Love my job.
good,"I worked in the salon. I worked my way up to Master Designer 2 and Salon Manager. The company brought you daily challenges and goals. It was constantly giving out new information and turning out the newest training for our staff. I feel like this job would be great for go-getters, goal-setters, independent, and ambitious people. The opportunities to climb up the ladder are there. You get what you put into it. "
good,"Ulta is a great place to work and shop. My time at Ulta has been eye opening and a very helpful learning experience. Everyone is treated with respect and kindly. Teamwork oriented, fun and upbeat."
good,"Ulta was all about keeping their associates in the know.  "
good,There is always something to do! The team you work with will make all the difference!  I really enjoyed my team members and the ability to acquire new clients by walking the floor and assisting customers.
good,"Great company and wonderful work environment. Although each store differs in their management style, the overall consensus is that each employee is treated fairly and equally."
good,"Great place to work, just didn't have enough ability for advancement. Management was always willing to help you and train you for new roles. Some of the store managers needed to be trained more."
good,"I help people out everytime I work, from showing people where to find something that they have been wanting, to helping someone find a new product they might like. I also sent up the floor a lot to get ready for new sales or events that might be going on."
good,A great environment.  Free products when working in prestige to learn about the business of cosmetics.  Associates are great to work with. Great with team bonding.  Always flexible with schedules
good,I’m working part time right now as a lead cashier- I started out a year ago last fall as a beauty advisor but was recently given a promotion by my GM. I was nervous about starting work again as I’d been a stay at home mom for about ten years before starting this position but I got into the swing of things pretty quickly and am excited every day I get to work! I learn something new every day and all of my managers and co workers are tight knit and easy to talk to. I can’t speak about full time hours but from my perspective as a part time employee I get a fair amount of hours (anywhere from 20-30 a week) and am paid a fair wage. We are also given gratis from time to time which is a great incentive to put forth your best effort! I’m really happy with this job and believe there is room for me to grow there and make it a full time career.
good,"Ulta was a fun, positive environment. Everyday everyone looked forward to working. If you are passionate about make up, hair, and skin care, this was the perfect job!"
good,I love Ulta Beauty. Its such a great atmosphere to be im. Everyone is super friendly. I love all things beauty and being there was like i was in heaven.
good,"During my 2 years as a prestige consultant at Ulta Cosmetics I learned a great deal about a career as a makeup artist and as a makeup sales woman. The prestige brands would send us DVDs for our quaterly trainings, which explained in detail all about the new product launches, what the benefits of the products were, how they were used, and selling techniques. Most of the companies even sent us gratis, which was great because it made it much easier to sell a lot of the products if you were wearing them on your own face. I discovered at Ulta how rewarding it feels to make a costumer feel beautiful and excited about their new purchases. I had customers come in and tell me that they were having a really bad day, and just wanted to purchase some new makeup to give  themselves a little pick me up. These costumers were my favorite. I dont wish bad days upon anyone, but I truly enjoyed helping them turn their bad day into a good one. I was able to demonstrate any product that they were interested in purchasing, so that they left feeling beautiful and with some new knowledge on how to use their purchases properly. I learned so much at this job that I was able to take all of the skills and knowledge that I obtained at Ulta and move on to Freelance for other Big name brand companies. If it wasnt for Ulta, I definitely wouldnt be the artist that I am today!"
good,"There is lots of training and great place for advancement. When you advance with the company, you get so many great benefits.  I loved all my training and my co-works were awesome."
good,This job was awesome if rehired I would go back ..they make good money and they care about everyone they work for also they do stretch routines before going to work and they provide you the things you need to make up the boxes and orders
good,"Ulta is definitely a fun place to work but there is little play time with makeup. Majority of your time will be spent setting up the store, doing truck, setting up displays,  and cashiering. Other than that it's an awesome company to work for if you don't mind the lack in hours."
good,This business has a typical retail environment. I have learned light inventory skills and food safety skills. The workplace culture stays current with fashion.
good,"I loved working with makeup, everyday I’d learn something new anout a product. Not just makeup but skincare, about different skin needs and every single person is different."
good,Most of my days are pretty fast paced if I am busy behind the chair.  I have a great support team that keeps one another encouraged and upbeat for growth of one another.
good,I worked here as a way to help get myself through college and loved it. I'm a huge fan of the makeup/skincare industry so being around all of it every day was so much fun to me.
good,"This was my first time working with Ulta. I worked as a stocker, sorter,  and display maker. This was a temporary job . We were helping to set up the new store ."
good,I loved my time at Ulta! Great atmosphere! Terrific as a part time job through college. Of course it was a part time gig for me and temporary so I can't speak for the benefits.
good,"Packing "
good,"I loved working here. It tore my heart to choose between the beauty industry and my current industry now."
good,"I love working at ULTA Beauty in Jacksonville Beach, FL! The Managers, beauty advisors, salon stylists etc. are all very friendly and engaging. Working in retail can be challenging but, your fellow co-worker is always there to help and provide needed laughs and support."
good,"My work family was amazing, never had any real problems with the girls who I worked with and with the one I did resolved it fast and easily, gratis all the time, and lots of opportunity to move up"
good,"The first thing I would do is get in contact with my Prestige Manager for a ""chat-in."" This is basically just your manager letting you know what our goal to accomplish for the day is. They briefly update you on the progress of reaching that goal so far that day. Management is firm on all rules, but they are understanding of ""life happens"" situations and will work with you on tardiness. They have a culture of guest hospitality and loyalty. We as employees of Ulta are to make sure we do everything we can to help our customers and give them a ""WOW"" experience. We need to make sure every customer has a loyalty ID for not only their convenience, but to meet our individual quotas. Every week we are evaluated on how well we keep our loyalty up. I learned more about cosmetic products while I was there. My makeup skills improved as well. The hardest part of the job is working the truck shift. You come in on Friday when the store is about to close at 9pm, work til sometimes 5am, and in that time you and 7 other employees unload a various number of pallets each with around 30 boxes of product on them. We sort the product out by brand and type of product, restock what will fit on the sales floor, and backstock the rest. The best part for me working at Ulta was getting to be around amazing makeup all day. I loved getting to tell customers about the latest trends, the new palettes, makeup essentials, and how to apply makeup."
good,"Everyone at my Ulta location is so friendly and helpful. It really makes coming to work a joy, not a chore! I love every aspect of the job, including early morning stock, helping customers match their beauty needs, and even cashiering is fun there!"
good,I believe Ulta is a good company. They support good causes and value transparency with their employees and policies. Working there was great and I enjoyed being there.
good,Amazing Experience! Tons of education. Pleasant culture. Vendor support is abundant to help store succeed. Vendor education on brands. GM's annual training is the best in the industry.
good,Working at Ulta is a fast paced and fun work place. Customer service is very important at Ulta. The management.I loved working at Ulta. They have a flexible hours for students.  There is also room for advancement if you want to to keep growing with Ulta.
good,"As a Stylist, I spent many years with other corporate companies, feeling under appreciated. At Ulta, I feel valued and that Ulta genuinely wants me to succeed. I love how we have events and are able to do Demo's in the store and show shoppers the skills I have. I have been with Ulta for 10 months and have already jumped commission levels! I never plan to leave Ulta because I have a set schedule that works for me and an appointment book that helps me manage my own business in Ulta!"
good,"I enjoy working for ulta and the experience it provides. A typical day would include opening registers, reviewing payroll for the day/week and adjusting based on sales trends. Inventory Adjustments, Ad sets, Shipment, Guest service, returns. "
good,The team that I work with us awesome. The hardest part about this job is getting credit cards but they motivate you and give you ways to improve. As long as you like working with people and being a fast paced environment from time to time you can do just great!
good,"Managers were always helpful and nice. You are able to have whatever hair color you want, do whatever makeup you want and can really make your schedule work for you."
good,All In All It’s A Good Company To Work For It’s Very Hands On They Will Train you Very Well  It’s a Simple Job To Do  supervisors  Are Awesome  The Leads Are Amazing The Co-workers if You Get To they more you  be comfortable with them  Once You’ve Been With The Company For Months They Will Train you Well And once you get the hang of the job you will be fine  I was  thankful enough to work at Ulta Dallas DC It was A good environment to For no complaints Just Nice Old Fashion Working Once Again Grateful Enough To Experience Working At This Wearhouse If Your People Person And If Like Working Warehouses This Is The Job For You they are helpful and everyway Ulta Is Place To Be I Was Honnored To Work With The People I’ve  work with  Ulta Beauty Is Good Personel
good,"My coworkers and managers are friendly and supportive. My hours are flexible, yet I generally know which kind of shifts I'll work. My managers especially are feedback-driven and will work hard to help inspire their team and keep everyone on track."
good,"The new owners are amazing they have they believe in do the right thing, they believe in work life balance, and I believe  the company is going to just keep growing and being successful."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. Great team full of great people who helped build each other up to provide a successful, productive working environment. Would recommend."
good,Great opportunity if you want to pursue a career with makeup. I always had fun recommending new products to customers and learned the products for myself. It was an amazing learning experience!
good,Everyday you greet customers and use your knowledge to educate customers on the products they are looking for. You are mostly working around females and all your faces are beat and contoured wonderfully! It is a fun environment to meet new faces and talk about the latest  products and make up trends. Don't let customers with a bad attitude ruin your day because more than likely it is easy to meet their needs in the store. Management is very helpful because they will show you exactly how to do everything to meet goals in the store. Ulta is a growing experience for cosmetic sales and customer service.
good,"Ulta beauty is a great place to work, I've almost hit my year mark and i couldnt be happier. My workers are the absolute best and management is always willing to work with my schedule and help me maintain good hours."
good,Very fun and exciting job. Loved my team and the company. I looked forward to each day and the customers. It was very challenging and always had something new to learn about.
good,"This is an amazing company with a growing pace, and a strong culture. Great education and training. Love the team atmosphere, and the ability to give the guest a specialized experience."
good,Great place to build your clientele. Lots of heavy walk ins 7 days a week. Excellent pay scale and the tips averaged around 20-25%. Advanced education was always offered.
good,Has a good work place culture and values. What I enjoyed most about my job was the flexibility good opportunities to learn new and exciting things in the work place. There wasn't really anything hard about my daily duties.
good,"Ulta Beauty is a company and brand I stand by 100%. Working for a company with a motto of doing what we love and loving what we do, I truly believe that to be true throughout the entire company. I enjoy helping people embrace their beauty as well as giving them a shopping experience that is both enjoyable and fulfilling."
good,"Ulta is a face paced, hard working company that employs strong personalities willing to work hard and be comfortable with talking to all guest with the Platinum standard.  Ulta is more than coming to play in the newest cosmetic, there is a lot of hard work that goes into keeping such a place in shape. Not only does Ulta sell into retail, but the locations also include a full service salon. Must be comfortable selling and be able to perform planograms. The benefits you reap; (not talking about insurance and paid time off.) The gratis: the free cosmetics, hair care products, skin care. All for attending training courses in store."
good,"It was a challenging but productive place to work. I worked mostly opening shifts. I had to learn many brand names and describe certain formulas, but I enjoyed working there. The atmosphere was also fun and the employees were very friendly, including the managers."
good,"Ulta is an extremely rewarding place to work! there are a lot of opportunities to move up in the company and if you are a motivated and hard-working, you were certainly rewarded for it in many ways."
good,"This company has grown my"
good,Always so much going on in the store. Great fun place to work. Fun place to work and express your self. Amazing discounts. Good benefits. Get to make people feel beautiful and happy.
good,"Had an amazing time with the Ulta team. Learned a lot between working as a cashier, truck worker, and changing signage! A wonderful managing team and lots of friendly faces!"
good,I loved working here it was a great job to take a step forward and get my foot in the door the only thing is that the general manager did not care about the employee and would take off weeks at a time and would never help out with the store
good,Ulta always has new products and exciting sales that keep you interested and excited about going to work. I would recommend working for this company and try not to spend your whole paycheck on the products.
good,Ulta Is a great company to work for and believes in letting their employees be creative. Opportunity for advancement is easily attainable for employees who really work toward a higher goal.
good,"Everyday is an absolute blast. Though, upper management can sometimes have the tendency to micro manage everyone gets along great. No drama, just makeup. Make your sales goals and do your job and you'll be fine."
good,"It was a great place to work. Fun friendly people. Worked 4 hour shifts,"
good,"Ulta is like the perfect part time job. I love my managers and coworkers. Also, the job is pretty easy and everyone is so fun to work with. I've learned a lot about retail, makeup, shipping/stocking, and customer service. Some days I work as the cashier or just helping customers out. Other days I work putting a way shipments, stocking, or creating displays/ad set. The people have been the most enjoyable part. I think the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers (as with all retail jobs). Additionally I have trouble with keeping my loyalty up. But overall the job is fairly easy and enjoyable!"
good,"Loved the job was fun and easy going environment, Met a lot of cool people. Sometimes did feel a bit more like just retail than working in makeup. If you're looking to be a makeup artist its great practice and hands on but sometimes feels like you're just trying to sell products instead of have fun with makeup. So I wouldn't recommend if you're ONLY looking at makeup artistry as a full time job."
good,"Awesome in store management "
good,"I loved working for this company, I was hired in to be their Clinique rep but all of my benefits came from ulta. They're a great company and were so willing to work with me. I would still be employed through them if I hadn't been forced to leave the state due to personal problems. Great management and staff, I was full time so the work life balance was a little difficult with retail hours but I loved it. Full insurance benefit package for full time employees, and it was amazing! So affordable! The makeup industry is one I've been in before with another retailer and I must say it was the complete opposite of working with Ulta. I highly recommend this company!"
good,"I have been in the salon industry for over 36 years. Ulta Beauty is the first company I've worked for that truly inspires Salon Professionals to be the very best they can be. Beyond the inspiring, Ulta Beauty also provides the tools for designers to achieve all of their goals, both personal and professional."
good,I enjoy working here and would recommend it to anyone who loves makeup. Downside is you sometimes spend your money on the makeup. The people are nice and management is fantastic.
good,"First got in everyone was very comforting, and helped me understand the flow of the store, all the managers are kind and understanding,"
good,"Great gratis, coworkers and management!"
good,"This was the best job i've had, I loved the staff, I loved the store guest, I loved the job culture the company created, all of it made for a great work place. Unfortunately I was offered a different job, somewhere else with better pay. But if i could get paid more to work for Ulta I would have never left"
good,"My overall experience working at Ulta was great. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with. It was also very nice helping customers figure out what they wanted and needed. A typical work day was mostly busy. I usually worked the cash register, but when I was not at the cash register I was helping customers. There was not really many challenges, but when there were I was sure to ask for help and made sure I did my best. Overall working at Ulta was a joyful experience."
good,"This is an amazing company with amazing people and I am so blessed to have the opportunity to learn and grow with this company. Management is always extremely supportive, I have learned how to work as a team and on my own, I get to meet hundreds of new people a week and its just overall an amazing experience!"
good,"Going into work was always a positive experience, the good attitudes of the management team made it easy to help them."
good,I really loved working here. If you love makeup you'll definitely love working here. The only thing i didn't like about working at the alabaster location is you don't get enough hours. They would only work me one day a week. but overall its an awesome place to work.
good,"I love love love love Ulta Beauty. I worked for Ulta during the summer of 2015 and christmas. I am still employee, only seasonal though. The environment of this job is great! The people are great! Out of all my jobs I've had, this is the best one. The only con is that, managers are not always on the same page, which affect us employees."
good,"Great place to work and great custumers, but I refuse to be treated or talked to in a very unprofessional manner or belittled in front of custumers."
good,"Fun place to work, nice people to work with, learned a great deal about customer service and about meeting goals and exceeding them"
good,"None at this time"
good,"If money is your main priority, then ULTA is the place for you. I don't mind working the hours, our store is pretty good about letting us have a rational amount of time to rest through out the day. The tips are excellent and the store is always pulling in foot traffic which makes it easy to convert shoppers to the salon. Management is fine, they follow all the rules and are very goal oriented with high expectations. If you make money, they make money, as a corporation what else is to be expected? I thoroughly enjoy working here and the high energy environment keeps me going all day."
good,"everyone is friendly and they're all willing to help each other. I definitely enjoyed working there. The manager was friendly. The hardest part was not being able to get a day off when I needed it, my manager wouldn't approve it nor would she let me trade shifts with my co-workers."
good,"My routine at ulta was greeting and servicing guest. I learned that each customer is different. Ulta was a fun and adventurous place o work, especially dealing with the customers and their different outlook out makeup and etc."
good,"A typical day at work involves opening registers, conducting budget analyzation for the day and week, checking e-mails, performing daily task duties, servicing guests, and helping employees achieve their daily goals. My years as a manager of Ulta taught me the importance of working as a team. Ulta is a ""guest service"" oriented company; we will do anything (within reason) to make sure the customer leaves happy. I enjoyed that this company gives me the opportunity to do what is right for the guest. I never found anything difficult about working here; I see everything as a learning opportunity. Everything takes some getting used to when you start a new career. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my employees grow within the company. I will teach anyone what I know, and I make sure it's a gratifying process."
good,"Loved the atmosphere, very fun and enjoyable place to work! Learned a lot about makeup and skincare brands and makeup application. Incredible management at that time, and great co-workers. Hardest part was theft and shrinkage. Most enjoyable part was everything about the job!"
good,It was seasonal but I would've stayed if I could! The managers were wonderful and you got discounts on the products and services! I miss it.
good,I loved working there i had a lot of great experiences i wish i never had to leave. I actually had a child at the time and focused my attention on him so after my maternity leave i didn't come back to work. They were very understanding and wish i could work for them again.
good,Even in the busiest and most stressful times of work (i.e. Christmas) Management always made work fun and enjoyable. We would laugh a cut up together to relieve tension created by demanding or demeaning customers. Great support system!
good,"Ulta is the best place to work. I've never been treated as well at a job as well as Ulta treats me. I always feel valued there. On a typical day  I will check customers out, put all the throwbacks back, do mark downs, and occasionally set up displays. Sometimes on Fridays I'm part of the truck shift which is where we unload the truck with product and sort and stock the shelves with product. The management is amazing. They are respectful and actually take a genuine interest in your well-being. There is no feeling of ""I'm above you"" like a lot of managers tend to show and give off. My co-workers are awesome. We all help each other out and there is no catty behavior which is surprising since it's mainly all female employees. We have each other's backs and it's not a problem to find someone to take a shift if needed. The hardest part of my job would have to be when there is down time and is slow and there isn't much to do up at the registers. There really is nothing I don't dislike about my job except that we never know what the new ad will be about until the day it comes out instead of ahead of time. It would also be nice to have more hours, just because I need the money, but so that I could be there more!! I find everything enjoyable, but that probably has a lot to do with the environment and the people I work with. What I've learned since I started working here was more confidence in myself but also more confidence in how I interact with people. My conflict resolution skills have improved as well. This job has brought nothing but good things my way. By far the best job I've ever"
good,"I absolutely LOVED.. L O V E D my team at ULTA. My boss had a mild case of OCD and had all of us girls keep the store in TOP NOTCH condition. This helped with sales, which in turn helped all of us get better reviews and move up in the business. "
good,"This position had a great management team that worked with my schedule all through college, allowing me to fund my tuition. I stayed with this company for six years and can still call former coworkers friends. This position allowed me to sharpen skills such as management, leadership, and customer service."
good,"Company has excellent customer service, the sales floor is always stocked. Help when needed, always friendly."
good,I worked daily hands on with makeup and skincare products. I interacted daily face to face with guests. I want to pursue a career in cosmetics and Ulta has helped get my foot in the door. The management where I worked could use some help but overall it is a great place to work.
good,very good place to work but Hr need to give full control of their duties and not give title only.
good,"great environment to work in you get the best of both worlds salon,prestige and drug store cosmetics setting all in one. awesome experience you get to learn a little about everything!"
good,loved this job. being a lead cashier was awesome. customers and their questions about the products made my day.
good,A typical day at work would be fun for me. I love make up and it gave me a chance to show my creative skills. My co-workers were all nice and I develop a relationship with a few. There were really not hard parts because it was fun to me.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and challenging."
good,Ulta Beauty is great way to get your foot in the door for the beauty industry. I am only speaking about my store when I say that the management team is like a family and everyone truly cares about how you are doing. As I am very sure all ulta beauty stores are like this I know that store 683 I the best of the best!
good,"Any amazing place to work discounts great, management was incredibly supportive in difficult situations, and provide feedback without being rude about it"
good,"The environment was great and the bosses were great. I learned so much "
good,Weekend shift great environment to work in job duties are easy  great shift hours management is great understanding. Hardest part of the job is keeping production up
good,Good place to work at! I basically love going to work because everyone loves me n I’m very dependable! I’m very friendly and I have the best customer service!
good,I worked as a seasonal employee and loved the environment. The staff the I worked with had the same passion for beauty. It was so easy to get along with everyone and have fun while doing it.
good,"I found that retail is totally for me here, they train so well and give so much encouragement and many opportunities!! Everyone I work with is amazing and the management is the best"
good,"The teamwork is incredible. You feel like you're a part of a family and the manage truly cares about you. Very fun, professional environment to be a part of."
good,"My time at Ulta Beauty was never a waste, there was constantly beneficial work to be done and something new to learn.  I was always pushed to improve and work to the best of my abilities while still be accepted for who I was.  My weaknesses were noted for improvement but never zeroed out as more important than my strengths.  The entire staff was professionally driven and every member of the seasonal team had great goals.  It was such a rewarding experience and I would recommend this job to anyone who cares about the beauty industry and customer service."
good,Great if your schedule isn't straight-lined. They really work with you in that sense. The management team is always willing to help you and would never ask you to do anything they wouldn't.
good,Lots of room to grow. Great atmosphere and job benefits. There were a lot of people who would steal in the store yet we couldn't do anything about it which was super annoying. But I love my job.
good,"I love working for Ulta. The company is amazing--with all of their benefits, pay, and gratis-- I love it. I plan to stay with his company for years to come. I have gotten 3 promotions in the year that I have been with the company. I plan to get more promotions in the future and stick with eh company to become a district manager."
good,Ulta is a very friendly environment. Loved working there. The hours were nice & consistent. Management was very nice as well! Would recommend to anyone!
good,"Learn a lot and was surrounded by good co-workers , good with equipment also did good at counting the inventory good working environment pay good and reliable hours"
good,"Typically we started the day on an overview of what the day would look like; busy or otherwise. Then, making a plan on how to be productive and make sales while promoting a positive ULTA experience. Loved my job, would have loved to stay longer to get into management but alas, I had to move and no way of transferring. Best part of the job were my coworkers we had a great bond that allowed the workplace to be fun and positive! Also, we were in a college town so we were allowed to go rogue with creativity. Managers were amazing, salon staff did the best they could, and beauty advisors were honestly the foundation to ULTA. They got the short end of the stick, due to having to be at the cash register all day, but were always able to make the customers happy."
good,Ulta provides the most generous commission compaired to other salons. You have the opportunity to make 70% commission. They hire fresh out of beauty school or if your are experienced. They offer ongoing training to help build your skills and keep up with trends. You can build your client base quickly by converting guests from the retail floor. Management is trained and supportive to helping you grow. Mistakes are expected for new talent and they coach you on how to improve.
good,"I loved working at ULTA! I worked there for almost 4 years and loved it. Like every job, it depends on the management, but my management was AWESOME. I was really sad when I had to leave."
good,Great place to work if I had to  recommend anyone in the beauty industry on where to get beauty   Products I will always recommend them to go to Ulta Beauty.
good,I absolutely love being apart of the Ulta Beauty team. Your hard work is always acknowledged by your managers. I couldn’t ask for a better company to work for. My goal is to grow within the company and make my career the best of it.
good,working at ulta is a rewarding experience. The staff is laid back and work steady. Management is really good at guiding the crew on how to get progress going. When business get challenging we put our heads together to figure out a solution to make things smoother.
good,"I loved working here! Atmosphere is fun and energetic. If you're committed to your work and the company you will advance with ease."
good,love working at Ulta.  Friendly co workers. Understanding management team. Company cares about their employees with an excellent balance between work and home life.
good,most enjoyable place to work at. if you really like makeup and beauty products this is the place for you. everyone there is very helpful and nice.i really love this location.
good,would highly recommend. very understanding a good work environment. the hardest part of the job is putting out the truck on thursday mornings. but it is a fun place to work.
good,I absolutely loved the atmosphere and knowledge that Ulta brings. Everyone was friendly and always willing to answer questions. There are many opportunities to move up in the company if you work hard.
good,"Great place to work, has a lot of potential for growth. I would have stayed if didn’t need to relocate.  I would love the opportunity to work for the company again in the future."
good,"You always had something to do, to help on the floor. Salon team helped build clientele for others. Felt more like hanging out with friends than working."
good,It was a fun place to work I made good money and I was advancing I started as temp to hire I showed my worth and they hired me on I had to leave for personal reason but I wish I never had to leave
good,"Overall great place to work. Love the environment and work place. Too slow for me in customers, not enough hours to live off of and would like more hours I currently work full time and work almost less than part time."
good,I enjoy going to work and being around the staff. I feel comfortable around the staff and like I can be myself. It's a really fun and exciting atmosphere where everyone is always pushing each other to improve.
good,"A typical day at work would be like everyday. It’s busy, but a lot of fun to meet everyone that walks in and assist them when they have questions or even need help."
good,"I loved working at ulta beauty. I would love to go back."
good,"A really positive environment, the managers are all incredible people and the atmosphere is really positive and supportive. I really loved my short time working there"
good,"Discount and gratis is a bonus, training is knowledge you’re getting paid to learn about brands that are already interesting. Events are fun and meeting brand partners is interesting."
good,It’s was a fun and welcoming environment! The management staff was especially friendly and very attentive with new employees. Definitely recommend other
good,Working at Ulta I have met many amazing and outgoing people who share the same passion for Beaty as I do. I loved working with my managers. They are very easygoing and willing to work out any problems with their employees to make their staff happy.
good,Working at Ulta has been one of my best professional experiences. My management team is dedicated to helping employees at all levels for growth and development to take you further within the company.
good,"Above average wage for our area. Amazing work culture. Managers value employees and promote people from within. Friendly environment, great discount. Clear expectations and communication with staff.  Really enjoyable work!"
good,"I love working for Ulta. I have worked for the company at 2 locations and each was unique, but consistent in the expectations and the opportunities for advancement. I enjoy getting to work with customers and help them find products suitable for their wants and needs."
good,"I loved working at Ulta and I met some great people, however I always felt like an outcast.  Maybe because I was seasonal, but I wasn't the only one who was.  Also, I did a lot of tending to the register and never got the chance to try another position elsewhere in the store.  Beauty and self-care are incredibly important to me so it was disappointing that I was just seen as another body.  I enjoyed some of the people I worked with and all the managers were great, but some ""seasoned"" employees were rude and did not want to work as a team."
good,"Everyday is something new. When under the right team, you will learn a lot about the company and the brands we carry. There is a balance with work and life, and a lot of fun perks!"
good,Ulta is the best place to work at. Friendly caring people all the time. The hours are definitely pretty amazing and everything. I loved working there everyone really cared about one another and always willing to give customer the best experience necessary.
good,"Ulta is a wonderful working environment. It is fun, exciting, and family friendly. Hours can be flexible, and advancement was available. Ulta loves to have employees make careers not just employment."
good,"Ulta has tremendous room for growth and oppuritinity if you work hard and express your interest in advancing. Ulta is a values-based company, and we are driven by our mission to be the most loved beauty retailer in the industry. We care about the experience when you come to our stores, not just the product you’re buying."
good,"Ulta is an amazing company to work at but definitely don't expect to make money quickly, it takes time and patience so definitely work a second job until you have built a good standing clientele."
good,Ulta is a fast pace company who is constantly growing their business. We have a lot of pressure to meet set goals which keeps management interesting and competitive. You learn what it is like to be part of a functioning team with the same intentions. Ulta has helped shaped me and my work ethic.
good,"great if your in college, good pay, good for makeup lovers, I learned so much about make up brands and the job is always something to do which is great not boring at all."
good,I love working for Ulta Beauty !! I think that they should support thier employee and help them reach thier dreams more hands on training and certifcation .
good,"Amazing company to work for. Love going to work. Amazing environment to work for, management and always willing to help other. Always open to new things."
good,what I learned  it is great company to work for. But it can be very comptetive with all the events and vendors they have coming in the store all the time. It was overall a great place to work and you can always leave with a smile.....
good,Ulta is a great place to work at with great culture. With the right management and the right team this place is a charm to work at. I NEVER went to work thinking it was a drag. Everyday was amazing. Nothing is better than going to work not only in a place of beautiful culture which promotes your work ethic but a place that also allows you to practice what you're passionate about.
good,"Daily I would get to discuss makeup with customers and restock/organize displays. Every day I could wear fun makeup and dress well. I did not mind working at the cashier's, but the loyalty program did become stressful. Overall, I loved my bosses and coworkers and would recommend the job."
good,"I loved working with guests and how guest oriented the job was. I also enjoyed being on the task team, working with my coworkers, and going through training. The only issues I had were with some of the managers because of their personalities but I never let this effect how I did my job, it only effected how I viewed working there."
good,"Although I was only able to work about 3 months at Ulta before moving for college, my overall experience there was absolutely wonderful. I had an amazing staff in both management and fellow employees. There are tons of benefits and prizes to earn when working with Ulta as well as an amazing discount on all of the beauty products."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Ulta in Augusta, the salon team is like family. They have great management on all levels, I would recommend this job to any new or experienced stylist."
good,"I enjoy working here because it is a great environment, it is always fun. I do not mind early mornings and this was a great place for me to put my energy,"
good,The customers are fantastic and they all just want your help to look and feel beautiful. You get to do that for them. Picking out their makeup and skin care. Complimenting them and making them feel better when they leave than when they came in. It’s a rewarding job for sure.
good,"I've always loved working at Ulta. from the work environment to what I do I love my job. although some days are more stressful than others, I never dread coming into work like I have with previous jobs. there's so many opportunities to move up in the company and when you love what you do its hard to call it a job. if i had to say anything negative I would say that sometimes your hours are limited and it gets stressful not being able to pay bills with such a small salary but other than that I would recommend working here over any of my past jobs."
good,"I had a great experience at Ulta, the management was fair and I loved the atmosphere. It was a great place to work at, very flexible and great learning experiences there."
good,"i enjoyed working at ulta i was just not getting enough hours. the working enviorment was awesome, everyone there is super friendly and super helpful. the managment is great could be more communcation between management and staff."
good,I enjoy the atmosphere and the people that I get to work with. Some days I am cashiering whereas other days I'm on the floor helping people find certain products and the fact that as I am helping them I am learning more and more about the products they sell. Sometimes it may get a little fast pace and difficult but even during that I still love what I get to do.
good,"Worked at a dozen retailers over 35 years.   Ulta was the best of the bunch.   Good staff, top notch technology, good employee perks, and fair compensations."
good,"Pay is not great, obviously, its retail but its super relaxed and the new management team is incredible. And don't notice how fast time goes by and feels like you only been working for 15 minutes. Culture is great at the Minnetonka location. You get to learn about makeup and tons of other stuff along the way. Occasionally, you'll get that rude customer but most people that come in are great and  not super high maintenance. Best part about the job is how easy it is to work. Holiday is a little more stressful but still not as bad as it is at a restaurant for example (all year round). I left my restaurant job for ulta because I was sick of all the stress and horrible customers and I didn't care that I got paid 1/4 of what I got at the restuarant because it was so much weight off my back and now I feel a lot happier. So if you're looking to leave a stressful job for something more chill, this is a good place to work and the hours are flexible. If you want to work 1-2 days a week you can!"
good,"I have been with ULTA part time for a little over two years and I love my managers, co-workers and the actual company itself is pretty great to their employees. There is always a way to move up, you just have to make it known. If I wasn't in school, I would probably keep this jobs and try to move up."
good,"Ulta was good to me and I do recommend it to others in need of retail experience or anyone who wants to build work experience generally. Managers treated me fairly and I never had any  major problems, they were also very understanding to minor problems. Great company."
good,Fun and friendly staff. Time goes by fast there. It is easy to talk and get along with everyone including managers. They are good about making sure you get your lunches and your breaks!
good,Getting hired at Ulta is a great start to becoming a beauty advisor if you want to eventually move to another store like MAC or Sephora. All in all a happy experience.
good,With Ulta being a newer store in Gadsden there were some bumps that we ran into but always ended up working through them. The team there was very supportive of each other and it was my favorite job that I've had so far.
good,Amazing work place where you get to interact with different customers. Every day was something new and came with new challenges to experience and learn from.
good,"I loved working here! I was only seasonal, but i definitely would like to go back after i am finished with school. Management is amazing, they are very good at working around schedules and making sure that work is not a bore."
good,"Very friendly place to work at , you get to know everyone . The Managers very informative and will answer any questions you have right on the spot . Cool events take place"
good,"learning and testing new products before everyone else is always fun. you learn a lot, do a lot and being able to help customers who are willing to listen is a good environment."
good,"Employees are like family, great benefits, laid back work place. The job in itself is very rewarding, but hard. Once you have the operational part of the business down, you're good to go!"
good,A typical day at Ulta was so much fun. The guests were friendly and the experience was a great one. I learned how to move at a fast pace and not get frustrated or overwhelmed. Management was amazing there was always someone there to help and they were all easy to talk to. My co-workers we friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of my job was finding time to sit down but everything else about the job was very enjoyable.
good,"Working at Ulta Beauty was definitely my favorite place of employment. Each day learned so much and was introduced to so many new products. I was hired as a Guest coordinator, where i was in charge of salon bookings, rebooking, and overall guest care. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help someone as i would have wished and dealing with complaints. My favorite part of my job was our team. Everyone i worked with had great personalities and made my workday a lot of fun as well as teaching me and informing me on how i can better handle my work load."
good,I LOVED working here. I helped with a grand opening at a new store and they hired me in. I always loved coming in to work and working with the ladies there.
good,"Typical day at Ulta is either slow paced with numerous tasks to accomplish, or very fast paced with numerous clients to tend to all while maintaining on keeping up with those tasks. I find it to be an extremely wonderful, professional environment to work for. The management is wonderful, supportive, professional and assertive. I genuinely enjoy helping other customers find their ultimate beauty necessities while informing them of wonderful new products they can truly benefit in after knowing a little bit about their likes and skin / makeup preferences. The hardest part of the job is ensuring every customer is taken care of while also preventing loss prevention at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping women feel beautiful by finding them the right products for them to enhance their natural beauty. When they are genuinely happy, I am genuinely happy."
good,Great company to work for! Fun place to grow in the industry. Love the training that you get from leaders in the industry. The team work with in the store is great
good,"I love waking up to go to work everyday. There is nothing better then getting to apply makeup on someone else, and telling them what matches them the best/ I learn about new products everyday. Since I have amazing co workers, my day isn't boring."
good,"Ulta is very good about recognizing hard work and being thankful of what every employee brings to the table to work as a team to better the store. Management is very flexible, in order for you to have a successful business you need to acknowledge and take notice to employees personal lives so they don't affect their working environment. Ulta portrays a professional family/team environment."
good,"Amazing outstanding workplace , Management and workers are the best. I learned how to do a lot for example I learned how to pick /pack and sort all in one week . the pay was the best . wasn't really anything that was too hard to do."
good,"New challenges daily"
good,"I LOVED and still love Ulta !! GREAT company that cares and wants you to grow along side with them. the chance that they give in helping you go is great. I have enjoyed my co-workers and the team that i had i am VERY PRO ULTA!  I love the event planning and the education that goes alone with the job. Ulta kicks Sephora BUTT , i biggest reason is because its a one stop shop . SO ANY guest will be happy with the items they buy because it addresses the needs they have. Shopping there is so easy"
good,"assisting customers with and questions on beauty products"
good,Great discount if you love makeup this is the place to work but it gets super crowded and it can be understaffed but lots of makeup to play with
good,I worked at the one in Wilmington which has since closed due to the company going bankrupt.
good,I had fun meeting new people every day! I also enjoyed playing in the make up and skin care products.
good,The company has a good work/home  ballance. They have technical as well as personal  training for salon. They care about there employees.
good,The managers are all very kind and the coworkers were very sweet! A very nice working atmosphere with people who were passionate about beauty!
good,"Complete all out going orders for shipment,perform daily cleaning duties. Great co-workers and supervisor. No heavy lift for the majority of the work day."
good,"Ulta was alot of fun to work for. We had unlimited amounts of makeup to use and practice with as well as helping customers decide what to buy. I learned alot about different products, and although I left a few years ago due to hours being cut repeatedly, I still love to shop there."
good,Pleased to work with amazing people in a great environment surrounded by a wonderful clientell looking for new makeup!
good,"At this job I preformed different tasks, such as working with customers and answering questions, working registers and working tasks such as planograms and ad sets. "
good,"I just started my employment at ulta recently and I absolutely love it. Im a prestige consultant and I got my first gratis the second time I worked! Ulta is a very fast paced environment but there is never a dull moment. 3 co workers that ive met are already getting promoted, including my GM. If you're looking for a job that only requires you to sit on your butt, this job is not for you. I've read a lot of the reviews about how the managers don't care/don't do enough training/don't give enough hours. If you want to do well at any job, you have to be proactive and you have to ask questions. If you want the extra training, ask. If you have questions about the register, ask as many as you can before they put you behind one. If you want the hours, prove it. Ulta is a big company and each of the team members have specific goals to work on. If you have specific needs, COMMUNICATE THEM. It's really that simple. In the first week I worked I was given 17 hours. You will be rewarded if you work hard and prove it. But that goes for any job."
good,The company was an amazing company to work for. All supervisors and managers made coming to work everyday a fun yet educational environment! 
good,I enjoy working for this company. You get a great discount and work with alot if interesting and fun people.
good,There are short videos giving details about new or important products that give you knowledge about the product and its importance. The employees and management is nice and the environment is good.

good,"I started here last month just so I had a job for when I came home on breaks, since I am away at college. They work great with your work schedule. If you tell them you aren’t available on certain days, they will not schedule you. The management is great and well-ran. I definitely recommend working here."
good,It was a very fun experience and met a lot of nice workers. Very flexible and hardworking people around you. Gives the best Attitude and can really connect with others

good,Ulta beauty was a fun and flexible workplace while I was in cosmetology school. I loved being able to work alongside the products I would be using after I received my cosmetology license.
good,Great place to work and great benefits. You get to interact with a lot of wonderful people and get to make them feel great when they walk out the door.
good,Ulta Beauty is an amazing place to work it. It not only boost your self esteem but it also helps you boosts others. By simply helping customers find the right shade of lip color or foundation color can completely help a customer feel appreciated.

The atmosphere was always alive, energetic and fun while listening to great music. You can feel the creativity from the make up artist and hairdresser,but most of all you feel passion through out Ulta."
good,Ulta Beauty is a fantastic company with alot of Career growth opportunities! I am very patient about the company and what it stays for. The structure and atmosphere provide a positive and happy work environment.

good,"ULTA is a fast paced, fun environment where anybody can grow. You can gain a lot of customer service experience and enhance your people skills. The better you are able to sell the products the longer you'll last."
good,"The atmosphere when entering the store is very friendly, with greeting immediately, and a willingness to help right away. There are multiple employees there at all times, with a strong sense of assisting each and every guest with the same experience. We stay up to date on the latest trends, and products to give you our best advice possible when shopping within the store. Having a full-service salon, aesthetician,  benefit brow bar, and Clinique specialists are among many of the perks within the store. You can book for hair appointments with our highly talented stylists, Aesthetician who is Dermalogica certified and provides the best experience possible! Not only that but getting to learn more about Clinique, and Benefit with our licensed cosmetologists are phenomenal. There are many other perks to not only working there but the company itself! A typical day of work is arriving, getting a chat, going over your conversions and areas in which you can improve, along with store goals. There are always little pop-up events and brand events that we get sign-ups, and to help educate customers with new products, or how to highlight certain features. I would say the hardest part of the job is not carrying a certain product or brand or not having used a specific product to give related or experienced knowledge on that product. But that is where the family-like culture comes into play, we call upon each other to help out to get reviews to give to our guests, or even being able to convert them to a similar product that might work more than the initial one wanted. Overall, I love working"
good,"Amazing environment with no judgments made, helps everyone, family friendly,amazing company and products, new opportunities daily as well as perks of working there"

good,"At Ulta Beauty I greeted customers as they came through the door with a  friendly smile. As a Beauty Advisor I would take on responsibilities such  as; stocking shelves, unloading boxes, organizing table displays and  ringing guest up at the register.    "
good,Very nice climate controlled place to work. Management is great! They always give you a goodie bag when you're leaving. Makes you feel appreciated after pulling 12 hours. The break area is nice and the outside area of the break room is the best!

The policies and procedures make sense and add to the guests and workers overall experience. I had amazing coworkers and managers. The dress code is designed for you to be able to maintain and express yourself while looking professional. I recommend anyone that is wanting to move up in the retail world to start here. You learn about selling, customer service, and the operations of the store. Great place for a budding manager."

good,"Loved working for the Company, Corporate Office was very involved at all times. Fast paced, fun environment. Would recommend job to friends and family."
good,A normal day of work at Ulta was steady. You can never learn too much about beauty items. Its a world thats always thriving and expanding. Always something new too learn about. However as for the manager's well went through quite a few of them during the time I was employed there. That was the downside of the job. Overall I absolutely loved and enjoyed every minute while working there!
good,I loved working at ULTA. I loved the experience of helping people. A lot of customer service. Amazing management and work environment. Very helpful and attentive.
good,"Love the people, manager and co workers. Never had to doubt feeling like I didn't belong or no one wanted me there. Everyone is very welcome and understanding"
good,"Utla was such a great place to work, as it was free and open to be and feel how you wanted to every time that you stepped foot through those doors. It was a great job and a great way to get personal with some of the customers and clients, overall it was full of laughter and a lot of fun moments that were shared with a lot of great people."
good,This is one the best jobs I've worked for so far. It pays good and they'll work around your schedule if you talk to the warehouse supervisor. Only thing I didn't like was that we only got two breaks out of 12-hour shifts.
good,"Absolutely loved my job there, and the people I worked with "
good,"I loved working at Ulta , I wish I never left. I would love to get my foot back in the door."
good,I loved this job! But I was fired for point accrual. My son got kicked off bus and even though i made sure my work hrs missed were covered they still fired me because the whole time i was giving away hrs they were pointing me!
good,As a benefit brow girl my daily work day consists of checking the books and making sure everything is cleaned and organized in my work area. I would approach customers to tell them our promotions and recommend products to them based on there needs.
good,"As someone who is extremely interested and invested in the beauty community, working at Ultra Beauty has always been a dream. I was a seasonal beauty advisor before leaving for an internship. Everyone is so friendly and supportive and I rarely encountered bad customers! We're all there because we love beauty, and we were like one big family! I'd 10/10 go back if offered a job!"
good,"ULTA is a great place to learn and grow within a company. Management at my store, as well as the district manager were both kind and professional. I would highly recommend a job at ULTA for anyone who is looking for a career in the beauty industry!."
good,Working at Ulta was a great experience that  builds to move forward in  customer experience. Working there was supper fun and had at the same time! It teaches you how to be  engaged with a customer
good,I would start my day by having a team meeting about what we had going on that week as far as sales and promotions. Next we would straighten shelves and assist customer needs.
good,Coworkers  are easy to work with and the manager is very good. The downside is part time workers are not given enough hours and there is little pressure to walk at the store looking for cosmetics.
good,"Management is amazing and company seems to actually care about its employees.  I wish the company would make everything a little more diverse, but overall a great experience."

A manager would chat you in, and go over any special instructions for the day, our sales goal, goals for credit cards, and then you can ask them any questions you might have before getting on the floor and starting your shift. Everyone was always upbeat and very fun to work with. We would have events, where we could learn more about different brands that we sold, and they would make sure to celebrate every holiday with treats and goodies.

good,"A typical day would be coming in, beginning to stock while maintaining the front counter. You'll check customers out while logging in their accounts to earn them points. You'll learn all about new products and even get a discount."
good,"I would clock in, make sure applicators were filled, talk to my co-workers, sell as much product as possible, make connections with guests, clean when necessary, make supply orders once a month, get on a conference call every Wednesday or Thursday, and remained focused on meeting my weekly goal.  I learned that the people I worked with were the best part of the job as well as the guests I helped.  The management was awesome.  The workplace culture was about making every guest feel beautiful, and improving their self esteem.  The hardest part of the job was attention to detail.  I wasn't the best at keeping my testers organized or the right testers on hand.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,I love ulta but due to family issues I had to leave only thing that sucks is once you “ quit “  you have a certain time period to come back even if it’s through temp . Temp service would have to call the dc to see if they would allow you back

good,"While working at Ulta Beauty, I was able to work with a team of  a diverse back ground which allowed me to learn a new technique when it came to working the belt/assembly line. The hardest part was trying to keep up with the old schools, vet's (smiles). It was a learning experience which allowed me to depend on my team as suppose to feeling I'm the only one who seems to care about how the work can be completed. Communication plays a huge factor when it comes to warehousing."

good,I would recommend for anyone who loves beauty!! It is a very inviting vibe its not too complicated. They dont play about tardiness and points adding up. Gratis is a bomb advantage.
good,I thrived working at ULTA and would recommend the job to anyone who has an interest in beauty and cosmetics. I learned so much and the employees really form a community of their own.
good,"Our high-end Atlanta location is a busy and high energy salon. We are a very dynamic, diverse, multicultural and multilingual team of artists. Experience in hair-coloring, highlights, and balayage (preferably Redken familiarity) is most definitely a big plus. Amazing perks to keep in mind also if you consider transferring from another salon with an existing clientele "
good,Shifts are normally 11-7pm with a set schedule (lots of weekends unless you request off). The prestige side was usually understaffed so the brow expert had to constantly color match for all the brands. Time goes by fast but can be overwhelming during the holidays.
good,"My experience working with Ulta DC was an eventful one. Week after week we always had a goal that each of us worked towards, and management did a great job reliving that stress with company events and activities each of us had the option to participate in."

good,At Ulta I enjoyed creating great guest experiences while managing  a team and achieving sales plans and executing events. Also overseeing the many vendors within store.
good,a typicall day in ulta is serving guests with a huge smile and helping them continue there day with the best customer service. so far ive learned in cases that i see is the best way to deal with an uoset customer is by giving them a reason to smille as well as a fast solution to there problem

It was a fast pace environment which i enjoyed because it kept me on my feet. Learning the computers and registers was a great experience and I learned a lot from it. Starting off at ultra i also was replenishing product in the early mornings. Stocking the product kept me busy. The management was great, and made sure i had all my breaks I needed. I would really say there was anything hard, but more so challenging. I was challenged in this workplace and I learned so much from it."
good,"This job, like many others, is only what you make of it. Ulta gives you SO many tools and resources to be successful that the only way you wouldn't be is if you unfortunately have an unorganized manager, which is a reflection of that specific manager and not the company.

Being a guy, I knew very little about makeup when I started but after some time you get to know a lot about the brands and products. All the other employees are friendly and dependable.

The ULTA culture has a strong sense of informing and training employees on the hundreds of beauty brands that are offered within the stores. I gained so much knowledge about cosmetics and skin care from the past 1 and half year of working here that I would've never learned about anywhere else. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated when sales are low and the customers are rude. However, that is retail for you. The most important key to remember when handling customers is to be yourself and be informative about the products that you are trying to sell to them. Make personal connections with your customers and you will find that these customers will constantly come back. I enjoyed the consistent training as well as the one on one experience with my guests by showing them numerous makeup and skin care brands that are customized to fit their specific needs."

good,I would arrive early and prepare for my day by checking which children were due for their physicals. I had to organize my paperwork and organize children with medicaid insurance between the ages of 0-18. I would also assist the Medical Billing in submitting claims to insurances online.

good,"- greeting customers"
good,"My shift usually started when the store opened, during the first couple of hours in the morning business was fairly slow so I would spend my time cleaning the cash register, stocking nearby shelves, and reading up on new products and promotions. As more cashiers showed up I would leave them to check out customers while I walked around the store assisting clients with their needs and questions. If there was an issue or problem at the cash register I was the first to be paged if I could not handle the issue then a manager would be paged. I would spend the rest of my shift running the cash register, handling returns and exchanges, assisting customers, and completing any tasks the managers needed. I loved coming to work everyday, my co workers were always nice, upbeat and fun to work with. My managers were wonderful, understanding of balancing life and work and maintained a fun hardworking atmosphere. During my time at ULTA I learned a lot about beauty products and different makeup brands, I learned that hard work was always rewarded and there can be jobs that you do really enjoy to work at. The hardest part of the job was having to explain to our customers that our coupons did not cover everything in the store and had certain limitations, thinking that our coupons worked on all our products and then being told differently was understandably a frustrating experience for our customers. However to my knowledge the company has listened and is working on changing how strict they are on the coupons."
good,If I could rate them higher than a 5 I totally would. The company is awesome with great incentives and benefits for someone. The district that I work in is great. Everything is awesome and the managers give you respect and level with you with your satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Everything from skincare-cosmetics to hair and body. They even cater to MEN. The best part of the job is that you are able to network with so many different companies and people there is always room for advancement. There's a fun and friendly staff due to ULTA taking pride in choosing the most bubbly approachable personalities to represent their company. The most enjoyable part of the job are all the freebies! You receive lots of gratis for trainings on new product lines and you are able to try the product in order to testify to it, how awesome is that!! I love the ULTA company and have shared many wonderful times as a member of management however my only suggestion is that the payroll for the company is something to take into consideration. The store is so set on opening new stores that they are not supporting the staff with payroll to deliver excellent customer service. Majority of the time when you walk into an ULTA store you notice the staff is very limited and for a cosmetic store you want to ensure that you have available help because make-up isn't self selling when you don't know how to use it."
