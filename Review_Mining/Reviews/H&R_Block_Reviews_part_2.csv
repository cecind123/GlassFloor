good,"I've been an HR Block employee for over 25 years.  As the years have progressed I've had more time to offer so my wages have increased accordingly.  The hardest part of the job and the worst part of the job are the same - dealing with the tax public.  I have clients who drive 60 miles to come to me to do their returns and we have wonderful clients.  Then there are those clients who you will never make happy.  The fees are too high (which I have no control over.)  Through the years it has gotten tougher as corporate America has changed.  There is more upper management now who have never done a tax return.  When management comes from fast food industry or Target, they sometimes forget the client just wants their taxes done correctly at a fair price."

good,Great place to work . Nice environment and management is flexible. Integrity is number one. I would come in and clock in. I would print out daily reports and then highlight our goals that we made. I would then input some of the information into the computer and then would look at the calendar day and what customers needed to be seen.

I have been doing this for 12 years, of which 8 years I have been a manager.  I enjoy dealing with people and getting to know my clients even sometimes on a personal level.

I would come in and finish pulling all the afternoon files, make new files for new customers, answer the phone, make appointments, except payment for taxes processed, balanced cash drawer and then file back all of that days files and get the morning receptionist ready for the next day. It was always a blast to come in to a place full of smiles even in the middle of the tax season to the end.

I have learned more applications to use on the computer such as appointment manager and kronos. Everyone is really nice and understanding."
good,To be a receptionist I do it full time and you have to be good with kids and you have to be very clean. I clean the bathrooms because customers come in everyday and there is a professional cleaner that comes in once a week and that is not enough and other then that the customers are very nice and I enjoy it for now it is a temporary job but I love what I do and I might come back next year if I don't have anything else going on I wish we got paid more.

I am a CSP so for not knowing a lot about taxes I have learned so much in 2 seasons. Answering client questions on the phone is easier and all of the preparers are willing to help me out when they can. Our office has a professional feel and we treat each other with respect. The hardest part of the job is when you have clients waiting to check in and the phone is ringing and you are trying to take payment. But I love it. And the preparers also help me answer the phone when they can. We work together as a team. I love that part! A team covers for each other, helps each other out and there isn't any grumbling about how much work they have to do and can't help. Never once have I heard one person get upset that they are too busy and need to do their own work. It's the most amazing place that I wish was year round!"

good,Coworkers are great and the job is very fast pace but can be slow at times. The atmosphere is light and fun but can get stressful when there are more clients than there are tax pros.

The hardest part of my job is getting everyone to help with the marketing. Also hard is not losing your cool with an irate  and upset client that has not received his/her refund because they owed something to the government. They have to vent to someone so we get the brunt of it because we are easy to get to.The most enjoyable part is when you get a client, who is sure they have to pay more taxes, and  I find them a refund, even if it a small one."

I work well with little supervision.  I know what has to be done and I make sure it's done. I normally start the day with a schedule of things that need to be done.  Since most of the time the job requires a visit to many offices, I make my route using the Google map.  That shows me the shortest route and the amount of time it would take to go to each office.  This also helps me manage my time."

This company has been around for many years, the company provides the most updated information within our tax system whether it applies to some or all persons of interest.  They go beyond just having information for our taxes but provide other information such as the health care changes, or maybe you need information on how to decide what tax bracket you fall in when deciding how to have your taxes withheld by the company that you work for.

good,"Very educating place to work."
good,"My day would start out with balancing cash drawer.  I managed the front desk of clients and answering the phone calls of many questions and scheduling appointments.  I've learned many things working with all types of people.  Most important is that a lot of people are very stressed when coming in to do their taxes.  I tried to make sure they felt relaxed and confident that they were in the right place and we could help them no matter what their problem.  If someone would come in with a complaint and get over excited, I learned the best way to handle these people was to not get excited back but to be concerned about helping them and not to match their level of excitement. If you stay calm, they usually match you and calm down.  "

good,"During peak season, things are always fast-paced: clients are coming in one after the other with questions and concerns, calling on the phone, or waiting to have their taxes done. Being in a receptionist type of position, you learn a lot about customer service if you didn't already have experience -- basically your job is to treat customers the way you would want to be treated and create a comfortable setting for them while they are there.

I've learned how to make the clients feel welcomed, and also how to help calm a client whenever he/she is getting impatient. The management of H&R Block is extremely friendly and sweet. They've made it to where I plan on working with them every year as a Client Service Professional. They are very strict, but lenient as well. My manager has taught me well to the point I know what is right and what is wrong. I love my co-workers because they made me feel (and still make me feel) welcomed to the fullest extent. I work with two other Client Service Professionals, and they help me when I mess up on something and they teach me how to do tasks more effectively and proficiently. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with impatient clients. It's a very difficult task to do, but you learn every day how to deal with different people and it makes it much more easier.

Not too much extraneous work was given at the company although you may be asked to call former clients or ""holds"" multiple times after you felt callbacks would be effective. The management was mostly flexible but entirely inflexible on the fundamentals of work there such as organization or time management. A big stickler is searching non-work-related websites on office time. My co-workers were very helpful in building me up as a tax preparer and letting me know office protocol.
