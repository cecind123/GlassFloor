rating,review
bad,I worked for a franchise in Cincinnati that was a terrible experience and management didn't care about the company and there were many racist and sexist and discriminatory actions made in my 4 years.
bad,"Racist and verbally abusive manager. "
bad,"They did not care about personal life. The schedule would sometimes come out the day before the new week. They would schedule you 7, 8 or even 9 days in a row.There was a strong lack of communication and a whole LOT of favoritism."
bad,Hyatt is a toxic work environment where you are not valued. Putrid. Everyone who works there is constantly looking for another job because everyone is made miserable.
bad,"I worked doe four different Hyatts around the country and loved them so much. They became family. Hyatt Lost Pines was the worst. They found a way to fire my friend because she was pregnant. II never missed a dy in the 5 years I worked there, even missed my childs birthday completely. I got a kidney infection and was out for 4 days and they fired me."
bad,"Sucked. They choose a group of ethnic people who spoke NO ENGLISH and managers included, and made my life horrible there. Plus, I was hired to work in one position that I specifically applied for and since they needed me to work somewhere I said I was not applying for,  a position I did not apply for that I could not do I got fired. ithat company I Saudi could not do,"
bad,Don't work at the Nashville airport Hyatt onwers of the property don't care and won't spend time or money to make the hotel better need to close the property.
bad,"I worked for the Hyatt Place in Marlbough, MA. They are a franchise of True North Hotels. They care about one thing and one thing only, PROFIT!! This is at the cost of anything and anyone. Family member dies, need to be there for your shift! Drunk people throwing glasses at you, cant report it because we need the business. Management drinking on the job, good luck reaching anyone who cares!! STAY AWAY FROM TRUE NORTH HOTEL PROPERTIES."
bad,"Do not work for this fake wannabe  low pay slaving nasty company! If you dont speak Spanish with the Mexicans and managment, they will talk badly about you, ignore you and complain that your not working as hard as them or good enough! Which means there always short staffed so they have to hire temps to also talk about !!!"
bad,Awful place employees talk about u all day and nite they can’t keep good people to work there hard work for bad pay it’s good for maybe a 17 year old if that very unprofessional place
bad,They let people do whatever they want.  No fear of being fired.  Lazy employees can't say nothing to them. Management do not care it is all about heads in beds and making money
bad,"I was so Excited to start working at Hyatt was told They cared for you so you can be your very best, But that value was a lie from most department heads the women Are treated like slaves especially in HK they are robbed and worked harder than a donkey for pocket change.."
bad,Horrible place to work at in Newport Beach it will s a franchise ran Hyatt near airport and the owners keep all the gratuity for the banquet servers and pay them minimum wage 🤬horrible peopl
bad,There is no room for growth unless you become a part of a click and kiss butt for people to like you. They don't show appreciation for any good that you do but are quick to point out any flaws.
bad,The money wasn't bad but the Captains are a total disaster. And the Banquet Manager isn't much to brag about either. There are a lot better banquet places to work with a much nicer rewarding staff.
bad,"No good management, lack of equipment to work, low pay. Squeeze you to do a lot of work without help. Benefits no big deal. If you no have another choice  of work do it."
bad,"If you expect to work tenfold the value of your paycheck, not be appreciated, be stagnant for about 2 years and be watching your back about ""he-said-she-said"" BS, This is your place!"
bad,"Absolutely feudal environment with HR threats and cliquey Frat and Sorority Reality TV  all seeking to fault or damage"
bad,"No comment ....bad experience , I don’t recommend it for anyone who would like to work in a hotel, bad management and it was all missed up .i lost time by working there"
bad,The hyatt is a horrible place to work ot was like being in high school all over again...no matter how many hours you work for them they will not appreciate it at all I never give a bad review for where I've worked but this place is beyond horrible
bad,"This place treats you so badly and cover up there tracks. Long hours. They are against employees with children. They also discriminate. Nasty, dirty kitchen with mold, flies, high temp refrigerators everywhere."
bad,I would not recommend anyone work here. Hourly pay was very low and management was not committed to their job and the work place. Need to make better choices when choosing upper management candidates.
bad,"Housekeepers would go in rooms and steal tips. Management wouldn't do anything about it. Housekeepers would punch in, then sleep in rooms, while I worked my butt off."
bad,The manager team was very unfair and very unprofessional. I would never recommend anyone to work for this  specific location. I enjoyed the work and learning new this and I am very much glad to still be able to learn and gain the experience that I had the ability to gather.
bad,I hated it and they don’t care I would never go back their even if they asked to pay me more I don’t like it they are unprofessional the management treat u Very bad and they be quick to lie on you and some of them are racist.
bad,"The new director of sales &marketing is an arrogant woman who believes her title gives her the right to treat employees with no respect, this person has no profesional ethic at all, and makes any position miserable at sales dep. How Hyatt can keep such a disgusting employee like her? ""If you are not a manager in this place, they treat you like garbage!!!"
bad,well if you like working somewhere where people commit suicide and jump off the 6th floor and have to experience that who would want to work here at this place they have poor management wages suck hotel is old and rundown
bad,"My experience working there was miserable"
bad,Place was horrible..no benefits no nothing.  No holiday pay no sick days.  No consideration for employees whatsoever.  They don't care!  Run as fast as you can
bad,"The Banquet area is a revolving door, due to the lady manager. She has no management skills, and it wouldn't hurt for her to go to school and actually learn managing techniques and common employment laws. Her mood swings are questionable, and her overall unethical management style creates a revolving door of employees within that department. If the Hyatt lets her go, and hires a more qualified banquet manager, they will save on training cost. It cost a business money to hire and train new employees, as well as it does hiring temps. This lady manager does not treat temps fairly as well. She is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
bad,"this place is not good for work, such stress, such hardwork needing, no regular dayoffs, if you dont come to work because you are sick you are fired etc."
bad,Typically A chef will tell u to read a prep sheet and you as lead cook make the food however u want.  No consise recipes. People that are hourly employees cheat their time when they arrive late for their shift. Food handeling procedures below state regulations. Not a servsafe kitchen.
bad,They had favorites and prejudged before they even got the chance to know you. Poor communication on Management part. Just wasnt a good experience in the end. Met some good people though.
bad,"Worked here for part of the summer it’s so unorganized, management needs training they have no idea what customer service even is . You can find better employment in osoyoos people . Don’t recommend. And the pay is only 12.75 hour it’s a joke ."
bad,They have alot of favoritism there and will work you past you shift. I loved my job but the people made me hate it.  Never had enough staff to cover their shifts.  Every day it was drama I just couldn't work like that.
bad,"I worked at Hyatt airport Calgary for a short time. Completely understaffed and expected to cover all positions when I was hired directly for maintenance."
bad,Unless your family or friends of anna good luck moving up at this place they treat employees like trash .management  Breaking all kinds of rules like sleeping with guest.  plenty of other cases were they also break  policy. They put people in high positions that no nothing and all they are good for is washing dishes so please stay away from this job it’s not worth the stress.
bad,"They are very unprofessional, they want you to work 7 days straight without no days off sometimes 14 days. They still your tips. They talk to you like trash. You would think that they would go up on the pay with the stuff you deal with but its 7.50 a hour and they lie to you on the job pages saying 8.25 to 8.75 just to get you in the door. I would never go back"
bad,"if you are from the hood this is your place to work, if you are friends with anna you will get what you want, not by what you know of your work ethic. assistance Mannager dont know nothing about hospitality. GM dont know why he is there, they fire half of people, now the hotel is in the worst conditions then before. PLEASE DONT WORKS HERE."
bad,"If I Could give 0 Stars that would still be an understatement for this place.. No Structure, Poor Management Skills, Disrespectful to Guests And Staff..."
bad,I honestly have to say my experience working at the Hyatt regency hotel was definitely not the best because there was a lot of favoritism going on managers we're definitely unprofessional didn't I know how to handle certain situations. They fired me one time do to me injuring my ankles while on shift and that one time that I ever get paid. They pick and choose who they want to deal with and who they don't want to deal. with I felt like certain people got away with
bad,Poor management. Do not honor seniority. Poor management and compensation. Human Resources management is very poor. Reverse discrimination. Food and beverage executives are very poor and unexperienced.
bad,cant run a business while the manager hires incompetent people and wants them as friends and has no trust in her engineers . Overall the job was a joke with way too much drama
bad,"Do  not let the name fool you. It is not a Hyatt. It is a franchise hotel with lousy management. "
bad,"Downtown Hyatt is a franchise, so they do not have give the same benefits that apply to employees whom are employees of the corporation. Even issues like minimum of staff to be able to provide the best hospitality available is overlooked. The opportunity to visit another Hyatt (like a vacation resort) is not an option. I do not approve of charging customers for a higher end hotel price for Motel 6 quality"
bad,"It is a excellent work place. Good staff and the benefits are okay. The management is not good at all. Definitely needs work, as well as owners of hotel."
bad,I would not recommend any one to work here they are very poor when it comes to management it seems as if the ones who has been there the longest far as house keeping we use to suffer more cause they hired and fired almost everybody it was a suck place to work
bad,"Staff housing is outrageous, crazy expensive with a dirty, nothing function little bedroom. The laundry don’t even work. The pay rate is the lowest compare to anywhere. Highly disorganized, corrupted culture. Rude and ignorant seen all over management. Treat people like slave. Lies everyday"
bad,The Hyatt longisland isn't even a real Hyatt its owned and ran by Remington so naturally it isn't going to be the same as a real Hyatt location. This place is a joke if you do get a job here be prepared to do your job and everything one else's  as well.
bad,The hotel was awesome with the former management but this new company treats all staff like slaves. The watch the staff from home on cameras and provide a hostile work environment. The managers are very sneaky.
bad,"They fired me because I was not ready to come back too soon after a back injury. even though I seeing a chiro.Hurt to BREATHE and they expected me to come in and work anyway . When I explained my situation, I was Written up for insubordination and terminated UNFAIRLY.I applied again recently when I learned there is a whole new better team,  only to be turned down because the hr chick who fired me,she Red Flagged my name so I am Non-rehirable."
bad,GM has no backbone and other management just covers their own butts. Over worked underpaid. No room for raises (3% annually). And toxic gossip between managers and employees about other managers and employees.
bad,"Managers were unorganized"
bad,"Trop de jalousie a l'hotel,toujours dans le rust.."
bad,Hyatt house dania beach south fla is a joke .....the training is good luck...they show no  concern until u can prove ur self the mangs talk about what ever employee is not there they tell anyone whos interested ur Personal business that you might have shared with your manager for whatever reason very very unprofessional I don’t recommend anybody working here they’re always hiring because they’re so short staffed because they either hire idiots that don’t know what they’re doing and the people that do you know what they’re doing and are professional what no parts of this place the pay is horrible
bad,There is racism and lots of high school drama most from the agm very hostile work environment I walked out and haven’t had one headache since don’t set yourself up to drain yourself for a job
bad,Multiple employee rights violations.  Director of rooms is uneducated.  If you want a respectful working environment don’t even bother working here!  Very disappointing experience.
bad,"I've worked at this facility which is currently called the Tempe Mission Palms and have not been valued as I should, or promoted or respected. And I've been there for a few years! They need to focus on respecting employees and having integrity. As of right now, the hotel is under Union negotiations to make this hotel a better place. Obviously that tells you something though, that they needed direction because they aren't doing their jobs as leaders and management. So, I hope it will turn around, but I'll believe it when I see it!"
bad,unequal disciplinary practices decisions favor female persuasion pay is not competitive and disrespect of experience achieved  not flexible and uniform policy is bad
bad,wouldn't work here if I where you!! management was terrible and could care less about their employees.  Stay away from Hyatt Coconut plantation!!!!!!!
bad,Ok first let us start by saying Management needs to return phone calls and learn how to communicate.  They are horrible here. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They are clicky meaning they choose who they want here..
bad,The housekeeping executive manager is very unprofessional.  The pay that is offered is not nearly enough for what you will be asked to do.  The some of the people you work with has the worse attitudes.  The housekeeping manager dress very inappropriately for example very short skirts without underwear.  I was told I would be paid one thing and never received it.  Everyone shows favor to employee they are close to.  There is a lot of drama within the company involving mainly the upper management.  The Housekeeping manager keep up the most drama.  I do not recommend no one working here.
bad,"It seems when you start that it will be a great job. But give it a couple months and you will see what a terrible place it is and how the communication and leadership is at the bottom. I went there ( and saw a few other cooks )  go there with a great attitude and really try. All I got back from Garde Manger was negativity and treated like I was stupid. I saw another employee go there with the same can do attitude and get treated worse than myself. He left as soon as his internship was done. And I left the same week. "
bad,The Individuals  Human Resources are Very Catty. They Ghost you.  But they do not want me to work for them and that's ok! People were generally fake nice. The night life can be exciting. Especially with a convention Trade show etc
bad,Very misleading the housekeeping department went through 4 managers in one year always short staffed and very dishonest with no compassion for staff .
bad,Prices are too high manager is real mean and the cars don’t work very well short breaks people that work there are nice but both managers are real mean
bad,"If you work for the Hyatt Place in Uptown Charlotte, be prepared to be mistreated, over- worked, and have none of your thoughts and concerns paid attention to. The managers allow for their personal friendship to interfere with their professionalism. Employees have tried as hard as to get corporate and the owner, Palak, involved and nothing had even attempted to be done about the abusive work environment that employees endure on a daily basis. Stick to bigger corporations with an actual functioning HR department that respond to your concern and needs."
bad,"- management does not train you, let alone any employee."
bad,"Hyatt is normally very competitive with pay, compensation and other benefits. The one I worked at was owned by a management company that was too new to understand what was going on. Lack of fair/competitive pay, benefits had to be enrolled for but none of management informed anyone of the narrow enrollment period, along with constant arguing about my paycheck every two weeks. Things ranged from not getting my tips, hours were rounded down and bonuses were not given out. HR at my management company was non-existent. Multiple calls were made and no solutions were presented. A single coworker was showing up late consistently and avoiding doing their duties only for them to be compensated higher than anyone else showing up early and staying late. I don't know how this property passes brand standard, and I don't know how management is able to continue highway robbery of their workers."
bad,Where do I begin. The 3 corworkers that I worked with were the laziest clock milking group of people I had ever worked with in my life. They only ever helped each other and took hours to do things in groups of two or more than a person working alone at a steady paceworking by him/herself. They took smoke breaks every hour on the hour and always needed help with the smallest of tasks acting like they never knew what was going on or how to get it done. They constantly left me to do the dirtiest rooms which required the most work and the management or supervisory staff never wrote them up for anything. This was the worst most unfruitful under payed position I have ever taken and it will never happen again.
bad,"Hyatt was a great experience for me, I started as a Room Attendant, then was promoted to position of Supervisor, during this time it was decided to localize the position of Housekeeping Manager and I was sent to 3 German hotels for cross training, I was trained in Baku by Executive Housekeeper Ms.Sue Fisher and got a position of Assistant Housekeeping Manager. After running 2 years convention center's Housekeeping department I was promoted to position of Housekeeping Manager."
bad,"Opening was smooth as team was nearby 10 minutes walk from Hyatt Regency Hotel. It was an excellent experience working with corporate preopening team and my cross training in Germany helped me a lot during OE order for new hotel as most of items (duvets, pillows, mattress pads etc.) were purchased from Germany"
bad,I have reviewed my experience in Hyatt Hotels and Resorts previous as set up here is a bit challenging as Fairmont Hotels and Resort reviews wer asked to make two times
bad,"It was stressfull, management was poor, a lot of shadiness behind your back, they dont care about you, everyone acts nice but as soon as you make a mistake you’re done"
bad,"Back to back calls, need to maintain high conversion rate 51% to meet goal if do not make u can loss your job, need x amount of credit card transfers for customers to sign up for hyatt credit card if missed you can loss your job,  meet handle time, adherence,  they projected goals make it a stressful job..this is a call center for room reservations  should not be a stressful job."
bad,"Company is a bunch of illegal morons that love to screw over their employees. No wonder it iis bankrupt and losing people......,,,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,"
bad,Columbia Sussex is a terrible place to work. They have zero compassion for work related injuries and Human Resources was an completely overwhelmed and made significant mistakes that resulted in me losing my job.
bad,Do not work here. Spent my workdays here being snubbed by 20-year-olds and inexperienced Brats Who do not know how to relate to  fellow workers or guests. They knew nothing about yoga  or props needed to teach a resort class. Sometimes had to teach on a dirty cement floor with food items on the floor .  Had to teach yoga out on a lawn with dog eccretement.  Literally had to roll a wagon full of mats like a homeless person. This is not a professional setting. Look elsewhere to teach. This place does not align with any yogic principles of equanimity and gratitude. Bad karma here. I have never seen Such a dirty and unequipped setting like this in my life.
bad,"Wouldn't work for them again, they abused the hard workers and never appreciated the work one did for them, we got stiffed on the tips the clients would leave for us"
bad,"Your typical day is that you are constantly put down, and told that your time management skills are not up to par, when how can you have effective time management when you are troubleshooting the issue.  Also you are not allowed overtime and in order to succeed you have to take your laptop at home, but are not allow to be paid for it.  You are one person working for two hotels there isn't enough time in the universe to work that efficiently, they will not give you an assistant, because they can't afford it, yet the hotel is a cash cow.  You are managed by the Finance Director who only cares about money not quality of your performance.  So basically you are mismanaged and defiantly do not have the time or the energy to effectively do this job.  Then they wonder why they keep on loosing people well if you gave the people what they need to do their job like their logo states then yeah maybe you could be happy there.  DO NOT WORK for the Hyatt Regency Savannah HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!!!!!"
bad,"The hotel itself is beautiful and I loved working at the location.  Unfortunately, the particular department I worked in was poorly managed, understaffed and chaotic."
bad,"It’s like your own team fights you if your not to their likeing or fast enough and in the end it’s every man for himself it felt like, and when something goes wrong don’t except to find out for days!"
bad,This would have been the worse jobs ever. I busted my butt to try to make things run smoothly but yet get kicked down. I was not paid enough for all the stress and hours I put into this hotel. I felt  unappreciated for all the hard work I put in this hotel.  The only good thing about working at the hotel was the team I started to build at the desk.
bad,THE worst place ever NO management they fired the manager They Don't Care About u!!! Trust me They dont the supervisor treat you really BAD no houseman's for the housekeepers so meaning that you're going back and forth to get sheets towels everything by yourself and they give you a time on your sheet that you have to be out you don't even have time for lunch they rushing u out the room... Breakfast SUCK they give us uncooked sausage coffee is BAD they talk down to u... and when you report the supervisor the way they treat ppl  you would think the General manager will understand!!!! is a lot of red flags I do not recommend no one working there 3 people quit they had to let me  go because I wasn't having it I was not going to let nobody talk to me in any type of way...
bad,"Very inflexible with hours, management was not great. Only had one 15 min ""working break"" during your shift. Did not like the culture in the hotel. would not recommend."
bad,I worked in the corporate office. I have never worked in an environment where there was such backstabbing to get ahead. Yuck. Managers intentionally try to make others they view as a threat look bad. This didn't happen to me but watched it happened all the time.
bad,"I worked in the housekeeping department and it's a shame how they treat the executive housekeeper Manager. If an employee/employee's dont show up she's left to do they board with no help. You're force to stay and work even if you're done with your work you still have to help other housekeepers until all the work is completed. The Assistant GM is so unprofessional, they are very under staff and the list can go on and on."
bad,"This is a job that pays very low and expects you to work min 47.5 - 60hrs a week. You only get time back if you work a minimum 6hrs on the weekend, but not any extra time back or come in late the next day for working until midnight. It's a thankless job."
bad,"I never work for no where that poor management.  Jealous and super discrimination. Careless about employees. They change schedule whenever they want to without any discussion or notice. Just changed it and said ""schedule changed, check your schedule"" that's all! Very disrespectful. First, we tried to help and totally becomes our responsibility. Managers never happy with our work."
bad,"I worked for 5 days a week at Grand Hyatt Denver, and I increased more skills in my job experience for making every events successful. At Grand Hyatt I worked with different culture of people."
bad,"The absolute worst experience I've ever had with a company."
bad,"Absolutely love it. Wouldn't do anything else. Where else in the world can you stand still and meet people form all corners of the globe? In the hospitality industry, that's where."
bad,"Management was very poor and pay was poor. At anytime when there was an issue with a matter regarding guest, front desk or even employees,85 percent wasn't resolved"
bad,Management pushes good workers out and keep bad ones. Hours aren’t steady and the benefits are congruent with the cost of living. The Food and Beverage Director is a very inappropriate guy and the food is aweful coming from the kitchen.
bad,"At Hyatt House employees rarely got a lunch especially the night shift. many issues were brought to management and instead of them doing anything about it they brushed it off like it was nothing. Once the GM said in a degrading manor to all employees ""that we are all business expenses and nothing else."""
bad,A unique experience so far as no one knows whats going on or how to do anything. Nor dose anyone care. They need a warm live person to pay minimum wage to be at their front desk and to do housekeeping and maintenance all at the same time with no advancement or pay. They also get your hours wrong and don't pay anyone correctly. So you have to be record every hour you work and then compare it when the check comes out. Unreal.
bad,"bad place to work, horrible employment, was never paid on time. didn't receive a paycheck for over three months. Almost filed a lawsuit against them. Horrible experience"
bad,lack of fairness and understanding. The manager seem like they didnt care about nothing but the income and not the well being of employees. I hated everything about it.
bad,"The rate of pay is terrible. Managers are also terrible with agendas that only involve there advancements within the company. They will use you to sabotage another manager. Just stay away, trust me."
bad,i did not liking working there the supervisors were horrible and the boss lady was very racist she had her picks on people she like which is not right.
bad,"Stressful and unforgiving, no one is held accountable for anything they do there and they play favorites . Everyday supplies are hard to come by and odering then takes longer then it really should, looks of finger pointing and he said she said were no one owns up to their mistakes."
bad,"no room to grow, over worked and under paid, However did learna lot about the costumer service industry and how important it is. Also hot to handle many different situations."
bad,management was very rude and made racist jokes towards my ethnicity and I could not go to HR in fear of my job and being let go. I ultimately quit because I could no longer take it and just moved on.
bad,"I had a horrible experience working for the Hyatt Regency, I now suffer from stress and anxiety along with their and harassment . I had no choice but to quit."
bad,Not a good place to be. Only decent thing about being an employee there are the benefits.  Management does nothing while they watch their employees do everything.
bad,"horrible management, disgusting building, inconsistent hours, stress of job not worth the pay, favoritism amongst management and employees, inappropriate relationships, horrible food for employees, no PTO until at job for a year, few benefits unless full-time"
bad,"Management will scream at you, like you are a dog. They didn't train me for the role they expect you to do.  But they expect you to succeed yet you can't without proper training. Don't ask for a day off, even if it's 30 days in advance because you'll never get it. One of the worse jobs I've ever had"
bad,"Environnement de travail stressant, ouverture d'open spaces jusqu'à 15 personnes dans un espace, management à la carte et dans la défiance envers les salariés, Manager qui établis des clans et vous mets en quarantaine, ... et le tous en toute discrétion bien sure. très mauvaise et traumatisante expérience sous l'enseigne de cet établissement."
bad,The plant closed down and the building was bulldozed to the ground it was formerly owned by GM. I did not have enough time in to be transferred. so I was given my walking papers.
bad,It's was overall by far the worst place to work at low pay terrible benefits I would not recommend them to noo e for a job over worked and under paid ijs
bad,"I do not recommend anyone to work here, this hotel is dirty, old, and very ran down and the management is horrible, favorites are always picked and just a very a bad place to work."
bad,Started this job almost 5 years ago. Enjoyed it very much. Co- workers and mangement was good. Now we have new managment now. The new management I very rarely see or speak with. They have made drastic changes to my schedule without even talking to me to see if I can adapt to these changes. I have a wife and child and my schedule was in rhythm with theirs. Now I went from full time employee to working 2 days a week. Im diggin into my saving to pay my bills and im almost on E. That is why I'm looking for new job.
bad,Lowest scores of any hyatt. They expect to much of everyone.  Place is a pit show. They fired three people  including the gm while I was there and the front desk manager.
bad,"You'll have to see for yourself, but you wont be happy. The valet service lacks professional management. The manager doesn't even work a quarter of the time everyone else puts in.  Just a disappointing environment and could be improved dramatically."
bad,I did not enjoy my time at Hyatt. Employees were rude and cruel to one another. This place was drama filled and guests noticed it. The manager was in the back end not caring what was going on
bad,"The managers are not qualified. The crew is decent, but deserve a better pay. Opportunities for advancement are only for old people. Young people are not welcome."
bad,"This was by far, one of the single worst places to work for.  They are tyrants and cheats.  They wanted me to work for free and not pay for mileage.  I was terminated because I refused a last minute call when I was already out with my wife.  When had plans for dinner and a show I was not about to cancel."
bad,worked in the call center for reservations. after hearing people yell at me all day it was hard to let it go at home. mad props to anyone who can be in customer service long term
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for management would constantly ask us to be dishonest to guests and customers although the company would provide food for employees most of the time it was undercooked or overcooked resulting in employee illnesses company had significant sewer problems resulting in room smelling of sewers regardless of your work ethic maintaining employment was based purely on sucking up to your direct managers and no one else's no training would be provided if you were not qualified or unfamiliar with their systems you would be pushed out
bad,"WORST place ive ever been employed , discrimination by HR horrible front desk management The gm doesnt care about anyone but his management which all suck anyway they give no"
bad,"No proper training, manager comes in and out. No structure. Everyone is rude and talks about everyone including guests. Probably more stressful environment than job."
bad,"A typical day at The Hyatt Place consist of hard and tedious work. I learned that you need to have team players in order to make the job easier. The management is very unorganized and unprofessional. The workplace culture is okay as far as dealing with the public. As far as how they treat their employees, its horrible. Management does not know how to communicate with one another, and there is lack of much respect shown to their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was making my guest happy by fulfilling their needs."
bad,The management at this company is focused on quantity not quality and it is very apparent in the manner in which they run this call center. The employees are not treated well.
bad,"I had never worked for such an unorganized company nor paid so little money for the work load that you do. No other place in the valley, not even family owned businesses will pay you as little as the Hyatt."
bad,"You cook clean rooms unclog toilets, fix ac's you are constantly yelled at you 4 issue that management neglect. No management support shady coworkers."
bad,"Hot kitchen with no air conditioning, and lots of mosquitos. Micromanagement is unbearable. Terrible communication. Minimum pay with maximum work effort."
bad,"Management is always changing, a lot of employees leaving for various reasons.Guest are always complaining about hotel staff and other things.Management does not acknowledge good employees etc..."
bad,The managmet did not give fair treatment when he came down to promotions. They will work you until you cant work no more an even after that. They make you pick up others slack.
bad,No one got along at this work place everyone is negative and litter ally acts as though they hate life engagement is negative and it has a very tense atmosphere.
bad,"I learned so much about helping the elderly, Lot of information about their Diets how they should eat. Did lots of cleaning and sanitizing the kitchen making sure the Patiences."
bad,"Worked a lot of hours, turned around hotel dept, got a grip on lots of problems but never supplied enough tools to do job right. Management has some real problems with managing style"
bad,The work place was okay - staff were not so friendly. I worked really hard and the customers liked me however I was not given the opportunity by my manager and lies were made against me. I was told that I would be getting a permanent contract however when the Christmas and New Year period was over I was let go.
bad,Stay away from this place. The company says their employees matter but they don't. They'll kill you half the time and the other half they'll cut your hours so severely you can't pay your bills. They refuse to give you the schedule more than a few days in advance so it's impossible to anything outside of work and half the time won't give you the things you need to complete your work efficiently.
bad,"Es una empresa que actualmente va en decadencia, no hay proyecciones laborales, no te puedes desarrollar como profesional, se pasan por alto las normas de higiene y seguridad laboral. Es una empresa no es cociente con sus empleados, quienes trabajan alli es porque realmente lo necesitan."
bad,They require staff and leadership/management is not present. They require more security at night. They need to work out the kinks of the hotel in order to be considered as a compatible hotel within the downtown edmonton area
bad,busy  interesting people do what they want no penalty attached. At most parts it was fun while it lasted. it got unprofessional
bad,Worst place to work in Wichita KS. I wouldnt work for this job if it was the last one on earth Hyatt Regency Wichita is the worst one.
bad,"I enjoy working for this company, because it fun place to work for. Good benefits made lots of friends. The company is a good company. I have lots of fun there."
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked. Very poor management, terrible bosses, extremely unhappy employees, honestly coming to work here, is by far my worst mistake in life"
bad,"Although, Hyatt Regency Albuquerque jobs are listed as Hyatt, they are franchise jobs. The management is by Hertage Hotels. Hetitage micromanages the hotel  and there is no job security. HR department is not a resource for employees."
bad,Every one is rude.They have some discrimination to everyone.Overall not a good experience to work there.Some people have a mind to down the people who work there.Not a good placre to work.
bad,understaffed and Management thought that two or even one person  was enough to check people in be a bartender and cook the food and also sometimes make room calls while completing a checklist and role playing all in one day.
bad,"Toda a equipe desmotivada. Promessas salariais não cumpridas. descumpre o ""cuidar das pessoas"""
bad,If you really in need of a job this is the place to stack a couple checks. Very hard work little pay for what all they want done. Cleaning cart is way to big and heavy because of all the items that's on it
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for they (the owners) are alcoholics and insane. They are also satis and enjoy setting up staff and watching them fail. They bully their employee's for fun.
bad,the hardest part of this job is dealing with coworkers that like to cause problems. I clean rooms make sure they are ready for the next guest that is going to stay in it
bad,Management is very cold and uncaring to employee's very gracious and fake to guest.In spite of that I liked working with the people that I took care of shuttling to and from there destinations 99.9 percent are wonderful and loving people
bad,"This company did not compare to expectations that were projected."
bad,Great Company to work for. Nice benifts or and great staff. It s great place for someone who is looking to start their hospitaliy career.
bad,"Good Management, and they care about all associates.the most enjoyable part of the job is the team that I'm working with, we believe teamwork is a key to success."
bad,"The Hyatt Place concept is flawed to a point where it cannot be redeemed.  To have ONE person in charge of the hotel with one set of challenges (being present at the desk to handle guests, near the phone in case it rings, running the end of day and all the filing and other work that goes with that, etc), PLUS the bar and grab and go food (mixing drinks, ringing up food orders, prepping grab and go food, etc) PLUS 24/7 food on demand (making fresh hot food in another part of the building for as many people as ask for it as often as they ask for it, which of course puts the first priority, being present for the guests, completely out the window)."
bad,"A typical day starts with meetings that consist mainly of telling everyone what they are doing wrong and making you feel negative. The rules and regulations change on a daily basis. There are awesome people that work there and a couple of managers who want the best for the company but, too much corporate chaos for me."
bad,"too snooty. instead of classy...they were cold. being from the south...were not like that. needless to say...I didn't fit in well. guess it was cause I wasn't an ""actress"""
bad,"I am done working in this place and hopefully before December 2014, I will be out of here. Forcing employees to give management 100% is simply crazy!! I worked in hotels for over 16 years and never been in a place where you are forced to give 100% in a management review AOS. If you decide to come work for Hyatt Arlington, then be prepared to lie and give fake scores, otherwise, you will get in so much trouble with the HR."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Management treated employees very poorly. Would not recommend anyone to work for Hyatt.
bad,"gosto de trabalhar junto com as camareiras para dar mais rapido os quartos para venda"
bad,the hyatt sucks....they need better management. they management team act like kids
bad,"Top Management has, shamelessly lied to several, if not all the employee's.  Contradictory statements that can change on a daily basis, plus unrealistic work goals. Hiring under false impressions. hours/days routinely cut. constant uncertainty of work schedule. High employee turn over rate.  More senior personal, set up for failure. While new employee's become favorites. "
bad,"Slander and sabotage initially cost me my position with the subcontracted company. These slanderous and false statements were never investigated, and I was forced out of my position. "
bad,"Your typical day at work consists of dealing with problems that no one wants to deal with. I've learned that all Hyatt's are tainted. Managers are never on the same page with each other, everyone have their own rules and regulations. Your co-workers never help you unless they are close to you, they will know that you are struggle but due to the fact that they do not want to do extra work they allow you to take on all the responsibilities by yourself. The hardest part of the job is, you never get recognized for anything you do, they only award people that they are in favor of. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out!"
bad,"Hyatt Place Hotel was the worst place that I've ever worked. The work is overwhelming and exspectations are over the top. Guests are rude and abnostious. over drinking at the bar; grabbing you and coming in the kitchen unanouced. And the GM says to do what ever the guests requests. The GM promotes those that are unqualified, yet kiss his butt and tally on all the other associates to make themseleves look good. Very bad, unstable enviornment for a person of my status. I truely rate Hyatt'; zero. Intermountain (headquarters) really need to step in. I was ther for 7 months, and hed 5 differant Asst General Managers. the turnover there is very scary. I had the worst experience ever on a job. I'm a professional and in need of a real job."
bad,"This place hired me as a per diem Supervisor Coordinator, it was good at first, didnt realize I was being set up.  The Director's who was an LPN and got her RN on line...decides she will be asking the RN Supervisors to sell out their hard working employees. Unethical and full of garbage she was, she doesnt even know how to be a real nurse. She never worked the floor as an RN, she got her RN while she was the VI/Hyatt. What a joke.We knew more than her, and her cherry oak desk."
bad,"I played a key role in overseeing, coordinating and assisting in the activity of the maintenance staff, Ensure repairs, maintenance activity and trainings and preventive maintenance program are completed as directed and supported, monitor capital repairs and renovation projects."
bad,"Needs a union. A friend of mine had a piece of glass stuck in her foot. She had gone to the doctor the day before her shift and had her foot X-rayed and the doctors said they couldn't remove it and that she needed to stay off it. The day after her visit to the doctor, she was not sent home or given light duty, she was forced to stay on her feet all day working in a busy restaurant. This is only one of many abuses that took place during my employment for the Hyatt corporation. "
bad,Very high turn over rate.. Over worked and under paid.. Never again
bad,my days were long and painful. lot of work for no pay. and no advancement.
bad,"it was not a great experience, no advancement, overworked underpaid, its madness....."
bad,Came into like 11pm to 7am but sometime management ask you to say and then it will be a lot later. But this company is nothing but users they work you to death then when they are done with you they will fire you.
bad,"Long hours double shifts and management could care less if you have a family to spend time with. They do not adhere to your availability requests, then expect you to scramble for childcare at the last minute because they scheduled you on your days that you had no availability marked off."
bad,"When the Adams Mark became the new Hyatt Regency at the Arch. Then I was laid-off. They never gave me the chance to prove that I could do the same job that I was doing for the past year 1 1/2, but even better."
bad,"Unfair treatment to new staff. Senior staffs are lazy, they only love to gossip rather than to work, they pick up all the easy works to do and leave behind the ugly ones to new staffs. Poor training and rude environment."
bad,"I was the restaurant supervisor and worked here for 10 excruciating months, in which every member of the management in my department left because it is such a horrible place to work. Every single other member, including directors of F&B and the Director of Operations."
bad,I worked at Hyatt Place for a few months this year. There is no clean lining at that hotel. The housekeepering Supervisor talk to and about the housekeepers to the housekeepers.  The manager at the hotel . Talks to the employees under her like they are trash. The health department needs to close that place down till all the laundry is cleaned and every room is deep cleaned.
bad,"Not organized, no training, no work life balance, Corporate has attitude and no help Everyone is new, everyone is quitting 5 GMs in one year Lots broken in hotel"
bad,I never got the benefits I was told about and the management sucked I went 4 weeks without being on the schedule to 5 days a week without receiving employee benefits
bad,"When you first walk into Hyatt, you are made to believe that it's a fun environment that its ""not a call center"" but trust me. It is. They say ""we care.for people so they can be their best."" But that's only true if you're a a manager favorite. You will never promote unless a manager wants you to promote. Year raises could be .10 cents, could be $1.00. There used to be events and happy hours and taking time off the phones, but now you are almost chained yo to your desk. There are way better paying jobs.  You can be terminated at any time for any reason they see fit. There is not job security. Their rules change depending on who you are. There is not an attendance policy but yet you can be termed for attendance, even if you are not abusing the lack of a so called policy. Even if it's an emergency out of your control. This place has gone down hill so bad. Honestly, its like a mean girls club in customer service. Supervisors and leads are bice to your face but real catty behind your back. If you go to work, stay to yourself and go home you are treated like you're so unsocial and do not like anyone, when really you just want to work and go home and leave work at work. If you're into drama and two faced women then by all means apply. Personally, there are better call centers with better pay."
bad,"By far one of the worst Hotels I've ever worked for, The management is anti employee and the employee turn over rate was abysmal. Moral was low, long working hours and weak management made for an unpleasant working experience. Management never took the needs of staff to heart and was always quick to fire staff members over disagreements."
bad,"Out Of The 4 Years I Dedicated My Years To Hyatt, I Have Never Been In Such Diguse! I Will Only Go Back To Hyatt If My First Ever Manager Will Hire Me Back. #DoneWithHyatt!"
bad,As a hotel team work is a must. The most inportion thing is producing quality work for our guest.We had a daily meeting of how the week will go.some client has diffent needs.
bad,Management changes way too often. They hire incompetent people who would do drugs on the job and even after being told would do nothing. Employees were over worked and not compensated for being stretched out and constantly taken advantage of.
bad,Gm and mangers dont have fairness within employment housekeeping is never in order always loosing workers breakfast is way to expensive now employee's are very rude
bad,Expect you to work Starbucks the restaurant and the bar all in one shift and don’t ask for a break or a day off and if you have an issue with someone you can’t go to hr cause MS Falcon will tell everyone your business
bad,"Always running in a state of being understaffed & overworked. Meaning that we neither had enough employees for the workload or enough scheduled to work."
bad,"This job is a bluff. The management team judges you from a personal outlook instead of a professional outlook. How hard you work don’t mean a thing to them, It goes right over their heads. The front desk staff is demanded to take care of the front desk, watch breakfast area, clean and turnover meeting space, make food off of the dinner menu, be security when guest is disturbed, bartend, and the pay is disgusting. I would not recommend to work here even if I was poor."
bad,What I learned was that it helps to be able to know how to make the coffee like Starbucks. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with the dish and the amount of food for the morning.
bad,"At first the management was great but then they start to lost emloyees, change GM 3-4 times when i was working there. It was not a very good experience for me. I was an intern and supposed to be trained as the contract say but I was never trained properly. I had to fight for the training I need. Most of my gain knowledge was self-learn or I already knew what I am doing. I was so happy that my training was over. I never want to go back to that place ever again. It was never a happy  place to work."
bad,The lack of good management made it an extremely difficult place to work at. Most everybody that starts working their is immediately looking for a new job so they can leave. Extremely high turnover rate.
bad,"This company does not care about their employees at all! They are not willing to work with them or pay them what they should be. If you even ask for a raise in pay they get mad and say that you are replacable. "
bad,All line level employees at the Hyatt Herald Square are extremely hard workers. They deserve a better chance at transitioning to sister priorities for job advancement.
bad,AGM is nasty rude and very unprofessional. Her behavior with her girlfriend is inappropriate for any hotel lobby especially when you are a leader to other employees. Unfair scheduling and lots of favoritism abundantly obvious and bullying staff into not calling corporate. Poor character to be presented by Hyatt.
bad,It gives good job security management. The work is very tedious as there were limited off days. There were activity days which were used to counter the no off situations.
bad,"I worked less than 10% of my time with this company in my assigned position.  I was regularly forced to work positions I was not hired for and openly told management I did not want to do.  There were no raises after doing the job of multiple people, and never one recognition for going the extra mile to help my department as a whole.  I made some fantastic friends, but the work life was a universal misery.  Day after day I heard one person or group from every department say how much they hated the company and location.  Never a positive word spoken."
bad,The management of my department was ran a little unprofessional causing gossip and conflicts. Something you shouldn't have to deal with on a daily basis at work..
bad,No leadership or direction from upper management. This place is very unorganized and disgustingly unsanitary. The view is the only good thing about this god awful job.
bad,"Company totes itself as being employee focused and cares for their employees when it is nonsense.  Upper management was narrow minded and never cared to see the whole pictures.  Good luck trying to get any shifts as a union employee because if you do get a shift, you work the grave yards, and if you are the newest employee, get ready for the worst possible assignments as seniority rules all.  Pros are that if you do your time, you do get to move up / relocate.  Cons, time = 5-8 years before you can think about moving up."
bad,Management is horrible.
bad,"The pay ($9.00) is a bit more than other hotels but not nearly enough for what you do. You are expected to clean the lobby, set up and take down breakfast, clean dishes while breakfast is going on, make lunch and dinner (you are the cook as well) server lunch and dinner to guest, mix alcoholic drinks(your the bartender as well) and then once again clean the entire lobby, kitchen and bar area before you go home. Its Terrible! I would stay away at all costs!"
bad,"management is trash, no one there like their job and they keep on getting more and more hotels and saying it's job security but they're so understaffed as it is and everyone just continues to either  quit or  get fired"
bad,"They have a good culture but do not have very flexible hours. Being in event set up, you are only scheduled during events. They cannot guarantee hours this way, so in my case, I had to get a second job which has a more set schedule."
bad,"They pay minimum wage,they lie about having two people a shift because they're so broke they can only afford one per shift. Housekeeping is always having issues. They treat guests as if they're  God's and if you're okay with having a guest throw literal rocks and paper at you and your managers way of handling that is to reward them with a free night. Then maybe this is the place for you . The only benefit I got out of this place was that both maintenance and the front desk staff are cool decent people who work way to hard for the treatment they get. I have worked for Hotels before,but this hotel has to be the worst ."
bad,"At Hyatt people are not ethical. The culture is one of which not about your work and meeting commitment but simple the image and kissing up to people is how you would get ahead. Good staff are held accountable and staff that play their game are rewards. They have ethics hotline for show and you have no course of action."
bad,This place is like Middle school or Jr. High all over again. Either they love you or they dislike you.  Fake Nice! Like Reality TV Positions are Posted for months and not filled.  Neither Human Resources or The Department you are trying to work for will answer the most basic questions required to fill the position either.  Some Hyatt Positions Have been open since 2017!   Find a place that appreciates you not ignores you. HR are dual property managers and they cannot manage 1 Hyatt property much less 2 Hyatt properties. Clique Catty 101
bad,"Lack of experienced employees ,,cockroaches, old fashion  cuisine, had to pay for parking, lots of frozen products, 50 hour weeks 5 days a week turned into 60 hours week and 6 days"
bad,They have more managers than workers ....they always focus in the negative ....never in the good work you do !
bad,"Worst career move ever.  Leadership will set you up and stab you in the back when you are not looking.  Absolutely ZERO work life balance.  You work five days, however you are expected to be there 12 to 14 hours."
bad,Inexperienced supervisors and unethical HR make the Hyatt a terrible choice for professionals.  If you want grief apply now and regret your decision later.
bad,"The management is horrible "
bad,"More stressful then should be, unreasonable standards. They made you work with harsh chemicals and didn't give you gloves or masks. Poor and limited supplies, so there was a lot of theft even when you brought your own supplies. The main manager, although not bad most times, was unpleasant others, could never just get her point across and was a broken record over everything, and played favorites. Assistant manager was far more pleasant to be around, kind and fair. Some of the staff were pleasant, but many of them not so much and one like to antagonize intentionally. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"It was a great place to work wham I first started. About 3 years in the owner sold the property back to Hyatt corporation. They started cutting positions and people right away. Managers became stressed out and took it out on employees etc.. The place was never the same again. The future I imagined in the company evaporated very quickly. But one good thing came of it all, I met the love of my life their and I'm very happy."
bad,Working at the hotel has been stressful one. Management is the biggest problem. The work culture is poor because management is abusive and the hotel was in a constant state of disarray. I am a dedicated and hard working working employee and the requirements for getting through a shift at this hotel are really difficult and there is little room for advancement and poor compensation.
bad,"Extremely Stressful and hectic "
bad,"Everyone who works at Hyatt's pretty much hates Hyatt's, unless they are related to Hyatt's by blood or marriage. All wages are way too low, across the board. The building is in shambles. The health insurance is worse than medicaid. The managers are 75% complete ding-dongs. Honestly, I worked here a year. I hated a year of my life."
bad,You work crazy hours. The pay is not worth the job. They need to pay staff what they are worth. Average starting pay is 9.50 hr but expect you to work anytime they call.
bad,"I just left the Lodge after working there for the past few years. Don't do it! That is my advice, this place was formerly called Stowe Mountain Lodge for the past 10 years and you should look up that name and read the employee reviews. Nothing has changed. Now they want to call this a Hyatt property and charge obscene rates all the time which will lead to angry guests all the time. Always short staffed and there is no training in any departments. Management has weekends off and during the week only work 9 - 5.  On weekends you are completely alone. It's just you and the angry guest standing in front of you. We run out of linens, towels, orange juice, food, just about anything you can think of. Upper Management does not care about anybody but themselves and the same can be said about the AFOM's too. You will be lied too over and over again about more staff arriving and pay increases. It will be impossible for you to take time off as they do not have staff. Your coworkers will not like just because they are miserable after spending way to long at the Lodge. The main thing I hear form new employees is ""this does not make any sense"" and seasoned employees will reassure them, ""it's not supposed to make sense this is the Lodge""  You will be blamed for stuff that is not your fault and anyone in a position of power will just point the finger at someone lower than them and blame them the first chance they get. You will be under appreciated, overworked and underpaid. That is a guarantee."
bad,"The management company cannot actually be considered a management company. Expectations were never discussed for the employees, just expected. A lot of shady business with vendors and contractors which is also why the project took considerably long to open and was unsuccessful. The owner overall needs more hotel experience prior to attempt to open a well known branded hotel such as Hyatt"
bad,"Of all the years of customer service and hospitality, it pains me to say that it is absurd the way things are ran there. There is no line between friendship and work colleagues. Its hindering the hotel and the team they have."
bad,"The Hyatt Place consist of hard and tedious work. I learned that you need to have team players in order to make the job easier. The management is very unorganized and unprofessional. The workplace culture is okay as far as dealing with the public. As far as how they treat their employees, its horrible. No employee meals .Management does not know how to communicate talk about there employee and there is lack of much respect shown to their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was making my guest happy by fulfilling their needs."
bad,"Worse job ever, not what you expect, pay is not enough for what you are required to do, poor management, career advancement is based off who you know, not what you know"
bad,Not enough employees to handle HYATT place at max capacity. No cash tips allowed. And they want you to leave the TVs on fake news cnn all day long. That says enough in itself.
bad,They still owe me my retro pay of 130 hours. They mangers are very unprofessional. I feel like it wasn't the job for me. I'm just being honest.  And I'll just leave it like that.
bad,"HR Department head has no experience and is very ignorant.  harrassment is rampant there with no help from corporate when you complain. Workers are abused daily in many forms. There is no life at home, its only the hotel. Commitments are broken constantly. You are made to feel like less of a person by GM and HR, they are a team of abusers and if you say something you get fired. The employees are afraid for their jobs. Corporate was called many times and just sweeps the many abuses under the rug."
bad,"Management is a jokes "
bad,"Management and ownership are the worst. In fact, they will fire you via text message in the middle of the night for no reason. Don't work here!!!  You will regret it!"
bad,"The rush of cars come in, then the front desk wants you to abandon the only other guy working with you to go fetch someone from the airport or train station. You get back and now someone else wants to get dropped off at the airport, meantime there's a line of cars expanding onto Fore Street in Portland, just trying to check in and valet their cars. Yet there's no teamwork from management until people start complaining about the wait. Then when you work closing shift, the chances are very slim of going home early if you're working with someone else. The other person usually goes home early cause all the money has been made and they ""have better things to do"". Then you're stuck filling out some stupid log sheet so people get billed accordingly, and there's a 50/50 chance you come into another rush right before the end of your shift where then you're stuck late, cause you ""NEED"" to complete the log of people using valet. You're not really appreciated by the company, but more or less treated like a peasant."
bad,The management in this hotel don't care about employees and they keep lazy and careless people in this hotel. it's the worse place to work ever because specially the management trouble.
bad,"while working at Centric, turnover were very high.  Lack of experiemced maagers amd most of all GN and HR director need to educate themselves and their managers in communication and how to boost morale."
bad,"Working for a hyatt place you have to be ready to do everything from cooking, cleaning, being a receptionist, answering to horrible costumers, driving, bartending and making coffee for less than 13 dollars an hour."
bad,"If you work here you will mostly be told to learn from fellow employees, instead of management. Working here will eventually drain you, since there is a frequently high turnover rate. Coworkers will call in or be absent for time to time, in turn you will receive calls to cover shifts which isn't appreciated in the long run. The general manager always disappears in the hotel in time of need and keeps a way of communications on him. You are often left alone to deal with guests concerns. Housekeeping issues occur very frequently which leave you responsible to fix. Kitchen area is always filthy, examples you find food which stinks or is molded or brown often. There are silverware which aren't properly clean being given out to guests all time from kitchen morning staff. Prep table for food in the kitchen is always a mess with food pieces always scattered about and crusted on the pans. The floor is consistently dirty from food attracting bugs inside the hotel. The hotel is poorly managed for letting these occurs regularly, and the ownership lacks the responsibility to make efforts or changes to create a better business."
bad,"Employed for ten years.The hotel was corporately owned.I love working there now it is franchised own for 3 years and hotel is going down the drain. had two GM in the two years .Two new sales people."
bad,"Management is verbally abusive with little understanding how to perform their own jobs. Relying solely on the opinions of others, decisions are constantly changing without any notice to the people affected."
bad,Hyatt is a horrible company to work for. For managers there is no work life balance. They feel very comfortable making managers work 70 plus hours per week. They are so afraid of the union employees are allowed to treat management very poorly. Senior management is arrrogant and condescending. I would never recommend any one I know work for this company. I also encourage all my family and friends to never stay at a Hyatt. Absolutely despicable work environment.
bad,"I would not recommend working in this restaurant if you have substantial experience. It has been hands down thee worst place I have ever spent my time. It is not ran by mgmt, it is ran by selfish, lazy staff who want to be anywhere else but at work. Mgmt just avoids holding them accountable. That's ok, they can keep them,  I'll move on. "
bad,"I knew that when  I signed a waiver to give up my 30 min lunches that it could only, get worse. I did not realize how bad this job was going to be. Its not customer service as a front desk hotel agent would suggest. You are juggling every kind of job possible from being a mcdonald's employee, to janitor, to bartender, shuttle driver, and then being customer service."
bad,This could be a decent place to work if the right resources were provided and they hired competent management.  Unfortunately this hotel is run by a third party management firm.  They offer no training and management is only worried about protecting their own interests and will not help develop their employees.  Working 80 hours weeks is not worth it.  There is no work life balance and extremely high turnover.  They do not offer vacation or 401k the first year given very few employees last that long.  I would not recommend this place to my friends.
bad,"Too Much work for the pay given. Management sucks because supervisour family works there so ""family first"" they get the days off they desire. Other of us that are not ""family"" have to work their days, which are often weekends and holidays. In which I lot time of spending time with my family. My co-workers take advantage of having their family member as supervisor alot. Also the supervisor doesn't report insidents that happen. I didn't like it an will never return to this place for work."
bad,"el hambito laboral es acojedor pues el compañerismo estan agradeble, sin embargo la parte administrativa no actua confome a las politicas ya establecidas, es decir el las maneja asu manera"
bad,"I thought I was joining a family, but I got a dirty, lazy chef that is supposedly ServSafe Certified but breaks every rule in the book. I blame his failing health for his laziness and unkempt kitchen. They could do so much better, but they seem to be happy with the way things are, a disgrace!!"
bad,"ambiance difficille à supporter, millieu huppé,direction technique inexsiatent, employement à la chaine, syndrome de peter à la clé et turn over insupportable"
bad,"Easy job"
bad,"I worked in one of the restaurants at the new Hyatt Regency New Orleans. Before working here, I longed to work in the hospitality industry and had plans on making it a career. . .this quickly changed. Not only do I not have any interests in working at another Hyatt but I no longer want to work at any Hotel, no matter the name or status. The managers constantly blame their employees for any and everything that goes wrong and are unpleasant and unprofessional to work with. The managers are mostly from out of town and look down on locals. They believe that they know more than the locals and refuse to take advice from their employees. There is a very small margin for advancement. Good luck to anyone looking to work there. I honestly don't expect this hotel to last for 5 years."
bad,i worked there fpr about 6 months its an ok job but very low pay plus the GM is rasist an doesnt know how to talk to his employees please dont consider this job if u need it take it if not dont
bad,Each and evey day will learn how staff and guest were treated and both complaints how were managed. Most importantly learned that people should be treated individualy and with respect at all times and the guest is always right even if is not the case but make them feel at home and later explain to your superior the crux of the matter without guest knowing
bad,"It was not a good fit for me from a nursing and core value perspective. I cannot recommend the facility as a sound and safe environment to keep their loved ones. Typical day started at 7AM with no night nurse to give report or to count narcotics with. DON resigned after 5 months leaving me the only licensed nurse on the floor. Facility consisted of 2 floors, over 30 residents ranging from psych to bedridden. Communication system and management not effective. The hardest part of the job was dispensing medication in a timely manner to different residents, most preferring to have their medications brought to their rooms. Alot of diabetics, 70% requesting their insulin in their rooms while the other 30% waiting on 1st floor medication room."
bad,"It was good at the beginning but they changed management and there were too many bosses, they don't care about the employees, I have been humiliated in front of guests and made to kneel and scrub bathroom floors just so the guest can get his night free."
bad,"At first everything was awesome working at the Hyatt, but after  couple months everything went bad especially with management and a few other fellow workers. Very very poor entire management ."
bad,"Bad work experience all together, mangers showed favorites towards employees. Very unprofessional and unorganized. Some of the employees were a joy to work with. It was a OK work area at times"
bad,"This new Hyatt culture stinks. Managers make the rules as they go. There is no Human Resources office available. Working during the night, it was you against the world. Along with your job duties you had many other jobs to perform, and God forbid you forgot to complete your duties. Their culture was, take care of my buddies and screw the rest of the personnel. I never worked so hard in my life. I resigned."
bad,Hyatt itself is a prommising brand however the management within was deteriorating the companys reputation.No proper training was conducted on newly hired employees.
bad,I have never seen a company or job over work people like the Hyatt. I been in hotels for 14 years and this property needs a lot of work starting with the management company.
bad,poor management. screwed me out of all my paid time off. wouldn't work with my college schedule. hired to not work weekends and then they required me to work weekend when a new head housekeeper was hired.
bad,"The company Hyatt is wonderful. The Hyatt place Tucson airport is not. I wouldn’t apply unless you know Spanish. The crew is mainly Hispanic and will speak Spanish first and translate to English if needed. This particular location has a policy of “if you can’t finish it, the next person will pick up the work”. As a closing employee it lands on you to pick up after everyone else."
bad,"Horrible place to work! They need to be shut down, POOR MANAGEMENT! THEY FIRED me for going back to school and getting a second job! Don’t care about their workers, treated us like slaves! PRIVILEGED GUEST just plain RUDE, was never enough laundry, spent most of the day at work waiting on SHEETS, pillow cases.. ETC! workers have been called incompetent. Threats were made towards our J1 students! HATED IT HERE!"
bad,"The people at this Hyatt are great however the job, pay, and management are absolutely horrible. There is no room for advancing and one of the bosses is the worst, if you aren’t the perfect little Barbie who wears make up for a 5:30am shift and have a perfect hairstyle he will tell you to do better and compare you to others"
bad,"I learned lots of things in this company but work here is also very stressful, the managers and corporate does not help you to grow up and that is one of the reasons why i want to leave"
bad,"Managers at that property come and go I was working there for 11 years and just recently got fired do to new management lack of communication, they do not know the union rules, they are racist and they have Friends working there with lower seniority, so they have conspire to get rid of upper seniority so that their friends could get more days and hours on the schedule. H.R is for management not for employees, overall they need to teach the managers to be fair go by the union book and stop harassing upper seniority."
bad,"on a daily basis, I was constantly understaffed, I served as the bartender, waitress and sometimes also the chef. I was also wrongfully terminated due to this understaffing"
bad,I wish the Hyatt was a better place to work at once the new management came in but it wasn't it was a hard work sperience working with a new manager in Ramona Jones
bad,".               They will push you beyond your limits. i saw number of employees being hired and fired, no appropriate management for such big place ,"
bad,"This is not a job that will last a lifetime., you make $8 doing front desk bar and kitchen whereas other hotels in the area make $8 or even $9 and they do JUST the front desk .. housekeeping starts off at $7.25 and they have to scrub floors and other stuff  they take forever to give you a raise. High turnover rate always has been since they’ve been open ., and it’s definitely because of the pay. They need a new manager, someone who actually knows how to manage and with management skills, preferably a man!"
bad,"If you don't do what they say,  they turn on you.   They hire their manager's pick for jobs and overlook your hard work!   They allow employees to come to work high be no call no shows but scold others that they are not close with!"
bad,I learn alot of things that i did think that could possiblie  learn . the hyatt is not really bad place to work its just the people who the compagnies they really dont know how to take care a good employer . it dont matter how hard you working if the4y dont like you they will keep attaking you untill you live so they can give you position to someone else who dont even wanna to work and thats wrong
bad,"The park hyatt makes lots of promises to its employees that it cannot fulfill. When I was hired, I was told I would have an orientation and get a tour of the hotel. That never happened. One manager says to do one thing and while another says to do something totally different. The biggest issue is the lack of management whatsoever. Horrible communication between all departments and all levels of management. On a typical work day, there were on average 2 managers to cover 45+ working employees in 5 different departments on each shift. I worked in two different departments, and I never had a manager that checked on me, asked how things were doing, or to check to make sure the job was getting done. No one is held accountable, and management gets treated like gods while the employees have to figure out what to do on their own because there is no training whatsoever. I would have customers complain to me that there were no managers around to give refunds or to talk about service issues. Guests were not happy here. I was a tipped employee and my Director of Operations told us we couldn't have a tip jar.... even though our other managers did not care whether we had a tip jar or not. When one manager tell us to do one thing, and 5 other managers tell us to do 5 other things, it makes working at the Hyatt very difficult. The worst part is when guests saw the horrible management practices and complained to us about it."
bad,"The Hyatt Reg.ND in particular has had its share of several owners, no matter what changes occur, the property is always lacking in all departments!!!"
bad,For those looking to get into the hotel industry this is a stepping stone into the hotel industry. Compared to other hotels the pay is is mediocre and management isn't as appreciative as other places I've worked.
bad,Interval Leisure Group is a company only interested in profits.  The work staff was slowly replaced with less experienced people.  In addition to the poor company culture was the Franklin Templeton building.  There is no heating unit in the building.  This was incredibly uncomfortable when the fans circulated cold air every day.  Staff had to wear hooded jackets to keep the drafts off of them.
bad,"My typical day at work is usually helping with breakfast, restocking/putting  food, and beverages away! Doing shuttle runs, wiping down tables and food area, keeping an eye on the front desk, "
bad,"A typical day at work is basically me just walking in in the morning and breakfast being served. I help maintain the upkeep of the gallery kitchen and also the gallery where guest are eating. After breakfast is completed, I help breakdown and put away all of the left over food and make sure the area is cleaned up for the next day. When all of that is completed, I help with either the check-in or check-out process and make sure that guest has all of their needs met when they arrive or leave. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the guest. If I'm making them happy, then I'm happy. I also enjoy working with my coworkers. In the time that I've been employed at this job, I've gotten close to some of the people that I've worked with and we have become like family. The hardest part of the job is when you have to deal with disgruntled guests. My main objective is always to give them the optimum Hyatt experience that they deserve and when there's nothing that you can do to make them happy, it can make the situation difficult to deal with."
bad,"Pay was adequate and they have nice employee meal buffets but training for job sub-par. Went through terrible rennovation crammed into a coat closet for operations without sufficient accommodations and terrible conditions for guests. FOM wanted to pass off his responsibilities of training to other people and then blamed me for the lack of knowledge which he was supposed to impart. Often left without suitable coverage for busy nights and unable to reach manager when necessary (often he would disappear for hours and nobody knew where he was!). No support or efficient conflict resolution from HR, seemed they were all in cahoots with each other! Well, I tried to warn them...manager was fired eventually but only after I had to separate myself from the ignorance."
bad,"The Hyatt is all business, not true hospitality, horrible management, bartenders make less than servers but work 5x as hard."
bad,"Good coworkers, ethic but fast pace job"
bad,There is culture of ruling by intimidation.There is no quality of life. This company micromanages .
bad,"Honestly my co-workers would help me get through the day, with there funny and motivating personalities. Very clean and friendly environment. The management is very resourceful and are willing to help in every department."
bad,"He is always complains about the lack of professionalism of the managers , many interns managers with no experience. overall Atlanta Hyatt it's probably the worst you can work for. he is quitting as soon as he gets any other position."
bad,"Finally I get to review this horrible place! This is not a professional place because as a former employee they do not care about the issues that you have with another co-workers and they always think that you are stealing from the hotel. Therefore, there is always a trusting issue and they do not warmly welcome new employees.The HR department is not helpful at all because they cannot help you if do not bring a problem to their attention, even if you do, they still cannot help you. Only if you have payroll issues, they will be obligated to help you because obviously if no one gets paid, they will get sued."
bad,I would work their again some of the people was very nice the guess was nice when I did housekeeping great management could have been better but I would work their all over
bad,Management and Hr are all clueless and they only promote the employees they sleep with. They retaliate and harass employees who have disabilities and those on FMLA and other accommodations. They let employees talk about others they don’t like right in front of everyone and if you call in the entire department knows why...
bad,"Hyatt is a great company to work for if the work environment is positive. There is a lot of turnaround, therefore, the morale of the work place can change. The company expects you to be responsible for tasks that are not  apart of your job description as well as have a flexible schedule. Overtime is never permitted!"
bad,"They expect you to ""figure it out"" very high school clicky with upper management. If you are not in you are out. One of the worst office atmospheres I have ever encountered. Very belittling and hostile work environment."
bad,"A typical work day 17 plus checkout a day on top of 17 stayovers.They don't count stayovers. Short staffed everyday, overworked and underpaid. Employees are tried. Management WOULDN'T help at all. Suppose to take lunch but don't have time. Always want rush the employees to get done and get off the clock. Work 4 months straight without a weekend off and was told I would have every other weekend off and didn't get that. I wouldn't work here again nor would I stay here."
bad,I dedicated myself to my position but was never appreciated where others were I worked 80 hours a week because management would always allow staff to call off or all request off we're approved for other staff regardless of how busy the hotel was.i had to complete task required for a higher position but yet when the position was available I was instantly turned down but was still required to to complete these tasks to prove I wanted to keep my current position.it seemed like a very unfair system which was a big disappointment because the position had many appealing qualities.
bad,"Lots of work politics."
bad,"I worked a Hyatt by the arch a very short time before I got pregnant I was ok with standing long hours . but than I had got sick nd the management was not having it . you cant call off before a year.the pay is not worth the stress, they stress you out over surveys every week."
bad,"I had high hopes for this position after reading all of the positive reviews about the positive work culture. Unfortunately, I experienced the complete opposite. Very unorganized, non-professional environment and management does not care about you. You will be scheduled long hours or 6 days a week without being asked and you don't know your schedule until the day before the week begins."
bad,it was a good place to work overall Until I had to deal with management parking was terrible but overall the people were nice but the time given to complete certain test was unrealistic
bad,Employees not treated with respect housekeeping is disposable to them. Management has the tendency of being aggressive with there approach to dealing with employees
bad,"At the property I worked at, each department was out to blame another. I had a manager that would frequently call people names or would just overall talk down to you, he was an absolute bully. Upper management were very 2 faced and did not hold back on how they displayed favoritism with their management team and associates. I was never allowed to use my vacation time as it would go to others who had requested time off long after me. I worked more hours than my superior and never was appreciated. Hyatt has left a disgusting taste in my mouth and I wasted over 11 years of my career and life."
bad,Als Ausbildungsort sehr schlecht. Habe mich dort nicht wohlgefühlt. Unnötige Überstunden gemacht.
bad,"At first seemed as a good place to work.  Especially when the previous GM was there.  Then they changed GM's and the place fell.  The new GM came across as a nice guy, but wasn't.  The hotel lost money one month and they blamed it on employees and started cutting back full-time employees hours to 28 hours, doing away with benefits.  Then removed high paid people and replaced them with low paying people.   DO NOT WORK FOR HYATT AIRPORT or COMMONWEALTH HOTELS.  Some ""very rude"" Corporate people, and they don't care about employees. 10 positions were open recently from employees whom had quit."
bad,"Discrimination was made aware to upper management with no results or changes.  Management never addressed concerns or problems that workers brought to their attention, which made for a negative work environment."
bad,"It was a job I loved and was excited to get. It had been a long time since I really enjoyed going to work, but not long after I was hired the company changed to Heritage and it went downhill very fast and just kept getting worse."
bad,"The Hyatt Place is a great place to work if you are available to work full time or have flexibility within your schedule. I do not recommend this job for students ( who have set schedules), or people with any extracurriculars or upcoming events or engagements. The chain of command is confusing and messages aren't always sent to the right person nor received. There is a huge lack of communication in reference to training, infractions, and scheduling. So prepare to be improperly scheduled. There are little to no warnings of infractions or mistakes you have made. This is a job that asks flexibility from you but does not often return it( as they have to meet crazy business demands). If you have the energy and time, it works great. If you require minimal flexibility, I would look elsewhere."
bad,"Terrible work- life balance- Grueling work hours"
bad,"Bad management company worked long hours, terrible work life balance, not organized, terrible training program, Company was not willing to invest in their employees which had morale low"
bad,"No set schedule, not enough employees, not fair pay for job requirements. Management is hard to talk to about issues. Would be better ran if it was a corporate Hyatt."
bad,must be a conformist - having nothing to do with conforming to excellent work ethic and service standards - but to the 'fraternity/sorority' mentality that permeates the management and is passed on the associates - I would avoid Hyatt
bad,the hours were that of a hospital shift and management was awful. commissions were never paid and bonuses were distributed in order of hierarchy. not based on who eared it.
bad,"benefits are outstanding, but management is very bias no job security, the vets run the hotel so seniority matters regardless if you are high off your rocker doing sloppy work!"
bad,"I wouldn't work here unless you're in a pinch. The menu states to buy desert over giving employees gratitude. I was over-tasked as a bartender, barista, auditor, host, expediter, among other guest requests. The management isn't very sensitive to social needs of employees including procedural justice and situational mediation."
bad,"Not a good place to work! The mangers are just as rude as the customers, i’m always nice and that job was just not the one for me. It made me know that i never wanna run a restaurant"
bad,"The Hyatt need to train all of their employees, Everyone is mistreated, Favoritism should not be happening in the work place. Discrimination. I like that we can travel with the Hyatt. Greeting and meeting the customers brightens my day."
bad,They were very unprofessional they were not nice to me. I always did my work and some other people work but they found out they had an issue with a family member of mine and started taking my hours. I was down to working 1 day a week so I quit
bad,"Worked here as a (gallery host) front desk. These people over work you, they make you do so much and treat you so bad. Management in this place is unbelievably rude. They care about their bonuses, not the employees. HORRIBLE place to work."
bad,No more Hyatt.  Now that the Vacation Entity has been acquired by a huge Corporation the family atmosphere has dissolved.  It's now stab or be stabbed in this new cut throat culture.
bad,"Worked for Hyatt of 7 years in management and was a very good experience till i got to Philadelphia. The GM and his directors are rude, not willing to help/mentor management"
bad,"the management was all over the place. they would say one thing and do another. they played sides when it came to certain things. the guest were nice, but you would have some that weren't. you could bust your butt working and you'd be lucky if they noticed. they were too worried about their reviews than there staff members!"
bad,"The only way to move up in the company is to be someone who can be ""molded"" ie. a professional butt kisser. If you are someone who actually thinks. Your job could be on the line if you were to voice those thoughts."
bad,"Hyatt was a good place until a new AGM came in and the second AGM left. Horrible management, employees are treated unfairly and major favoritism. Strict on uniforms yet don’t provide a uniform. Don’t allow night auditors any kind of breaks. When asked when I could sit and rest for a bit, I was told when I used the bathroom. Unorganized, property falling apart, poor scores due to property issues yet it’s the front desks agents fault."
bad,"la supervisora no te deja trabajar tranquilo y se complotaba con mis compañeros... no te dejan progresar.."
bad,Zero work life balance and minimum management shift is 10 hours daily but usually much longer. Upper management is out of touch with day to day operation and  make it more difficult for their team to operate.  Staff is amazing and such a support system to each other and great teamwork within the line level departments.  benefits are great (vacation and paid maternity leave etc.) when you're actually able to use your time.
bad,"Muy mal clima laboral, los sueldo son variables y hasta la fecha sigos trabajando como eventual sin un salario fijo"
bad,the work was very hard and the co-workers management made it more difficult.
bad,"The sales team is 100% commissioned based. Very often the marketing department does not provide the sales team enough tours so all sales staff members receive one tour (sales opportunity) daily and often the tours are not qualified. "
bad,"Imagine being disrespected to your face daily, imagine having your job threatened by management over lies by lazy employees who don’t even value the job, imagine them changing your work uniform from a professional suit to a low cut short wrap dress and them telling you they don’t care you don’t feel comfortable showing your chest or wearing a dress this short and them shrugging they shoulders and saying the uniforms the uniform, imagine your HR painting you out to be the issue because that’s what it’s like to work for this Hyatt years of disrespect and no value"
bad,"I worked as a housekeeping supervisor and my manager was so threatened by me, she would constantly blame me for things I had nothing to do with or things that would happen on my days off. She would never give constructive criticism, just throw blame so that she wouldn't have to take responsibility for not keeping an eye on her people while she just sat in the office all day. The worst was when I caught the housekeepers doing some shady stuff and she believed the housekeepers over me. When it was proved that I was right, she got salty about it and treated me like garbage all morning. It didn't help things that we had an absent GM so my complaints and concerns constantly fell on deaf ears. They don't care about you and they give the bare minimum to their employees."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and co workers. Management is very flexible and understanding with your school schedule. You are on your feet a lot as well but you get used to it.
bad,"It was a Hyatt branded hotel, but the employer was actually InterMountain Management.  Some GMs are great, my last one was horrible.  Backed up by corporate even though he was the cause of almost the whole staff quitting (including me) within his first 6 months - he is stll with, and supported by, InterMountain."
bad,"As i applied for a front desk position, i was offered an even better position as i was told. Not knowing that i would get a lower offer in pay, nothing was said. The first manager i worked under spend very little time training me, i spent alot of time researching and figuring out programs, i have to say i did a good job with learning on my own. Little did i know that my manager was training with another department for a different position in a different state,great for her but i was not being helped. i took the first step in talking to the supervisor, no change i then went to HR nothing was changed, soon the manager left, the new manager stepped in, she had never done reservations i helped her as much as i could and learned, mistakes she made was blamed on me and she pointed the finger at me. No one took the time to correct me nor help with fixing mistakes."
bad,Shady management tactics to get new hires. Not upfront about the job or what they're looking for and appear to be desperate. Probably good for people with flexible schedules but don't expect them to work with you.
bad,"You’ll climb then corporate ladder if you’re a part of the click.  The same people win the shout outs and awards.  "
bad,"But the people you work with sucks and will stab you in the back.  the agm cares about your personal life. the gm is amazing at her job and gets things."
bad,"Each Hyatt Place is individually owned by someone different.  Hyatt Place Mohegan Sun seemed poorly managed.  My overall experience was poor.  I do not understand why they did to me what they did; I did not feel safe there, either."
bad,People are fun to work with they have awesome environment and they tak care of there employees.everytime i go to work feels good cause i know i will be surrounded with nice people
bad,"It's management before guests, ALWAYS! But be sure to beg guests for 10’s (guest satisfaction) per mgmt. Do not speak unless spoken to. Your opinion does not count. Bad employee morale and high turnover."
bad,Management was awful during the last year of my 11+ year career at the hotel.  Most of the management staff was turned over when the new GM arrived during her first 9 months.  Currently there are no members of management that I worked with still employed at the property.  I loved my job for most of my time spent there and was sad to see it fall apart as I was leaving.
bad,"not so much fun to work here life and work becomes work and no life , management doesn't memeber there employees names so your just a number here"
bad,"I am ex employee of Hyatt was working as Food and Beverage Cost controller "
bad,"Management got away with a lot of stuff"
bad,Some of the Jamaicans was very nice some of them was really rude some of them you couldn't really trust and then when they talk about you they talk in their language
bad,This place was terrible to say the least. The management sits down all day and expect everyone else to work the butts off. We never had linen so we were literally waiting for vacant rooms so we can use the linen for new arrivals. They put the hammer down on black employees you have no room for mistake and the pay is years behind. I started at 11 and some change every where else 13. This place is a joke and the funny thing about it I was fired when I would’ve gave my left butt cheek to quit.
bad,I loved working at Hyatt it was a very nice place to work at that I help with from the ground up it very nice and I’m glad to say that I worked there.
bad,I really didn't like working there the job something i love to but i feel like i was a slave i wouldn't recommend no one to work there but it pays the bills
bad,"It is not a bad company, good people to work with, just very fast paced and busy. Benefits are also great, and they are flexible with the shifts you work."
bad,"do not work for the company management is lazy and shows favoritism to female employees. "
bad,I am started from stewarding in hotel and get the position till to coordinator Engineering department and I was build myself as a person who is can work at all condition because of i want to achieve something in life
bad,Mai loundry attendant hu mujhe in sab kaamo ki acchi yeah jaankari hai aur Mai yeh sabhi kaam Ko acchi yeah nibhaoonga aur mene longer bar Mai manager ki post par rha hu
bad,Unpleasant and stressful. Supervisor lacked good communication skills and over-load work assignments onto untrained employees. Lack of appropriate equipment and materials to perform job duties.
bad,"I was discriminated against and was afraid to even show up to work, my spouse sent an email to corporate about the situation and the GM at the time pulled me into the office and called me a liar."
bad,Working for the Hyatt corporation was an overall bad experience. I would not recommend them as an employer to anyone seeking a fulfilling position or environment.
bad,"Same as current job  over seeing  ding payroll walk ins , typing menus ,    "
bad,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, it really didn't seem as though I was going to a job. I liked the fact that I was basically my own supervisor, I had no one hovering over every second. Everyone treated everyone equal and as if they were family. It was a nice place to work the entire staff was awesome."
bad,"management not attentive to employees needs. pay disputes not resolved. i worked night auditor, little supervision needed or offered. management not available when assistance needed."
bad,Working at Sheraton hotel the staff was very helpful. I love the how they trained me to work in a safe way overall being employed there was great. I would recommended people who has excellent Multitasking and time managment skills to give this hotel a try
bad,The Hyatt Midtown could have been the worst place that I could have work at by far they have not organization as far as direction upper management really stinks I would nt recommend anybody to apply for interstate hotel and resorts.
bad,In grand hyatt the most hardest part of job when Mr saraf's son wedding happened. Team work is the most enjoyable of the job
bad,"nice place to work, to many bosses and lunch not long enough, not enough time to complete assigned duties. starting wage and probation time unfair"
bad,Hyatt is a very unorganized place especially the valet attendants. Management was ill experienced and they don't appreciate their employees
bad,If you are a student this is a good hotel to work for the work well with your schedule and the pay is decent. One of the main negatives is that it is hard to make plans because you will work unexpected long shifts at times
bad,A lbeautiful beach front hote at Saadiyat Beach which avearhe occupancy 85% through out the year
bad,"dentro de mi año trabajando en hotel hyatt aprendi a trabajar bajo presion, poder manejar varios process dentro de un mismo tiempo, lo cual me ayudo a poder organizar y priorisar de mejor manera mis tiempos, en cuanto al ambiente laboral, me llevaba muy bien tanto con mis pares como con mis jefaturas.  "
bad,"-Mostly work the second shift that begins from 3pm to 12am."
bad,"In the beginning it was fine, cause it was a new job experience. But as time went on it became more and more stressful, to the point that I had to quit. I would not recommend Hyatt Place to anyone, cause you are constantly taken advantage of, and they dont pay you near enough for the work you do."
bad,"People can be very mean when they travel. "
bad,"There is no typical day at work. There is always and forever some surprise that comes up, which is the nature of our business but at Hyatt regency Reston its extreme. Management is always pushing you to do more and more, which would also be cool if your were properly compensate for it.  The hardest part of my job was accepting the fact that I had to perform multiple job roles while only getting paid for one. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving. Sorry but I had to be brutally honest."
bad,it was great place to work but management didn't have a clue.
bad,"An elite place of business that provides great learning experiences. I really enjoyed providing each customer completed reservations. I continued to learn that our hotel guest is the most important part of the business. My desire would be to excel in a management position."
bad,"It is very easy to work in Mcdonalds, very cooperative staff, always smiling faces, flexible schedules, Managers are always very assisting. Good customer serivice building skills"
bad,"Assisting the manager in daily duties "
bad,management needs work more footwork and hands on experience
bad,Im out going careing.love helping people.seeing them happy.keeping them smile.alwas prepared.dressed and ready to work.always on time.always ready for what ever is coming .
bad,"since i been here the GM was fired the front desk staff went from 12 to 5 and they want you to cook, work the bar, and check people in, its BS dont waste your time."
bad,Management is very poor no good .. Housekeeper is very rude ..Housekeeping Supervisor always arrive late sometime need get cart for ready supplies .. No one open housekeeping storage always late .. One of Housekeeper was very rude and she want all tips her self and not share with other housekeeping teams  .. Laundry is greedy take tips from housekeeping  and guest left tips for housekeeper cleaned room . Some Laundry co work will take tip money .. It is wrong this tip is not for them because they don’t cleaned this room .. That’s why Management is poor and no professional .. Also they messy and drama!!! Don’t work there is not a good place
bad,"The worst Front Office Manager ever & to add to that, the director if room had unprofessional relationships with the front office manager which was the worst of all"
bad,"Management gave two people whom they hired for no more than 6 months leadership positions before me. Nobody seemed to really care about how I felt only to have at least $100 to my name after paying bills then coming to work to do everything (Bar, Starbucks, Kitchen! keep front desk tidy and sometimes even housekeeping duties). Management spoke about guest and applicants very terribly. No real motivation and encouragement. Sometimes you feel like you are a slave and have no choice but to leave. Do not apply here if you are looking to advance later on for lead position, they might hire someone long after you and offer it to them. Other hotel properties pay their workers more with less duties."
bad,"Working at Hyatt was very stressful."
bad,"O hotel é um lugar incrível , mas para trabalhar não recomendo ."
bad,"This is a glorified motel disguised as a hotel. The cliental, especially during football season, are the worst. Expect to do other peoples jobs regardless of what department you are in, and work all sort of hours."
bad,"requires housekeepers to do 20+ rooms a day.  does not provide adequate supplies.  not enough helpers, does not care about employees"
bad,"You would start your morning off by setting up your cart and stocking which include loading towels ,wash, rags, and sheets, and pillow cases . then youw would add your hygiene produts as well then you start cleaning the rooms that your manager assigned to you on your board."
bad,"No one kept they word, couldn't trust management to keep they mouths shut they always told your business,  they would promise you a position, give it to you and still except you to do more than one job position to benefit themselves and you still ended up with less ridden 40 hours. Even when they know you worked over time they lie and manipulate the time clock. BS job if you not apart  of the Hyatt itself they dont respect you  or your work ethics"
bad,Good place to work but management is horrible from the General manager to the housekeeping manager. They dont treat they employees right and the agm is rude.
bad,"The job will be OK if management was organized, structured, and modeled professionalism to their employees.  People play favorites and exude no real teamwork and togetherness no one wants to deal with coming to work every other day and the rules don’t apply to everyone."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management is poor and in my department non-existent . The pay is low, benefits are poor. Quality of service is terrible. I would not recommend this company."
bad,"Working for this company was hard, it affected me physically and emotionally. Management was not professional and there is a lot of turnover. I believe none of the employees that worked with me are still working there."
bad,Busy and uncertain tasks
bad,"Hyatt place needs more organization within the company, and more ways to show their employees that they appreciate them. The work environment can be very stressful as they rush workers daily. so they don't have to pay employees as much money."
bad,"If your looking for job stability this place is not for you. "
bad,"Ive been working for hyatt for a year and the favorites game is no joke ! I come to work to WORK not have a popularity contest. The leadership team will plot against you and make your life harr if they dont personally like you. If you can't trust the ""leaders"" who can you trust?  On the plus side I have pretty decent insurance through hyatt and the discounts on rooms are pretty cool as well . In other words apply for another brand spare yourself the nonsense and low pay."
bad,"My typical day at work is actually the ""Overnight"" shift. I've learned that I have more power than I thought, it's a self-realization."
bad,"Actually Hyatt Corporate is probably pretty good, it's just that my department was horrible.  The manager was horrible, and the staff were horrible.  Enough said."
bad,"Okay to work but management not very helpful when it comes to being short handed, Learned how to use shortcuts of cleaning , the hardest part was getting to guest to leave, the most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
bad,"For the most part my co-workers were just great. Having worked there for nearly 5 years many of them felt more like family."
bad,The fact that the majority of my time is spent alone working on reports
bad,"mucha ropa para lavar en un dia lleno"
bad,"Poor compensation for employees, benefits only for full time staff, poor management."
bad,i work for hyatt in atlanta not the same in park city seasonal hotel
bad,"Horrible management. Only two people working front desk, bar, and preparing food. Terrible service for the guests. Employees were very unhappy and always complaining."
bad,"required to play to many roles for minimum pay, dealing with alot of unforeseens. nothing in the hotel worked and the hotel was fairly new. it makes it harder to work."
bad,I loved it at first into manger start lying to me about moving up and messing with my money messing with your hours and letting ppl they favor do what they want to do taking money from guess taking supplies from the job
bad,Current management makes the job stressful by lack of being around and lack of resolving work issues internal and external.  Internal being employee issues and external like guest issues and complaints.
bad,"At first everyone is nice, but watch out! Most of them are talking behind your back. Nice to your face but will stab you in the back in a instant. You never advance even if you have seniority and deserve it. They take your PTO without asking & dont even pay you for it. Change the schedule without telling you either."
bad,"Hyatt place is a place that can be a very fun, learning and stress free place to work. The management team should work more together and not apart. There are other reasons as to why my stay was longer than expected."
bad,I would never recommend this company to work for. Very bad management . They don’t have respect for the staff. Housekeeping department is the worst one.
bad,"When I first started working at the Hyatt  I was excited and still am But its certain areas in management that are not being productive and its causing a lapse in training, And once bad habits become in bedded they are hard to break"
bad,"No room for advancement, lack of/poor management, far too low of pay and absolutely no benefits nor paid time off. Was threatened numerous times by guests and was even solicited to go back to a guest room!"
bad,Upper management would not control drama in the workplace.  The company did very much focus on their customers however did not place much care in treating their employees well.
bad,"Your experience and knowledge don't matter. You're a number in a file, not a person, and if you have an idea you're a terrible person for thinking. If you're a spineless doormat with no brain and willing to do what you're told without question-even if it is committing fraud at the general manager's direction-then this place is for you."
bad,"The general manager was too cavalier when it came to monitoring policy implementation.I was told that I could not eat in the breakroom by the housekeeping supervisor in which she threaten me.  I reported and nothing was done.  Also, I was sexually harassed with no consequences."
bad,the manager did not know how to use the system therefore could not and would not help us.No room for growth. VERY short staffed. I loved my coworkers but this job was very overwhelming at times.
bad,"En mi opinión acerca de esta empresa y lo que viví en particular en ella, durante mi estancia en ella pude experimentar un trabajo con demasiada presión, por los mismo aprendí a descubrir mis habilidades en manejo de control de situaciones adversas, al igual que pude vivir de igual manera el poco interés en personas que se esmeran y comprometen con el trabajo y favoritismo que se tiene hacia ciertas personas que no se esfuerzan lo suficiente, la dirección pienso que es buena pero las personas que tiene a su alrededor de cierto modo opaca lo bien que esta la misma, en el caso de colegas como se menciona antes muchos terminan yéndose por el poco interés y reconocimiento en ellos, la parte más difícil a sido tener que lidiar con palabras duras y amenazas por parte tanto del personal como de huéspedes, y lo que puedo destacar de ella es que Hyatt en general es una muy buena marca, pero el manejo que se tiene al menos en este no es el adecuado para  que los valores de la empresa reluzcan y sea una empresa linda para trabajar como lo son otros hyatt en el mundo."
bad,"the worse environment to work, managers do not have respect for employees and there is not any REAL HUMAN RESOURCES to speak with."
bad,"The Hyatt needs help in the organization category. Working in an unorganized setting can make the job very hectic. Being a server can already be a challenging job by itself, but when you are constantly under staffed and one person has to do the job of 3 others as well as their own it makes for a very stressful work environment."
bad,"I am obviously not happy there, hence why I am wanting to move on."
bad,Worst employer ever. Uncomfortable environment. You must sacrifice your personal life just to stay employed. Employee perks are rarely honored. Schedule posted 2 days before the next week begins so that nothing can be planed outside of work. Hyatt work environment is codusive for the success of pychopaths.
bad,Laid back environment but too much responsibilities for one person to only be getting paid $10.25. Too much work not enough money.
bad,"There were weeks I worked 70+ hours, then weeks I didn't work AT ALL!"
bad,If u want raises or growth in a company don't pick this Hyatt was told I would get a raise at 90 days from both interviewing managers 10 months later still nothing...no one to help if u need it so u better figure it out fast oh and best believe if u choose wrong u will get the write up....so get ready for the same position and pay rate untill u get ready to leave...
bad,"It is not a fun place to work, there are a lot of favoritism, and EEOC should really get involved due to discrimination and cultural differences."
bad,"When I started working at the one in Sandy Springs, my GM gave her resignation and I applied. Never received feed back on my interview nut a new manager started."
bad,"Very poorly ran , no structure and constant turn over , staff not held accountable basically the majority of the staff work when they feel like it and new people get worked harder with poor training"
bad,It is my opinion that Hyatt Baha Mar has some of the worst managers i have ever seen in my career of over 15 years. They are uncaring towards their staff and unprofessional. They need training more than the staff. Most of the staff have not had a raise since the hotel opened almost 3 years ago.
bad,"Franchise company, didn’t budget well and overworked. Couldn’t even take a vacation, understaffed. Staff was great and everyone worked well together and had fun at work even though we were understaffed."
bad,The hyatt is very unorganized and cant keep employees. If you are a good employee they will load you down with work and days on the schedule and leave the slackers with nothing at all which is totally unfair.
bad,"Terrible managers...the company crestline is awful & went through about 5 general manager in a year."
bad,"Overall a bad time. The Hyatt management cared more about what they wanted vs what Starbucks wanted. Poor communication between that, and no one was trained well enough to properly care for the store itself. It was constantly stressful, hiring people that didn't even really want to be there. Paid poorly especially for that amount of work they asked you for."
bad,Stay to yourself. Only stay until something better comes along. It's not worth the stress. Oh and they don't clean urine stained mattresses properly. Everyone there gossips including the managers. Don't tell them your business because they will tell someone else.
bad,"Hyatt as a company is great, I just think that the location I was at was not the best. The management was awful. They would quit every 6 months because could not handle it. Making it hard for us because we would have to keep adjusting to new rules with different personalities coming in."
bad,"Awful place to work. You receive your weekly schedule 2 days -sometimes only 1 day- before the beginning of the work week, so it's impossible to make plans. To transfer to another department, your direct managers must approve it, so if you are in a job that is particularly hard to fill, forget it, they'll never approve it."
bad,"We were usually short staffed,so our typical 8 hour shift could tend to turn into 10 hour one. The cleaning board could range between 12-27 rooms per housekeeper. Management only cared about filling the rooms to make their numbers without any concern of the work it would be on the staff. They would have me work 3 positions sometimes, and when I would speak up for myself my word would never get heard or mean anything. My experience here has made me learn how cruel a work establishment can be. The hardest part of this job was trying not to take home all the negative energy my work had animating around them home with me. The best part of this job was meeting people from around the world. The guest made work worth it."
bad,"Management was bad, favoritism was very big at the time that I worked there, and didn't help the job situation. Communication was very bad also between staff and management. No meetings were ever held ."
bad,"I really have nothing good to say about the Hyatt.My day started off getting my cart organized then we were given our assignment for the day.,then off to clean rooms and make beds."
bad,"It may be the hospitality industry, but I personally found the way of working and managing people really poor in the particular property I worked at. There was a lot of rigidness when it came to culture. It wasn't for me"
bad,The associates working here can be trying at times. There's no room for advancement and the pay is not equal at all. The Management team is not as responsive to associate requests or even complaints. They seem to be more focused on the bottom line. It becomes very tiring at times to work in this hotel
bad,shuttle driver and houseman drive guests to mohegan sun and maintain hotel cleanliness standards assist in laundry dept as needed and strip rooms as needed
bad,"typical work day: checking in guests, assisting the AGM with tasks, serving guests at bar and kitchen, responding to guest situations, money handling, rolling business days"
bad,"It is a very demanding job. If you have kids that will make it even more difficult to work there. There are no shift bids so what ever schedule you choose in the beginning is the one that you are stuck with. You only can miss 6 days out of an year. They are very strict with you staying on the phones as if you are a robot. This job is not for everyone but the benefits are good. Management will tell you anything, throw you on a final in a heart beat. Not the most secure job on the planet but if you want to make a money temporarily then this is the job for you. If you have no kids, family, or life this the job for you as well."
bad,"A day at work started with me checking if everything was at the right place or if it something needed be completed in order to be prepared for the service. Furthemore, during my shift I had to deal with the bad and unprofessional behaviour of collegues. As a result, I continiously tried to encounter and fight against their cunning actions and their defamations about me, both as a professional and as a human. In addition, the management team was a supporter for their actions and in some cases they were a part of this. Their target was to damage me, my great perfomance, my reliability, my dignity and eventually force me to live. "
bad,"Absolutely feudal environmemt with department heads all seeking to damage there peers "
bad,"They Make you do everything in the hotel for less pay, management are not well trained, the most enjoyable part of my job are the people i work with. The company do not care for their employees many have already left to other jobs"
bad,"far from my home"
bad,"Extremely high turnover rate for management"
bad,The work environment is not one that fosters involvement nor provides you the tools or motivation to be your best. Issues in the work place as it pertains to minimum standards either go unaddressed or take entire quarters to be brought back to standard.
bad,"I'd have to say overall I would not recommend working here. While working on first shift your only aloud a 30 minute lunch no matter the amount of hours your working and on 3rd shift your not aloud any breaks the only shift that you would get 2 15s and a 30 is 2nd shift. Even so most people working there have a frantic schedule alot of times they will schedule someone to work til midnight and have them come back in at 6 or 7 am and on occasion they'll have them come in at 4:30 am after getting off at midnight, leaving their employees exhausted for their next shift. There really isn't any moving up in the company either most of the time anytime a position opens up they will hire outside of the company to fill it. Management at the location was as well very impersonal they don't treat their employees well. On several different occurrences when employees were sick and throwing up at work they were told that they had to stay and finish their shift including the employees working in the kitchen with the food. I feel every job you work is going to have something you don't like about it, but the only thing I can say that I enjoyed about this job is the actual work itself it was very easy to complete job tasks also on that note to much down time and not enough to keep you busy for a full work day unless it happens to be a busy day."
bad,Hyatt is strict to their rules and regulations.  Not much opportunity for movement unless you are already in management.
bad,I'm sure this would be a lovely property to work at...if you liked watching a place burn down around you.  Between constant management shifts and terrible communication the only upside is the day does eventually have to end.
bad,"I worked hard for Hyatt Regency Pier Sixty Six for 2 and half years doing doubles and dedicating a lot of my time, blood, sweat and tears literally. This job has no structure the upper heads dont to much talk to you unless they feel like it or when they need something. I went through 3 GMs and 3 front office Managers in 2 and half years. Their is a lot of turn overs and almost in every department at this hotel.  A lot of work for very little money. Managers are incapable of dealing with conflict. And  yeah theirs favorites if your not one of theirs, they'll throw you out before you can say the word HAPPY. Ask a lot of questions and think on it first before deciding to work for this company."
bad,"Typical day at work begins helping in the lobby, then reading reports, balancing inventory, working with revenue manager to make sure we are priced well against our competition to sell.  Then start the day with contact made to current accounts, then cold calls to possible new accounts.  Sales did well to balance all angles with the workload but was lacking in support from the operations side to make sure the customer comes first.  "
bad,"Good place to work and a good company- the management/co-workers are the main problem. Long hours standing on your feet, raises aren't the best,  and not much appreciation for hard work."
bad,"Bartenders have to haul over 100 lbs of liquor everyday to set up the bar. Management announces their break period, however, does not let employees take regular required breaks when business is slow."
bad,"Don't have the supplies to run a good valet"
bad,Working in the hospitality field can be a rewarding wonderful thing if you get into the right place. At the location I'm at the upper management  team are very unprofessional. My co-workers are younger people that needs work on their people friendly skills but as I said they are young people and they are learning. The hardest part of my job is not having the or running out of the supplies I need to do my on a daily basis. The most enjoyable thing about being the breakfast manager is meeting & talking to the guest(s) during breakfast. Because I am a people person it's nice to know that I help get their day started:).
bad,was glad to leave i only worked there for a few days as part as my college course
bad,"Stand on your feet all day, wait 3 hours to urinate, be treated like a disposable person. WAY too many corporate rules and stuffy people who lie to the tourists. I lasted 3 days before I had enough of their insanity."
bad,"Though I felt as if there was no place for me to grow, I still enjoyed meeting new people and learned a little more techniques in the spa."
bad,Job refused to give me my half hour break when I worked over 8 hours 5-6 days a week.
bad,if your looking for a unfair workload and a management that know no boundary's then look no further than hyatt sacramento
bad,"The saying goes, if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say it at all. I'll stay silent. Thank them for the job opportunity though. To be honest EVERY business needs to work on finding the good workers versus the non, lazy workers. Managers know they have these type of workers but choose to keep them to save money or less paper work. I have no idea what it is, but I can go on for days."
bad,Environment not so good. Cant stay longer. A lot of conflicts. Many want to easy escape and blame others. Not happy working here. Not suggested to work here.
bad,"Hyatt in NY isn’t great at any of the properties. All managers are unhappy, overworked, and underpaid. It’s a small circle so everyone knows eachother and no one is happy. There are few to no growth opportunities. The overall morale is very low. They do not take care of their employees."
bad,"Senior leadership needs to follow the Hyatt processes and procedures. "
bad,"I was hired as an Administrative Assistant at the Hyatt and immediately fell in love with the motto of “we care for people so they can be their best.” I left the company feeling like I was scum of the earth by one of my three managers who was the Event Planning Manager. Within two months from the start of my employment, The Hyatt let go of the Event Sales Manager which I worked directly under. From the date of his termination forward I was given the job tasks of the Event Sales Manager without proper training, compensation, or recognition. I would recommend that they find adequate replacements immediately and not put the tasks of a Manager position on an hourly employee. My General Manager of this property went above and beyond to constantly keep the Hyatt motto alive and make sure that things were as they should be. I hope that all Managers there can keep that going since this is the Florida Keys and living on a tiny island we keep the “One Human Family” motto also alive."
bad,"When I  first started working at Hyatt almost 12 years ago it was a great place to work. Regular employees had the same right to voice their opinion as management.  Management has changed, gotten much younger and seems they are trying to push older employees out. Hence why I am looking elsewhere."
bad,"You are hired for a specfic title but you do the work of 45 people which a salary is alotted for.aimbridge is actually who i worked for and my front office mgr forced me to walk out .Mental anquish,unecessary writeups most unwarrented."
bad,"Provide service to guests, greet everyone with a smile, treat co-workers and guest with utmost respect."
bad,"I loved the job but the assistant manager was rude and just jumped on you without asking questions. This company was a nice place to work, but when it came down to it I just couldnt deal with the asst. Manager."
bad,"Very stressful and busy environment, but the people here are awesome. Short staff on a daily basis but everyone works together if anyone needs help. Overworked employees. How can we get the most out of our colleagues while they’re at work? How can we cut down on labor to the bare minimum even if it means employees are stressed and overworked."
bad,guests are mostly always wanting something for free or always complaining about parking other than that the place is ok to work for but the team mangment needs improvment there alot of favortism and no room for growth unlee your part of the favorites
bad,"I was there for 16 month,so with the hotel just opening,there was jus TO MUCH turnover. The staff argument managers not stepping up not wanting to get their hands dirty just overall bad management"
bad,"As a doorman, you are required to stand within the duration of your shift, which can be 8 hours straight."
bad,"Unless you're a manager, prepare to work long hours with little pay and little benefits. Hours get cut during the winter time because the workflow is a heads in bed type ordeal, so once people stop coming to events later in the year so does your hours and your money. Don't make this your primary job unless you're a manager here, they take care of the managers, not the hourly workers."
bad,"They cut your hours/days down during slow periods, and then tell you  that you need to meet your 30 hours a week to keep your insurance?  Um hello.... I wouldn't need to make up my hours, if you didn't scam us on hours during slow periods.  Looking for some other company ASAP to work for."
bad,Loaded a lot of work onto individuals without a care of needing more employees. Good place to meet people from different states or even countries. Close location to the disneyland resort.
bad,"Without proper management, the people in the office act or behave however they want to behave. Negative atmosphere, unhappy employees."
bad,"When I was there, I did prep work, cooking, serving dishes to the customers and cleaning the kitchen."
bad,If your looking for a decent paying job this is not the place. Your required to work late into the night and often expect to work a turnaround shift the next day.
bad,"When they hired you you’re not working in one position that you applied if you’re hired in the front desk you need to work in the kitchen too like dishwashing,busser & preparing food for guest orders the general manager keep walking around checking if you’re doing your job that to make sure not just standing around"
bad,The sous chef/evening manager is garbage to me!  He had me do the majority of the work.  He tried to pick on me more than anyone else.  The waiters & waitresses are beyond rude to the cooks.
bad,"I don't think I was there long enough to give an accurate review of the establishment. However, from my time there I can say that it has its perks if you are willing to deal with a fast paced and (at times) stressful work environment."
bad,"Front desk night auditor position multitasks between checking in and out guest,  taking orders and cooking. Wait time for guest may be long at times due to only one staff on duty."
bad,"Stressful; reason why when I worked at the HYATT they had me training with a woman that spoke Spanish. We did a lot of work for a little bit of money, the house men didn't do nothing to help"
bad,"Poor Management, no chance of moving up no matter how hard you work or how willing you are to take on more work. Expect to do everything on your own with little to no help."
bad,"Just to sum it up.. I was in the middle of a shift one time and my sister called the manager to inform her that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital, my manager responded first by giggling and then saying, ""Ok soooo..."" He/She was absolutely heartless and inconsiderate of other people."
bad,Everything at the Hyatt is wrong. Management is more concerned about makijg money than making sure there employees are happy. Its a very cutthroat business that doesn't appreciate there workers.
bad,They started to cut work hours resulting that I have to file for partial unemployment.  This also resulted to the cancellation of our health insurance benefits.
bad,"Management is very poor and only interested in making the last dollar they can. Have zero interest in employee welfare and know they can get tons of refugees / immigrants to do entry level work , so constant hiring and firing is a norm. "
bad,I didn't like this job because the management isn't the best. I worked in the kitchen and I was all alone most of the time. I didn't have help from anyone so it was very stressful for me to make every guest happy and get them what they needed.
bad,Lack of communication and trust between employees and management. The assignment keep increasing but the pay stays the same. Employees who have been there longer have insecurities with their positions.
bad,The short time spent in not enough to rate the organisation. Its a tough industry so no work life balance. Salary is not good. But there are enough growth opportunities.
bad,"Trabajar en hyatt santiago es una forna de escuela donde aprendes a realizar varios tipos de trabajo dentro de la organizacion, a veces dan oportunidades para cambiar de departamento y crecer profesionalmente."
bad,Very quiet place but plenty to do when it comes to cleaning. I took it upon myself to get things done other then just my job. I had some training in night auditor but it did not go very well.  Remodeling the hotel caused a lot of issues with guests rates and plus changes in management within Housekeeping every few weeks was what made my job the hardest.
bad,I help pull the cars for the customers as well as park them. The environment was a fast paced place to work at times but I managed to fulfill all my duties.
bad,"Since I was a full time student and worked full time, it was really hard to balance everything out, especially back to back turn over shifts from night audit to evening shift on school nights. Management wasn't willing to work more with my schedule, when I had initially stated that my school comes first. "
bad,"Hours were rough but that was to be expected working on the morning shift but on more than a couple occasions I was expected to stay an extra hour or four to help clean up excessive waste or prepare catering for a meeting. I was told I was hired as part-time but it wasn't until recently, when I checked on my job profile that I was hired as full-time which means on average I was working six to eight hours a day, five times a week.That would accumulate roughly to $300 a week, which is not a livable wage."
bad,This job started out as wonderful and something I enjoyed very much. New upper management came in the picture and turned the place upside down. It was no longer the job I enjoyed. they turned all there 'All Star' team members away. Very sad.
bad,"Used to be best company to work for . Afther they become public company it become Money hungry animals . Employee become last important on scale MONEY MONEY MONEY sad . I stil have guest that call me"
bad,"Hyatt place would be a great place to start a career in cooking. Not so great if you are an experienced cook. Breakfast is most of their business(like most hotels). They have a small bar type menu that they use all day. Nothing to it."
bad,"Changing and restructuring every 2 years. The work environment is getting worse and worse."
bad,"Where to begin?  The GM is cool.  Director of operations is feared by most everybody, generally everyone walked on egg shells when he was around.  HR thinks they ruled all.  Manager is inept and generally avoided confrontation.  Supervisors are mostly cool until you tried to talk to them about your current situation and what you needed then it just reverted back to them and how they have not promoted.  Coworkers, way cool, as most coworkers are in this business, as has been my experience.  Expect zero time off as they love to deny any sort of time off within the first year.  Overall, don't make any plans, they own you.  Requests for specific days off in the course of a normal week, impossible.  One more thing,  the uniforms SUCKED!!!!  Not even remotely appropriate for the location and climate.  Other than that, it was a beautiful property to work at and I very much enjoyed serving the vast variety of guests that stayed there as well as working with AWESOME coworkers on a daily basis."
bad,"i had a very bad experience working with this company."
bad,"Job was very interesting and hands on."
bad,Most of the time understaffed and get no help from fellow employees or managers. There is  no flow of communication. Money is great and benefits are great but in the end don't seem to make it worth it.
bad,"The company/job is just terrible. The management doesn't know what they're doing, there is lack of communication, there is no organization amongst the departments."
bad,Working at Hyatt you are commitmented to providing high standard of care and concern to all guests. The co-workers are awesome!
bad,The perks of being able to stay at the resorts is the only part of this company that makes you stay. It's a small company environment so there are a lot of management clicks and they are not all pleasant to be around.
bad,"Is sad that the management do not know what they are doing , but is good to have a nice co-workers that know what to do and are eager to learn more."
bad,Sehr monotone. Keine Stimmung. Zu viel Stress wegen Managment. Sehr wenig bezahlt... Aber nur 38 Stunden/Woche. Möglichkeit in einem Hyatt Hotel kostenlos zu schlaffen.
bad,Underpaid and over worked. Management was not keeping up with Salaries in other field and lost a lot of employees as a result. 
bad,"*Great location"
bad,Do not recognize people that are qualified or are able to train people to their recomendations . I was able to organize the bar above their codes.
bad,Need to work on management skills.....need to show more respect to ALL employees.
bad,"I once loved this company but as I've moved up I've become more and more disappointed.  I cannot speak for all Hyatt's but the operations side of the Hyatt Regency Denver only has a handful of strong and caring managers.  There are some who really want to contribute to the growth and advancement of their employees, while others are clearly not very team oriented.  If you are looking to advance at this property, stay away from the housekeeping department (at least for the near future).  There are one or two managers who are very knowledgable but the rest are incredibly passive aggressive and impatient.  They demean and demoralize their team with a smile on their face.  Some managers are only there because they come from a well respected property. Their leadership skills are futile and their scarce contributions are rarely positive.  Unfortunately, if you come from a well known property you will most likely be hired."
bad,"I didn't mind this job as a college student, but they did expect me to work 35+ hours a week while also being a full-time student so that was rough. The work wasn't hard, you just have to be confident in your customer service skills and not waver when guests complain or get upset."
bad,This company has no consistency. The turnover rate for management is so high that nothing ever gets done. At least once a year someone tries to change everything about the F&B department and then leaves half way through. Management seems to care more about climbing the corporate ladder than the employees or guests themselves. Staff is constantly asking for basic things to do their jobs and even that's too much to ask.
bad,"Muy buena compañía, puntual hecha para servir al invitado"
bad,"if you want to be have a job where you do three task for little pay then work here. This job is not the best and is very tiring. Being a cook, front desk agent and bartender is terrible within its self"
bad,"Un dia tipico en Hyatt es correr todo el tiempo ya que todos los Galary Host atendemos Front desk, concierge, grab n go, la barra y a la vez preparamos comida para los hueses.  Aprendi mucho del sistema oprah pero mas porque me auto enseñe, aprendi muchas cosas maravillosas de los huespes y compañeros. Ambiente de trabajo pobre, hostil, explotador, siempre con poco personal y muy poca asistencia de los gerenciales. Gerencia con poco o ningun conocimiento en la mayor parte de las areas.  Excelente area para trabajar si la gerencia se interesara mas en los empleados y en los huespes y no solo en hacer dinero.  Es lamentable que para ellos sea mas importante la cantidad que la calidad.  Muy dificil poder dar un excelente servicio con muy poco apollo.  Sugerencia : Oficinas de personal o Relaciones humanas si no se puede en cada hotel por lo menos uno en la Isla ya que Hyatt no tiene HR en Puerto Rico y los Gerente General Se encargan de eso tambien sin el conocimiento necesario. La parte mas dificil era ver esperar a los huespedes por la falta de personal y/o porque estabas en otras de las areas que teniamos que atender, ver como unos se molestaban y otros te defendian ante ellos dejandoles saber que di no veian que estabas sola corriendo todo.  Lo mas que me gusto era la gente (huesped y algunos compañeros). El lugar de trabajo tambien es muy bello ese hotel y haber podido estar ahi durante su construccion, limpiarlo y organizarlo para apertura para recibir a nuestro huespedes fue muy satisfactorio, el ser parte del regreso de Hyatt a Puerto Rico."
bad,The job overall wasn’t terrible. Once you understood what you were supposed to do it’s was fine . I worked there for 4 months and never was offered any benefits. It has a tendency to get super busy on the weekends. management wouldn’t keep up with housekeeping in the morning to make sure the rooms were ready for check in’s at 3pm. Due to the lack of rooms not being clean and available guests were often upset and wanting discounts that we couldn’t provide. Management also wouldn’t work with my availability when I had to get a second job they would not adjust my hours so I could come in an hour later and stay until midnight resulting in me always being late to work and I brought up the subject many times with my manager and nothing was changed so you are stressed out due to the lack of rooms clean or being under staffed and getting a rush at 10pm and it’s obly you and one other person working checking people in and making food and manning the bar it’s just a lot to ask of a person without the proper pay to do it most of the people that worked there had two jobs to survive
bad,The managers I had here were the absolute worst I have ever had in my life. The pay seems okay bc I got paid 10$$ but the job is so stressful and fast paced that the pay is basically nothing for the work you do.
bad,"Management ...needs to work on there compassion ..for there employees who are grieving for the lost a family ...instead of pretending they actually do care.and even.telling you if you need anything or more time to recover from your loss of a love one.....they dont care at all  after a month "
bad,"loved working here at first , now its just a place I go to work. not fun anymore. do way too many things in there to get paid basically nothing. managers don't care. hardest part of my job is coming in there and having to be pulled in 10 directions at once because coworkers don't help. their is absolutely no team working in there on certain shifts/ when you work with certain people."
bad,"O departamento que trabalhei era péssimo. Spa. A gerente não tem formação universitária e não gosta de funcionários que tem, com medo de perder sua posição. Departamento fraco, sem chance de crescimento. Salário, fora do mercado. Muitas exigências, trabalho aos finais de semana e nenhum reconhecimento. "
bad,You work until everything is finished so there are days you work for like 4 hours others day you can work a 12 hours shift and I never had a weekend off.
bad,This job was a temporary work experience .And i only worked in the kitchen as a cleaner most often.this was a slow job i did not hqve much to do .i like a full time job to keep me going .
bad,"At times it was a very satisfying place to be. Beautiful place! The management did not really make you feel very appreciated. The work was very demanding , but expected. The employee cafeteria was a great perk! The benefits were expensive."
bad,Bar area is visited by a nice group of guests. Coworkers are congenial. Corporate office makes decisions without speaking to all involved with decision.
bad,"It was a really great place to work at the first 10 years i was there, then it went downhill when They started Hiring Young people right out of College with out proper training to be Managers and nothing was getting done on 2 nd shift.. people writing in their times and leaving early etc. Noone gettting the work done."
bad,No comment  didn't like the way they handled issues between coworkers. Picked favorites laundry was difficult with the way they had their laundry set up. You had to pick threw dirty linen an separate towels from sheets
bad,I currently work here and I'm currently looking for new employment opportunities... management sweaps all reported incidents regarding house keeping supervisor very poor professional environment
bad,Not good mangers at all love cleaning but hard working for bad people I worked there for 2 years place start going down hill once mangers changed from housekeeper to manger
bad,I thought working on a golf course would be fun. I couldn't have been more wrong. The person who hired me left for a different job and the new boss was a jerk who cared about looking good to his bosses and blamed everything that went wrong on the people who worked beneath him. I almost passed out from heatstroke and was accused of being lazy. Often I would have to work until 10 pm at night and then have to come back and open at 5 am the next day because that's how the schedule was written up.
bad,"A typical day of work included customer relations, food preparation, transporting, and cleanliness. Most of my duties were self managed. Good cultural environment. Hardest part of my job was keep up with customer demands when you have two people doing the work of five. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the satisfaction of the quest when you are able to meet there needs."
bad,"position requires multiple varied tasks which were hard to keep up with. low pay for the requirements of the jobs. stressful negative environment, not very clean either."
bad,"Days were generally busy. As a receptionist you are also in charge of assist with the bar and restaurant. There was no training done for those so it felt like you were just thrown into it. Management was terrible and all over the place not leaders, but bosses. Appears that theirs ideals were conflicting and a lot of in-fighting between them, and they took it out on the workers."
bad,Working here I was exposed to the wants and needs of the senior citizen population.  It was a challenge to provide good tasting food that met all the dietary needs of the population
bad,"Hyatt Place Tampa Busch Gardens is a horrible place to work. The management team is the worst in the business. It is only this Hyatt Place. I have had other Managers in the past at this property that have been amazing. The current General Manager has no idea what she is doing. She is uses everyone as a scapegoat when something goes wrong. She does not even know how to operate anything at the front desk. She is the worst manager I have ever had. "
bad,"Working here is all about routine. Set up and break down everyday is extensive, must bus table and cater to customers who decide to take part in the fresh omelet station. This job while being decent pay for what you are doing is up and down and the management doesn't handle last minute changes very well. the staff for breakfast is also rushed out before lunch time because the kitchen is taken over by restaurant staff that has to open for lunch."
bad,Greenspoint was going through many changes with new management every few weeks. Everything was broken including the elevators. Management was stealing products including new dishes
bad,"I actually enjoyed this job, it was a job that kept me busy and on my toes. I enjoy meeting, and talking to people from all different backgrounds. I still enjoyed the job after they changed managers. Yet at the same time I didn't feel safe to come to the managers about different situations that would occur."
bad,there are many employees there who are unprofessional. they like to get involved in work drama and sometimes are the ones who make the drama at work. things started out well for me but after a while i started to get treated very differently from the lady i was working under (kitchen manager). Some of the employees like to talk about each other behind their back. there is no sort of team work going on its just like they all hate each other
bad,"management does not care if you have a life, but they make sure they have weekends off, and get their special days off. worked their for a little time. very short staffed"
bad,"I worked at the Hyatt Place Nashville Airport for sixteen months and had a so so experience. I have a bachelors degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management."
bad,"fun work place , i learned how to communicate more to the client. understanding management. workplace culture is making clients happy so they're coming back . hardest part of the job is clients not communicating well. assisting clients is the enjoyable part of the job"
bad,I had a very good experienced with the Hyatt although it was just a year but i had the opportunity to learn a lot especially with regards to working as a team. The management is always looking after the employees' welfare. Workplace is very conducive and people I worked with are very helpful and accommodating. The most enjoyable part of the job was I get to meet different people from different walks of life. It was worth it.
bad,"Employer doesn't really bother."
bad,Been working for a while there and I found out that some employer have really bad manners and not really a people person the only thing that was good about this is the customer that stay there
bad,"Hyatt Centric is acuatly  a franchise hotel who bears a Hyatt name. The overall is lack of management, particularly the Food&Beverage I worked for. At the beginning I came in, we did not even have a manager nor chef."
bad,The Management held many positions causing job dissatisfaction.  Managers were expected to work way more than 40 hours.  There was no work/life balance.
bad,"Worked with Hyatt Bangalore MG Road for more than a year.          "
bad,Great place to work and build a team. Great place to meet new people and share in their vacations. It gets very busy at times and must be able to work in a fast pace environment.
bad,"Hyatt Park has a really rough demographic of children. Almost all children are on free and reduced lunch, and come from single family homes. Their backgrounds are not always pretty. But, it is not always the children that made this place difficult to work at. The administration would change year to year and just kept getting worse. There is little parent involvement and lack of support from the administration. You were definitely flying solo while teaching here. Most of the other staff members were really negative as well. The building itself is nice, but once really into that environment, you will see that it is toxic for both the students and the teachers that are there because they care. It's a really unfortunate circumstance."
bad,hyatt place is a franchise so not owned by hyatt. pay was ok but the management was horrible and the work load was way too much for the wage that we made.
bad,I worked at the Hyatt for a year and a half and my one year raise was .07$. Despite excellent work ethic and commitment to the position there is no recognition once so ever. Employees cycle through faster than the customers. Terrible place to work if you want to gain good experience or further your career. Management is childish and often very degrading to staff.
bad,"I don't like my current working place. There is no room to further my skills. Since I have customer service knowledge and experience, I believe that I deserve better career."
bad,Manager is terrible and coworkers are catty. They don't work with your availability. They don't allow any piercings and they told me my hair was too blonde and I would need to dye it darker or they would send me home. They also told me I needed to grow my hair out because they preferred I wear it in a bun. They have you wear pant suits that are an awful material.
bad,Working at hyatt was the worst experience I had ever had. Management for sure has favorites and does not properly train their employees. Instead they are yelled at for making one little mistake . The Staff you work with in the exception of one or two Is horrible . And their behind the scenes standards about gossiping about their guests . And having a personal life is for sure out of the question. I worked every holiday and 8+ days in a row. Overall if you're thinking about applying at this hotel find something else .
bad,"Closing shifts to an open shift all the time. I was not able to get a lot of sleep. Was not allowed to put in a time off request more than 2 months prior to the dates I needed off."
bad,"In two years this property has been through 3 GM's, and 4 Controllers Budgeting and Forecasting has been challenging, frustrating and based on fictitious numbers generated by the sales team.  There has been no enforcement of Department heads adhering to budgets, of following purchasing policies.  These actions have caused every controller to resign, leaving me to ""hold down the fort"" until replacements have been found. This has left me with a feeling that the property may close or change hands soon."
bad,a very nice hotel. management isn't so great. maybe that comes along with being a new hotel. hopefully it works it's self out and be a great business to work for.
bad,"we have long and unsociable hours of work, i learned to take extra cate dealing with people, management is absent, co owners are your hole diggers, i can't rely on making sense of some co workers and the management. exercising and teaching."
bad,Big chain in universe...Nice facilites for employee food & beverage etc...Supportive team...Great place to work ....Perfect management team
bad,"buena gente"
bad,"No consideration for the difficulty of the overnight shift employee's. Schedule 10 overnight shifts in a row and split days off. If you ever worked overnights you would understand that it is completely different from day, afternoon, evening shifts. If they don't take you seriously then why should you take this job seriously. No respect at all."
bad,"Let me start with the hardest part of the job. It is the fact that most of the time, I had to attend to three to five people at the same time and all of them wants to prioritized first, the sad part is the one who is I am always prioritizing is the only one who evaluated me but he was not satisfied with my work. Another hard part is the fact that I live far from work so I always get short on budget causing me to be absent from work. My co-workers are great."
bad,"Fun line staff"
bad,Starting the carrier through supporting subordinates to prepare their day to day preparation. And organising  their utensils & help them to maintain the cleanliness.
bad,I had a great time being a valet(out sourced company) but the management was horrible to deal with. I was able to learn a little about the nice cars I drove and a little about hospitality but theirs not much to learn after that. Movement inside the company is none existent. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and indecisive management. The best part was the people you meet and the cars you get to park.
bad,"New challenge"
bad,"I moved from another state as a server from about a year and a month of experience. Initially applied for a barback position but made it known that I wanted to be a bartender. I was told that I would be moved up to bartender once I showed improvement. After about three months and coming from a U.S. military background, I picked up product knowledge faster than expected from supervisors. After asking an assistant supervisor to be considered for an open bartending position, I was told that because I had only been at the Hyatt for three months I was not being considered for a bartending position even though I was pulling shift for bartenders on their days off or breaks. I had to find out from another department that they were hiring someone with less experience and ZERO barbacking experience to do a job I was being pruned for. Unbelievable. As soon as I find a better job I'm gone. I will never work for this company again."
bad,"Obtained a list of vacant rooms needing immediate cleaning and a list of prospective checks-outs and scheduled the cleaning of theses rooms. Colllected and disposed of the trash, Cleaned floor surfaces by sweeping, mopping, scrubbing or vacumming."
bad,Worked there many years with many changes and adjustments. Met many good people and worked with some good people. The hospitality industry as a whole is a wonderful thing.
bad,"1997 to 2002 – Director of Food & Beverage - Hyatt Hotels – Hyatt Regency Newport, Rhode Island"
bad,I did not like working there. Not very friendly enviroment in the Salon at all.Not very good work ethics and not very professional at all.
bad,"Walk the property making sure everything's in order and up to hotel standards, check and the maintain pool area on a daily, attend morning meeting to discuss today's agenda and whats expected for the day and taking care of all guest request in a timely manner."
bad,I've started with banquet here it's For people without kidsdue the the hours they want us to work. I never received a raised after 8 months. I know some folks have been there for years with no raised. The Management sucks maybe they'll have better soon. Some perks small discount on rooms & 401k. This was one of the worst positions I've held
bad,"If you fall into the right click then you can advance quick; but if not it does not matter what work you do, your skills, work ethic, or intelligence you will not have a chance for advancement."
bad,"We were so understaffed that everyone was working 7 days a week about 10 hours a day. If you finished your rooms assigned, you had to go pick up someone else’s slack and finish there rooms too which isn’t fair at all. Got yelled at for not cleaning right but different people trained differently so there really shouldn’t be anything to get mad about. If they want certain things done a certain way, they should tech us it themselves rather than having an employee teach us there bad habits and short cut ways."
bad,Its a nice place for someone who's down on their luck to chill before figuring out something better to do. The duties of a hotel are easy but the work environment is toxic.
bad,"Unprofessionalism with management"
bad,"I really want to go back to working for this company, but they do not want me to work for them and thats ok! People were generally fake nice. The night life can be exciting."
bad,Dealing with upset customers is not easy when the hotel oversells most nights of the week so we have to walk. Lack of hierarchy amongst managers. Managers were not very resourceful when it came to training. Work life balance was not ideal because we were short staffed.
bad,They had very poor management because if you called off due to a family emergency they would still ask you to work. If you make a complaint to HR they will not do anything to help resolve the problem.
bad,This was a temporary assignment I was familiar with the systems so it was easy for me to be able to utilize my skill and perform my duties very well in this role.  I also was training and onboarding new staff members due to the fact that the company was going through a  transition at this time.
bad,The current management company is not qualified to run a full-service hotel. Not enough people at the corporate level to take care of things needed at the hotel level.
bad,Management says one thing and does another.  Not a true Hyatt but a franchisee. Claim to want change to implement policies and procedures but receive no support but actually receive scrutiny.
bad,I worked at Hyatt for 10 years and several different names and owners. Once Hyatt took over the place I loved to work at was no more. I dreaded going to work and you seemed like just a number there.
bad,Not a huge fan of my time spent there. That could be because it was franchise- I definitely like working for a corporately owned property better.  To each their own!
bad,"Management is pretty bad, needs a reconsideration. There have been too many issues regarding management and other staff. If it weren't for these managers I would not mind working here and I would be able to advance."
bad,"family oriented workplace. Everyone pitched in to make things flow smoothly, Great place to work you meet people from all over the world nice place to work. The pay should be more"
bad,"No strategy, no plans, too many group meetings with no decisions taken.. no employees one-to-one meetings. They change plans every 2 days and fire employees with no prior warnings!"
bad,"As Night Audit worked independently no supervision."
bad,"challenging position as  i had to receive file by fax and start make pricing then I had to escort the groups during their tours and be sure that everyone is satisfied and happy, gave me opportunity to be witty if i face any problem during tours and to lead groups in best way to offer best services."
bad,"This review is for the Hyatt I worked at in Reston VA only,I worked for the Hyatt almost 15 years. They change the policies according to the situation. They allow the Controller to talk and curse at you and he is not corrected. HR is unapproachable and when you do finally get to speak to them they don't do anything about it. That being said their benefits are the best around."
bad,in this company the management wanted me to be blunt with people and have little to say to them when they asked a question of any sort and when I would be nice and answer the question to not sound like a jerk I got into trouble
bad,Working there was fun I was young they trained me greatly in management techniques also you were able to stay free at Hyatt when on vacation went to Hyatt training classes in management  seem like 2 years
bad,"Great friendship among/between coworkers, bad treatment to employees from management. Management does not listen to employees when employees need something."
bad,"Like all places of employment, this place is no different when it comes to its politics. Some people are allowed a longer leash than others to make mistakes without it costing them their position. I understand security is held to a higher standard and accept it."
bad,"the people in each team are exceptional, but when you get changes and modifications, remodeling etc. it can get pretty challenging."
bad,The company can teach you a lot and you can get great professional experience. Though it will be a tough ride considering complicated work time and responsibility which does not reflect to the salary provided.
bad,"working with people on a daily basis is what I love to do, setting up weddings, conventions, meetings, etc seeing the joy on peoples faces when everything comes together is what made the job that much better.  However working at this Hyatt was very draining it was never the guest it was the people that I worked with the city of Cambridge is very small and working at the Hyatt there were a lot of favorites in the departments a lot of clicks a lot of crews and when you don't want to be apart of said groups that was an issue.  There was always a lot of drama within the banquet department"
bad,"I worked with HYATT place arboretum for two and a half years and management never seemed to get better. Although Hyatt is a very good brand to work with and has great benefits, it seems like management was constantly favoring employees and not taking the initiative to properly train new ones. The work load is a lot, you may find yourself extremely overwhelmed and understaffed. I only speak on this property alone, I have had wonderful experiences with other HYATT properties."
bad,"Overall good people to work with. Depending on General Manager, management can be good too.  Free lunch, dinner for staff."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of completing a check list when you first come in. Logging into your workstation and taking care of any guest request and resolving any issue while your on the clock. I learned how to be more open to any and every type of individual. Management micro manages you especially when your new and look for you to mess and will come down on you hard for any little thing so stay on top of your game. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone from the guest to management to my co-workers, but you have to realize you can't please everyone. The most enjoyable part was the location and the different type of people that I came in contact with throughout my time at the hotel."
bad,"I learned there how to work maximun hours and "
bad,"they where very hush about issues, knowone was held responsible when inappropriate stories where spread, no accountability with managment, young inexperienced group of managers, almost no regard for quality of work place."
bad,"Cannot compare Hyatt Regency Pune with brand Hyatt, working here is good but its only work work and work. Doesn't get time to enjoy the work, no appreciation and no growth opportunities"
bad,"A typical day at work is setting up for breakfast"
bad,Overall the Hyatt Place is the hardest job because of management.  They do not lead by example and often times will retaliate against you if you do not agree with them.
bad,"Front desk employees are not trained on the system. They are shown only the basic, the starting pay is good but you will not get 32 or40 hrs. If management keep their employees hours down they receive a bonus. If you desire to work there still be look for a better job, watch you're back employees you work with will throw you under to bus in a heart beat."
bad,Typical work day was checking guest in and out and making sure we exceeded their expectations.  Some guest were difficult but that's what you have to deal with when working in hospitality.
bad,"Great place to start a career, but need to find a company where I can have more responsibility and have room to grow within."
bad,The pay for the management jobs is really bad. I worked from 10 to 14 hours daily for 7 years. Very stressful and not rewarding. Upper management like GMs and Directors are lousy and not always have your back.
bad,If it was not for most of my co-workers I would have left long ago.  There were ups and downs as in all jobs.  But the amount of work that the staff was supposed to accomplish was absolutely ridiculous and the pay was unbelievably low for the amount of work that was done.  I got very sick during my employment with an illness usually found in the elderly but because of the amount of stress I had been experiencing my immune system was vulnerable and I got shingles.  Now I tried to call off because well it is a painful disease and is highly contagious.  I was informed they did not have enough staff and I actually worked everyday around our guests.  They were constantly understaffed and not hiring.  Training was poor.  I loved my managers but it was terrible place to work and I will never go back.
bad,the place is great due to variety of coworkers... but management brings down the atmosphere ....
bad,No comment about this family owned company.
bad,"Being a seasonal property, the hotel had a hard time recruiting employees. As a result, the hotel was understaffed and employees were pulled in multiple directions to keep the property running. I would constantly work more than 40 hours a week. I did not feel like I had the proper resources or training to do my job to the best of my abilities. There were several times that I brought my concerns up to the GM and they were ignored."
bad,Was a good place to work but had to many changes in managers and the rules changed with every change. Also they manage like children. Didn't know how to treat people. The job was night shift and after the managers left for the day the team would relax and the real work got done in all departments.The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers who didn't communicate with the night shift letting them know what was happening.
bad,Company has taken a very different direction than what they once had when it comes to employees and its brand standards
bad,"Every Hyatt is a bit different, but overall they provide good benefits, compensation and ability to move up quickly. The down side is they require you to work about 60 hours per week as a manager and sometimes more."
bad,This is guest oriented business and i do my best to provide an excellent experience for the guests at all levels. A typical day would be operating the kitchen and assisting guests.
bad,everyone is employe in the company everyone need to do same hours shift why some people have privileges just because of they are boss and and possition
bad,"I actual left my previous job, because I was offered a lead position at the Hyatt. Management is very bias, they like to hire their friends, and place them into positions of seniority....They themselves will throw their own staff (front desk) under the bus for a guest in order to avoid a bad review,   ironicly they would always blast the hotel any way. They based your entire work performance, on something (onething) they see in passing. I was assulted by a male employee and then treated as if I were the problem for ""making it a bigger deal"" than they felt neccessary."
bad,Algunos manager tienen provileguis con enpleados que no hacen el trabajo. No se valora a los empleados hay mucho racismo y discriminación
bad,"Hyatt is an Amazing Company to work for HOWEVER At the East Moline Location we worked under a management company who did not manage the hotel. The GM made sure we were constantly short staffed and overworked. No support from management and High turn over due to poor working conditions. Also lack of training onsite. Training consisted of watching videos and being expected to know what to do. High turn over in management also. If managed properly this could be an amazing place to work. Beautiful location, upscale hotel with lowscale pricing. Discounts at any Hyatt. Good pay, kind co-workers. Lots of room for growth.Multitasking is a must! "
bad,"There were a great deal of managerial issues and constant changes to security protocols. Many contractors were fired, even though work was done right."
bad,"Since i started working for Aimbridge after Hyatt sold the to them, they showed life that quickly went bad. they never really seem to get better for the area they where in lisle, Il. i learned to become better organized at the daily job list for 2 cooks to run the line, cook for the buffet, PD, production, pantry, pastry. the hardest part was learning to work without a Chef. the best part was i was able to get some very valuable experience"
bad,"We used to served the pretheater meals for the ICC but due to the opening of new restaurants the Aria restaurant just died, headchef by the time lack of ideas for new menus and ineficient in the kitchen only capable of doing banketing."
bad,"The F&B managers were terrible. They don't care about their employees. They are never around when you need them. There is no team work. The main manager is always in his office, one was fired and the other does room service and has no time for anything else. Definitely  the worst management I've ever worked for."
bad,it's okay.  Not many opportunities for advancement. It's a job that pay the bills. Management doesn't seem to care about sticking around.  They pretty much use the department as a stepping stone to move up the corporate ladder.
bad,Not much to say about this company I sure other locations are more professional and management does there job with out having to be told by employees and the sad thing is nothing ever gets done or resolved.... If you decided to work for Hyatt please work for Hyatt and not a bought Hyatt that just carry the name and  the Hyatt brand.
bad,"A typical day consisted of much walking of the grounds, responding to any/all emergency calls. Taking reports for guests, logging of lost/found property, assisting emergency personnel that responded to the grounds and patrolling via security vehicle the outer grounds of the buildings and parking area."
bad,"guest interaction is the best part of the job, the assistant managers were bad at day to day operations and the moral of the employees was bad. no opportunity for advancement within the property"
bad,"I started out here on the low rung of the totem pole, and now four years later i have yet to recive an oppurtunity to advance, no matter how much work i put in or how much management ""appreciates"" the extra hours i put in. advancement is not possible when all the management is switched out every couple of months or so."
bad,"As a bellman and can driver the job requirements were not demanding."
bad,"I wish this company was a really good place to work at but it's ultimate flaw is the type of management that generally manages its establishments. They are quite disrespectful, and at times quite racial."
bad,"Fast Paced, because there was always a group in-house."
bad,checking in guest in and out assited  with travel needs and entertainment while they where visting area. it was great to meet guest  from all over the world and hear about their world travel
bad,"Very good salaries and benefits, and no big pressure on the time."
bad,"A typical day at work was checking in and out customer answering in and out bound calls, collecting money working the bar for customer in the hotel. Making sure all customers were happy with their stay."
bad,Not really a great place to work. Management doesnt really make an effort to help balance personal life and work life. Expected to be a slave to the company.
bad,"Getting good experience along with new software information, exposure is also OK. Less salary as expected no expectation for growth in career. But as a Brand good place to work along with good team and supportive boss"
bad,Was hired by hiring manager (who apparently did not notify food/beverage manager beforehand). As such he felt undercut and made the job very difficult
bad,Park Hayatt is best brand name of hospitality industry.according to Hayatt company promised to our personal and skill growth but management of park hayatt dubai is dictator management who is not think about his employee also
bad,"As a former Manager of the hotel, I can say, InterMountain Management is not involved at all.  The worst turnover I have ever seen in just one year. There are some passionate employees and members of management, however, many of the good employees leave because they are over-worked and under appreciated. I do not suggest working for IMM of any of their hotels."
bad,Working in a larger facility has been a wonderful experience. I have gained a lot of knowledge on hospitality and management. At this point i would like to further my career in the field that i went to school for which is Property Management.
bad,"I would build relationships with clients to detail and design group events and social functions. I learned to have to multi task daily. Unfortunately I never received training for my position so I would have to always teach myself how to fulfill my duties. Management was new to their roles, so there was a lot of uncertainty."
bad,"Good place to work for.  Co workers where outstanding!! Was very hard in the beginning without having any staff, but I fought my way throug the storm."
bad,Good hotel.  Was a learning curve in the hotel industry.  Enjoyed being a part of this chain of hotels.  Worked with colleagues and bosses of different nationalities.
bad,"A typical day at the Hyatt is fast paced and steady.we have breakfast served in the morning and guests being served at the  front desk. We have to make sure the banquet room is tidy and safe enough for guests to enjoy their meal. Along with that we have to answer phones and make sure we check the guests in appropiately."
bad,"I had enjoyable moments at the Hyatt with fellow team members, but the unprofessionalism of Management staff will never gain the successful team needed to operate bar smoothly"
bad,"Politics play a major roll in advancement. Dealt with multiple managers and it makes know difference who they are, the respect level only changed from one to the next. Dealing with guests is the most satisfying thing day to day. The concept of a Hyatt Place needs work. I dont regret the experience but its tiring when I know there's something better waiting for me."
bad,"Currently working for the Crowne Plaza Dallas-Downtown has had it's up's and down's. Pay is good for the ""up's"""
bad,Handling all guest complaints right then and there to make sure they leave happy and have a positive experience with their visit.My most enjoyable part of the job is seeing repeat guests and those with a welcoming smile and cheerful attitude when returning from a hard days work.
bad,"- depends on how full the hotel is on how busy it is"
bad,"It was a great environment to work in, but the earning & growth potentials were low."
bad,"An exciting workplace, always something going on. This was my first hotel, being next to Rupp Arena makes it interesting. My co workers are the best, management not so much. The hardest part of the job is running a restaurant that is under staffed and not having the tools and equiptment to do the very best. The most enjoyable part of my job is making someone happy because of the food I cook for them."
bad,The job itself was easy but hotel management made it somewhat complicated.
bad,It is full of chalnges like something want wrong when you were not at work but that compline would come to you and you have to solve it.
bad,It is not fair to judge the job on the guests who came into the hotel but it was not a job for everyone. Management did not support the front office whenever a situation arose. We would check in and out guests on a daily basis. At times work in stressful situations dealing with the public.
bad,Tough to recommend. Very corporate and only cares about the bottom line. If you are in operations you will have absolutely no life and work 60++ hours a week.
bad,Kitchen is severely understaffed. No work-life balance even though promoted. Chef does an excellent job keeping the ship running but doesn't really get support from upper management
bad,Be prepared to be overworked no matter what department you are in. Manager experience is low level with a high turnover rate. Majority of managers are flown in from the mainland. Why local people not wanting to be in management should be a red flag. All Departments are Union. Many employees have been working over 25 years and some departments are extremely juvenile despite adults working in the department. Loud and obnoxious.
bad,"The position I had, had very little supervision. Managers weren’t in there to deal with the things that I endured, but would come in and try to change things when it was NOT necessary! "
bad,"Use to be a great place to work. Things have changed drastically over the last few years. Employees are micro managed, treated like children and talked down too."
bad,Great team to work for till the Micro management became and issue.  Director of the department was great teacher but upper management had to much input on the department without the knowledge.
bad,"In Hotel industry, I learned lot about food and beverages."
bad,"Its cool to work at you meet new people everyday, But management is horrible. Theres always a problem with the hotel. Its just a mess, and they try to control your life."
bad,"Je pouvais faire 10h sans pause et sans m'asseoir bien que je sois quelqu'un de dynamique qui en veut toujours plus, les responsables étant désagréables le travail était agaçant bien que j'apprécie réellement l'aspect d'être en contact avec les clients"
bad,"I worked for Hyatt for nearly three years, the last two of those were spent working from home as a remote agent. I will admit that they have a wonderful benefits package and they are very generous with their starting wage, (granted their starting pay is $3 higher than my starting pay from three years ago.) and with their PTO. However, I do not feel that these benefits outweigh the demands on their associates. Mandatory overtime, sometimes with as little as a 24 hour notice, were exhausting and made balancing home life difficult. Another factor to take into account was that the required overtime hours needed to be scheduled outside of your normal shift according to business needs. There were many times my normal schedule would be Sunday-Thursday 8:00am-4:30pm and the only available overtime I could pick up would be from 10:00pm-2:00am Sunday-Thursday, which left little time for a regular sleep schedule. During my employment the mandatory overtime continued for over 12 months consistently with similar requirements. A primarily sedentary job combined with a very unhealthy schedule (especially someone with insomnia like myself) lead to severe depression. Bottom line, this job is not worth it. There are better jobs out there and you are worth better."
bad,Managers were great and it is a nice hotel. I was hired as a part time doorman but it was more like on call. Schedule would vary week to week and some full time staff were complaining about lack of hours. Somtimes I would be forgotten and would have to call the hotel to see if I was lucky and had a shift. Very unorganized system of seniority were senior staff would just take a month or two off. You are expected to drop all you are doing to cover full time.
bad,I like who i work with my staff it great the front desk is great but manament is not so good i been there for a while now and we have had 3 general mangers and about 6 temp GM
bad,"Work schedule was never set.  Working evening shift then back for early morning breakfast shift. It was a lot of work having to do front desk, bar, kitchen, and help guest with any room service or housekeeping work. I learned a lot when it comes to customer service and how the hotel industry works."
bad,"Das Hyatt ist ein guter Ort zum lernen.Es gibt viele kompetente Mitarbeiter. "
bad,"Management was spread thin to support the bottom line which led to a poor working environment. Other than that it would have been a good job, but the atmosphere was toxic."
bad,The work was great the pay was great but the management was poor. When it was time to solve a problem it could never come to a compromise with both parties
bad,"Every day in Hyatt Regency Miami is a special day because the of the talented staff management. Amazing staff, Human resources as well have done something special for each person who works for the company to be satisfied. I know nothing is perfect in that world but they have done great things."
bad,All new management that's are not qualified and don't know what they are doing. Lots of work and no help at all. No team to support you. Only one cook most days food takes forever and no help.
bad,"My day started out reviewing the previous day's work that had not been completed, do employee live news video, work on the hotel employee newsletter, and worker comp cases.  "
bad,"Well I was hired as a pool server at Hyatt. The first day I started, I got thrown in and trained by someone who was there two days before me. Instead of a serving position, I am actually bartending with no previous experience. The management is very unorganized as they do not care about this position at all and it shows!"
bad,I never really felt like part of the team. It was like being in high school and fighting to fit in. In such an industry I would have expected a better welcoming and being part of a team in order for that to transfer to the customer.
bad,"One of the most important aspects of this job is that you are forced to a little bit of everything, so I have learned to drive a shuttle bus and tend bar as well as learning more in depth aspects of hotel management."
bad,"Management - keine interesse an die Mitarbeiter"
bad,They don't teach the just call you out for every mistake you make they make you feel uneasy everyday you work. No room for creativity.
bad,"Park Hyatt at Beaver Creek "
bad,"Poor leadership in the marketing department is toxic and continues to cost Hyatt talent. The new organizational structure prevents their best talent from being recognized for their work and ultimately, advancing their careers. While good values are a said priority, they are rarely ever practiced."
bad,"Prepared pre-cooked morning meals buffet style. Place and made meals upon guest request. Work beverage area and prepared lunch for business meeting. The hardest thing about my job that challenge me the most was; checking in and out our guest on their system. I love my co-workers great team, happy environment."
bad,The training is haphazard.  Training is done by co-workers who could really care less if you understand what you are supposed to be learning.  It is made more difficult because every person has their own way of doing the same thing.  Did I say CONFUSION??  They constantly have people calling off for whatever reason so they are looking for someone to cover at the last minute.  I thought this would be a great place to work.  Just wasn't so.
bad,i didnt like it do to the staff i that was training me they wasnt training the things they was doing was not apporiate like not changing the sheets putting the same dirty sheets back on the bed
bad,get to know and meet lots of people and where there from team work there low pay long hours nice college job but you can move up in the company hard to do so
bad,"Typical work day would include checking guests into and out of the hotel. Taking care of the gallery, taking food and beverage orders from the bar and kitchen. Making service runs to rooms for room service and or a guest request for amenities provided by the hotel. As key holder i would take the guests to work in the morning or to the airport with our company shuttle van. In charge of stock, so there is a daily food and beverage order that i would take care of of as far as the gallery, kitchen and housekeeping needs. Walk in guests are common and finding a place/room for them to stay in my goal. If not possible then i was able to guest to another one of our hotels near by. Hardest part of the job was making ever guest happy and comfortable as far as dealing with so many personalities but that is just part of the job, as in any position at any workplace."
bad,The job was productive good communication skills they were very helpful and also work with your time schedule they provide everything you need and helpful
bad,"Working at the Hyatt reservation center was a learning experience. Working at a quick pace, multitasking while talking, typing and searching on multiple screens.  The hardest part of the job was how often upset customers would get only wanting assistance from someone who worked at the actual hotel."
bad,"This review is for the corporate headquarters location only. Overall, the advancement opportunities, benefits, location, pay, and work/life balance were comparable to other employers. However, like anywhere else, your experience has a lot to do with which group you work in, which team you work on and who you report to. My experience here was a never ending bad high school drama. The people are extremely cliquey and where you fit in decides how well you perform and how you are viewed. Your relationships, especially those outside of your cubicle, define your opportunities and your performance. Colleagues and managers spent more time working with individuals that they were friends with rather than with who needed guidance or support. This mindset seemed pervasive across most of the corporate groups."
bad,"Not good pay for all the hard work, very physically demanding. Would not recommend as a start-up position. Not much growth provided for the position given."
bad,"The Hyatt itself is a good place the valet company not so much, the other managers are cut throat and will do anything to get ahead, they hire predominately lazy cashiers and valets that don't want to work, with the few exceptions, were always damaging cars, gives employees the expectation that they can move up but never let them, over works the employees."
bad,"Management is very black and white policy.  They do not work with you at all.  You can forget about your work/life balance, they are very inconsiderate when it comes to that.  The job was great but the people are very petty.  Here I learned that your coworkers are definitely not your friends. People will tell on you about the smallest things just to get brownie points. You get guaranteed 40 hours a week.  Do not work nights, that is the hardest part of this job.   The best thing about this place were the benefits. If you don't want to see your family this is the place to be. Nice hotel though!"
bad,A typical day at work is usually busy there are days when we are short staff and other days we lack the resources we need to perform the our job. There is no room for growth there.
bad,"Upon being hired, I felt like the complete job description was not clear. The position was called a Gallery Host, which when you normally work front desk you assume thats what they were just calling it. Not only was I front desk, I was also a bartender (which I have never done) and also a cook. They have a 24 hour kitchen which is awesome for the guests, but when its you and one other capable person working; doing front desk, bartending and cooking is a bit much for ten bucks. Tips were decent if the other employees weren't trying to con you out of them."
bad,"Management was awful, no support as a supervisor.  Very imuture staff."
bad,"Working at Big Bar was a challenge. Made $$ & good benefits but mgmt is corporate, clueless & never had your back. Mgmt kowtows the guests to the point of over-entitlement. The renovations made the bar even less functional than it was previously. If your dept is in the Union, good luck getting any requested days off; the seniors couldn't care less about you and most of them are super slow & terrible at their jobs. Almost had to quit college because they didn't want to work with my schedule. Near the end of my employment, the bar was getting an influx of young, rowdy rifraff on the weekends that would staredown their rivals & start fistfights & act like they were at a trashy nightclub. I expressed my concerns to mgmt & HR, but ultimately had to quit because I felt unsafe at work. Happy to be gone from there!"
bad,"My time at the Hyatt was great it has a good work environment real professional employers and employees. The thing that was not so good was they never really have the materials. "
bad,I did not like working at the Hyatt in Bellevue for many reasons. I feel like everyone there is extremely overworked and underpaid. The management there was an absolute joke and nobody knew what they were doing.
bad,"long hours and low salary, really tiring, and stressful. friendly people. sometimes not enough hours when its quiet but when its busy its not worth the stress for the amount of money you receive"
bad,Hyatt was a stressfull place to work. The operators were expected to do quite alot and the pay did not match the updated job description that was continually updated and you could get written up for just about anything.
bad,"Not really a fan of this particular brand concept wise for the property that I was at specifically. If you don't mind that, then it wouldn't be bad as long as you have a great leadership team."
bad,I really didn't enjoy this particular hotel. My main issue was that there were too many tasks and it took away from overall guest satisfaction. This position isn't for everyone.
bad,"I clock in sign into my register and take customer's order, then pack there food. and hand it to them. sometimes i go to the back and restock the sauces"
bad,"Rude customers, sales training isn't great, fun co workers, there was a lot of favoritism. They were giving our rewards if you do well at your job"
bad,Okay to work here... least bothered about the employees... never ever work here... look for companies who care for you and your career... this is the most horrible company I've ever worked with
bad,This was a great brand to get to know. I learned a lot about select service while working at this hotel.
bad,Des horaires pas réellement respectés.. Il faut aimer les grandes structures pour pouvoir s'y sentir bien
bad,"Workdays could be quiet and be easy on you, but weekends would be hellacious."
bad,Hyatt can be a great company and they will work you very hard.  Some department heads are fantastic and some aren't.  Hopefully you get lucky.
bad,Great balance of employee and company needs.  Guests are very important.  Training is good.
bad,It was a start of customer service skill. Learned how to deal with very irate patients and customers
bad,"At the front desk assisting with checkins/-outs, room issues. Was very uder staffed when I worked there and rooms were a constant issue with mld."
bad,"Poorly run hotel, education not rewarded.  Promises broken."
bad,"ok ,I learned a lot."
bad,Dealing with people all morning long and learning how to problem solve in certain situations where customers are unhappy. Being able to maintain efficient work ethics and proper customer service under pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you realized you did a good job with customer service with the amount of tip money being made.
bad,"Love the job, usually an awesome work day. Co workers great but not enough training in every department."
bad,"Get changed for work, clock in, speak with the supervisor about the task. I pretty much didn't learn anything new at the job, Management was great, as were my co-workers. I would say the hardest part of the job is the ""downtime"". The most enjoyable part was when certain celebrities enter we get the opportunity to meet them and also the food was great."
bad,"The training is great. I was put through orientations and seminars about how associates in this company treat each other with respect, then shortly afterwards, I was completely disregarded and disrespected."
bad,Working as a room attendant at the hyatt was very challenging everyday. We will recieve up to 30 rooms daily or 15 check outs.
bad,Don’t have anything to say about this place of business I just work there look for a good paying job. This is my reviews on the over all  the job is overall to mich
bad,"If you like the idea of having 6 different superiors in 4 years, then this is the place for you! Corporate is often unresponsive and glacially slow with solutions when they do reply."
bad,"Long shifts, heavy loads of work."
bad,"I Love being the olemlet lady at the HYATT REGENCY HOTEL,but when your boss ,my chef is lazy and rude too myself and the others workers it's time to find somewhere else to work I am indeed looking too do the same work but at a different Hotel,"
bad,"It a nice place to work. Some of the staff will make you feel very uncomfortable if you are black or muslim. When I worked there the other employees did'nt make me feel like I was part of the team. I did'nt get invited to most of the company programs and functions for whatever reason. They took a group photo of most of the employees,a nd I was left out. I covered other employees shifts for 6 to 8 months and was never thanked, nor compensated. I liked working there to help the hotel guest but didn' t like working their due to the rudeness of the other employees. This is was at the royal palms resort and spa"
bad,"Hyatt is a good company to work for, unfortunately the Hyatt Santa Clara upper management were not bias. Middle managers were able to shine and move up as the General Manager recognized the hard work they put in. Everything turned around when a new F & B Director came in and she had close connection to the Corporate F & B Director for Hyatt North America.She had her own agenda and fired the Director of Outlets (manager of the year), Director of Banquets(Manager of the quarter), Executive Chef (13 years with Hyatt) and the Chef de Cusine resigned after 14 years with Hyatt."
bad,"Great work, management and co-workers, however my less then stellar review is due to lack of hours and opportunity due to union politics and cronyism."
bad,"Typical day at work would be cleaning rooms, some rooms had to be deep cleaned and other just a simple cleaning, one took about 1 hour and the other about 30 mins depending, rooms that were already checked out were the easiest. "
bad,"Never paying attention with the needs/requests of the employee. They want only favour to the management.. In my case, I asked nicely to take my emergency off coz of family matters but the newly housekeeping manager never grant me my off and she never listened to our opinion and she cannot agree to our explanation. She never give us a chance to explain our side. No consideration so most of the attendants call sick coz she never giving them off willingly by request."
bad,the morning normally starts off rough because everyone needs laundry in order to make beds so we all running around looking floor linen on other floors but as the work day go by everything is find the coworker is helpful sometimes the mangers are great the hardest part of the job is when all the rooms need to be done before your shift is over sometimes you get get up to eighteen rooms or more
good,It's a great place to work the hrs just wasn't enough. Management sucked they didn't know how to conduct business right when it came to employees. I would never work for them again.
good,It was a job not a career. I do think it helped me grow because I didn’t want to break my back any more so I worked hard saved my money and got out of the company
good,"over worked, understaffed, no appreciation, literally worked illegal hours - on more than one occasion I worked a whole  month long with only 2 days off.  10+ hour days, get called on your day off getting screamed at for things I wasn't even there for.  Very poor management, treated staff like dirt.  If it wasn't for the staff  NOTHING would have been done.  Poor communication."
good,"Needs work and better supervision with more training to better their skills for employee's. Theres plenty too say but, not enough space to explain about the product and activity done in the work environment."
good,"I just feel unappreciated here, one week vacation for 1 year or 20 years, that's all you get, I work almost every Saturday, which I don't mind but if I want one off on occasion I would like it without a hassle. My insurance in horrible."
good,"When I first started I was so excited to work here  it's such a beautiful hotel it's the only one in the area so if somebody's looking for a Hyatt to go to they're going to go there you get to meet new people I got to make the place look good. I started getting stressed when I realized I'm the only employee at night answering all the calls cleaning all the bathrooms the lobby the pool area which is huge doing all the trash and trying to run things to people's rooms when they need it and then halfway through my employment I was only there for 3 months it just got out of hand I get home at like 2 in the morning 1 in the morning when I'm scheduled off at 11 because there was just so much to do and then on top of it to make my boss's life easier in the mornings cuz the girls were fighting too much about their stuff to put on their carts she started making me do their carts as well so now I have that added to my job I'm talking like 7 to 14 carts a night it's so overwhelming and then to top it off my manager does poor inventory we would run out of toilet paper run out of soap run out of lotion run out of shampoos conditioners paper towels all the stuff that the guests need we'd run out of how do you run out of something like that at a Hyatt Hotel it is a franchise with the Hilton and the Marriott you just don't do that other than that this place could be a really fun place to work. The managers are backstabbers and two-faced,  if they ask you to do something and you hesitate from then on out  be prepared to be getting ready to get booted you are to do what they want whenever they"
good,"inspect the guest rooms, and public areas, and heart of the house for cleanliness,  maintain a regularly scheduled cleaning program, maintain supply and linen inventories, ensure housekeeping request from guest or management are responded to in a timely efficient and friendly manner"
good,"On a good day, there would be four cabins to clean and two turn overs. On a bad day when the front desk would over book and have seven turn overs. Each cabin takes an hour to clean and everyone wants to have a late check out of 1 pm and check in is 3. Management is terrible, one day you are the toast of their businesses the next your fired for not selling expired meat or for not cleaning fast enough."
good,"easy job, did not get paid enough for what the job entailed. management did not care about it's employees. the gm was never around on shift was always up in a room sleeping. more drama than a highschool"
good,"When you are at a company for two years you expect more than 5 vacation days. You are given these 5 days to use for vacation, sick time of holiday which is awful. Management doesn't care about employees either."
good,"not much to say, other than i needed to move on and that it isnt a good fit if you are trying to balnce a lot uin your life.  not much leniency when it comes to calling off for emergencies."
good,Working at the Hyatt Midtown was great until the investors hired consultants that completely ruined the Hyatt standard. We went from having the best managers to having no managers at all at one point. Hyatt Midtown has not been the same since.
good,you work with a lot of lazy ppl.coworkers are the worst to deal with than customer . the kitchen is dirty so much and manager play their favoritism is so unprofesional
good,"Never been treated as an intern, every day was promised rotation but was only allocated one position, which made my learning experience limited."
good,"The position in banquet, there is no future in banquet, eventhough it is very enjoyable and you like the job you do. You could be there 5 year and they still will not provide you with healthcare, or any type of benefits because you are not clasified as a full time worker. I think if you are there more than a year they should provide you with some type of benefits"
good,"The spa management have poor communication skills & lack follow through. There is no consistency between therapists, i.e. some are allowed to buy & wear own clothes if it fits same colors as issued uniform. Others are not permitted to do the same. The hardest part of the job is no job security, if you don't make your hours due to slow business you loose your benefits...health , vacation ect. The most enjoyable part... performing my facials for my guests."
good,"Housekeeping staff are lazy and skip cleaning rooms. Housekeeping supervisor drinks on the job and is very unprofessional. This hotel is falling apart and nobody wants to stick around."
good,"The company does not take care of employees very well, they eliminated the traditional Christmas events for family, they do not compensate for night shift differential, they mostly hire part time or seasonal employees to avoid the grant of benefits.  A family man cannot stay with the amount of salary provided and the amount of time taken away from your family."
good,"Good place for experience, management has to be improved "
good,"As long as management has been changed it's most likely a safe place to work now. I dealt with unpaid Hours, and Racist management. The GM at the time was very irrational in decisions and refused/ forced me to stay then fired me a week later."
good,"Always short staffed. On the busiest night of the year myself and the security were left alone to nonstop calls, requests and food orders. very poor planning by upper management. Due to the turnover rate and the fact that the job exhausts the staff who then call out. They call staff who on their days off to come in. They over work the best people they have."
good,I just feel like I don't belong here. At the end of everyday I'm so tired every muscle in my body hurts so bad. I'm never guaranteed to have weekends off.
good,would not work at a union hotel.managment has no sence of whats fair.does not tell u whats going on in hotel. no job security.get laid off every year. no health insurance for a yr cause of the union
good,Management could use some more work on how they react with their employees to get the understanding of them. I have learned alot with the computer program
good,"It is not orderly, poor level of customer care, without opportunity for growth, does not offer beneficion, there is no clear rules or policies in addition to uregulares sentidi overall payments and nonpoint, It offers no assurances"
good,"The manager there hires all her friends which are born and raised in urban areas,whereas they bring the same attitude to work with them therefore the position itself was not a great experience for me at all."
good,i dont have anything to say about the compny as a temp i learned to do many different jobs so all in all it gave me vital experience.
good,"Great hotel that is up and coming within the N. Arlington / Grand Prairie area.  Under hotel management, not a corporate hotel."
good,My customer service skills were built during my tenure for the Hyatt corporation as well as my managerial skills with operations and staff.  
good,The people for the most part are ok.  The benefits package is lacking. Pay is subpar for the work that they require.  General morale among employees is wretched.
good,"In the Franchise world there is no training, no ability for advancement. They want your skill set and client book. They set unrealistic goals, and rarely pay bonuses. "
good,"Twice having worked in their corporate cultured properties. When citing situations that may easily correctable and beneficial to the culture, your labeled a trouble maker. The suggestions that are looked at take a year or so to be implemented. When there’s a need for a talk regarding policy adherence, there will be at least two to three members of management in the talk but you may not have representation or at least an impartial person present. You may actually see their methodology of compliance adherence, as a form of military discipline. Look elsewhere if a career choice is your goal."
good,"The hotel its self lovely, and guests are wonderful, my coworkers were like family but management is awful the managers have their picks and the general manager he is not right"
good,"slow during the day and rush hour was until midnight. difficult clients, mostly seniors. no teamwork, lack of management, great tips, average benefits."
good,The cleaning company that I worker for Intergrity was not at all organized and were very unprofessional. The only plus to working for them was the location in which I was assigned which was downtown Flushing.
good,"Hyatt has a good culture to unite their people but the work life balance is nil. there is a fixed login time but no fixed time to run home, whenever the world having holiday's hospitality Is ready to serve you"
good,"die Mitarbeiter sind unprofesional , die nutzen alle aushilfe aus, schlecht bezahlt . ich habe als aushilfe gearbeitet aber der teamleiter haben manchmal keine brieifng gegeben und sie haben immer wenig aushilfe für eine grosse event. bei  100 gäste haben die nur 4 aushilfe als service (Sparen)"
good,"High turnover rate for employees and managers. "
good,"Each hotel is different.I worked at two HYATT hotels,the first was wonderful,the second not so much.I have worked at other hotels that promote employees by numerous factors,Hyatt in wichita is only concerned with the young so they can pay less and mold them thier way.They do not realize these kids take that training and go elsewhere for more money."
good,"Learned to deal with guest through phone or face to face."
good,"You life will be consumed by Hyatt! They tell you that they will work with what you have going on outside of wirk but they don't. You can do anything outside of Hyatt as long as it doesn't interfere with your work schedule. They offer tuition assistance,  but won't work with your school schedule for you to be able to go to school.  Hyatt is a place for someone that only wants to be in their entry level position their entire life."
good,"WE DO EVERYTHING!! Our job consists of everything except for the kitchen sink... but wait, there's a kitchen sink. There is just a lot to do for this job. I can say it definitely keeps yo on your toes. Always expect the unexpected, but I'ved learned that from previous working experiences. Its a good starting places to work, nothing long term though."
good,No job advancement and management is not organized and supportive. Business hotel is old compare to other hotels in the area.
good,"Arrive at 5:30 am either counting the money first or prepping for the continental breakfast. Talking to the previous shift to communicate with the important information about the job. Going through the main important functions on the computer such as printing out emergency reports, looking at availability and arrivals. I am a people's person and my co workers knew that if they we're working with me, a smile was going to be on their face. Helped everyone on a good day or a bad day. If I couldn't figure it out on my own, I would always reach out to support and get an answer for my peers. I helped with brand communications so if there was any new info that came out with the brand, I knew and passed it  on. My most enjoyable time there was the personal touch I had lithesome guests and co workers and I will never forget those memories."
good,"Just not for me. I can go on for days, but the people who work here are all great and try.The company as a whole has some issues to work out and they are aware of that."
good,The Hyatt Place runs because certain employees take their job seriously despite lack of guidance from upper management.
good,"working 8 hours a week isn't enough to pay bills, loved the people I worked with and work was always fun but I would have this as a side job"
good,Hotel muy moderno con facilidades de aprender el funcionamiento de todo.
good,"If you’re looking to get your foot in the door of the hospitality field, this position is for you, as it offers longevity. However, there is almost no room for advancement. Managers and supervisors are friendly, but they are lying when they tell you that it’s easy to move up in the company. There is only one opening in any position that isn’t entry-level, and since all of the team leads and managers are best friends, they have no interest in your advancement within the company. You’ll have 500 responsibilities and are held to a remarkably high standard for the lack of training and pay."
good,It Need a new manager... And help with supplies... I thought in the beginning I was going to enjoy working here but things changed... They need new management and better general manager..
good,"It was my experience with the Hyatt that they do one thing and say another. They spoke of empathy and a culture of community between staff and departments, but when the chips were down their actions spoke of profit. Even to the point that they ran departments under regulated staffing quotas. Plus guests were devalued and overcharged unless of course they had prestige and money to burn."
good,"Management responds only to complaints from guests, and it doesn’t matter if you was talking about the same problem 2 months, but if guest says about the same problem they can fix in the same day. No respect from management, a lot of lies, nobody communicate with each other (one supervisor can tell you one information, after 5 minutes another supervisor tell you different information,"
good,"Bad move. Bad people just over all experience was bad, money was the motivator on this opportunity. Just needed to move on. Could have been better.  O"
good,"When friends or family ask me, “Should I apply or Should I work there”. I say no, check all your other resources before applying to this corporation. I myself am happily moving on to better horizons. The work culture is depressing, the management does not value you as a person, and the corporation does not pay its employees a fare wage."
good,"chefs skill and quality is lower then three stars hotel but it is five stars hotel."
good,I was placed in a position I did not apply for while making the best of it I went above and beyond my job tasks. Great hours! 30 min lunch break which was unacceptable for hard labor work especially working laundry.
good,"Loved the people, upper management is horrible though and the pay is not good. I enjoy working here just wish they paid us more and the managers didnt talk to the employees like children..."
good,"if you just want a job apply this place"
good,"Benefits are great, 12 free hotel rooms a year, cheap and excellent health insurance, but that is about where it stops.  Horrible schedule options.  When hired, they tell you they have all shifts open, but once you get to chose, all they have left are cbad options.  Pay is ridiculous, don't expect to be able to live off of this one job alone, won't happen.  Constant back to back phone calls, with not even a second gap in between to prepare yourself for the next one.  No reason for that what-so-ever."
good,"the scheduling was very poor at times. Often we would have too many people on days where we were not busy at all, and then we had too few people on days where we were totally swamped."
good,somewhere to help pay bills. They only utilize you when convenient. During the slow period you are replaceable however the sky will fall if they need you and you are not available.
good,When I worked at this place the GM an management where a bit unrealistic about some of the task an the way u deal  with the guest.  I worked long an hard for company an just didn't see any growth. Although I appreciate the opportunity. I would not like to be a part of this team anymore.
good,"The Hyatt culture is great for hospitality advancement. The guests you encounter can be amazing human beings but at times can be taxing when encountering those who are less than pleasant. The work/life balance is difficult to maintain as it pretty much requires an open schedule. Hours are not hard to come by except for when the hotel in question has a low occupancy, then you will be seeing part-time hours for employees as management tends to cut hours for budget purposes."
good,Business depends largely on hotel occupancy and guests itineraries. Management is constantly changing. No real consideration for employees especially if you lack seniority.
good,They do not want to raise the pay for housekeeper employees. Housekeepers have the hardest job to do in the hotel and get paid the least. tips are ok but a raise in pay would be nice.
good,Low pay for the required work. Management  company changes g.m. . Change of policies  with every new manager. Constant flow of new employees. Everyone from management  company keeps everything quiet. Always  in the dark on issues in the hotel.
good,"management is not good, they always change policies every 2 months. Sadly GM got away with letting this lady run out on a 15 K room tab and still kept his job."
good,"Overall, the Hyatt in Albuquerque is not the most professional establishment. A typical day at work is either very busy when there is an event being held at the hotel, or not busy at all. The management is on constant rotation which makes it hard to concentrate on work. The managers who have been hired have not seemed to be suitable for the environment. The hardest part of working at the Hyatt is that management is always changing and there are no set ""rules"" in which the establishment (more so the restaurant) is ran."
good,I took a job as a storeroom clerk to get my foot in the door to ne greeted with a couple passive aggressive coworkers i didnt get training at all the hours and pay was fine
good,the main reason why i left because management was not appreciative of the job day in and day out. no one bother to thank you for the sacrifice you make on daily basis for th benefit of the company.
good,needs new management. turnover is really high now ever since davidson took over management. the benefits are expensive.
good,"Location of equipment made job very difficult to work on. Leave policy was very hard to follow. Manager expected you not have dirty uniform even though I didn't work in office, engineers tend to get dirty because some of the equipment is dirty."
good,i felt that the pay was Good but the management was awful!!!!!!! i did however work with some great people and learn some valuable information...
good,"Could be a fun place to work, management need to pay more for all the hats that front desk wear and management need to stand behind there staff more"
good,Poor management made this job very difficult to enjoy  Long hours with very little help.  Many hours put in with very little reward
good,"Nothing terribly flashy.  Management is a bit behind the times, but the associates are what make it worth it.  Great atmosphere amongst associates."
good,"On a weekly basis, my schedule switched from morning to evening shifts. I was able to work in other areas I did not experienced on previous hotel jobs, such as food preparing, and alcohol serving. The hotel runs smooth and the management was eager and motivates all employees to pass the monthly inspection. The hardest part of my job was the preparation of alcohol drinks, due to my inexperience in the area and not been trained to properly prepare cocktails. I love the location of the job, within walking distance to downtown (including my home), restaurants, the river itself and the tranquility of the area."
good,I like the work. Fast paced always something that can be done.
good,Not a great place to work. Poor management with little respect to employees and loosing money as a whole. Not sure that it will last much longer.
good,"Getting there a 6 am to place the order away. handeling customers and money tranactions. preparring food for guests, check in and out guest. other day it was swing shift or night audit."
good,"I was responsible for maintaining a section of the resort gardens. My daily routine was to tidy the area, remove rubbish and fallen branches/palm throngs, routine garden maintenance. This would involve pruning, mowing, edging, whipping, planting, trimming, mulching. Additional duties would involve removal of fallen trees,repairing paving, clearing drains and pits, laying turf, maintance of turf, repairing irrigation assisting Greenfeepers on the Golf Course."
good,Very low pay rate and if you have no life outside the job go for it.
good,"Management is not compensated by the company for working long hours. Can take a toll on an individual, leaving you with very little social life if any."
good,"Management  need  to  listen  what  staff  needing  and  understanding  all "
good,I like this room I am not speaking bad on the job but other than that I love what I do so wheather the job has it together or not imma still do my job
good,"The typical day consisted of unloading equipment and set up of said equipment. The days varies I would either be the ground guy for the day, meaning I would be doing the cutting of material for installation, or I would be an installer, meaning I would be installing the material on the house. Roughly an hour before the end of the day we would clean up and pack up for the day."
good,"I don't know about the other hyatts. But the one in rochester is horrible. They wont fix things within a reasonable time no matter how busy it is supposed to be unless a customer complains about it. The turnover rate is scary, I've seen more people leave within two weeks than last six months. Management is a joke. And we NEVER seem to have everything we NEED to do our jobs. And yetbthey find a way to blame it on the minimum wage workers. That place sucks."
good,"I was Working as a Room Attendace, I got Sick Now i need Part time  They dont wanna hire me Again, I really need a job. Please help me i now that That they have a job for me, I try to apply again so many times, but i have no lucks."
good,Great fun coworkers.  Poor management. No discipline for late day shift employees relieving overnight staff. Interaction with people always an adventure.
good,The management at this location was awful. She never knew how to treat employees and was always leaving early and passing off things to her employees.
good,Worked at the property for just under a year when the manager came to the department and made the statement that she was going to fire one of the two maintenance techs.  She did not identify who or why of the statement.  I don't play those game and resigned.  The other maintenance tech quite about 3 months later.
good,"Working here teaches you a lot about the hospitality industry and Hyatt is a great hotel branch. However, the management does not care about their staff at this location. You cannot call off for any reason, though management constantly does. There is a reason the turnover rate is so high. The only real pro is my coworkers here. The pay sucks for the amount of work we have to do"
good,"Hyatt was good as far call centers go.  The people were nice enough, but there was a ton of employee turn over.  The benefits were expensive for a family."
good,I have worked here for a couple years and had 4 general managers. With each one the revenue gets worse.  The turn over rate is high due to lack of training by way of management. The computer and credit card machine will freeze up at the worse times. If you have a sub par co-worker with you at the bar you are going to have to pick up their slack. Keep up with your tip and hours work because quite often your check will be short. You can run out of inventory fast because of small storage space and go through a drought for a couple of weeks. No inventory= No guests= No major $$$. Make sure you know the handbook and procedures because management will manipulate the rules to get rid of people. On the brighter side co-workers and guest can be joy.
good,I have no review of Hyatt.  I was not with this company very long before they decided to close the resort for construction.  Don't rally have anything else to say.
good,This job is not for everyone. Pro is that you are interacting with all kinds of people. Con is when the hotel is over sold and you have to walk or accommodate a guest in some type of way you are at he front line for all the blows. Management is not professional what so ever.
good,"For most, Hyatt is a great company to work for, they offer excellent continuing education for particular field, salary/compensation is great, however you work so many hours depending on your position where you never end up using your PTO. "
good,"Nice hotel, great staff and friendliness among them. The problem is most managers I had to deal with were completely in over their heads, way under-qualified, from the Director of Rooms, to the Front Office Mgr, to immediate supervisors. Cameras everywhere, but only to watch employees.Never once heard of a camera in my dept that was used to help guests, just simply to use as evidence for discipline and to use against employees. Constantly being watched very prison-like.  Good benefits, average health care available. I'm sure not all Hyatts are like this, but this one suffers because of poor management"
good,The job an be fulfilling but the pressure to meet sales targets and the consequences of not doing so feels like a stressful pressure cooker-like atmosphere.  Most people work 2-3 years in Sales & Events without a promotion.  They over-emphasize the quality and treatment of their guests but fail to extend the same to their staff behind the scenes.
good,Pay is fair and benefits as well. Housekeeping office staff could definetly use training on how to talk to their employees. Desk Secretary Hailey was always very rude and liked to belittle and gossip towards housekeeping staff. She is very ruse and managment even when brought to their attention were never helpful. We were always asked just to let it go because that was just her attitude.
good,Great employees low pay for to much work no communication with managment great ideas for customer service and growing the business. Great employees that work great in customer service
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Hyatt. I learned about hotel upkeep, and participated in an entire hotel remodel. The management was great, we just had a lot of turnover. The hardest part of the job was the walking, and the most enjoyable part was the workplace."
good,"Travail dynamique, mise en place, debarrassage   ."
good,"*********************************** It was OK , but frequently changing management. Passed down responsibility's. Didn't keep promise. Work environment was to stressfull."
good,"Great place to work with many oppurtunities to advance."
good,Required to do more than job required which ordinarily i'm fine with until it becomes frequent due to lack of managers doing their job. In which case I mean no one is supervising the workplace and fellow co workers slack off and being a responsible worker having to pick up their slack.
good,Crescent hotels and resorts has no job stability. They don't monitor the management staff properly. They can fire you at anytime and the managers show favoritism to employees.
good,Early hours starting at 6 a.m. Setting up the breakfast gallery for guests. I learned that you many different cultures and different activities ranging from business to sports. When it was busy it was exhausting but the guests made it all worth it. Management was not around when you needed them. The culture of the job was management show favoritism. The hardest part of the job was getting up so early and not getting time off. The best part of the job were the guests from various places.
good,The people at the place is the best thing. its very well rounded on job duties and good resume builder. getting to know the costumers and the stories  can be exciting and show different out look of  current events.
good,"En esta empresa comencé a trabajar por primera vez, una vez que recibí mi titulo, la verdad en aquel entonces era una empresa que estaba recién comenzando el gran plus que tenia era que usaba algunos servicios de áreas comunes de una cadena hotelera 5 estrellas y eso a vista de los pasajeros qie se hopeaban en los departamentos era muy bueno"
good,Staffing was very dificult to keep. The day to day operations were ever changing and inconsistant. The management team was more of being about one and not a team.
good,"Beautiful property. Horrible management"
good,Not a fan almost worked there 10 years and just about every year company went through lay offs it was very stressful especially since it always seemed to happen around the be holidays
good,"I worked here seasonally, and there were days they would call me in to work and I would be there an hour and they'd ask me to leave. I also was called and told not to come in multiple times. there were some girls that would be there for an eight hour shift and they would force them to take a 2 hour lunch so they didn't have to pay them the full time."
good,"I'm assuming all of the management would be gone by now but when I was there the employees were constantly having to take the blame for the managements mistakes, simply because management was no where to be found. Front desk had about 6 responsibilities on top of checking people in, mainly because we knew if we didn't do it we knew it wasn't going to get done. This job definitely taught me how to work hard and what bad management looks like and how it can destroy not only a company but make for a very unprofessional work environment."
good,"The job description of each GSO is to do the check-in, check-out, welcome the guest and be to the expectations of the guest. As far as my journey is concerned, it is more or less different. My day start normally with checking all the areas in the Spa & Health Club facilities. I have to ensure that everything is up to standard and if there is any engineering issue, i have to report it immediately. I do check-out & check-in of the guest. As well, ensuring that the guest had a good service and if there is anything extra we can do for the guest. There is a lot of guest engagement involved which actually makes my day much better everytime. End of the month, i was in charged of the inventory of the spa & health club. Spa products, retails items, guest amenities and health club products had to be counted and reported to finance. It was my weekly task as well to update the roster of the Spa staff and to ensure that we do not lack manning over the whole week. Above these, departmental trainings as well were part of my duties. I had to prepare a departmental training plan for each new comer in the department. It was my monthly task as well to give trainings to the staff on a time to time basis such grooming trainings, telephone standard, room set up standard. i also at times conducted the daily briefing. Throughout these 2 years, i have learned a lot in terms of management position. i was involved in many projects in the spa such as the manicure & pedicure and lot more. "
good,"Controlling  all the security systems and others responsabilities , my Job at Hyatt was very versatible one"
good,I don't have too many negative thing to say. I enjoyed working here. The hours were what I needed. The management could've been friendlier.
good,"non orginazational overall, no vision for the future, hiring incapable employees, no teamwork, from the top to the bottom"
good,The job was fun and I enjoyed the people I worked with but it was a collective thought that we were simply not compensated for the work that we put in. We were paid less doing the jobs of about 4 people than someone who was just a front desk worker at a another hotel.
good,"Really did not like how the managers handled  certain situations, and left me on my own when i was not ready to be left alone ."
good,produce cleaning products and deliver them to places as schools and companies
good,good work place to work for starters.learned how to manage. co workers are cool. meeting people is enjoyable.
good,"It is a new hotel and because of this they have yet to develop any structure for procedures and/or policies. It makes it a very stressful, tense and frustrating working evironment about 80% of the time."
good,responible for 16 housekeepers making sure rooms are properly cleaned and vips are ready to be taken care of properly. communicating with the staff and keeping them moving along
good,mis compañeros  de trabajo muy buenos pero el supervisor que tenia muy flojo y no sabia hacer nada todo me lo dejaba ami y aguante 1año y cuando me queje de el me corrieron  sin carta de despido pesima administración
good,"No room to move up or increase pay to an appropriate level after a few years. Breaking into management is very difficult, as the same managers have been here quite some time."
good,"You can get training and hours if you can handle the work load, must be able to work alone and as a team. Guest is always right even when wrong they find a way to make it stick to you. Be careful."
good,"Would be a great job but management is a revolving door of inexperienced, immature kids who are there to put this job on their resume, not actually manage or be there for their team. Completely disorganized and very 'cliquey'. Unprofessional atmosphere trying to be a five star hotel."
good,"They will work you like a dog. an u will get blame  For theirs mistakes,they  Need to hire more people and stop putting soo much work on their workers."
good,There was nothing but drama between me and the manager she had a big crush on my boyfriend. So she always made sure that I wasn't around when she felt like flirting.
good,"I truly loved working with my co-workers and the overall environment is fun and relaxed, however...the reservation center's upper management is awful and unpredictable. In the year that I was employed there, the teams were restructured three times."
good,"Management was okay, pay was low, no benefits, but a typical day was quick paced. it was a good working day cant complain, but the pay was low it wasn't enough to live on your own if part- time."
good,Be prepared if you apply and get hired by Hyatt Place. Most likely privately owned (franchised). You’ll be wearing more than one hat working there. Discounts are pretty decent. Shady management and coworkers
good,It's great to work in the hotel but schedule sucks. It's ok if this is your only job but it's hard when you go to school or have another job. most employees have another job due to low wages. Some managers are very caring and very hospitable to guest and employees but most are vice versa.
good,"I got to meet a lot of interesting people, both guests and coworkers. I learned what working for a corporate business was like. I held my position for 8 years in security and for 1 year in in-room dining. I learned how to get along with coworkers and managers and to have good customer service skills. I learned how to do CPR and computer skills. The hardest part of the job was when we had to relocate employee parking, it took a lot of standing and directing traffic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits that we received."
good,"Cut-throat management, love to hire young white people, stressful at the time I was there,  Hard to get into top management not able to stay at  hotel"
good,"working in this theater was a good and bad experiences. gave me some well advice and show me a bit more of regal before the new company took over, it ok"
good,"I help 4 different positions while at Hyatt and although I did move within the company to be truly successful you have to be willing to work 10-12 hour days, and relocate around the country (or world) at the drop of a hat. The perks are nice, but the pay is not fair for the work."
good,"Great places to work, nice and clean environment. With great people."
good,"I always saw Hyatt as a great brand and company to work for. When I started things were unusual, for example, I started before attending Orientation and the training was lackluster. The people that work for the organization are the biggest downfall."
good,"Love Hyatt at the corporate level.  Very professional and lots of training available."
good,"I don't want to have to write a review of the company to complete this process.  Perhaps this request should be voluntary, instead of mandatory.  Perhaps."
good,Cooking breakfast at the Hyatt Place every morning for the guest was definitely an expected experience. Having the pleasure to greet and meet the needs of those who were hungry motivated me to ensure everything was up to part. I learned that some people do not mind having casual conversation early in the morning versus some that wants to be left alone. The management is always what you make of it. Doing your job right is what matters most
good,not a good place to much work not enough pay. always working weekend and its not fair wen your here for 7 years and a new hire ends up with all weekends off
good,"Hyatt is not a terrible company to work for. They have very nice properties worldwide and quality service standards."
good,"A typical day at work is boring, until you start meeting the guests and future customers. Once this happens you life starts to look like h*ll filled with quests that you are never goiing to achieve succeding. Your back-stabbing colleagues will never support you in anything you do, and try to make everything possible to help you lose the job. however at the end of the day you visit HR and after being carefully brainwashed, go home happy like nothing ever happened."
good,"They make you work 47.5 hours and you receive overtime for the 7.5 hours, but do not get that time and a half until after you have worked 40 hours. So basically it is set so you cannot miss a day. The management company, Aimbridge, runs so lean that there is never enough people to do what they are supposed to for a full-service hotel making it hard for you to do your job correctly and efficiently."
good,"During my time at Hyatt we were very understaffed, but managers and supervisors of Atrium and other restaurants of the hotel were very helpful. It was a good environment for team work but it was hard to provide the best service because of the under staff situation."
good,"Checking in and checking out guests, generating and analysing reports, payments and taking cash. Management is a little laid back. Learned to be more patient."
good,I currently work with Hyatt for now but I haven't been satisfied with the experience. I feel like the training was too brief and they threw us to the wolves. If someone is extremely detail oriented and can remember a hundred steps for a reservation this job is for you!
good,"Stressful, learn patience, lack of management, diversity was only Hispanic with a few African Americans, favoritism, and the best part was breakfast!!!"
good,management company was horrible. never addressed the problems with the front office staff. brand new hotel on May 23 2017. Hotel had a lot of problems hanging on to staff due to inconsistencies in management
good,"Inadequate support from management, blame aiming at employees, workplace bullying, character profiling, insufficent diversity in management, competitive wages"
good,"the hardest part of the job was not knowing how to speak spanish with some of the co-workers."
good,"The hours were horrible and the exploit you. The job required too much for very low pay. You were expected to be driver, cook, front office, sometimes bartender, barista, and cleaning person. Sometimes it was to much and no one was helping."
good,"Very hard work, but you get paid well. Very competitive, but teams are dwindling, and they work managers to the bone. My average week is 80 hours."
good,Aprendizado continuo com treinamentos e sempre buscando inovação e melhorias no processo.
good,"Management needs to learn how to manage there money.."
good,"N/A"
good,"pretty good... "
good,I enjoyed working there when I first started buy now I realize how unorganized the company the company is I refuse to input my hard work at this company
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo formal. En general lo sentí demasiado pesado y rutinario, en dónde si podía interactuar con otros actores sociales pero de igual forma mi capacidad de raciocinio quedaba estancada."
good,"The management is definitely lacking. There is little to no promotion from within. As far as the culture, it's constant talk and gossip about employees by the managerial staff. The team at the desk is amazing!"
good,Banquet service is a different breed.  The Hyatt has management issues in banquets and needs to work it out for the sake of attrition rates and for customer retention.
good,Overall Hyatt is a great place to work but the management here sucks. The general manager does not show any empathy towards his employers at all. Just recently the hotel was robbed at gun point and he showed no compassion toward the women that endured this incident as well as the guest. He only cares about his money and nothing else.
good,"Management is good, it takes time for them to deal with problems. Day goes by pretty fast for the morning shifts. You would definitely be asked to go around in positions."
good,a typical day at work will be you starting out doing your tasks that are giving to you. Greeting every guest that walks past you which is ok no problem. One thing you'll learn never talk about your personal life. Management always want to do more then your job and still clock out before 8hrs. hardest part of the job is trying to get your work done. Most enjoyable part of the job is lunch time.
good,"At my specific location: The management at hyatt was uncaring of its employees and their needs. After working there for a few months and working the ""late"" shift; I asked to have different hours because it was interfering with my other jobs and family. They refused to change my hours and I continued working the last shift of the day: unhappy. I was disciplined for my lack of enthusiasm and threaten to never work at a Hyatt again."
good,PARK HYATT DUBAI being a very luxury prorperty is very excellent for guest but when it comes to staff its really not appreciated the salary level is too low no salary increment past two years and  no specific reason as such
good,"Employees easy to get along with willing to help."
good,"Hyatt Hotel "
good,"Trabajo de mucho sacrificios, horas de sueño, horas extras, sin muchas compensaciones mas allá de hacer lazos con las mismas personas que uno trabaja, por las largas horas de trabajo, en lineas generales, trabajo muy sacrificado."
good,Hotel was managed by independent owner who did not do things according to Hyatt standards.  Once the hotel was audited the hotel lost it's flag and the owner lost hotel.
good,It was a good place to work sometimes and sometimes it a major stress but had to pay the bills. Sometimes they over work you because it was not enough housekeepers to do all the work.
good,Hyatt is a five star place so you can understand the feeling at a five star place it is best place to work but there will no salary increment and new learning at this job
good,To many bosses telling you ways to do the job....if you do it the way that you are taught it should not be a problem. You should only have 1-2 bosses telling you not 3 to 4 like it was there. they don't treat all workers fairly.Wrong poor management judgement by giving in to other workers by letting them do as they please!!!
good,"I need a new job close to my home need make more money my job is very good I have a lot experience I am a man work hard and professional I can take any schedule, but I don't like work overnights.   I know any function in the hotel. gest request. public area. houseman shut laundry. banquet."
good,"typical day at work, is truly a headache. my co workers are the best, they really helped me get on board fast and was willing to answer all question ( even if it was the same one over and over). the hardest part of my job , is working with other who doesn't help and pull their weight at work and your stuck doing everything and when your always on time and some of your coworkers not and you always have to stay late, even when you have other plans."
good,I would pull around peoples cars as they would come. Hardest thing was driving stick shift and that is very easy so the job was super easy.
good,"I worked 10 months in Hyatt Computer and learned a lot new tools for IT management support."
good,"Worked for a Hyatt Place, not corporate. Management was poor, with barely any oversight. Hotel was clean, coworkers were pleasant"
good,"I really love the Hyatt Hotel,  There a good place for advancement"
good,"Great for someone thats doesn't mind traveling, working eight hour shifts without breaks and (sometimes) 6 days a week. Really friendly staff."
good,The work was fun and enjoyable and it paid well but the culture was terrible. Managers work 6-7 days a week and expect the same from hourly staff. Turnover is very high due to management not respecting employes work life balance.
good,"I would only work for events such as concerts, parties, etc. I learned how to properly pat down a female or male to make sure they did not enter the premises with any illegal or deathly items. I worked for my professor from my college, who was a great mentor as well. My co-workers were also students as well as retired colleagues of my professor who were all interested in the same field and worked to build their own experience. I would have to say, being 5'2 weighing roughly 110lbs, the hardest part was being taken serious by patrons who were attending the events. The most enjoyable part was actually working for an event where famous people known worldwide would attend to."
good,"Sporadic schedule. Very hard to currently plan outside activities due to the constant working of split shifts. No work/life balance. Very cliquish culture. You either partake in social functions with mid-management and supervisors after work or be seen as virtual outsider.  Diversity in race but not diversity in character amongst front desk staff. All hired seem to be friends prior. Immediate department head has hot temperament with staff inside and outside of department and will berate you regardless of the presence of others. Positives are EXTREMELY positive. Over ten comp room nights at Hyatts across the globe. Great Friends and Family rate for employee's families. Health, Dental, Sick Days, etc. General Manager at this property is easy to approach and very friendly and hard working. Restaurant on property is excellent."
good,"Good benefits and perks, Working for hyatt was very rewarding but very demanding. Grand Hyatt has great General Manager. He is good leader and person"
good,"No day is alike with my job.  "
good,"I learned how to be a jack of all trades, but a master of none at this job.  I was Front Desk, but I also worked in housekeeping, kitchen, putting away stock, etc.  I was always able to lend a helping hand when asked, and even when I wasn't asked."
good,"Being Helpful to the colleagues."
good,"Plenty of work, stable, fun, hard to advance within company"
good,"co-workers, loved multi-tasking and loved working in customer service"
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to someone who doesn't want to break their back for $10.
good,"Needs structure, but is a good job for a fast paced lifestyle. Hotel deals are a must and the people are generally friendly. "
good,"Hyatt is a prestigious company and hotel brand name and image."
good,"This is a company with potential potential for advancement, but comes at the price of work/life balance."
good,a good company to work with. can know about the American standards of food and living. learned a lot of their food style.
good,"I usually work 5 days a week/40hrs a week. There are times the business is slow or not really busy, so i get laid off couple days. The management sometimes like to cut your hours if they see the business is slow. The most memorable moment when i was working here when i get promoted to bar attendant from dishwasher, some of my manager likes me, some of them maybe not. it depends on how you perform your job on the floor if they see you are doing a great job or not. The hardest part for me here when i worked with my fellow co-worker here it because sometimes we dont get along each other because each one of us has own way to do their job, we argued sometimes about things related to work especially engaging with guest/customer. For me this is the hardest job i've done in my life and more challenging. "
good,"A stronger management team and more teamwork would have been desirable. The work volume fluctuated massively, making it hard to reach the 40 hour mark each week."
good,A bit too much of the Micro Managing side. However other than that the line employees are very friendly almost family like. HR could use a bit more training
good,A good place to work in college but the salary is below average and there are not many benefits.
good,"work was busy but enjoyable. lot of back stabbers,think thats how to get ahead.dont know if thats part of management training.poor comunications between departments.they are making many personell changes.hope it helps.their bigest mistake was loosing me"
good,"Ive learned a lot from this compnay. If you are a person who needs advancement in hospitality, they will help you with that"
good,The Hyatt in Cambridge md was an okay job but they just talk too people any type of way. They also have certain people that they let get away with the things they do.The Hyatt managers their do not know how too talk too people and is also rude.
good,Simple job that requires just parking customers vehicles and assisting them with their luggage. You need to have good customer service in order to grow with this company.
good,"It was a place to learn about serving in the metropolitan area. The location was dynamic, a lot of traffic in the restaurant. Unfortunately the manager at the time was difficult"
good,"Busy day at the front desk multitasking is vital"
good,"Unfair treatment based off race with current management. The previous housekeeping manager was fair to everyone. "
good,"Hyatt in the UAE stands as a great hotel chain, saddly the management will absorb your talents for a very low salary. And a careless management where you will find all the departments running short of staff"
good,Çalışmış olduğum 13 yıl içerisinde hayat otelinde Çeşitli milletten ve kültürden insanlarla çalıştım bu benim için çok büyük bir kazanç oldu. Profesyonel anlamda çok büyük tecrübeler edindim.
good,"To be far this place is alright if you are a salary worker, however, front desk, doormen, drivers, concierge and other part-time positions are push to there limits. Many of us developed foot problems from long hours of standing and lack of days off. I once worked with an employee that work double shifts all the time and hourly wage changed depending on what he did not what he was hired as."
good,"super fast paced environment, very stressful restaurant but banquets was a bit more fun. management was so ruthless and not very understanding you were only good as long as it was beneficial to them"
good,"Management was a joke at the property I worked at. The manager was more concerned with being friends with his Front Desk Agents and promoting his friend’s wife who also worked at the hotel. Everything felt very “clique-y” and unprofessional."
good,"Other than having friendly staff members that would be all about the hyatt centric south beach back when i used to work for them , not sure if the hotel has become a better and less stressful palce to work at ."
good,"It was a great atmosphere to work in.  Lots of different types of people with multiple different positions.  I enjoyed my time working here, just wish they had more advancement."
good,Hyatt as a brand is not as well recognized as some other players in the industry. Hotel location is out of city centers and there is little room for advancement.
good,"Good place to work for""excellent benefits you jut have to deal with some of the supervisors and management ,you think you can trust them .but when you not a round they are disgusting your personal business, which is not a good thing to do other then ifs a good place to work ."
good,Management sucks. They do not care about family life.  The needs of the hotel come first. I wouldn't suggest anybody to work there unless they get a new GM.
good,"It was a fun job. A nice environment but very stressful. The tasks consist of constant moving up and down stairs. Jobs would not get done on time, due to the hotel not having enough laundry for the housekeepers to do their jobs. You would be rushed for jobs you were told about 5 min before you started. All around its a good job but they need more employees for the hotel jobs, to be ran correctly. The management team tries their hardest but sometimes they get just as fustrated as the housekeepers. But sometimes they can't control what they say, and HOW they say some things, to employees. It will come out harsh or disrespectful and the only time they apologize, is when someone has seen them be that way towards someone."
good,There's nothing fantastic about it but there's nothing absolutely terrible either. It's just kind of in the middle. Standards are lower than I would have expected from Hyatt.
good,"Little direction or directives given by Arnprior office manager.  Secrecy expected and demanded by Arnprior manager regarding head office demands or inquiries."
good,"Great concept for a Spa but lack of trust, management leadership  and appreciation of therapist and staff that works there."
good,This is a job just if you need work you won’t be able to get a promotion no matter what your education background is they will try to keep you in the same position into you complain about it and then they will promise you something and you still won’t get a promotion The pay is horrible and ours are horrible
good,"I went into Hyatt as a corporate management trainee.  When I completed my program, they were on a hiring freeze, but squeezed me in at a very low salary. I worked my butt off, sometimes 16 hours a day, and if I didn't get to eat 3 meals at work I would not have survived because the salary didn't match the cost of living in San Diego.  My next few promotions came with very little salary increases and eventually the amount of work I was putting in for the amount of money I was getting paid just wasn't worth it anymore."
good,"Good location, staff is easy to work with, lovely guests."
good,Nothing to mention as the hotels give us 15 hors to work every day without any benifits salary is very less 1500 AED per month which you can finish in one week only
good,I am very happy to be working for the first time as a hotelier.Many new things I can learn as a telephone operator.I can interact with many people from all over the world
good,Empresa cobra muito do funcionário e nao paga tão bem para isso.
good,"Service industry environment, everyday is different and challenging. Working with interns from other countries is a plus as you learn about other cultures and languages."
good,Not pleased with management. Not willing to do your job to the fullest. never recognizes time and worth. Not allowed overtime even though you are called in.
good,I felt little payoff for the hard work. Also I was working 14 hour shifts with no break before I had even turned 18 and other teenagers would sometimes not be able to go home until after midnight on school nights.
good,"They Hyatt Regency New Orleans has poor management. The GM is a egocentric man, who only cares about his mistresses and his fancy wine glasses. He is so far removed from the day-to-day operations, it is ridiculous."
good,"A lot of jobs put into one position.  on a regular day u check people in, you are also a bartender and a cook for room service. your day is very fast paced and designed for you to manage great customer service regardless of the circumstances."
good,Dealing with the fact that people or coming from all 50 states plus. I must say that you never know who or what you are going to encounter. I enjoy working in security.
good,It's more about getting along with the people than the job. To move up you need to be perfect 98% of the time and get along with management well. There is a cut throat kind of competition for hours.
good,Prepared meeting rooms and ballrooms.I learned team work is very important.The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was a short crew but we still strived to get it done .
good,"Management does not take a person role in employees"
good,"if you are looking for extra money this might be the place to work at, they offer on-call positions were you can pretty much choose your own schedule every week"
good,Management made the work days longer sometimes when the did not do their job correctly. There was more often than not an issue on their part that the employees had to pick up the slack for.
good,"It is a great experience to be part of the family. The Manager is great and very approachable but the thing is that you are not there to please everybody. You wake up early morning to go to work and make money bu there is alot of leisure time than making money in that job and I think if you are looking for an easy-going job, that might fit for you but for me I need a job that can compensate my needs and not just going to work and have nothing at the end of the day."
good,"Hyatt management team is not fair.  They never investigate any problem, just takes someone else;s word and then fires the person,  they have cliques and if you dont belong you are literally out"
good,Changes made it hard to stay focused on customer service when on property managers were changing or leaving for time off. Good overall company support from Hyatt and external management company.
good,"Fun people to work with. Be ready to work second and third shift often, (long hours during busy season) Upper management could use some work though. Did not emphasize a good work life balance."
good,"My experience at Hyatt was great the first few years and was the perfect environment for creativity and learning,  but this had declined as management changed and I felt the talent management within the business was very poor; concerned only with people who could talk the talk and not with those who walk the walk (who are normally the better side of the work force). Progression was difficult as the recruitment culture became 'find fresh eyes' as opposed to 'promote within' which is a shame because there was a number of extremely talented people already working there who already knew the business and how to improve it. "
good,"open the deparment  inspect rooms"
good,"there is no growth where im at , everything you had to learn on your on and on your own time. my location and position is not a place to be if you have a passion for what you do"
good,I good job for students however the pay to support a family is poor. You would not be able to afford health care for yourself yet alone for your children.
good,"They don't pay you most of the extra rooms you clean, they treated me great until this past year. They don't appreciate hard workers. Everything was great until Peabody sold the hotel to Hyatt."
good,"Smile ! work hard, helpful, kind, the hardest part of the job was less time for a lot of to do !!! the most enjoyable part of the job party for us !!!"
good,This job is a lot of fun you never know who you are going to see at this job. I got to work at the camp most of the time due to the fact I love kids and am good at keeping them busy. You can try several different jobs here until you find your good fit
good,"Typical day consist of interacting with different vendors,insuring quality and compliance of their products. I have learned alot about the hospitality industry,that i will take with me as i transition back into"
good,"Benefits with the current property management company are really good.  On-site Management could be more supportive.  They seem less concerned about their team members, and are not always there to support their team when the team needs assistance.  The departments are highly segregated, so it makes the atmosphere more of fend for yourself."
good,"Management is never around, never an MOD on weekends. they dont want to give you benefits. they also get frustrated when you ask management for help. management wont  help at the front desk on crazy rushes. You will work front desk, kitchen, and gallery all in the same day."
good,Front office was always a mess. Some good managers. Tons of turnover. I worked in valet. I was often micromanaged and suggestions to better the company were often ignored.
good,Interesting place to work. Diverse culture. Poor Management. It was a very corporate environment full of double standards. Also Union ran. Not much room for advancement.
good,When i arrived at the hyatt Place they were under new management the turn around rate was as soon as they were hired they were fired about a two week turn around.
good,"The work day was somewhat disorganized and in need of some time management review and assessment to figure a more efficient and effective strategy to accomplish key projects to conclude for the environment to grow and accomplish success. I was given the insight as to how a manager should and should not conduct their time and organizational skills. Management needed to collaborate for conductively to reach project resolution. Co-workers were in need of embracing the basics of professional and ethical work skills and that it was a team environment and not an ""I"" environment. "
good,"It is safe work place,everyone is nice and friendly and one big team."
good,"Hyatt brought new leadership to the marketing department about 18 mos ago that has had a toxic impact on culture and overall morale. They are smart and certainly know their stuff, though they don't understand hospitality. There is little effort made to help associates create a work life balance. The expectation is you are always available and working. Hyatt as always had a great culture of great people that work hard but always knew how to have fun. That has changed significantly which has led to a tremendous amount of talent walking out the door. Sometimes even without a job lined up."
good,"Management is ok, but needs to be stricter on peoples, example stricter on attendance, cleanliness, and attitudes. Some of the employees who are my equals are very bossy and act like they are a supervisor even though they are not, management knows about these people and will not do anything about them."
good,beautiful property.  As an hourly associate the pay is not good.  the benefits itself are comparable to most other properties.  tey seem to have a good management program if you want to make Hyatt your world.
good,Higher employers only care for themselves. do not care about lower management and daily workers. Care more about revenue then people though the culture is suppose to be based on the people of the company.
good,The management here was terrible. They were so money hungry and didn't care about their employees. The manager was extremely rude to her employees and at times even rude to some customers.
good,there are to many managers that just guess on what policy's are and have no accountability when they get someone wrote up. it is a far better place to work if your a home agent
good,"Its a great place to work when it comes to fast pace. Great employees and a laid back atmosphere between employees. The hotel is connected to the casino, so we get casino business and the celebs that have events there. Pay rate is way above minimum wage and is highest among same related places in the area."
good,"A regular job, underpaid as a gallery host not only works the front desk but cooks, cleans, bartends, and drives. Management at this property needs to work more on making sure employees have everything they need to accomplish their work."
good,"Overall the hotel was well kept together, and affordable. For the most part every customer enjoyed their stay. The job provided health benefits and a lot personal time."
good,"Could be an enjoyable place to work, except for too much attention to the business of others and starting rumors. Drug use is prominent were as if there was a drug test, many would fail including some in management!!"
good,"Management was poor on execution business plan and how they wanted to operate hotel. Required to do housekeeping, Mechanics and other duties even though job description implies as a FRONT DESK CLERK. Pay sucks 9.25 and having a .10 or .15 cent raise after a year plus of hard work which is a slap in the face and shows how much they value their employees especially the good ones; No Loyalty or Appreciation for their staff which lead to my resignation. Manager's asked the world from you but was not appreciated nor shown by giving advancement opportunities when they clearly needed it, if you want your business to grow you have to pay and promote within as the companies stresses. Also, Hotel condition was poor causing many issues that my coworkers and I had to deal with which in result caused upset guests making it hard to please guests and had to make temporary fixes to the hotel to get by daily or weekly."
good,"as a gallery host, you: check in and check out guests, make reservations, tend to bar, make food, set up for meeting, guest services, and drive the van"
good,"It was very demanding,  a lot of roles that a Guest Service Agent performs. The gallery host at a Hyatt Place, checks in and out guests, cooks, serves food, serves beverages, and serves alcohol. Must also be responsible for cash handling. The team here is not very much a team, more like a group of individuals with their own agendas to fulfill. You really never know how management feels about you until they have to speak to you. Very fake environment to work in and around. This hotel in particular is a franchise and the owners are two different Hotel management companies that are based in the mainland. Also this hotel does not keep things up to code with food safety laws and inspections. The management always knows when the food and safety inspector is coming and cleans the whole kitchen from top to bottom the day before. In other restaurants I've worked for, the restaurant was always cleaned from top to bottom everyday because the staff knew a health and safety inspection was random. I would think twice before excepting a job here and if you HAVE to except it, stay a few months and then leave. Trust me!"
good,"Great benefits"
good,"Good place to work, just needed something better. Feel as if management needed to get more involved with each department and actually listened to the employees complaints."
good,"Good Company to work for. Good people, good environment.  Good place to start a career in hospitality."
good,"A typical day at work includes but is not limited to lots of customer service interactions, patrols and dispatching. I learned a lot about computers, people and incident reports. My co-workers and some of the management team were like family and genuinely cared about my progress. The hardest part of the job was separating emotions from facts. The most enjoyable part was interaction with people of varied diversities."
good,"a typical day consisted of setting up and breaking down breakfast, lunches, dinners and snack breaks for guests attending weddings, seminars or convetions and as a restaurant supervisor I got to do a little more guest service reviews, profit improvement reports, menu up dates and/or modifications and event planning. The hardest part was how demanding the hours were (at the time my children were much younger)"
good,"Its a high end hotel that caters to corporate clients.  The management team focused a lot of attention on the guest, and invested very little time training their associates to preform at maximum levels.  There was very little opportunity for internal advancement.  I work with a friendly group of people.  The hardest part of the job was working the overnight shift.  The night crew was never included in any activities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people daily."
good,I was happy in compleating daily tasks and also being able to train and develop peers. Although once you cross the Clique you are done for.
good,"only the duty hours is 12hrs,nd salary is nt according to that."
good,Amazing staff and coworkers. Would like it if we had more opportunity to advance within the company.
good,Good job for learning on-the-fly because of lack of training.
good,This was my first work place which thought me lot about this industry and how to work in team.
good,This company has the potential to be a great froce but bias is a big issue. The work can be demanding and the hours can be long but that is an excepted with little issue from most of the workers I've encountered. The issue that I find is the class system that is in place in this company. Different departments that work together on a daily basis have serious respect and communication issues.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I worked hard, did the job of many others and it was unfortunate that I was not given other options beyond being laid off. I was led to believe that my talents were appreciated and much needed."
good,In my time with Hyatt I watched a lot of great employees leave for jobs with better benefits and pay.  It was almost impossible to maintain a positive work culture when key players are constantly being replaced.
good,"The management is really bad. They talk about you to other employees behind your back and do not listen to what you have to say. They will say something is a rule and then 20 minutes later they are changing their mind to something else. Therefore, all of their workers become confused on what they should really do or not do."
good,"I wish i would've recorded some of their demeanor to show how over the top and rude these obviously non educated staff members can get! The women are extremely petty and clueless, literally so easy to get them caught up with their personal vs professional aspects. I thank God for allowing me the opportunity to further my education and my spirituality because if you are weak these demons will pick your mind.."
good,"job was fulfilling, coworkers were team players, part time hours were good, but departmental management required professionalism. part time positions were eliminated and I am not looking for full time employment at this time."
good,At this Hyatt there is little movement up towards management unless you become friends with the managers and show them you want to take on extra work. The job load at times can become really stressful. especially since in this city our hotel is convention based. Hardest part about job is the hours management will not notice the hours unless you say something.
good,You have to keep your head down and not socialize. They use everything against you. A lot of people are two faced there as well. The company isn't bad but the employees are garbage.
good,"At first it was a really great experience. But afterwards, I started to feel like this place wasn’t meant for me and the chef (not executive) is mean. Don’t get me wrong, he was the way he was in order to help and push you to get where you want to be. But afterwards I started to feel very uncomfortable around him. "
good,"Lack of recognition, pay not equal to tasks performed, long hours with no regard for home life, not enough personnel for my department, short lunches, terrible menu's for employee meals eventhough it's  free, new management seems distant, impersonable."
good,We had a couple of miscommunications that led to me leaving but overall it was a decent experience though it's somewhat high pressure so if you don't work well or think on your feet it might be difficult
good,"the workplace culture is nice,diversity. but the management itself is poor, we always lack of linen when busy day. too much pressure from  executive manager to keep the room clean in such a short time."
good,Not consistent with promises. Lack of proper work duties and advancement. Management are afraid to do the right thing and speak up. Cant advance here properly.
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to get everything you need for the guest while still learning the system. The people there are nice and helpful. However the job requires you to stand the whole shift
good,I don't think I would like to work there again if I was given that choice. Management really didn't care for their employees. Lots of Drama in the work place instead of actual work getting done.
good,"The upper management doesn't provide a positive work experience. The middle management helps to keep things together but they take a lot of heat from the indecisive and mismanaged upper management. The stress trickles down to the employees as well. "
good,"Good place to work, the people were nice & helpful. The manager was good & kept on his toes, I didn't wanna work full-time but it was worth it. The Hyatt was a great place to work & they offer good benefits"
good,"I first get the three tier cart and put all the juices,milks,fruits and breads. Then i go set everything out in the breakfast area throughout breakfast time i make sure everything stays full. I set up the busing station so guest can put way their dishes. Sometimes guest don't put up their dishes so i go and put their dishes away and clean the table and chairs."
good,Fun job if you like being bored 60% of the time. When it was busy you are able to make a lot of tips and run a lot of cars but when it’s slow you will do nothing. I try to take advantage of whatever way I can make a dollar. Hustle is key at this property
good,"Great work place, when arriving at work there’s a meeting that takes place every morning before work was started. The environment was so positive. The hardest part of the job was inspection time lol."
good,I was at Hyatt for a number of years and went through a lot with my kitchen team but the overall management of the Birmingham branch kitchen wise was not excellent and had a negative impact on the overall running of the kitchen.
good,"Has its good and its bad but overall I would only recommend Hyatt if you are only looking for good benefits and no life outside of work. Otherwise, its just like every other hotel or restaurant. Just don't expect to get any promotions, they don't work that way."
good,"I did not enjoy working for this company due to a few reasons! The culture of unprofessionalism, ""buddy/favoritism"" with advancement, etc. I was stressed each day and was my happiest the day I resigned!"
good,Pesado y no es flexible el horario. Piden cumplir con lo requerido pero normalmente no hay material para completarlo.
good,"If you're looking for a good place to start your career, or if you want to keep moving up in a position, or striving for relocation, this is a good place to do that"
good,"Depending on your how often you're scheduled and which department, you can get burnt out pretty quickly. Cash flow is good but the amount of work you do can be unjustified. Management is lacking, there is a sense of a ""free for all"". Good discounts and perks though."
good,Management can be pretty a hearache. Work accommodation were sometime not what they should be but you get free room pretty good insurance which you pay for of course and 401 options. If you can work and go home and keep your personal life seperate and ignore a lot of the nonsense its an ok job.
good,"When I worked here, it was in a state of flux. As time went on, management began to stabilize, and frankly, not change much. It's a small potatoes hotel, with tire travelers, people looking for deals; high demand with little reward."
good,"A typical day at work will be supervisor talking about other employees and the other supervisor, other than that it was laid back cause everybody else got along. I learned to not sit down with your supervisor and talk about other people and to always report it to a higher manager"
good,Very good. Average of 24-45 dollars per hour.worked on a tip pool basis. Server does coffee break service and food and beverage service.Tips pooled weekly and divided according to the number of servers and the number of hours worked for the week.
good,The owners do not believe in providing a living wage for the workers.  Too many contract employees.  Not possible to be hired by the Hyatt without quitting original job first then wait 30 days to begin application process.
good,"No causul work, shifts are not maintain, nusring students are not given work here but environment is good to work. Acoordi g to the age rate is paid which didn't satisfied me"
good,"The managers act like they care about you but they don't. We are always short on supplies and we are always running out of sheets and towels. The hotel cannot accommodate more than 130 check outs, we just don't ever have the linen. Its insane. The house attendant is expected to do a 3 person job as far as stocking the closets with supplies and whatever small linen delivery we have. They are also expected to maintain the housekeepers carts as well and also wash glasses when they were told originally that it was going to be given to someone else to do. We all perpetually need help because we have so much to do that we just can't catch up. The work environment is very high stress and anxiety inducing beyond words. The housekeepers have so many rooms to clean per lady that some housekeepers are in tears because they are exhausted. Management has unrealistic expectations for staff and very high turnover rates because of the toxic work environment."
good,I thought taking this job would be a great opportunity for me to further my career but instead it diminished it. I was promised the executive chef position in a few months but later found out that was a lie and working with all union cooks was a complete nightmare. If you are ever thinking of getting into a hotel with a union    DO NOT
good,This position is ideal for working students.  The flexibility of hours offered by the hotel to cater to university attending individuals is of great help.
good,"Typically busy with international business people, Management is present, Good team of people throughout the hotel. Still young hotel.I most enjoy interacting with the guest, being on the plaza you see a great spectrum of people."
good,The hotel environment is a good place to work but it can be exhausting. Working with the public has it's ups and downs but overall Hyatt was a good company to work for and I had a good experience.
good,"I loved it at first, but it became clear over time that the 'people-first' culture was more talk than action. My colleagues and I frequently felt pressured to stay late, which would've been fine if it hadn't turned into an every day thing. It felt like management were disconnected and unconcerned with the workload of the non-management."
good,I enjoyed working at the Hyatt. People were great. Meet lots of different people from very different back grounds. Made a few life time friends. It was also really fun to interact  with the different groups that game through the hotel.
good,"White Lodging starts off as a wonderful company when you get hired, full of vigor, fun and care. After about a couple of months and no time with your family, you determine that maybe working a job that only requires 40 hours would be better for you."
good,the people are not very responsible with there work and when you say anything the management they will tell you it is ok not to bother with it .just keep working.
good,So I worked at the Hyatt Regency for almost a year and I would say the job was decent. I think for serving the pay could've been better as in like the base pay is very little and the job was tip based. With the job being tip based some nights were extremely busy so you made quite a bit of money but again you could've made even more if your base pay was higher. As far as hours go i got a good amount but i would've liked to work less holiday hours. I worked every single holiday from may-january. It was completely unfair and the management didn't work with me on it whatsoever. The job itself wasn't too difficult and the management could be better. My favorite part was nights you wouldn't expect would end up being busy and you make quite a bit of money
good,"Is a small hotel so everyone is like family in there, but there is too many politics or too much bureaucracy, so in order to advance you have to be friends with the right people. Balancing your life is quite hard depending your role in that place."
good,"Overall depending on your position you can like or even grown in this place, unfortunately all is about politics or bureaucracy in this place, benefits are amazing and health benefits are not the best but they are not the worst as well. Hospitality is a really hard work, there is great benefits to it but you have to put up a lot from the guest and managers."
good,"I loved my job for the first 5 months. It was nice to work for a company that empowered you to make decisions. But now they have cracked down, for lack of better words at the moment, and have been criticizing the decisions we are making."
good,"There is a positive experience for ever person. This is a great company to work for, its just a matter of finding your fit and a property which works for you."
good,"make schedule out for housekeeper, billing, order supplies for housekeepers to do there jobs. Take on guest complaints."
good,"Hyatt Place is a fun place to work in the aspect of having great coworkers and meeting new people all the time. It's like having a family away from home. The only thing is they work you to death and they pay you horribly for it. As a gallery host you do the front desk, cook, clean, wash dishes, set up meeting rooms, serve at parties.... you're literally doing EVERYTHING for pennies."
good,"I was an on-call server, so there wasn't much opportunity for me. There are few benefits offered. They did offer a room rate discount, which was nice. I think its hard to rate a ""hotel"". Your experience anywhere depends on who you directly work with."
good,"Love my team, management very poor. They only care about the hotel scores, not their employees. My colleagues are the only ones that kept me sane for so long."
good,"during busy and always focus to the food because that is buffet."
good,"this is a place that taught me absolutely nothing, it was just focused on making money rather than building a strong team. you work there with little support from management"
good,"Everyone was very nice but not enough training at all.  There was never a full tour of the entire property, but we were expected to know the views of each specific room. They would just do for you so that you did not take long for guests.  Then you were never taught how to perform the task properly and on your own.  There were very nice managers but there needs to be more that meets the eye."
good,"The ability to work from home with Dell/Hyatt was a great benefit."
good,"Great place to work in mumbai was the first job. the growth is slow and  only so much can be done in terms of that, I joind as an inter as a part on my degree."
good,My immediate managers lacked effective people skills. The work environment was quick-paced and competitive. Lacked room for learning opportunities. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with direct reports and Hyatt guests.
good,I stayed here for 11 years. Over the years different management and owners. I had a good time most of my time here because I worked overnight audit and was alone most of the time.
good,"It's just balanced. The co workers are very friendly. I just wish they have a nice uniform for the food attendants. Overall, it is still a nice place."
good,"A typical day at work was supporting seven Leisure Sales Manager in the state and three Business Development Managers in the Mainland.  This job was a new experience for me and it taught me a lot about the Wholesale business side of the hotel.  My first Manager had good work ethics and taught me all I know, also she was very hands on.  My second Manager was not very hands on. The hardest part of the job was supporting so many people both internally and externally.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people that I worked and interacted with."
good,"Hyatt was a great place for me to work at initially but what it really came down to was that every manager that comes into the F&B department stays for about a year and then switches restaurant, department or even relocates to another Hyatt due job advancement and such."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I enjoyed working with co workers and leaving my area in a clean condition. The Hyatt hotel as a upstanding place of service.
good,this employer don't care about their workers they just do a systematic procedure that ensure profitable returns for the company .even if you go above and beyond to help make this happen there is no recognition.
good,"The Hyatt is an awesome place to work if you love helping/assisting and working along side people."
good,Fun people to work with it was just a headache dealing with people on the phone and having to take care of people with bad attitudes sometimes you didn't want to do the job
good,"its ok its typically moderately busy throughout the week "
good,"It is challenging to interact with different cultural foreigners, who speak different languages and their religions. I have a great learning from them."
good,"Its a cool place to work, the benefits are good. However if you are not used to a fast paced environment this isn't the place for you. Also the management is okay, sometimes i feel as if my voice isn't heard or cared about."
good,"worked 6am to 2pm and made reservations and assisted guest with issues they might have. Helped new hires with questions."
good,"Its hard to feel stable when things around you are forever changing,"
good,"The work place definitely does offer some really good benefits and the hotel is highly organised. The main problem arises when it comes to learning new methods or ways to cook something. The staff is not willing to adapt to change quickly. Nevertheless, the chefs do take time to teach what they already know and have patiently taught me numerous things."
good,"Always busy, everyone's serious. Don't reward their employees. Work long hard hours, there's no highlights to working there. Pros, the ladies (other workers) are very nice."
good,It is a really cool job but you would never think that one place can tire you of the things you like so much. If you need a fun side job it may work for you
good,I enjoyed some of my moments working here but mostly hate it. i would probably never work a hotel job again. too many rude people to answer to and specifically management here wasn't good at all.
good,"Hyatt Place wasn't technically my direct employer. We were essentially franchised through Lodgeworks. Directly working through Hyatt would be better. The main issue is we had no HR. No manager could explain the benefits, raises, any employee issues that came up.. so it made it a difficult working environment. If you are looking to get employed at Hyatt make sure Lodgeworks isn't the franchise owner."
good,"Bartending UK games, weddings, concerts, etc. a fun working environment. For the most part, the staff is professional. Not very many opportunities to grow and advance in Lexington, KY."
good,it was delightful going to work there. the staff and crew were very respectful and friendly. The free breakfasts were super. the hotel itself was great.
good,Work days are typical okay. but the frown upon you having a second job to pay your bills but wont pay you what you deserve. they want you to have open availability but some don't but the don't they get what time off the want and schedule.
good,"1. weekends and holidays that's the typical of work"
good,No hay posibilidad de progresar ya que el equipo de trabajo ya vino armado de otro hotel y no valoran conocimientos
good,A typical day at work was get to work clock in and then go to the ramp and greet and help guests to my full ability and rank. management was all that great they promised so much but did very little to back it up. The hardest part was sharing tips because i would  work my butt off to just put my tips that i earned in the box with people that did nothing. The best part was the guest that i met while working there.
good,"Associates are great to work with. Busy hotel with lots of territory to cover. Business continues to increase, great place for meetings or a relaxing family vacation."
good,Its a ok experience for u to start but eventually u will find better else where. U will not get the opportunity to advance in this work place because they put to many rooms on u
good,"During the time that I was with Hyatt, I overall enjoyed working my time with them. I have a lot of great memories and I was given the opportunity to better my knowledge and skills."
good,"All but one person made it miserable for everyone else to work there. Micromanaging was a main issue there. If they were removed from the workplace, everyone would be happier."
good,"Great place good management , great team , working on weekends also I was working with one more person cleaning rooms , hallways, suites, great supervisor"
good,"Maybe it was because I had never worked at a hotel before, but I found this place morally difficult to stomach. People who booked a reservation and made a simple mistake on location and needed to cancel the reservation (within the correct time frame) were never refunded money. I found it wrong and awful to do to people. All in the name of keeping your numbers up."
good,"This review is for the Hyatt Corporate Office. It used to be a great company which was focused on the employees. Since 2010 after the company went public, things had changed. Every 2 years there are reorganizing and people are being asked to leave. Their work is given to those who are still employed, and it is expected that they do both jobs in a place of one without any salary increases. The company has many great ideas but only on paper. They are tying to show that they care for their employees and are very work/life balance focused, but with the amount of work it is impossible to succeed. Therefore, people are overworked, are expected to stay overtime, and yet they are not compensated for it. Due to all of the above, many employees who had been with the company for many years, are leaving."
good,"When I first began working at the Hyatt it was a good and fair workplace. I learned how to solve guess problems, the opera system with checking guess in and out, and how to make reservations. I also learned bartending and food prepping."
good,Manage construction team including external consultants. Good work team who support each other. There is no typical day therefore start and end of day can be very different depending on the projects planned for day. However it always starts with planning priorities of the day and working to achieve these targets.
good,"When I started at the Hyatt Lisle it was run by Hyatt now its a franchise with none of the Hyatt procedures or training. The orientation I went thru was two days and it made you feel like you were part of a great company, it was eye opening because they did not pull any punches about how hard the jobs are but the reward is limitless."
good,"As a Price Line Guest of hyatt you will not get the same good treatment as a Guest that's paying regular price's. The Management treats the employee's as a lesser, its like a two teams working against one another."
good,I enjoyed my colleagues and other staff. not much room for advancement under new management. I enjoy helping customers and providing them with quality hospitality.
good,"A typical day right now is returning phone calls and emails, attending morning standup meeting, prospecting for new business, courtesy calls to current customers, outside sales calls, notes in customer database."
good,"A typical day would start off with you completing a checklist (which was the same checklist everyday) of simple things to complete. Management definitely favored certain employees if you aren't a favorite they watch like a hawk. Co-workers were generally cool and helpful to one another. The hardest part of the job was keeping people happy, even when you think you've done your best you haven't in their eyes. The most enjoyable part was the location and guest."
good,The hotel is nice for myself because it is near my home and it is nice that we work with the Pittsburgh Steelers & Penquins  .Having learn my customer service skills over the years i know that is why guest keep coming back .
good,"Good Team means Good quality in work.  If your team is strong then you have nothing to worry about."
good,A typical day at work would be bringing keys down from the cashier booth if there is any. I would come down to the garage where the key booth is and make sure those keys are in the system. After I would perform an audit to make sure every key that is hanged up is there and that there are no missing keys. The management here is very poor. I did not like it at all. They never gave me a chance to valet and prove myself that I am worthy to become a valet. Most of my co-workers are lazy and I want to work in an environment where everyone hustles and works their butt off. It sucks sitting in the booth watching them walk to every pull wishing that could be me running to the car and delivering it to the guest as fast as possible. The hardest part is when we get slammed with cars while there are cars waiting to be pulled. I don't enjoy my job here at the Hyatt in Huntington Beach.
good,"The typical day when I arrive at work begins with organization. we have a 15 minute meeting everyday before we leave for our assignment so everyone has an idea of our daily goals. Which jobs we are working on, who is their and details such as payment plans ect. After the meeting we all head to assess the jobs and make sure the jobs have the proper materials and that sub contractors show up. We babysit 2-3 jobs typically in the same area all day bouncing back and forth. If a job is complete when ask the home owner to inspect the residence after our initial inspection and see about getting paid. We all meet back at the show to get the lady in the office details of each job and our notes on each of them."
good,I am at a small property with very little in the way of opportunity.We are typically short staffed because it is hard to find people who will  work hard for not much pay.
good,i wouldn't recommend as they dont deliver what they promise. can improve their culture of work atmosphere. and way of staff treatments.
good,"I would give the housekeepers clean sheets ,towels and pillow cases.I also took away their dirty linen and dumped their trash..The hardest part of the job was keeping up with my work after helping out the housekeepers with their work."
good,"they are well under staff for the volume of customers. They dont pay to well for all of the responsibilities. They make you work 2 or more stations on your own with vary little prep,or prep time. Over all you do learn to make things perfect in a stressful matter. Management is cool as long as you play the game. most people only can stand working here for at least a 6 months to a year."
good,"I did enjoy my time at the Hyatt Regency NO. high standards, beautiful property, long hours, hard work, seems a little understaffed most of the time. Management is pushed very hard, associates are pushed very hard. "
good,"Located next to a freeway with heavy vagrant foot traffic. Great back lawn area but layout is challenging, as well as the service levels in the restaurant and banquets."
good,"things to improve upon-hiring new people, respect, and being a good role model to the staff. enjoy the ability to move to another hyatt corporation."
good,"As I'm housekeeper, I start my day with an briefing, daily system generated reports. I learn every day something new."
good,"horaires s'échelonnant de 7h à 23h."
good,My coworkers are the best part about work.  Research the brands within the portfolio and pick the one that you will fit best.
good,This is a great transitional job with good potential to save money. I received a lot of great customer service experience and skills. However the company is constantly changing policies and it's difficult to keep up. There is a high turnover rate.
good,"Though this job has an excellent starter pay, with benefits coming in after 3 months, its tough being a new employee here. I have so far gotten just graveyard shifts due to seniority. There are too many people working here for there to be enough hours during the day, or even after September. You will need a part time job on the side, even if they promise you ""regular work""."
good,"Overall, guests rule this location. Never staffed enough during busy season. Dance competitions overwhelm during season being that this location is right next door to the Lakeland Center, where most of the events during the busy season take place. Maintenance does the best that they can to keep up with requests and necessary repairs, but are so constantly busy with hotel issues that it has trouble keeping guests happy. Don't even think about trying to get assistance with anything from management, you will either get brushed off or fired. Managers target employees to fire if they decide that they don't like you after hiring. Saw this happen 4 times before it happened to me just shy of my 90 days. I got great marks up until I was just due to hit my 90 days and then all of the sudden I have complaints???"
good,"Always on the go, never enough time to fully complete a job, running from the desk to the kitchen to rooms to the bar. The work schedule is never consistent. A lot of working nights, then a morning shift"
good,"This job seems great when you first start out. For me I love to work with people and making them happy so i enjoy my job. Its management and the lack of help. Mangement has changed 3 times since ive been here. Front desk does the front desk, the bar, starbucks, and we make food but yet we make 2 dollars less than other hotels because we are under pillar. Insurance will be taken away from you if you cant make two weeks both equal 32. they however do not explain that to you when they are trying to get you to get the insurance they just say one week within the 3 months has to be above 32. only enjoyable thing was the guest that i could make smile. the children i made laugh and everyone i was able to make feel like they were home"
good,"I got along with my coworkers and they became friends eventually. We had very busy days during high season that could be stressfull but we would overcome those moments working as a team. The hardest part of the job was to be nice to hard guests that sometimes were rude, and the most enjoyable was when guests noticed your good work and were happy with your service."
good,awesome work place relaxed job nothing to major non demanding work schedule advancement is fairly easy for some
good,"I liked working here, fun environment, met lots of different people."
good,Management isn't the best. Definitely doesn't appreciate their employees and is always looking for the easy way out and always willing to point a finger to place blame.
good,"Hard work, but fun people to work with. Staff needs better training and supervision, but overall it's a good group of people to work with."
good,"I start my day off handing out room assignments. Then inspecting any vacant clean rooms from the previous night. Recently, for the last 7 monthes, I have stripped rooms in the AM to help keep my staff at at their scheduled finish times at the end of the day. I inspect rooms the rest of the day. I have learned perseverence and keeping my personality to myself. Those are two very large things to have to contend with. I get along with most of my management team. But must say that I am at odds with my new General Manager over frequent changes he makes in all departments at the last minute. My management team are my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the 50-60 hour work weeks for little salary. Plus the daily stress of keeping up with the Hyatt standard with rooms that havent been renovated in seven years. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a 8-10 hour workday and good reviews."
good,Hyatt as a company has a wonderful culture and lots of opportunity.  Rochester struggles to follow the same ideals.
good,I had the opportunity to traverse multiple departments and gained a vast array of knowledge and experiences. It was a challanging and interesting experience.
good,Check In the guest left from Pm Shift
good,"I first started out in Laundry so for about 4 months I did washing, drying, folding, filling the linen closets, help clean rooms if needed."
good,"Loved my job as an event planner/coordinator. Executive Management did not recognize outstanding performance, only liked to point out minor flaws in their managers. Benefits were amazing. Worked long hours and worked long stretches without a day off."
good,"Hyatt has a great product and say they are behind their employees making it a great place to work. That may be well and good for individual hotels, both owned & managed, managed or franchised. They turn out not to be totally loyal to you when you have been loyal to them, particularly in the aftermath of the last reduction in staff when many people with 30 years or more in service were let go. In my case, almost 23 years. From a Corporate standpoint, there is a lot to be learned, as it is not just one hotel and that staff you are dealing with. As Hyatt intends to become more global, they will find they will have more individuals who remain more overworked than they already are, and may have another mass exodus on their hands, besides all the bad publicity based on the stands taken with Unite Here for those who were let go with Hyatt on the Union side of things. Those let go as I mentioned were non-union employees. If this is the way of things with all lovely facilities and smiles to the public when you arrive to one of Hyatt's many properties, look behind the smile & see what really may be going on."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Hyatt and it was wonderful helping customers from all walks of life. I liked my co-workers. Unfortunately, the nature of the business required 13 to 16 hour shifts up to 3 days per week, and I was constantly tired on my time off. It just was not the life for me. Nothing personal towards the Hyatt."
good,Bartended and covered barista responsibilities. Poor management at all levels.
good,"Proper systems were implemented in the working culture. Standards were high and very detailed oriented, Friendly workmates but workload is heavy, long working hours. Need to be flexible."
good,"Started collected tips, which is why I left, along with 6 other serving staff. Owner was too hands-on, and would not allow the F&B Manager to perform his job, which was frustrating for the servers and manager alike."
good,"Hyatt is a great place to work however the managers and HR have much to be desired. They will always side with management and if you are not one of the “in” crowd or a former AOL employee don’t think for a second your going to advance. If you complain against one of the “in” crowd managers. They will get a slap on the wrist and you will get written up, until they have enough to fire you  91/2 years and I was gone just like that"
good,"When hired i was promised benefits and extra training and i received none. Staff is great, management is not. Miscommunication between co-workers and at first no one properly showed me how to do my job."
good,A wonderful banquet team with a lot of heart and very knowledgeable they  will help and will go the 100% for all clients - I could not ask for a better team
good,Management has changed ive heard but it was awful other than the immediate manager in restaurant who sadly has quit.  The whole place is stressful and incredibly fast paced at times.  Many servers broke down and quit some crying.  Though if your good at your job you get the good shifts and make an insane amount of money.  Even with all the bad stuff if your a good server definately take this job its the highest paying server job in lexington.
good,"When I first started in 2000, it was a great place to work, Salary for Job is not the best but it was a job. I have seen several Management changes but the current Management are not the best. I had handed my notice in but left early due to lack of help from the management, I left a week early, I would not recommend anyone to work there with the current management"
good,Management doesn't promote from within. No advancement opportunities. Low morale in the IT department. Rampant favoritism and a few alcoholics drinking in the middle of the week is a normal thing.
good,"I was able to meet and help new people almost everyday. sometimes it was fun, other days it was difficult. on a typical day i would help people with luggage and directions to their meetings and/or restaurants near by."
good,I maintained different hotel rooms each day that needed re cleaned and new bedding. And other things updated. Always cleaned. And maintained.  I also kept up with my inventory on my housekeeping cart
good,The job I worked was good but the communication between different groups is so bad it makes your job less desirable. Pay is not very competitive and getting a decent raise is like pulling teeth.
good,It’s fun and all working til you realize that casual employees are not appreciated. It’s a new hotel when I started so management has a lot to work out.
good,"Not a hard job when come to work and do your job"
good,The job started great and I worked with a friend. Then the head boss cut our hours even though we were promised full time hours and ended up only getting 25 hours a week.
good,A typical day for me at times were slow and it was very hard to find something else to do when everything has been done.  I've learned patience.  The hardest part of my job cleaning the men's bathroom.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the guest.
good,"Hyatt was ok the establishment taught me not to go to  human resources , against a powerful manager, The managemebt team looked out for riff raff managers."
good,"its not bad just wished the management was a little improved. Beautiful hotel with an extensive selection of pool areas to choose from. The staff was friendly and attentive, delivering a truly relaxing experience.  The conference food and amenities were excellent. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the high cost of basics"
good,Good company to work for. Unfortunately the property I work for isn’t the greatest. Out of touch management making decisions that negatively effect all staff but betters their careers.
good,"Hyatt is a good company to work for, allot of benefits and opportunity to grow, however it depends on individual property and in this case this is ""one of them"". The hotel does not believe in training their employees, its basically jump ship with no structure or manuel to guide you in you everyday work. Also the company has an issue with its culture and identity which makes it hard to do your job."
good,"this is a face paced and highly interactive job in which you have the ability to get first hand experience in the field of hospitality, This is a great job, especially during the summer. This job allows you to put forth . variety of skill sets,"
good,Their policies were not very straight forward. Make sure you get the understanding you need so you do not break any policies that were not fully explained. Even when asking multiple times to explain.
good,The pay was horrible for the work they needed done. Management was cool to a certain extent but things changed and they got worst. Employees were fun to work with.
good,You get great training leading into the position. You then get additional training for the more advanced responsibilities. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Decent opportunity to changing roles and doing a job off the phones due to internal jobs opening.
good,"Hyatt itself is good hotel chain to work for. But the golf side of it is not all its cracked up to be. The environment is fun, but the pay stinks. Unless you are giving lessons every day and a few on your days off, you are looking at a whooping 23k-26k a year. Here in SD that does not work which is why I have left. Hyatt itself brings in enough revenue but cant pay golf staff a decent wage to make a living. $20 for a sleeve of golf balls and minimum wage is pretty much what most people get. Management have been here for a combined 30 years and don't show signs of leaving. So if you want to promote moving or relocating is a very likely possibility. Honestly if the pay was better per hour, I would have better outlook and be more motivated. But it is tough knowing Im going to spend 8 hours at a place and get paid less than 98 percent of golf professionals in San Diego. If you have a few roommates and can afford it, this would be an amazing place to work."
good,A very friendly environment to work in with diverse cultures. Good  direct manager. Love working in hotels as you don't just bump into workmates but guests and the like
good,"Needs more pay for the cost of living and job requirements, front desk agents at Hyatt house strictly work the front desk while a host at Hyatt place works the front desk while also bartending, barista, shuttle driving, cooking, and also providing essential customer service in a quick timely fashion. I feel that the pay should reflect the job duties provided."
good,"I took incoming calls for information on Hyatt hotels and made reservations."
good,"Spotting incompetence is simple. Look for the people who know full well what they need to change about themselves to be more productive but refuse to do so."
good,"Going a lot better now, than when I first started. Hopefully it just gets better. Working hard to improve quality and performance, maybe with a lot of hard work, determination, and diligence, we will enhance the whole work environment."
good,"high turnover of the employees "
good,"after doing building maintenance  for  more than 10 years,  I failed  because of worn out hip--couldnt walk fast enuff to inspect/repair rooms"
good,My typical day starts by greeting guests as they enter and leave the Hotel. We try to deliver valeted vehicles quickly and as safely as possible. We are the first and last point of contact for the majority of guests. We do our best to make that experience enjoyable.
good,Hyatt is a great company to work for. Just be prepared to work long hours and have your schedule be all over the place. I have learned a lot in a short amount of time and servers are willing to help you learn as a new manager. Hardest part of the job is having multiple people telling you different ways of doing the same thing. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the guests faces and responses when you make their stay or help them.
good,"Getting Boards ready for housekeepers inspecting rooms that have been cleaned and being sure everything is up to par. Assisting guess with any issue they may have encountered, helping other Departments out were needed. Communicating all with Management."
good,The employees here are overworked and micromanaged. Horrible environment. There are issues that are constantly overlooked by the General Manager. Need a visit from the Corporate Office for employee relief and support.
good,Very fast paced. Manadatory OT of at least 20 hours a month for over a year. Pay reasonable & better than a lot of other work from home. Turnover rate is high. Didn’t like having to use PTO when I take Unpaid time off.
good,"Good work environment but not enough pay"
good,"Entreprise agréable pour y travailler, bon esprit d'équipe en général, en revanche les salaires y sont très bas et l'évolution prend du temps"
good,"this is my first job and i have to adjust for the environment, my job in this company is not inline with my course but i've learned a lot. nice workplace and workmates."
good,Condition of hotel began to rapidly deteriorate resulting in a change in the clientele and subsequently tips. foot injury limited my ability to run up and down concrete hill for valeted vehicles
good,"el trabajo en esta empresa en la preste servicio fue buen remunerado, pero el ambiente laboral del hotel no me agradaba mucho mucha discriminación, uno tenia que hacer el trabajo de los jefes, no se hacían cargo de los accidentes laborales ósea los mandaban para la casa cuando pasaba algo."
good,Working at this company was ok. It provided free lunches and uniforms and laundry services free of charge. The work was a bit demanding because they are striving to be a five star hotel but is a work in progress. The managers and directors need some more training in how to speak and handle staff in a more respectful way. I believe with more training on the saying helping people so they can be there best really needs to be more focused on that aspect and not just a slogan. The line staff was good to work with and just wants to know they are appreciated for all the hard work and long hours they put in.  As far as managers were concerned they need to trust them more in carrying out the task they were allotted to do on a daily basis and stop the micro managing. It is only discouraging some of there best performers.
good,"poor managers with no actual experience in the field. "
good,The manage team sees us as a major financial burdent.  We are no longer consider part of the team but seen more like straight liability.  We cost too much and we don't add too much to the bottom line.
good,Hyatt was a very comfortable working place! Love the people and the job! Very fast paced type of job with tips on paycheck and also cash tips. The coworkers were very nice overral
good,"Business is based on conventions going on in the city. When there isn't one going on, we are not that busy. When there is an event going on, be prepared to get slammed."
good,"Good place for staff but bad for manager position."
good,"commercial minded individual with a track record of innovative solutions aligning with business and customer needs. In addition to having good knowledge and experience of people,"
good,"The company in overall gives great opportunities for development and career progression. However, the management is awful. There is no sustainable culture inside the company."
good,If you are getting started in hospitality. this would be the place to start. not much experience needed. the best thing about this hotel are the guests.
good,Good interactions with other employees and most of management.  Some management seems to make it a point to not interact with employees.  Overall a good place to work with great benefits.
good,Learned the tourism industry.  Great place to work.  Management always changed due.  Hardest part of the job was the guest request and getting the request to them in a certain time.
good,"- Es un ambiente laboral muy bueno, te ayudan a desarrollar y mejorar  tus habilidades personales."
good,"Hyatt corporation have a lot of standarts , that you need to follow. They are one of the best hotels corporations for the moment around the world. You can leaen here how to provide top services to your guests. One of the most enjoyble part of the job is benefits, to spend some free nights in other Hyatt around the world."
good,"A typical day at The Hyatt is usaually always busy for a banquet server, Alot of pasting back and forth trying to get things set up and ready for the event for that day."
good,Ein junges Haus das sich noch immer strukturiert. 
good,Working in this environment is very stressful. Accomplishments were few and hard to repeat. The environment's core initiative was to create a place where students could succeed.
good,very fast pace/ teamwork/  machine operator/tablecloth iron machine/ Presser for POSH company (outside of Hyatt Regency /helped out in laundry chute! loading carts for delivering supplies to 32 floor's/
good,"The company offers fairly decent benefits and compensation for the area. However, communication is very poor between management and the employees. You also never know what will happen, as people are often moved around, fired at random, and the CEO has an anger problem where he will yell and curse at you for practically nothing. They do often provide lunch to employees, but I didn't feel like it made up for a lack of respect I felt."
good,In the short time I was employed at Hyatt I witnessed three managers get fired. The management and staff is like a revolving door. The pay is decent but not for what is expected of you.
good,"Hyatt was a great place to work at first but has time went on, there are things and people that doesn't have the same passion and leadership that another coworker may have to make your team an success."
good,Management was good to work with students scheduling. 
good,"The management there is very poor. We never have the proper supplies to provide the job duties. There is lots of lack of communication at the hotel.  There is no recognition for the good work that""s being performed or any recognition when its your anniversary at the hotel no matter how long you have been employed there."
good,It was a good experience I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. It has an open dining area with a light breeze. It is very cozy. The staff is very attentive and friendly. And the food..... delicious!
good,"I learned how to manage my time better, but my work life balance was so thrown off my mental health was affected. I would like to see more effort to ensure that managers receive better hours."
good,the staff is always great very friendly when they're working with you.Sometimes theirs not enough people on staff so we would have to work a lot harder to make up for the time.
good,Any part of the day can be busy. You do need to learn on the go. Management has to many people on different shifts. The workplace is small if to many delivery drivers are their. The hardest part is the customers and the driving. Sometimes the co-workers.
good,"Peace and quiet people around you are nice , I was temporarily worker at Hyatt hotel , management runs good the business I work there just for a while."
good,"Was hired because of my Golf background, my sales experience, my 6+ years with the PGA TOUR. Sent to Oahu, HI to manage and sell/market the last tournament on the Sr. PGA Tour's schedule. After the event, the Japan-based company who sponsored the event decided not to renew it the next year, at which point Kemper Sports did not require my help - basically, the reason they hired me no longer existed. They allowed me to remain on board until I located another opportunity!"
good,"This job is very fun if you enjoy working with children. The staff is lovely, but the pay is not so good. There are not much benefits until but you do get a couple of training courses free like CPR."
good,I parked cars and made sure the parking facility was orderly and customers were served professionally and that their cars were parked with care.  Part time job through college.
good,"opportunités de développement, environnement international,"
good,"The Hyatt has great healthcare, benefits, free/discounted rooms and can be a great opportunity depending on your job. I can only speak for the food and beverage department of Hyatt and it wasn't for me. The micro management that happens will drive you crazy. Also I think management focuses more on the few bad things than all the good that happens. The employees though are awesome people."
good,"low pay for being the first impression, face, and catch all of the company. Scheduling was difficult sometimes. My coworkers were hard working and great. teamwork is key"
good,This is the most difficult i have worked at. i would not suggest anyone to work here. this is irritating to write about every company before u register yourself.
good,"fun pleace to work  the people are good the ey help you every way they can We were so extremely pleased and enjoyed our stay so much Friday thru Sunday, my boyfriend and I decided to stay an additional night Sunday thru Monday. It had all the comforts of home and very contemporary..plenty of shopping and places to eat nearby . My boyfriend and I aren't able to take long distant vacations because of work so we plan mini ""stay-cations"" near home just to spend time together and relax. justwill definitely will stay there again."
good,"many people have worked there a long time and they think they are above others.  not paid fair wage for the work, maybe just this hotel but not good place for a tipped wage."
good,It's a great place for people without family or friends. The company is top in hospitality and customer service. I learned so much here but work a long fluctuating schedule.
good,Hyatt was a very good work environment friendly people im a fast learner so the work was very good and i was able to provide for my family they provided bus passes if you didint have a car which i thought was a very good thing for those who had no car
good,Hyatt is an outstanding company to work for. They offer many amazing benefits however the only problem is that it is difficult to grow and advance in your career there.
good,If you want to break into the hospitality industry this is a good way to start. I would ensure before I started there is an advancement plan for employees that is actively working well.
good,First hand experience in how the casino world works. The money flows from the tables to the cages. I was locked in a room with two other co workers counting the daily deposits supervised by a camera.
good,"Hyatt REGENCY cares most about their image.... It does an employee NO good to work double shifts wit out breaks, work holidays and cover shifts last minute because in review....., the minutes tardy due to continuous construction, change in traffic patterns, bridge closures, police rerouting, and accidents.... verbal consent by managers to change report times are still documented as tardy and a bad review from the intoxicated guest cut off at last call is still the employees fault, in failure to follow hyatt policy in kissing butt to everyone that walks in. It's all about what looks good to them on paper. No one cares employees regularly work 10 plus hour shifts with no break. Breaks are rarely given and food needs to be begged for. Upper management is all about image and lower management is inconsistent and gutless. Work conditions are dirty and worn down and guests would be shocked at what really goes on behind scenes."
good,I learnt to work closely with my work colleagues. I didn't like how they cut the hours way below 40 hrs as I was not being paid enough to survive a month to begin with. The job was boring and that made time really hard to pass. There was not much to learn as it was a really easy job. It wasn't a hard job.
good,"The management (HR) is always willing to help it's interns and full time employees at any time of the day. In terms of stipend for interns, it's bad. Overall working conditions and constraints like timings, treatment of interns and employees is mediocrity in every way."
good,"This is a nice hotel to work for. However, please be prepare for hard work and also a lot of fun."
good,The atmosphere is light and the staff are friendly but at times the management can be very slack and nonchalant. Other than that the Hyatt is a great company for a novice chef to get their feet wet in the culinary industry.
good,"Each day brought a new challange. Like I stated I reported  to 12 supervisors that would want me to direct the correct staff to the job they needed done. I learned so much from forklit driving, buckhoist maintenance and so much more. The best part was knowing you were part of building an 18 story hotel with a lot of hard working people."
good,"partime job from 8-4pm alot of cleaning, learned how to be neat more, making friends and doing th best the best that i can."
good,I met the greatest people of my life working here. The culture is incredible and I'll always love the Hyatt. You can have the option and work towards transferring to other locations around the world!
good,Good and productive in due course of learning the business concerning Food and Beverage Serving Operation in Luxury Hotels.
good,"My typical work day consist of first inspecting my walk thru coolers."
good,"Be prepared to give all of your time to the Hyatt as a manager. Some enjoy this, but the work life balance is terrible. "
good,"As a first glimpse it seems like a company that you can trust as a employee. It felt as you could rely on the job security that this company said they offered. Well, my experience working at GRAND HYATT RIO DE JANEIRO was a bit diferent. It seems like I've got punished for working the way I've learned in America though out the years. I've worked a lot as everyone else did during the Olympic Games in Brazil. My surprise was that all that hard work and all my energy spent on doing the correct thing was worth nothing. It did I not came on consideration. After all finding out that others in the same position was chosen to stay other then me even though some of them carry a record with triple written notice feels disappointed. Border line, I was laid off less then a week after the Olympic Games were over. It was a massive monetary laid off that didn't considered talents. Being in Rio what counts is to be social at a work place. If you are too focus on work and on implementing companies rules... It simply means it isn't good enough. They rather keep stericals with no professinal manners and a record then someone that has a unique work ethics and posture. Well, I have worked for Not Your Average Joes for 9 years. And by far is a better company to work for. Maybe, it was just my experience in Brazil. It is possible that in the rest of the world things are a bit different. The felling of being betrayed is not pleasant. It makes me think of two possibilities. Either there was a lack of planning on calculating the among of people needed for the opening. Or it was a plan to play a dirty"
good,I have worked for Hyatt Place for 5 years with some amazing people.Working for Hyatt I have learned how to manage and run the housekeeping department within 1 year but there is no room for growth.
good,Typical day at work was very busy but entertaining. I was always on the go in which I love to be. The people were easy to get along with and made it easier to work throughout the day. Management were very fair and nice as well.
good,"Maintaining three meeting rooms, large groups and corresponding sale emails on a daily routine.  "
good,"Front desk for a hotel can get hectic at times but it was always a great time. You meet a lot of different people from around the country and the world who come to stay at the hotel. The only downside was the management and how they liked to handle everything. Also, the ones who were there longer felt as though they could act like they were in a management position even though they were on the same level as you. Most of the managers stayed in their office and never came out until it was time to go."
good,Its experience worth learning.I was taught a few things i didn't  know and learned the way hotels make their beds. the hardest part of the job was cleaning in a  fast pace.
good,"This job can be physically and mentally demanding most days, you work by yourself maintaining the front desk doing normal front desk duties and also working the ""breakfast area"" in the morning. Refilling food that is low, clearing dishes and sweeping the floors in the lobby. Making coffees and serving drink and food orders upon request."
good,"Great place for career-driven, hard-working people. Hotel chain with a passion for service and going above and beyond for their guests."
good,"I came here after several years at another hotel.  Worked here because I thought there would be advancement opportunity.  That opportunity dissipated very quickly.  I found my way out of there in a hurry.  Not saying it's the worst run hotel in the valley, but it's not too far off.  I loved the chance to learn some new things there though, and to be a part of the transition in operating systems from WinPM to Opera.  "
good,"The work/life balance is ridiculously slanted in favor of work, but most in the industry should understand that going in.  Salary and benefits are competitive, but not a game changer. The company does really put a lot of effort and money into making the culture something special, and for associates, it is.  For anyone in middle to upper leadership, it's a different ballgame.  As a leader, you are expected to encourage your associates to the point of patronizing them, but there is no focus on encouraging anyone in leadership, and the only training/coaching efforts in place institutionally are haphazard at best and usually quickly forgotten.  If anyone is applying to work for the Hyatt as an associate, you will absolutely love the experience (besides the pay, which is a bit low at the associate level), but leadership will usually spend most days feeling defeated and chastised by increasingly demanding superiors, trying to look good for the one's pressuring them from above - for leadership, I would look elsewhere."
good,I have learned new things as an Assistant Manager that allows me to assess difficult situations from a managerial prospective.  I love the environment that my co-workers because they make hard and/or difficult times at work easier to deal with.
good,"Mi experiencia en Hyatt Carmelo Uruguay, va de la mano con la vida que llevo aqui en Carmelo, un pueblo demasiado tranquilo y sin demasiadas actividades sociales para realizar, eso me hace poner en la balanza el trabajo. Pero para una o dos temporadas considero una buena experiencia la que me toco"
good,My typical work day depending on occupancy I sometimes walk in working checking in guest answering phones preparing food etc. Here I learned patients because you have to deal with rude guests as well as rude management. The co-workers here are very outgoing and friendly for the most part. There is not really hard part to work at the Hyatt you just have to be able to multitask very well.
good,"The Security Officer is responsible for the oversight of the safety and security of the hotel guests and employees. This person safety and security standards and complete incident reports as required. Consistently offer professional, friendly and engaging service. Ensure the overall safety and security of the hotel guests, Colleagues and hotel premises. Act as a member of the Emergency Response Team, responding in cases of fire, accident, safety concerns and calls for medical assistance. Ensure that any violations to law or hotel policy is investigated and reported. Correct and report any fire hazards or health and safety hazards."
good,ive been trying for a few months to get a promotion and it has not happened. they also micro manage too much and try to save money by short staffing.
good,A typical day at work is making hotel reservations and enrolling new customers to the reward program. this company is where i learned how to multitask different tools at the same time. The hardest part was the favoritism between employess and management. the best part was the immediate team itsself always seemed to be very close
good,"A workplace wherein you can have your dream job and you'll meet fantastic people. People are caring, accommodating and loving. Hardest would be lack of stuff, If they could provide more stuff everything will fall into places."
good,A day in Hyatt site is always busy and fast but always with caution and safety.  From day one until the turn over of our project all means one thing - the accomplishment of any project safely and on time.  My men have been on the job for quite sometime now and they already know the things to do;  they can be depended upon even if iam away.  They require very little assistance.  Rewards  come from your monthly pay and the fact that you finished the job on time and with everybody present.
good,The Hyatt brand is wonderful...but this property is too snooty. Theyre string for classy but instead showing snootiness and coldness
good,It was interesting. Management does there job and not much else. No room for growth.
good,Decent environment. Poor compensation and benefits. Management hires from private cleaning companies.
good,"One of the essential things while working at Hyatt, was  for a short while employees were able to work from home sometimes based on manager approval."
good,I really enjoy working for this place but there is no room to grow.
good,"the hardest part is sometimes people just are set out to have a terrible time,and no matter what you do you can not change them around"
good,"Very good benefits, not so many advancement opportunities."
good,"Before the company HVMG took over the operation of the hyatt hotel, things were quite well for the employees there. However things have changed so much that now youre just another body to them. Learned lots of etiquette, and the meaning of patience and endurance. Co-workers are awesome."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my work was the seasonal promotions and the festival times, always digging out ideas out of the box."
good,"I gave Hyatt low marks because I don't get enough hours. Hours depend on how many people are booked at the hotel. It's been very slow and I haven't been able to work which is why I'm job hunting now. Also because I haven't had many hours, I also don't qualify for their health insurance. I've asked to cross train to pick up more hours but it wasn't approved. I need a steady reliable job."
good,"We have Alot Of Fun At Work During a Busy Opperetion."
good,"The first 6 weeks of my program I learned a lot of different aspects of the hotel I have never gotten to work in, like front office and houskeeping. I saw management aspects and horly employee duties, which was great to experience."
good,"I have learnt alot regarding high end product and met many very interesting clients-who have encouraged me greatly to follow my dreams to find a career where my hard work determination and education is appreciated and valued."
good,Nice hotel with great employees.  There were free lunches and good discounts on rooms.
good,worked there for a new experience in working environment
good,"The hours were ok. worked 3 mid shifts, then one day off, worked 7 day shifts, then got 3 days off."
good,A beautiful place to work; benefits are okay at best; management is of average calibur
good,"lots of management change overs, long hours, little time off"
good,"meeting new people on a day to day, making guest smile. Being able to see a complete remodeling from one hotel to another."
good,Great opportunities for advancement. But dont expect to have a personal life if your work in F&B or Rooms. Healthcare banefits are top notch. Pay is a bit on the low side.
good,"The job itself is not that bad. The only downside to this job is that the work becomes tedious. The people are wonderful to be around as well as work with. The benefits are not bad, despite that you have to pay a little bit out of pocket for them."
good,"Hyatt is a pretty good company with benefits, including discounted or free lodging in other Hyatt’s. Pay is just average and most employees in the Southern California area have to work second jobs to make it. Pay could be much better. Big variances between line staff and managers."
good,The staff works well together. There are a lot of meetings to make sure everyone is on the same page. A lot of times you need to take your work home with you.
good,It was a great experience had a lot of fun on the job the job consist of cleaning setting up meeting spaces and the co-workers I was working with was very great to work with
good,Decent company with decent benefits. Nothing special and managers tried to show appreciation of the employees. Located downtown has its advantages for parking.
good,It's a good place to work with fair pay rate. And doing housekeeping you can also stay in shape with all the fast pace moving and bending you have to do.
good,"The  Gallery Host position does come with its downtime and can but when its busy its faced paced and you have to be able to multitask. Management tends to contradict themselves often causing you to be unable to perform your duties as instructed when you first begin working there. Gallery Host does not only included working the front desk, you also have to work the bar area, kitchen, and sometimes may have to setup meetings rooms."
good,"I worked there for about a year, great fun team, decent management, however when there was a role available for promotion i was suited for i didn't get a response or an interview which i was very disappointed with and i ended up leaving. The HR team leaders response to me questioning this, was ""we called you"" and i checked my phone and they called me during work hours, all she needed to do was walk up one flight of stairs and tell me i had an interview but no that was too hard."
good,You have to have tough skin to work in the hotel environment. You have to be a mult-tasker.  I learned how to work under pressure. It is a great experience.
good,"As demonstrated in my Resume, when working as an F&B attendant I was always rostered on for the weekend shifts, as they were the busiest nights of the week. I enjoy working hard and often under pressure. Whilst working there I proved that I worked well under pressure with both staff and customers. I took my order accurately and efficiently, and always assisted customers with menu questions when they arose whilst providing polite and excellent customer service at all times. My customers gave my boss excellent reviews of my ability to stay calm, enthusiastic and professional at all the times while often working under extreme pressure."
good,"Realice, muchas posiciones,como limpieza,londry,preparaba el desayuno,hacia la limpieza de los baños etc.Mi trabajo me gustaba mucho,pero por motivos ajenos a mi voluntad me tuve que ir"
good,Take the time to learn your building. I recommend a fire guard/ fire watch certification due to lack of security guards able and willing to shut down fire command station
good,Very busy place to work with many duties  to complete. Management extremely helpful with getting duties accomplished if needed. Very good open door policy for employees to express their thoughts. Room for growth.
good,"It was a good thing working at Hyatt hotel, everyone was happy with me ,but we had too worked on repairs, and we had too much problem with AC unit, painting, and doors replacement, and T.V issues"
good,"Flexible schedules.  Management tries to keep everyone engaged, even those working from home.  They have fun events like pancake days, bring your dog to work day."
good,Management trusted my decisions and back me up all the time. We got so many training and courses. Good and fun atmosphere to work. Management was very supportive.
good,The supervisor hid things from the management. The manager was good. I would go back if a different supervisor was there. The manager would tell you one thing and the supervisor would a lot of back stabbing.
good,Everything is great except for the prevailing sense of doom. The atmosphere would be more appropriate in an emergency room or a courtroom. It's not healthy.
good,"work life balance was the hardest part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work, busy in the morning until at night. I learned to work efficiently and do multitasking. The managers and employees are supportive."
good,"Managers have to work atleast 10-12 hrs a day (usually ends up being longer) . Very political atmosphere, not much control over what positions you can advance too. There are a lot of opportunities, you just need to get approved. They take care of the staff well overall , short staff line employees, not replace managers ,consolidating departments and positions  which increase workload but not pay."
good,Learn alot of skills like cleaning carpets removing stains from carpets and cleaning tile flors. Cleaning the hallways of the hotel restocking the storage
good,It's an easy job working here but you have to be mentally able to work an take orders from the boss's and your daily job is like 20 jobs in one day you can never finish one job to start the other it's like running around the world
good,Fairly new hotel well kept & maintained with great staff members! Managers took great care of their employees to ensure their hard work and dedication were recognized!
good,Good place to get experience large scale events hotel is outdated and needs to be renovated Overall I learned a lot and enjoyed my work. Made good contacts in the industry.
good,I had a lot thrown at me and a lot was expected of me. I felt like I was not able to do my job because I was always dealing with complaints that were due to management or outside my training.
good,"Just a normal hotel, nothing special. Just work with them in a short period"
good,"They have great benefits, 401K, life insurance, Dental, Medical, free lunch, optometrist insurance, flexible spending account, employee room discount."
good,"Typical day at work was balance. Busy when the high season arrives and when the low season comes, it was a normal day at work. Same routine from opening until the shift is finish. I learned to be confident and experienced customer service. The culture was different to me and a multicultural company. The hardest part of the job was during the time when our stocks is not enough but I did my very best to explain to the guest and at some point give an alternative way.  And the most enjoyable part of the job was, at the end of the day, I accomplished to day without any complain to me personally."
good,"There is always something to do when you work in a corporate environment, someone makes sure of it.  The campus is nice, the managers reasonable, but it is a job and it is expected to be taken seriously as you are an ambassador for the company on the floor."
good,After being employed here its seems like they had a great foundation but over time passion was lost and guest satisfaction became unsatisfactory. Hence my reason for leaving. I need to be appreciated and work with people who understand the word HOSPITALITY!
good,You get great training leading into the position. You then get additional training for the more advanced responsibilities. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Decent opportunity to changing roles and doing a job off the phones due to internal jobs opening.
good,"Time went by fast during one of the three shifts only, it dragged. Lots of drama. Any complaint you had, GM would not address the problem. Lot of negative talk about job from employees"
good,"Muita de demanda de trabalho. Porém, muito organizados."
good,"Basic server position working on a pool deck. Multiple customer interaction. Long hours working outside, with no time for breaks. Typical day is from open until sunset."
good,I am hard worker and often chip in to help others with their assignments.  Housekeeping can be a busy job with many duties. Rooms have to be cleaned in a timely manner.
good,"Very Good Experience, Hyatt hotels has a very good training program.  I started at the Park Hyatt Chicago as a Maitre D'etage and then became the Hotel Assistant Manager at the Hyatt Deerfield."
good,"The hotel I worked in was very beautiful and all the people I worked with were all very attentive, professional, focused and respectful with each other."
good,"Good Company to work, Nice work culture and they provide good accommodation and have global transfer policy also, They have open door policy which is great for employees"
good,Poor management. No advanced in job level. Horrible bosses. They are on a high power trip. It's bad if u can't make it to work be prepared to get fired. They don't treat employees good or value u at all. Just a big company to work for and that's it..
good,The job was great the employees not so much. The management needed improvement. The pay need to be more because of all the thing needed to be done or over time.
good,"Indeed has the info wrong, I never worked for a Hyatt Regency."
good,Working here wasnt bad but it wasnt great. I was the night audit. It was exhausting to work the hours i worked. The money was not that good and there were many complaints from the people who stayed there about things I could not fix.
good,great place to work. very competitive.guest are the first priority. opportunity to earn tips as well as other incentives. Great manager. nice location.
good,When I started there was high managerial turn over. I excelled to supervisor quickly. The current team is knowledgeable and will help with difficult guests.
good,The management was very unorganized. It was things that I felt they could work on to better the business that they didn't. They were unorganized when it came to k owing how to manage people's pay and hours of working
good,"cant really complain."
good,"Management didn't take care of the housekeeping to make sure that the rooms are clean for the customers so that makes your job difficult to check people in when there are not rooms clean. And you have to do like 5 job in one, check people in, banter, cook food, sometimes do maintenance, specially when the maintenance man was not there or not hire."
good,It was okay I came to do my job it was hard work but i didn't mind cause it was a job an at the time i needed a job. I got along with all my coworkers but i couldn't stay there cause they wasn't trying to give me a raise
good,"Good place, good property, some good people, high turn over of employees."
good,"Good .I enjoy working in this company."
good,"The Hyatt at Olive 8 is a great hotel to work at. They have great benefits for all employees. The pay is fairly low for how long and hard the work there is, especially once you get into the salaried positions, but that is made up for by being a pretty genial environment. If you are looking to develop skills in hospitality or office management, I can't think of a better place to start a career, though most move on once they have the skills to find a better opportunity."
good,"I worked for the company for a few months before I had to leave to continue my studies abroad in Texas."
good,"The job was okay but being there being only one overnight person a night makes it stressful in many ways. Firstly any issue you have to resolve alone from complaints that you do not have the tools to fix due to limited access to support ares at night to real emergencies. If you have an emergency you either have to wait for someone to show up if the phone is answered or abandon the post if it is that important. For me the incredible sense of loneliness, realization that you are truly on your own, and inability to do anything with people due to the overnight hours took it's toll on my mind. This is why I looked for other jobs because after 2.5 years of it I was burnt out. Also I was the supervisor after second shift left so that made the pay a little more insulting I will say that the 2nd shift positions are pretty good but they consider full time 30 or more so if you want a part time job with benefits and at least 30 hours it is a good deal. Overall if it is not the night shift it is really not too bad for what they pay but you will need a thick skin for hospitality. All of this applies only to Chesterfield MO Hyatt place."
good,Very horrible place to work. Management was very poor. HR was the worst I've ever had to deal with. Missing time from payroll and sometimes missing paychecks.
good,"Having Gallery Hosts make the food as well as the coffee, bar, and customer service/room service isn't the best idea. Management is different per location but mine wasn't good at all, unnecessary expectations."
good,"Working at the Hyatt, you have to be on your toes. The environment is really high-paced and you have to expect the unexpected and have grace under pressure."
good,Hotel is extremely large and work is very hard.  Over all good place but not happy with my immediate manager.  She was not a very nice person.  Very mean.
good,wasn't a great overall experience. Management didn't communicate and never tried to work with their employees' school schedules. They didn't hire enough staff for the busy months and overworked their current staff.
good,"every day you are waiting your tour based on where you are on the rotation , the every day meetings are unproductive friendly environment. The hardest part of the job is when there is no tours, no training you can help your co workers to close their table."
good,"A typical day at the Hyatt working in housekeeping consisted of preparing rooms for guest .I had to clean the rooms , prepare beds make sure it was comfortable the way i would of wanted it if me and my family stayed there.What i learned about cleaning working there was it was short cuts to it , being on a time limit per rooms.We would have a minimum of 15 max 20 . The culture was mixed but it was mainly hispanic people who i worked along.The hardest part part about housekeeping is meeting your deadline by the end of your shift.Imagine cleaning your bedroom vacuuming dusting everything off ,cleaning your bathroom wiping everything off cleaning and moping. Repeat 20 to 25 times a day is a lot .Overall the best part was just knowing it was a good workout once i got used to it."
good,"Fast -paced work environment, lack of training which is very surprising for the Hyatt brand. The systems are not integrated which makes for duplicate work. Most of the staff is friendly and there is a lack of communication between departments."
good,Enjoyed working with several different co-workers I met along the way. Older management retired and new management arrived and the hotel scores and numbers dropped. The client/guests were not at the level that most Hyatt's have. There were a lot of locals and 3rd parties. Enjoyed the journey while it lasted.
good,I loved my job when it was different now it has change so much I forgot who I was working for. There is a lack of leadership here and it makes it hard for you to stay focused
good,working here is difficult you are given 16 or 17 check out rooms a day and the rooms are so messy  and can have up to 3 beds in a room. the house men do not strip all the rooms and if they do you it only a few.
good,"It was a good job but poor with teaching new housekeepers, had others teach you and they wouldn't teach you the correct way they need to have  a manager teach the steps instead of other employees"
good,"it was ago place for me and   my future on goin long hours staring with b fast, lunch there after coffee brake reception and dinner a fun day with a good pay."
good,"This company/hotel has a lot of exciting benefits while here. There are extensive corporate discounts and opportunity for transfer. Within the hotel, it is a very close-knit and fast-paged management team with a lot of opportunity to grow."
good,"This Hyatt is the lowest paying banquet, and hours are being cut by new management.  Was a fun place to work, now not paying the bills.  I am looking for a second job to help cause I am here for advancement."
good,This is only my attempt to insert the required number of characters.  There is nothing I truly remember about a job I held this long ago.  I wonder if this matters?
good,"preparing diet food,cleaning work station great the guest,learning,growth, long hours,friendly,different culture, they have 3 shift low sallary,friendly staff,"
good,"good team"
good,The Hyatt brand is ok.  I work for a management company.  the company is not the best.  I am looking to stay in the field but not in a company where employees are not valued.
good,"It was a great place to work at , overall the very poor management , it needs to get a whole new crew of  managers , coworkers were great people to work with"
good,it was getting remodeled  so our hours were very different we change had alot of change from management to hrs...it went from Amerisuites to Hyatt Place taking over the company so we had to learn different styles and up keep in the company......
good,"The Hyatt Regency is a beautiful HUGE hotel with many wonderful people there. Its a multicultural environment with different ethnicities of people. But when it comes to business its needs alot of improvement. Management isn’t where its supposed to be, employees don’t get proper training. They make it very difficult to transfer to other departments if you’re a key asset to the department you’re in."
good,"I was working on the overnight I was in charged to take guests calls , secured emergencies doors and patrol guests floors also watching CCTV and fire system."
good,"Good money for servers, not for the bar because of the management. No real possibility to move up in the company unless you want to only make $13 an hour and live with your parents."
good,No supervisors most of the time on my shift. Young people run the place and they somewhat  un professional . Management are rude and do not hold a  meeting for their employees. Communication between the management and employees does not exist.
good,"relaxed work environment, stressful, fast paced on the phones. You clock in when you are suppose to. only have 2 scheduled breaks and 1 lunch. if you need to use the bathroom outside of those schedules it goes against you. when you were not on the phones it was relaxed."
good,This is a great Hotel. Friendly hospitality and customer service is an important part of any travel experience. I enjoy travel and this Hotel is a nice opportunity to relax and energize for the busy week ahead of you..
good,"It can be difficult to get time off sometimes when you need it.  The food for the workers is sometimes provided during shifts, in a special room, but often the food leaves something to be desired."
good,"Over all, I enjoyed working at The Hyatt. The Management roles changed a lot while I was there. Being a server, my income fluctuated very much. I worked night shift, which cut into my time with my kids."
good,"I came at work with grooming and on the time. first we have sign on attendence register. than we start our work.  check massage room n wet area its ckean and tidy. then we start look our appointment "
good,"Great work environment, awesome family-like team. great cross-training between departments. Hardest part of the job was the constant customer service, but in the end it was also the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Lower than average wages.  However - at the call center, there are a small number of non-demanding back office jobs with a fair amount of autonomy.  If you have no skills/education and are willing to take guest calls for several years first ... and do a GREAT job at that - then you may apply for and receive a steady back office job with C grade managers and co-workers that are not very demanding.  I would not recommend this career path for most people.  There are virtually no opportunities for advancement.  However, if you are not educated and need a long-term steady, low-demand, low stress job ... that does not require continuing education, this path might be good for you.  Getting the initial Customer Care (phone) job requires passing a Gallup phone interview.   The questions aim to identify workers who will remain phone agents ... be satisfied with that work and so I don't believe it is good to answer questions ambitiously.  I would recommend this career path only for someone with great ethics and a desire to please ... but who has no expectations for advancing past a low-level manager or back office worker ... because there is (for example) a learning disability.  If you are stable emotionally ... a positive and ethical person but need the accommodations that support some disability and can tolerate receiving no authority... consider this option.  I believe it is a better choice than bouncing around in retail or food service (for example.)"
good,"Because this Midtown is located in a hotel, it is much smaller than a typical gym and usually only requires one employee on shift at a time. However, at times it can get too busy for just one person and requires frequent multitasking. This is a good job to gain experience in customer service."
good,"Love what you do and the job will take care of you.come to work with a smile and be happy with the great and wonderful loving job that it is ,work with fun people who others could learn from and enjoy life to the fullest thanks."
good,good commutation with everyone takes easy to get to understand work can take up to a week or so but after you understand the everything gets easy to understand
good,"good benefits, management needs improvement, employees are nice, warm and welcoming. Current management cares less about employees. Meals and uniform included"
good,"The Hyatt place was a nice part-time job to get myself started in the working field. It had it's pros and cons, but for the most part the guest were very nice as well."
good,Hyatt Place is very unique. It will prepare you for the restaurant and hotel business. It all depends on what Hyatt you are hired at. Management is better depending on the location.
good,"awesome views, different shifts, wonderful coworkers, special events, great coffee, great work to get your steps, free food for on call or full time employees."
good,"Seriously? You're really making me do this right now? The only reason why I'm even bothering right now is cause I need a summer job, quick. I don't have time for these meaningless requirements"
good,"Working for Hyatt does have its benefits. When you are full time, you have options for health insurance and 401K. After a year you start to accrue paid time off. Hourly wages are low especially for everything that is expected. Some managers loose touch with the real world."
good,"Satisfactory place to be with. Not more oppurtunity to grow. Very much a normal chain of hotel with not a  great working environment. "
good,"very hard working and quick"
good,Interviewing all potential patients medically and financially
good,"MG not too bad. but you worked at there as housemen, I can feel a lot of press from housekeeping. I don't like their complained too much, I don't want come back work with this company."
good,Received call on Sun at 4PM saying assignment was done.  Was OK but no support from placement personnel at Aston Carter.  Hours good. Cafeteria at assignment was great.  Short drive from home to work.  But lack of training.
good,Good company to work for. Pay is a little bit low but the people are great. Smart hiring practices and potential to move up in the company very quickly.
good,The company was just opening while i worked there were still a lot of problem solving and kinks that were still being figured out. It was a good place to work while it lasted
good,"Overall good place to work but needs improvement on wages and salaries."
good,Fun place to work.  Peak time is in the summer so don't plan any summer vacations.  Great perks working there however!  Free hotel rooms at other Hyatt Hotels.
good,"It was a pleasure working with the team at the Hyatt, so many talented, hardworking, caring people. Schedule management was the most difficult thing about this job, because of high/low season."
good,Lots of days with a lot of downtime but can also be lots of non stop busy days.  Lots of problem solving. Overall management is decent very relaxed workplace culture.
good,"Lieu d’apprentissage très riche, bénéfique pour un boost au niveau du monde de travail"
good,This review is not based on Hyatt Corporate. Many of the Hyatt hotels are owned and managed by third party companies and that is where you need to be careful.
good,"It was an okay place to work.  I was not there for a super long amount of time, but it was nice.  I enjoyed my time there, management was helpful so were my other coworkers."
good,"Employees are dedicated, committed, and hardworking."
good,"Its a lot of selfishness,and not enough working as a team.good hours,positive people,and average pay could be better,I know its missing out on togetherness as a team employee's"
good,Hyatt is professional and a great place to work. Would recommend it to people just starting out or starting to gain experience in a professional atmosphere.
good,"the lead cook and the chef allways having fun to make you relax,the server helping at all time.the cook pm watching your foot step so you don't forget any thing at all.and the buser love you."
good,it was pretty ok . not too much hard work easy to learn good hours avg management  good benefits learning experience well tread good location nice people to work with
good,"Good relaxed environment. Good benefits,  Good work life balance, The people at Hyatt are what make the job so fantastic. During my tenure, it felt like working with my second family. You begin to learn about everyone and you are surrounded by many cultures."
good,"Nothing specifically great or poor about working for Hyatt. If you enjoy the hospitality industry it's a fine place to work. Decent culture, but a bit corporate, as in not really a ""family"" atmosphere as they try to say, but just a run of the mill job."
good,Did not spend much time working there. Chefs were professional trying to teach us interns on how the system of work in the kitchen. Heavy load of work but it was a grand hotel located next to KLCC
good,"Nothing to say. Job was medicore, pay stunk, management didnt know what they were doing and was lazy and stupid. I really dont know why anybody would stay and go thru this torture."
good,There is a great understanding of an individuals capabilities and potential. A great working environment for individuals looking to create a name for themselves.
good,A typical day at work would be where you come in without knowing what is happening due to no communication between staff and management.I learned nothing from this job besides to not work minimum wage jobs. Management is extremely poor and they take things personal. The culture of my workplace consists of professionalism towards guests and doing what we can do and maintain a positive work space for each other and the guests. The only downside of the work culture is that the managers have left their jobs for the normal hourly wage workers to do. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom to do what you want in your time frame. You're basically your own boss since there's no real management.
good,"Old hotel values, trying to keep up in a Marriott world.  They lack vision and the willingness to keep up with the times.  They need to be more present in social media"
good,Great sales force team! Always assists with questions and responds in a timely manner so I can get back with my customers. Learned so much about sales and business in general.
good,"Very fast pace company to work for.  I have worked for the Hyatt Regency Indianapolis for 25 years.  It is a very family-oriented company, that allows it employees to grow."
good,"PSAV is an excellent company for people who want both a  client based, hands on job related to light, sound, and audio. Individual branches vary from each other in attitude an din operations, but the overall program makes it easy to integrate into any of the branches."
good,"Good place to work, but very fast pace ,I learned a lot about customer service and training on many different systems  "
good,"The job requires extensive attention to detail and hard work on a time limit. It is very stressful and requires experience with the work so as to not need to stay late to finish."
good,"If your target is simply to earn a living, then you can work here as long as you wish. Otherwise, the benefits are minimal and on condition that you must have worked a minimum of 1 year. This was the conditioning back then, i just hope there have been some changes."
good,"My days spent at Hyatt as a room attendant were miserable, they give you a long list of rooms per day giving you only an hour to clean. Majority of the rooms are trashed and no one leaves tips."
good,"The workload was too much for one person to handle.  Many did not enjoy their job but, work to get promotions.  We were told you put in the hours you will get promoted.  It seldom happen."
good,"usually every day is different due to different customer interactions and i learned bartending skills, management skills and service recovery."
good,"I really enjoyed my Job and the management team. It was a lot of hard work, however we all pulled together to get the job done. whatever needed to be done ."
good,Bij Hyatt Place Amsterdam Airport heb je veel afwisseling tussen afdelingen.
good,Very lean operation relative to staff and capital expenditures; although rated above average in guest surveys. Lots of opportunity to interact with guests.
good,"Working for the Hyatt, was a great experience.  It allowed me to utilize my skills as far as, being able to multi-task in a fast past environment. A typical day at work would start off, assisting customers with dietary needs for breakfast. check out customer, and assure that they're stay at the Hyatt was enjoyable. Helped check out customers and get ready for shift change. I learned, that working at a hotel, takes a team. Every department within the hotel needed to work together to maintain great success. Although the Hyatt went through tremendous changes within management, i was able to adjust quickly with each change. The culture of the company was very diverse. the hardest part of my job, was sometimes having to be responsible for all duties when under staff. The most enjoyable part of working for the Hyatt, was the experience."
good,"i did reaal like my job. Over all its a good job. I would work back there,   The olny reason why is for famliy emergancy. They care aboit the people. We had a strong work crew."
good,This is for sure for someone who would like to get started in the hospitality industry. Really looking for a stop to get started please give them a shot.
good,"Every time you get into a new job, new location, you have an amazing opportunity in front of you. You get to play dumb for as long as people will allow you to play dumb. You get to ask all the dumb questions, you get to ask multiple people the dumb questions, and you get to make mistakes. That's how you stand out in the crowd."
good,"I loved working at the park Hyatt my manager was a wonderful person. Also my co-worker was  easy to get along within my job was fun ,I work there for fourteen years."
good,I basically came in to the same routine..It gets kind of busy but overall I stayed in the kitchen..The people were nice although there in horrible need of new management
good,Busy and high-paced work environment during meal service. Can be hard to manage at times especially given the typical clientele. However it teaches a committed individual to manage customers and provide good service even when under pressure.
good,"Enjoyed it, dealt with all kinds of interesting issues both good and bad. Provided excellent customer service.  Customer always first.  Locations was great"
good,"PSAV gives you all the tools to sell, create and execute events. A great company to start learning the ins and out of the hospitality business and all its surrounding attributes."
good,"This is a corporate managed property as well as a training hotel for upcoming directors and department managers. Therefore, it was a challenge to work for an individual that was not as seasoned."
good,"Great benefits, clean facility.  The team effort and management  its great  and the costumer services its above and beyond. Overall its a fun workplace."
good,"It was a very fast paced environment."
good,"Hot environment to work in "
good,"This was a very small set up of about 50 employees in the basement of Hyatt Regency Mumbai where Hyatt Hotels India were allowed for one of its Shared Service Centers to be operated out of Mumbai, the other two being in Mainz, Germany and Melbourne, Australia. All three were identical workplaces with the same goal of managing Hyatt Hotel Reservations for its hotels worldwide with the use of their individual software called ""Reserve""."
good,"Hyatt is a awesome hotel chain work with (keeping in mind some Hyatts are franchised). They're always advancing and implementing news ways to satisfy their guest. They strive for repeat customers, and stress how important it is to go above and beyond. However, you can learn endlessly within the Hyatt Place sector but we're well under paid."
good,Every one helps each other out. Co-workers are nice. Very friendly environment. Expectations are high. Human resources is not educated but works well to accommodate the work environment.
good,"I feel that Hyatt has a racist and bias culture. Not to say that people who work there are racists. The culture is, therefore manager tends to follow that culture. There is little or no advancement for older workers."
good,"Corporate Hyatt was a pleasant experience, however the hotel was bought and sold several times and it is unfair to post a review of Hyatt when a different management company has been under operational control.  My experience does not feel adequate to rate them high or low but believe them in the short time I had worked under a corporately controlled environment in comparison to the other management companies I would anticipate them being quite high."
good,"lack of support, under paid and over worked, way too much multi tasking, lack of staff, pay wasnt great, lack of security, and in a bad area of town, lack of training, unclear communication,"
good,Job is good. Phone job.  Must fake that you are at the hotel for inbound calls. Pay is low. Nice break area and does have catering from time to time. Hotels come and provide gifts too. Perk is that you get free hotel stays in other cities.
good,At the hyatt I took upon different positions each day that I went. one day I would be apart of house keeping and follow the cleaners to clean different rooms. one day I would be front desk and greet and guide people to their room.
good,"The Hyatt Hotel was a little exciting because I was working as an house keeper for a while and then I had got swithced to being a chef. The fun was working in the kitchen because you can eat as you cook, the food was amazing."
good,"Needs a little more organization and higher wages. Benefits are not great but overall a decent work environment. Always hiring, high turnover rate. New manement frequently."
good,"Busy environment overall, must be a fast learner during training since you are placed at the front desk typically after the first week from start date. Goals as a team typically consist of sales (upgrades), enrollment of transient guest into our loyalty program and giving great customer service. Reports must be complete before an agents shift is over, must be able to work under pressure and handle unsatisfied guest efficiently. Hardest part of the job is sometimes not having enough staff to fulfill some of the needs of the guest. No matter how hard you may work as an agent, the advancement of someone else may happen before you due to them being favored or connection verses experience, degree and hard work."
good,Hyatt is an wonderful company to work for. They offer many outstanding benefits to employees. However the problem working here is how difficult it is to obtain advancements for your career.
good,". Personal Clerk in Human Resources Department"
good,"Located in a nice location downtown. Great walkability for lunch. nice offices, very pristine. Work environment was good. the company has strong core values and work ethics."
good,I feel like working here has been stressful because of the lack of support you get from the management team. If you have a concern its viewed as a complaint. Proper protocol is very rarely followed and the staff is fearful to complain due to fear of retaliation.
good,In this position you will interact and communicate daily with a diverse group of people within staff members and guests. You will also constantly be building your experience in customer service.
good,"Hardest part of my day is finding new business for the hotel, when there are so many hotels in the East Memphis/Memphis area that has so much to offer."
good,"I haven't worked there in a while. It was not a bad place to work, just did not fit in working up the ladder. Managers tend to be young and child free, can devote their lives to work. I needed more balance with home life."
good,"s an equal opportunity employer committed to hiring a diverse workforce and sustaining an inclusive culture. Marriott International does not discriminate on the basis of disability, veteran status or any other basis protected under federal, state or local laws."
good,"very manageable working environment  "
good,"Various different roles and careers to be consider for the future. Once getting in, you have many options to expand your career. Great amenities and possibilities for transfer."
good,FoIsso muito fácil criar meu curriculum com sua ajuda
good,"The Hyatt was a great place to work enjoying the sun and helping guests in any way i could, elevating the guests experience  from knowledge of the surrounding areas."
good,Plusieurs taches à effectuer simultanément ce qui est très formateur.
good,"Fast paced productive environment. Good work environment. Good hours, god schedule, god benefits, good employees. Health benefits are incredible. Family environment."
good,"Every employee has to be multifunctional. front desk agent may work as a bartender, waitress, cook or even as a housekeeper. "
good,A typical day was full of work and sometimes stress.  It was a learning experience every day. Management was very helpful and understanding when it can to work load.
good,"the hotel I worked at treated housekeepers like bottom feeders... wouldn't recommend working at the hotel in Chesapeake, I worked there 3 weeks and they did not pay me."
good,"I really enjoyed my time when I first started work at the Grand Hyatt but it all changes as soon as Hyatt went public.  Before: great leadership, advancement opportunities, good food in the employee cafe, great benefits.  After: well, pretty much the opposite..."
good,My typical day at the Jyatt was coming starting my day stocking my cart \ checking all my checkout and greeting. I learn keeing my guests satisfied. I enjoy working for hotels cause you making the guests happy on they stay.
good,"Good people to work with and you make good money.  But the large, trickle-down management structure doesn't effectively communicate from top to bottom."
good,"A very fast paced environment. During my time at Hyatt; I had to become comfortable with going above and beyond my job description, I had to do a little bit of everything night audit, front desk, security, and valet at times. I can say that I appreciate the experience that I got, working at a Hyatt property."
good,"was on 90 day probation, didnt have a chance had 5 yrs experience of hotel maintenance ...got shot down because of a crummy paint job, and a little slow inspecting rooms...the truth is, my father died toward the second week there, and my arthritic hip(diagnosed 2 months later) was  slowing me down.."
good,"Fun great work environment, Great opportunity for growth. Great hotel to learn about all parts of hospitality hotel work. People are amazing and very knowledgeable"
good,"I've worked for hyatt for 3 years. Management is fake and flaky but the income is decently steady to keep you afloat. They stretch the managers WAY too thin. They tell you you can go home early but don't mention that it then takes away from your weekly hours which results in you losing your benefits regardless of being signed as a full time worker. "
good,"it was just a trade for me but great to have worked at the Hyatt, making the rooms nice for guest and tips, co-workers, how nice the other staff where in different departments."
good,I really enjoyed working with such a fine group of people from different cultural backgrounds. The managers were very open and comfortable to talk to with any issues or just work related or personal issues.
good,"didn't really like this job, did not like the way upper staff spoke to the housekeepers... they had no respect for the housekeepers at all I no longer wanted to stay at that job"
good,"Edward Hotel formally known as the Hyatt Hotel, is a great place to work, I've learned how to deal with different personalities and how to be a problem solver even with out managers around,It's very diverse, I love it,  hardest part is not having employees hopefully we will hire soon. Enjoyable part is our Customer Satisfaction."
good,"Right by the gulf of Mexico, the Hyatt Centric Resort and Spa is a gorgeous setting from sunrise to sunset.  Enjoy mouth-watering meals accompanied by aquamarine ocean views and you'll surely know you've had a slice of paradise."
good,"A regular day at work for me would be is to come prepared to complete all of my task before the end of my shift"
good,The days go by fast. Drive a lot of cars. Learned new management skills that will hellp me in my future career. The work place is fast paced but things get done with the right team.
good,"I had to learn how to use floor care equipment such as scrubbing and stripping machines to clean floors. Also, keeping the escalators in good shape at all times."
good,Worked in the basement sales office. Had a good team and growing in the role. Laid off in 2008 but no hard feelings.  New team there so don't know the environment.
good,Same as previous statement. Staff was great but office politics and people playing favorites. Its sad but true. I will keep that in mind the next time I take a position in Hospitality.
good,This was my first housemen job. I only had two days of training and I was the best on the job even when someone called out I learned a lot from this job and I will go back if they give me more hours
good,"I understand that a majority of the workforce are teenagers at Kentucky Kingdom, but as a young adult, the cattiness of the supervisors was extremely petty! I would highly advise for the supervisors to be shadowed and properly trained because the stress they bring to the workforce can cause many people to lose their livelihood."
good,"Being the largest is not everything. With the large nunber of rooms, the hotel should have hired and rostered more staff. To avoid elevated stress levels to people working more for less. This would also help the hotel provide better service to the guest. Most of the guest are unsatisfied with the piir service provided. More training and more staff is the solution."
good,My opinion of a typical day would consist of a simple routine of managing and preparing the daily activities of guest upon and prior to arrivals. Love it.
good,"Fun place to work, some managerial issues. Opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of working here is the inconsistencies in management"
good,Training system needs work and is not monitored. Some managers are a little sexist at times. Overall I enjoyed working here. Most staff were very friendly.
good,"*fold line and wash and dry."
good,The excitement to work in this industry wears down fast. Some management is great and other not so much. It reminds me of high school with all the drama at times.
good,"Seasons were unstable, awesome coworkers, excellent pay, mangle to was ok. Kitchen staff was the best because we were a family"
good,This job is a good job to get on your feet but not a good enough job to stay there for ever they under pay you there. I like it but it's time to move on  I can't support 4 children on this salery.
good,I worked for a private company for this employer and the people there were fun to work with. they are a true family and help out their own when needed. Great place to work
good,A great opportunity to learn about the hospitality industry and overall business management. There is always a lot do so the days go by very quickly and I have formed many good relationships.
good,"Great place to work. Alot of learning indeed. Good to grow and prepare for betterment."
good,"Some time we had a very top day in handling guest complains. "
good,I really love working at the Hyatt and everyone who works with me. My job is stressful but it's the hospitality industry. My job makes me a better person and it teaches me a lot.
good,It's ok .  You feel like you have no life out side of work and don't want to pay for the work you do. And dealing with all the attitude.
good,Made tables and broke them down at the end of the day pointed customers to their tables took customers orders and made sure they were satisfied with my service and if its anything extra I can help them with.
good,Great place to work with great associate benefits. Offers plenty of employee incentives and shows lots of appreciation. There are opportunities for advancement.
good,"Hyatt CHESA is a great place for young people to start a hospitality career path. A typical day at work includes scheduling, checking our areas for cleanliness, interacting with our guests, and keeping a steady section rotation. I've learned a lot from working at Hyatt. How to interact effectively with patrons and to diffuse situations. Our management at Hyatt has always been a struggle. Training is not always a priority or taken seriously so some areas fail to meet expectations. Everyone we work with at Hyatt is great at what they do. Personalities mean a lot in this industry. I would definitely say the hardest part of this job is not being in control of all situations. For example, we've had to close our pools numerous times over the summer due to the weather or a bio hazard. It becomes an issue when we have upset guests who can not use the pool and they are frustrated with us but its something we don't have much control over. The most enjoyable part would be seeing the faces of returning guests that you know and they know you. Its a great feeling when they come up to you and know your name right away or don't have to look directly at your name tag. Its a good feeling for them as well, showing that we do care enough to remember who they are."
good,No parking and they always except for you to do everything when you can't and only one valet so they always need help with something
good,It is a good place to work. Work load is high. be ready to be on the phone most of the time. Customer service is  must. you should know how to do multitasking.
good,"The Hyatt was a great experience, but unfortunately it did not provide the opportunity for growth I had hoped for. If you are looking for a comfortable place to work that provides you hours, this is a great example."
good,Being such a large company it is very difficult to acquire a personal relationship with the management.  There was communication problems which made it hard to preform properly.
good,super busy early mornings full of guests running everywhere. checking guests in and out. incoming calls and outgoing calls emailing faxing and printing.some of the best co workers i have ever had great and fun place to be.
good,"My typically start at 7:00 am to 3:00pm"
good,"Always had fun at hyatt resort and spa, new food ,nice kitchen great managers,wine tasting,food trips to local farms.Fun place lot to learn."
good,"I learn how to deal with other nationality. To understand, adopt and respect others culture. People care for each other so they're can be their best"
good,"Great place of work, guests are very diverse and interesting,"
good,"I have learned a lot in the last four months in regards to how an in room dining program and hotel run.  Unfortunately I am not being developed/challenged intellectually on a level that satisfies my need to become a more experienced restaurant manager, so I'm looking for an opportunity that will do just that."
good,"One of the best experiences that I have had this far for working for the Hyatt Regency OC, has been meeting great people and having great coworkers."
good,Nights at the Hyatt were okay at times. I learned a lot about self confidence due to the work environment. Since I did work the night shift I was only around one co-work and he was pretty easy to work with. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with customers who have just woken up out of their sleep. The most enjoyable part of they job to me was non only the money but the hotel breakfast.
good,"Good working environment, but poor management. Extremely high pressure due to understaffed. Overall not so bad, perhaps simply not the good choice for me."
good,"The Hyatt promotes a good work culture which is nice in the beginning. The longer you work there, the more you start to see flaws with the company and how they only promote those that are in good with management. "
good,My day at work is stressful. I learned how to work on a computer better. My managers were great at training and teaching me what was important to know in company policies. Co workers were very helpful. The hardest part was adjusting to different hours they were open. What I enjoyed was having a set schedule to work.
good,"The amount of mandatory overtime, the paychecks are great, but kills any life outside of work.  The pay is decent, but the benefits are amazing!"
good,Enjoyed greeting and helping customers coming in the restaurant and leading them to their designated tables. Responsible for answering in coming and out going calls. Always busy during holiday season.
good,"Nice to work with the company. decent amount of politics. "
good,Hyatt remains a strong competitor in the market after 20+ years of operation. Well rounded employee benefits and diversity in work environment
good,"When I start my training in Hyatt it is a typical work with professionals that have their passion in hospitality industry, especially the management they ensure that the employees benefits are monitored and implemented. I've learn to be more attentive, flexible, self-reliable, enhance my patience and develop my skills in handling guests complains. The most challenging part of my training was adjusting myself to the place and it was very hard to understand how the local speak because they are slang. The hardest part of my training is transferring to banquets, it is my first time to do banquets. I used to have interactions with guests but being in banquets is a fun experience because it help me to become flexible in my chosen field."
good,working for hyatt house was my first job in America and I never had an experience whats-so-ever before then. hyatt helped me grow and showed me how to act to different changes that might occur and you act in accordance in order to get the job done
good,"A typical day at the Hyatt House, Checking in guests and checking them out. To accommodate their needs after the check in process has been complete. Closing out folios, providing assistance to and from a 5 mile destination.Placing food and beverage orders, Handling our 24 hour guest market as well as our cash drawer bank. Making reservations, Making sure payments are made from our long term guests. Management is great, the responsibility of providing workdays for employees is great. Hardest part of this job is having short staffs when needed. Most enjoyable part is communicating with our guest and building a great relationship."
good,the management didn't support the employees they focsed more on customer satisfaction than employee dedication.it was tolerable but everyday you were ready for bed.
good,"Friendly environment with a diversity of over a 100 nationality and mixed cultures "
good,"2010 first day of my job"
good,Good colleagues to work with how strived to improve the company's product. There was a variety of work daily. The company was going through a major transition with people leaving and cutting back.
good,It's ok for someone just starting in work force.  Corporate office does not listen sales management.  Marketing can do a better job. But not too bad.
good,"I enjoyed the job I did there, but this property is a franchise."
good,"Beautiful property. Nice people"
good,"for the Driskill Hotel, I felt very supportive by management. The work environment and friendly atmosphere was great not only for the guest but also for the staff. Attention to detail and customer service  was a priority at all events or ceremonies"
good,"It was very busy non stop moving, you have to always make sure that you be there on time and be ready to work even if some days to when the group of people are not in at work."
good,"I enjoy face to face customer service with both our guests and our staff.  Meeting guests, & especially those from other areas of the country & world since the Pittsburgh airport is international, allows me glimpses into the lives of many people."
good,I had the best experience working for this company.  I learned a lot with other coworkers and the management is friendly.
good,"Good company who takes care of their employees, they offer a fun work atmosphere with game room and free cafeteria, when I was there they hourly wage was $9 per hour, but I would imagine due to inflation they are are now slightly higher."
good,"worked hard and as team"
good,"That was a hard time, but amazing work and life experience and I can defiantly say that after that I am well trained."
good,I obtained a lot of very useful and valuable office/admin work while employed at Hyatt Place. Management was touch and go for a while but we made it through.
good,"A typical day included the following:"
good,"I was leading 32 employees between independent living and care center. Daily we served over 550 meals.I provided daily meetings with the staff to obtain good communication and harmony to  satisfied residents, personnel and the company management . "
good,I worked with a lot of great people in the banquet and conventions department. I was encouraged to take additional responsibilities and supported throughout my time
good,"the Hyatt is a very fun, safe place to work. the pay is decent as well. the only con I would say about Hyatt is that there's not much room for growth. I would go back to work for this company."
good,A full hotel and not enough staff  and every room is checking out. Every one pulls together to get the job done and to get home in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part about this job is meeting new and different people. I have learned that no matter what you get things done.
good,"job description by setting up tables, taking orders, placing welcome amenities in the rooms. provides training such as service orientation, wine essentials. multi cultured company. enjoyable part is learning other cultures and mind set."
good,"I started out at the Front Desk with Hyatt...  Then went to HR... then Guest Services... Worked in the Outlets & Banquets briefly, even part timed it in Security and PBX.  Ultimately, I was a Meeting Concierge with Convention Services & Banquets,  The great thing about being in a large hotel, is that there are many options to entertain.  It was an awesome experience."
good,"Great customer service. Check in and check out guest, make sure the guest is satisfied with their needs at the hotel. Answer and direct phone calls to proper extensions. Answers all questions guests have."
good,"Decent hotel to work at. It is very challenging working there since an employee wears many hats. You do front desk duties  as well as many others, such as driving the shuttle, preparing break when put in the kitchen during the am shift, cleaning tables and vacuuming the floors, cooking food from the cafe menu."
good,"This is a mundane job and would not suggest hospitality unless you are passionate about the industry. Little room for growth and a lot of work and positions with little pay increases or attention. People are nice, but pay should be more."
good,"Housekeeping supervisor did not make much as some as the more experienced housekeepers. Training is given for the position but usually previous experience is required. Co-workers are nice, but some managers were inexperienced. Hardest part of the job is the language barriers, most enjoyable is a set schedule."
good,"Working for Aviara Spa at Park Hyatt Aviara has provided me with many opportunities to strengthen my professional skills.  I manage a staff of front desk coordinators, fitness attendants and massage therapists and estheticians.  I do everything from ordering, retail management, revenue and expense management, marketing strategies and promotions, a lot of customer service, scheduling, employee reviews, etc.  Work is important to me and I am a hard worker with an incredible work ethic.  I am organized, detail oriented, creative, self-starter, and a strong problem solver amongst many other qualities.  However, the hardest part of this job is being required to be here on weekends and holidays and miss out on cultivating the relationships in the other part of my life which is family, my significant other and my friends.  I believe in a good work-life balance so that I am able to give 100% at everything I do.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with some amazing and talented people in the spa industry."

good,"In a corporate company like this one, it is difficult to not feel like a cog in the wheel.  Advancement can be difficult, as the candidate pool is vast for relatively few opportunities."
good,The Hyatt is a place of high standards and a place that pushes its employees to go above and beyond expectations of the employer and customer.
good,"J'ai été formé durant mon apprentissage au sein de cette société. "
good,"Great family enviroment, and customer service is key! Busy enviroment with great benefits. Hyatt is all about their employees and making them feel at home."
good,"While management seems to be at a start-up phase, the hotel has potential. There are moments when you're not doing much but the people you work with are friendly and help the time go by faster. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is having to work overtime, more often than normal full-time hours, while the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting guests from all over the world, along with working with some really great people."
good,"maintain the store by cleaning, stocking and preparing foods. Very busy in the mornings and a little less chill in the evenings. cool environment with some friendly people. we see many different things everyday its pretty interesting"

good,"Ensure hotel rooms are neat and clean."
good,"I had awesome co workers at Hyatt farms, everyone was so nice and welcoming. The hardest part was being the only female, and trying to keep up with the work ethic of the men."
good,Very good working with employees lots of benfits and free rooms after one year. Management is a joke and seemed to mess up everybody's schedule every week. No permanent schedule and work weekends.
good,"I scheduled housekeeping staff, monitored hours, reviewed employee performance, inspected rooms."
good,food is served there. sometimes people sleep at the hotels.
good,No real job security.  Didn't offer opportunities to all employees to advance in their careers.
good,Not a bad place to work at all just seeking a better opportunity now that I am finilizing my Bachelor's degree in Business.
good,We were all about the same age and that made it easy to get along with everyone
good,"A typical day includes going out of your way on your own time to make connections with local restaurants and business. To generate interest in them with guest who come seeking advice on what to do and where to go. "
good,"Working with the guests of the Hyatt House was one of the best and most rewarding experiences of my career. It was truly great to consistently go above and beyond for my guests, to make their stay in Colorado Springs, a one of a kind experience. In my service I was awarded several accommodations both by my guests and by the management for excellent service. However, the management struggled to make it a great overall work experience and made it difficult to really connect with a career inside Hyatt as an organization. It is due to that lack of connection that I begin my search for a position that leads to a growth based career."
good,Maintain and operate Boilers and Chillers.I've learned that I should have never left there.

good,"It is always great to work for big companies with lots of hotel rooms in great location as well. I met a lot of new great people both employees and guests. I typically work in the mornings and afternoons. Women don't usually work at night due to security reason. I enjoyed most of my internship at the executive club that hosts many VIP guests. However, VIP guests are more demanding than regulars. We need to give extra attention and details in order to keep up with their high satisfaction during their stay. I managed to get along very well with the guests and employees. I enjoyed talking to the guests and hear their stories."
good,Learned from hOusekeeping Housemen to Housekeeping lead. THen transfer to Purchasing clerk

good,not a very goog place to work. really wish i had not workrd there so long.....really  really regreat it.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the guests. However, the Food and Beverage management team doesn't work together; creating confusion and chaos in the department. The GM of the hotel is amazing; catering, rooms, and sales are great departments to work for and offer the ""Hyatt"" work environment. Benefits are great; cheap insurance, sick and vacation days, plus free hotel nights."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service. That first impression is the most key factor. You want your guest to feel at ease, to be happy they chose the location they did. And of course, you want to see them become regulars. All of that can be achieved through customer service."
good,I work with guest everyday thats the best part dealing with new guest new people serving them what they want. im a cashier / barista

good,"•	Good Relationship with the Guest at the Dance floor and Dbox axis."
good,Ok place to work. It was very hard to find growth unless you were willing to relocate.
good,"This has been one of the best companies I've worked for, but I've had a lot of problems with how the standards set in the manual not being followed. I had major issues with my training being almost completely skipped and having to learn by constant trial and error. My managers also seemed uninterested or too busy to fully answer questions. They absolutely work harder rather than smarter. "
good,"Great team players. great culinary experts. "
good,"Start at 06:30 to check for current developments at the property. At 7:00 lead department briefing and assign duties to Admin Assistant as well as 22 engineers, mechanics and painters. Walk property to assist crew and review work progress. Report to GM and communicate with various departments and Directors to ensure work project progress. Meet with vendors for bid opportunities when needed. Run time edits for payroll and develop training for engineering crew. View property for further crew work assignments to swing and grave shifts."
good,Hyatt is a great place to work for people are friendly and hardworking. Although quality of service is great just materials used for client aren't. I hope in the near future help with that. We all have to agree we're here for our guest satisfaction.
good,Great experience in very prestigious environment. Well respected company made it easy to take pride in work. Sense of team work throughout event.
good,"The employees are great. All employees are friendly and easy to get along with. The work keeps you busy with taking care of a 110 year old building that was retrofitted with a hotel. Management however is a big problem. Seniority and other factors seem to get lost when something goes wrong or its time for advancement. Also, apparently they dont have to follow the corporate policy for hiring. It was a fun place to work that deffanately challenged my skills and abilities but lacks leadership. Also, playing favorites with departments and micromanaging is deffenately a favorite thing around there."
good,"work morning and nights when needed, I've learned different southern dishes.. Overall management was good, staff will work with an extra push. Trying to get the back & front of the house to be on one page, learning  a different cuisine and helping with new menu item.."

good,Great location in the heart of Midtown.  Very friendly staff to work with.
good,"A typical day at the Hyatt consis of me going above and beyound for my guest. Completing ckecking in and out procedures, authorizing guest credit cards helping guest with disputing charges etc, its never a dull day at the Hyatt because as a gallery host i also attend to the bar area and cafe, preparing drinks and serving food.the most enjoyable part of my job is gueat appreciation, its goes a long way to have a guest youve mad my stay every enjoyable is sometimes all the thanks I need."
good,Diificult environment...management company can be dysfunctional at times...
good,"To work for Hyatt, you must be a multi-tasker. It was an enjoyable experience. To work for a hotel, you must be able to go above and beyond for all guests. Providing exceptional customer service is a must. The hardest part of the job can be that customer service at times. But it is also the most enjoyable. "
good,"Handled all payable/receivables and assisted with daily Hotel deposits. Customer service to resolve adjustments to their hotel bills."
good,the managers are so young and dumb with very limited experience so they walk around with no say on the work mess around 
good,"•	Liaison for Banquet Events."
good,"I was only a temp at this office, but I do know that they provide their employees with great benefits. "
good,The compensation is mostly fair. AETNA and Metlife are included in very affordable health care package. Relocation from FL to TX was fully paid for. Training for new positions is practically non-existent. No turn over from manager to manager.
good,"I would take calls and make reservations from people to major hotel chains like Hawthorn,Hyatt and Microtel.I have learned about marketing and telecommunications.The management were helpful and it was easy to most of the time to move up.I thought the co workers were friendly and helpful.I waould say the hardest part of the job would be learning the countinouis new information on each hotel.I think the most enjoyable part of that job would be working with the co workers.They were so nice and it seem more like family."
good,Working at this company has been a learning experience. Begin with morning huddles given assignment end with stocking and cleaning carts.
good,"its cleaning hotel rooms, cleaning bathrooms, changing sheets and blankets on beds taking complaints from customers. Making sure the whole room is clean before a customer stays in the room"
good,learning experience to work as a housekeeping.hard to work with the supervisor but good management.
good,Sales admins worked together as a team but management was disconnected.
good,"Would highly recomend this company, enjoyed my 8 years of service to them."
good,"Attend sales meetings. Explain probucts and features to customers. Constant learning of modern technology in vehicles. Supportive General Manager. Receive complementary comments from satisfied customers. Moving, driving variety of new vehicles."
good,You worked hard from the time you clocked in until you left and sometimes didn't get but a 15 minute lunch. Very busy place and always have to be on your toes. Coworkers are the backbone of this company and are rarely seen as worthy.
good,it isnt a fair place sometime.. I enjoyed working in the beginning..then I moved farther away (40 miles) dont like to work the openings and closings and holidays weekends..
good,"I started my shift going over the shift before me for any issues, ran shift reports, checked guests in and out, maintained cash drawer, process payment and guest requests. We had a management team of Front Office Manager and two supervisors. Myself and co workers worked as a team to efficiently give excellent guest service. The hardest part of this position, was running out of specific rooms guests requested and having to place them in closest thing to that room type. The most enjoyable part was the contact with guests and being able to meet their needs."
good,"• Assisting guests with check-in and check out procedures as well as attending to customer needs and insuring their satisfaction. Concierge services, translating messages and sending and receiving packages and faxes for meetings held at the hotel."
good,I worked very hard to achieve success. I learned a lot about the management side of a business. All of my peers were exceptional people.
good,Great college recruitment/training program; gave me opportunities to grow within the company on a yearly basis. Great networking within the corporation and growth outside of the individual hotel.
good,"Good place to work, great benefits.. but, some of the management are cut throat."
good,The hardest part of the job is knowing what's expected of you.
good,I Learned how organized and Check the files of employee are in order.
good,A little too repetitive for me. I needed something more hands on.
good,"This position won't make you feel great about yourself, but you'll make more than enough to pay your bills. The experience you build will only help you land a management position in hospitality, so I wouldn't recommend staying in this position for as long as I have unless that's what you're shooting for. Union benefits are great!"
good,I think Hyatt has potential to be greater than it is. The workers are eager to work but with limited overtime it makes it hard to get the necessary tasks completed thoroughly.
good,This job was so nasty dusty they give us to many room and I will never till no one ever to work there the employee was fighting rude taking tip from other people
good,"They are not paid expected, so that's the only reason I have left that organization."
good,Usual day consisted of running calls and doing convention power for parties. Benefits were nice health dental 4011k and stocks. Also took care of all major emergencies from weather & media to medical & fire concerns.
good,"I would say overall the Abb restaurant is ok. It is not  busy consistently , so you can walk out of there with 250 or 50 bucks in tips. ( well not literally because most of the tips are on credit cards that you receive in your paycheck at the end of week"
good,Typical work day is hitting the ground running for the 14-16 hours you're there. Hard to find a break for lunch as an operations manager. Management is quick to tell you what you did wrong rather than correct.
good,"I loved my co workers but the practices of the mother company Northwest X Southern Hospitality was terrible. Very low pay, minimum health and dental benefits, lack of interest in communication with employees. My immediate management was amazing though."
good,"Hyatt hotels provide a fun work environment, given the hospitality industry and various properties. Their corporate culture of 'care' is not always extended to staff, and is dependent on management. Training and on boarding tends to be scattered, but this helps to build autonomy and growth. Hyatt does promote from within."
good,"Decent work environment. Management was good when I was there. The guests were great there. There used to be a discount on the high-quality food prepared there for lunch, but I don't know if that discount is still available as a worker."
good,"- international workplace"
good,Most days are enjoyable.  LC focuses on the wrong things which left me scratching my head.  Seems like if you're not in a relationship with someone in management then you're on the outside looking in.
good,Working on the docks unloaded abs restocking the meat freezer and the store room  helping with the mail room and taken inventory  of the day  activity.
good,"A  typical day was interacting with upper management and housekeepers. Checking rooms after the housekeepers have cleaned them. Which helped me be really good in my business. All of the supervisors got along very well, which made going to work every day that much more enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working for Hyatt while i was there. I met some very nice people while employed there! However they required me to work from sun up to Sun down almost everyday... rarely had a weekend off.... poor management however if you like working all the time with hardly any weekends, this is a good job for you."
good,The hours  fluctuate and decline depending on the clients. Sometimes the work loads is alot sometimes is not very much. Also it's a clean facility. Does cleaning for pests at the end of every month.
good,"It was very competitive environment for me. I understand as a job culture being cook/chef but I experienced something a bit different than that. Some of them were so helpful and nice to work with a team (After all working in kitchen = gotta have strong team work) however, some try to screw you over with some kind of nasty trap. My direct manager was nice but executive manager wasn't happy with me. Didn't listen what I had to say and pretty much blamed me for leaving before the busy seasons."
good,"pretty good place to work for as an entry level job; however, management company does not promote from with in, so no hope for career advancement.  Average benefits"
good,"The culture is laid back but that can be a disadvantage to some. "
good,The benefits with Hyatt are great. Discounted and free hotel stays when you travel to other Hyatt properties around the world. Medical benefits are also really great. The downside is that if you are looking to grow within the company you will eventually have to relocate. The pay at this property is also much lower when compared to similar companies.
good,growth potential which include leadership skills. Training to be an effective leader. Nepotism at work here. Slow rise of pay scale. Healthcare is expensive.
good,"tried to get rid of me unfairly. But other things are good about hyatt like good benefit, compensation and friendly co-worked. Nice new building all good."
good,Not enough coverage for extremely busy hours. Lots of people called off on a daily basis. Hard workers worked harder while lazy workers allowed to slack off with no reprecussions. Workers took longer breaks than was allowed.
good,"Though management at this particular venue is lacking I will not fault the brand for that however the corporate ownership is at fault. "
good,"Faites votre propre expériences."
good,"Great place to work at, the pay was just not enough. Everyday was a challenge. Break time was always a good part of the day. I was able to speak with my co workers."
good,"I constantly saw management create robots. If you had an opinion about something that they did not agree with, you were then pushed “to the back” and held back from growth. If you did not kiss butt you did not get promoted."
good,was a fast paced environment but was easy to get caught up in other peoples request that took you away from your mane task. I was also hired fulltime but was given part time ours even after requesting more hours.
good,"They Hyatt does have some great opportunities.I think everyone has a different experience. While my time there wasn't always good for me, there were certain managers that would push me to go farther. Not every managers was like that. It's not the company and I understood that. I had GMs of the hotel who helped me with a lot of things and pushed me also, It was sometimes the managers i worked with on a day to day basis that didn't take seriously, my wanting to advance. I watched one too many males hired after me advance. I learned a lot. Made some good connections in my 10+ years."
good,It was a very stressful job and I don't feel like we got paid enough. The turnover was very high and I felt like we were underpaid for what we did on the daily
good,The people are wonderful. The mission is admirable.  Focus is the biggest challenge.  Understanding of the industry is important.  Travel is a great benefit and requirement.
good,"i  learned so many things from the hyatt...im very thank full to hyatt.. i learned about alcohols,order taking,managing floor,handling guest complaints,making differents of coffees and teas,opening and closing of restaurant,closing of cash,inventories of alcohal..equipments,paper works,ordering of products,etc"
good,The days were very consistent. The management staff was clear about their expectations and the general workplace culture was very professional at all times.
good,"I worked here for many years, a basic grunt. My first job out of high school. I didn't know what I wanted then, but I've moved on to better things since. Not a bad place to work, though it could have used some better workers back then."
good,don't take my word go and o what you decide. don't be a follower.
good,"The Hyatt on the wharf was a new property that opened October 3, 2017. Although the experience was great with the guest the company needs room for improvement as far as management and scheduling. I honestly believe you should make sure you have a good support system if your a single parent because the scheduling was the most difficult and the management was not very understanding. A lot of the guests agreed that on the busiest days we were understaffed which was absolutely true. I just say if you work for this hotel just keep your game face on and don't be too friendly because you might set yourself up for failure."
good,This property is used like boot camp for managers they come as new leaders and don't really know what they are doing often butting heads with the current staff and creating problems then they make 2 or 5  years and leave to what they often call a real Hyatt. They have little to no concern of what they left behind.
good,"well planned work day; "
good,cool tres cordiale equipe soudee syndicats un peu trop possessifs
good,"Highly demanding job"
good,A great Food and beverage director he really provided a great learning environment. I'm glad I was able to have this experience because it provided great personal growth.
good,Not loyal to long term workers who has been loyal to hotel for over 20+ years. Wanted to retire with this job because I felt that management would be loyal but it was not.
good,This was a franchise hotel. I believe that they operated by separate policy and procedure. But will always recommend HYATT as an employer. Always do your research.
good,"Hyatt has always been the Best place to work. "
good,En este hotel pude aprender a preparar diferentes tipos de bebidas.
good,"a typical day at work for me is coming in and checking on the stats of things in our recreation area. making sure things are good and ready for the guest there. once that is all done im there to help make the guest time there is good and they are happy, interacting with the guest. i learn how to work hard and as a team. to better grow as a person and as a leader. management there can be good at times but isnt always.the hardest part of the job is just keeping up with everything, you can get a lot of things at once and it can get stressful but i mastered that pretty well over time. the best part of the job was the guest relationships that i would create, it is always great to see guest return remembering who i was. also the work relationships that i created, a lot of my friends are the ones a met at work."
good,"Working at the Hyatt Regency, is a fun and hard-working workplace. as well as a well-balanced and at times relaxed place to work, many places to advance and all parts of hospitality industry."
good,Booking meeting space at reasonable price. Getting group discounted rates. Setting up corp rates. Making sure rate for the day is right with comp set.
good,Hyatt is good for learners. Good company for wok who wish to learn under pressure. One can work  anywhere in this country once you complete good tenure with Hyatt.
good,Working there had a great energy and was in beautiful city. Seeing backend of how it all comes together was awesome!! Scheduling was the only downside when your in such a live city you want to be a part of it.
good,Daily Department meeting and taking minutes. Checking messages and return calls. Check shipment schedule and coordinating with receiving clerks. Check inventory supply. Ordering non-beverage supplies to office supplies. Type up all PO's  (purchase orders). Type up minutes of meeting. Assist Manager with special orders or projects. other clerical duties.
good,"Management does an ok job, but the people and the hotel itself live up to the name. for the most part the average employee tries there best to make the guests stay enjoyable."
good,"The company is high demanding and in a very fast paced environment, you better make sure you swim. However this also gives those willing to learn an excellent opportunity to do so."
good,"The upper management team provides an overall positive experience when addressing the hotel staff as a whole. The General Manager in particular is exceptionally caring and devoted to the hotel staff, overall culture, wellness, work/life balance, and fun-loving to ensure each staff member is well taken care of. The individual department leaders however do not all have the same care and devotion. The stress of the 24-hour operation and service required to properly take care of a hotel is evident in the leadership. The Sales team dynamic is very independent with each person individually responsible for handling their own workload and there is little support among each other. High expectations, demand, lead volume, and quota achievement provide for a frustrating experience without proper care and support."
good,I mostly did massages I don't think I learnt anything new the hardest part off the day was doing deep tissues massage. Unfortunately the spa wasn't very noticeable Since it wasn't in the main building.
good,"Beautiful on the outside, ugly on the inside. Great money, cool co workers, but the management left little to be desired. If they had more faith in their staff , inspired and motivated them , I'm sure that property would be more successful. Great company though."
good,"Though typically understaffed in all departments, Hyatt Pune still has a lot of great people who make sure the guest will never suffer. It does become quite hectic and irritating when you are just one person handling more than four areas; it definitely does help that you have good people around you."
good,I wasnt here long but it was a good company to work for. The pay wasnt as high as I wouldve liked but it was a decent job for the money. They treat their employees fairly.
good,"Durante mi jornada laboral realizamos cobros y captura de datos al sistema utilizado en el hotel. Verificamos reportes y realizamos gráficos para presentarlos al líder de área. "
good,Time management in working. With good salary and other benefits that company can give. A good relationships with the employers and co workers and a nice people to deal with.
good,Everyday you learn something new within the company. Great experience to work with amongst multicultural individuals.
good,"I enjoyed working at Washington.  Good health insurance. Motiviated co-worker. Oriented, 3 break per 8hr shift. Driven in the winter was the hardest part. I love my supervisor."
good,Hyatt Centric is a great hotel to gain experience but due to being a small boutique hotel there is very little room for advancement. Departments communicate really well between themselves and most employees are good friendly people. Great to gain Experience but i don't imagine anyone staying more then 1 to 2 years in this type of job.
good,My specific location we were understaffed and going to through management changes and property sale so most there was a lot of mix up other than that is was nice place
good,It was a nice clean friendly place to work with great benefits! The management was just wayward! You definitely have to hustle and upsell to make your money! Business is not consistent!
good,"The management needs to work it up a bit and increase pay. Too many hours and less pays, no benefits for the employee.The customers can be a bit rude."
good,"A typical day at DASA for therapist entailed 3-5 sessions for a full time employee."
good,"Friendly atmosphere. "
good,"Hyatt is a Five star hotel chain all over the world. Professional working environment. I learned UAE working culture and many accounting software as iscala. Also learned cash handling."
good,"Hard to balance work and personal life, working holidays, weekends, long hours, must relocate to advance, the team makes the difference, the people working in hospitality and love to customers are driven element"
good,This job was very taxing on the body. The managers would work you into the late night with just yourself and one other person and expect everything to be done. The union barely help you and all of the times you stayed over isn't recognized. You're fired for being one minute late to work. I do not recommend this company to anyone.
good,"I enjoyed working here for as long as I did and I learned a lot from my boss and his assistant. With that, I was able to transfer to another location and succeed there very well."
good,"I have been working in this company for 2 years now. This is the best company across my career. Though there is tough times and payscale isless, but the culture is open wjich is the best part."
good,"Good company overall but they try to pay you the minimum in order to achieve a better overall GOP.  There are some executives in the company that are set in their old ways and hinder you from growing in todays world, they have big egos. Some I'm not even sure how they got to the levels in which they are have and are still employed because they haven't embraced the Hyatt philosophies. They need to take better care of the people that are bring the revenues in to the hotels."
good,"I show up and set up large parties, then serve them, then break them down and clean them up."
good,A typical work day at the Hyatt hotel consisted of checking guest in and out of the hotel. As well as managing issues that occur within the hotel between guest and other departments. Working at the front desk consisted of a lot of multitasking and being able to communicate with other departments in order to get work completed
good,"Productive and progressive workplace with a friendly staff."
good,"you do more than the front desk. You make coffee, run a breakfast in the morning and the bar at night. You also set up and run banquets and make food orders. it is a great place to gain experience, not so good if youre looking for strictly front desk"
good,"Am Anfang waren die Kollegen nett, aber dann siehst du echte Gesichter der Leute, die dort arbeiten. Wenn du Ausländer bist und kein Deutsch sprichst dann kriegst du schlechte Behandlung von deinem Manager und seine Assisten. Sie geben dir eine schwierige Aufgabe, für die du eine Erfahrung haben muss. Aber sie erwarten von dir dass du diese Aufgabe als profi machst, auch wenn du keine Ausbildung dafür gemacht hast. Echte Hierarchie. Unangenehme Atmosphäre."
good,A typical day at work was helping costumers with directions or unloading their cars with was fun you meet alot of people. The most enjoyable part of the day it was lunch because all my co-workers and i set together and talk about different things.
good,"long, stressful days most days. but good place to work. they take care of their employees. high turn over at this property."
good,"show up, check people in and  out, go home early because they're always trying to cut payroll, overall an easy job, good for a college student who needs hours, but not much hourly pay."
good,there is this one co-worker that I keep having problems with.I took it up with human resources twice and I feel like she still picking on me.
good,dish washer break down oval trays of dirty dishes silver ware glass ware what i learned work hard go the extra step be a possitive worker management was good i worked good with co workers the hardest part is when you have a lazy worker dont want to do any thing also had to help the chefs to tray up hot meals for large bangquets the enjoyable i worked days got payed weekly
good,"Hyatt has allowed me the opportunity to develop as a leader, mentor and manager.  The company's equal focus on guests, associates and shareholders gives employees a sense of value and loyalty."
good,"It was slow at times but we did not have all the tools we needed to get the job done even when we requested. Turn over rate was very high."
good,"Working as a Gallery Host is a multi-tasking job to stay busy.  From answering phones, taking reservations, greeting guests, cleaning the front area and serving food and drinks.  Not much time to waste."
good,"I have been with the Hyatt for 3 years now. I transferred from Hyatt Regency Jacksonville to Hyatt Regency Buffalo. First of all, Hyatt is an incredible company to work for where opportunities are arising constantly. A typical day of work for me at the front desk consist of printing a list of reports to be completed throughout the day during downtime, and checking guests in and out of the hotel and answering any questions from local restaurants to architectural tours. Working with Hyatt, I have gained so much knowledge and respect for the hospitality/ hotel industry. The most common goal at work is to make sure every guest leaves happy even if there are bumps in the road. I would consider it my duty to leave a lasting impression making guests want to return from such a great experience. The most rewarding part of the job is leaving at the end of the day and knowing I made a positive impact on as many people as I came into contact with."
good,"I would start my day off at Hyatt by recounting our drawers before shift change, make or check daily reservations, make sure our Gallery/ Kitchen were stocked for the day, and show great hospitality. Management and Co-workers were great to have by your side, not one complaint. Learning how to give great guest services, making reservations, answering multiple phones and making sure every guest was satisfied. While working at Hyatt Place we would have to make decisions without management but they trained us well enough to make them without Supervisor. Hyatt place is a wonderful establishment to work at."
good,"i start my day by dividing the prep list to the prep team. checking in all produce and protiens and putting them away. butcher and portion meat and fish, make all the sauces."
good,Great place to work on. Great experience and full energetic while working.
good,Good place to work with excellent advancement opportunities available.
good,I've learned to come to work and do my job its that simple. I dont get into any drama or gossip I just simply work hard
good,"Hyatt Regency Bishkek gives many opportunity to grow, however the Management is too strict, the standards are to harsh."
good,"Park Hyatt Mendoza tiene una amplia variedad de departamentos ya que en él se encuentra el Hotel y el Casino,en cuanto al departamento de RRHH son personas accesibles al igual que los gerentes de algunos departamentos,yo trabaje en Ambar living bar por un periodo de tres años y cinco meses y me parecio muy buena la gestion del Gerente,habian algunas q otras falencias pero eran manejables."
good,your more independent working cleaning and providing services to the clients in the hotel
good,"everyday we prapare for the needs of the guest do the mis-en-place. then take the cash float the front office. then u have to count if its the correct amount. then check all the task if its done , if something is missing."
good,"I been at the Hyatt Regency Sarasota for almost nine years, it's been a great experience I've learn a lot from the customer service perspective since our standars are based upon exceeding our guest expectations, Most of my co workers have been there for over 20 years which speaks for itself!!"
good,I enjoyed working for the Hyatt great people. They always congratulated the staff on good work and management always lend a hand when needed. Had a great team who was dedicated to getting the job done. A typical day at work was a busy day from start to finish with a lot of confusion do to two kitchens using the same refrigerator for 2 different departments. The departments included restaurant and catering.
good,Es un trabajo que permite aprender y desarrollarse en conocimientos de caja y manejo de fluido dinero. El ambiente y los mandos medios son muy exigentes ya que buscan un servicio de alta calidad. Capacitaciones constantes pero poco reconocimiento.
good,"Handle the setup, service and daily operations of room service in an international clientele industry, which consists of tourists and business travelers. Enter orders into POS system; prepare daily sales reports for management; conduct weekly inventory; and perform heavy cash handling and reconciliation functions. Anticipated and met guests’ needs while working efficiently in a fast-paced environment."
good,"A 8 to 7 work week. I work weekends starting at 6:30. I speak to guest daily and help with issues and provide top customer service. "
good,"kitchen too far away from dining area"
good,"I enjoyed meeting all the different walks of life that visited the hotel daily and the challenges that came with working in the hospitality industry. However, I resigned because I needed a change of pace and direction in my career. Seeking advancement and would like to learn new skills in a different setting."
good,"already listed in resume long busy days, constant movement "
good,"Its a fast pace enviroment, however our hotel is going through a transition so its been very stressful. "
good,"I enjoyed working with the Hyatt, but as far as kitchen work is concerned moving up in the company would require a transfer to another location, possibly in another state.  It was a fun working environment, though management needed some work. During the slow season, not many hours are offered and you lose a lot of money."
good,"It was a busy day, I learned how supervise and take the lead if there was nobody there that is in charge. "
good,The hardest part of the job is getting support from your supervisors. Co-workers are selfish
good,co-workers are friendly and helpful
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo de mucha presión, se conoce mucha gente, la administración se aprende diario con diferentes métodos y el trabajo en equipo para cumplir el objetivo de la empresa, la parte de la decepcion fué el bajo sueldo y no tener donde crecer, sentirse estancada por la poca falta de capacitación y si no es por suerte no asciende la persona."
good,"IM working 10 hours per day sitting in the desk providing customers with services and fulfilling their needs,,I play the animation music of The mall in addition to that i have to make daily weekly and monthly reports which is given to the management describing counting and analyzing the mall events and guests movement.I have learnt too much so far especially how to deal with more than one task at the same time and work under pressure."
good,"enjoyed my time with this company, good benefits, good friends"
good,Travail en equipe pour toujours avoir le meme but soit celui de la satisfation de la clientele.
good,"It was a regional role so something new, i liked the organization but  solo profile sometimes can hamper communication and make working a bit lonely. I use to feel a bit disconnected."
good,"I love to work at Hyatt place, the work ethics very nice, people are very friendly. I recommended to work here. that all i will tell you. thank you for taking my opinion"
good,"Don't expect anything other than a desk and a computer.  No ping-pong tables or Friday beers-- it's a straight-up corporate environment, with a management team that is only slightly aware that the tech team exists."
good,Outside of poor managers I had no issues with the Hyatt. They had great benefits and offered deep discounts on many things. The managers however showed favoritism which cause issues among the employees. Some they didnt even make do their jobs and some they stayed on top of rather they were doing their job or not. It was all based on their personal feeling about the individual.
good,Overall good place to work management was awesome when I was there. pay could be better for an older property lots of work they have Christmas parties they recognize and reward employee's for there hard work I'd go back
good,I would do this job again if I could.I meet a lot of wonderful people.The company has wonderful atmosphere to work in.You get to learn how to properly clean a room and bathroom
good,"Pros:"
good,I feel like this is a great place for those who love the hotel industry but it is also a good starter for those just looking to find out if they would be interested in this industry.
good,"La empresa es buena, pero la verdad no quisiera que alguien pase por ese hotel, bueno al menos en el área que yo estaba era una matazon.."
good,"This property has so much potential. If the management was better this place would shine. Very easy work, you just have to be nice to people and do what you're supposed to."
good,"Hyatt overall is a great company. They have great values that SOME locations follow. In other places, they do not. Management is selfish. All they care about is themselves. There are no real advancement opportunities. You can be perfect for a position and it be the most logical next step for you in the company and they will still hire outside people. Its basically a slap in the face. The compensation is ridiculous and raises are a joke. The average salary for this position is 42k and yet you can receive 29k a year."
good,There is a lot on your plate to handle at a hyatt. The pay is a little bit more but I don't think it is directly parallel with responsibility. Other than that it is a typical hotel. Front desk duties + Bar & Food service handled by the same person.
good,Unfortunately my experience at Hyatt wasn't a good one.l didn't get the position l was originally offered.Tried laundry and not good.Well underpaid!!!
good,"stressful was the typical day, I learned a little more than I knew, Not to much as far as culture, administrative stress were the hardest part of the job, very fast paced a times, a lot of parties. The most enjoyable part of the job was cooking for the guest of the hotel. Some of the managers were very kind and professional and others weren't."
good,"J'ai effectuer un stage de huit semaines à l'hôtel Hyatt Paris Madeleine dans le service technique ce qui m'as montré la polyvalence requise dans les métiers de l'hôtellerie."
good,"Overtime was mandatory and schedule was rigid and fixed. Working holidays is required, although you can choose which holidays you work. (Your preference is not guaranteed). Requested my holiday shifts months in advance but was given extremely undesirable shifts on those holidays. While it was possible to get time off for family events and doctors appointments, the process was complicated and poorly explained. So many steps were required that it deterred employees from requesting time off. Compensation was decent but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with a family (Unless you don't care if you ever see them)."
good,"n/a, its okay."
good,This was the most challenging place I have worked. Most issue were causes by a manager. Through it all it can be a great place to work as well. I left to carry on with all my knowledge learned from the Hyatt.
good,I'm in working here for a while the only good thing is the coworkers and management are awesome and also working 4 days a week 10 hour days get paid weekly and have Friday Saturday Sunday off sometimes overtime on Friday that's the good part the badd part is no benefits low pay only $12.50 a hour
good,I clean rooms. I check rooms in. The hardest part of the job is all the rooms you have to clean. I have seen people come and go quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the luncheon meetings.
good,"Beautiful setting, free lunch daily and lots of corporate benefits.  Paid time off and vacations.  Employees had achievement awards and      staff parties."
good,Hardest part of job was working a different shift almost every day. Loved setting up the meeting rooms cooking and making friend with different people
good,It’s not the best paying job but they do work with you for life work balance. Lots of work but fun. Management not the best but workable and some time friendly atmosphere
good,"A typical day at my job is stressfull and nerve racking mostly, management is fair and fun but the ability to make more money is difficult. The most difficult part of my job is the guests and their constant complaining over minor issues mostly, I have learned a lot about running a hotel, the good and the bad."
good,"Was there for the opening of the Dallas location.. No training, No guidance.  Very little supervision. Managers semed to change every month or so. This was 30 years ago so it not fair to assume it hasn;t changed."
good,Nice job just didn't work with my child school schedule so there for I had to relocate. It wasn't a bad one hard job just had to keep the place clean and sanatsanitized that's all.
good,Worked in the banqueting department and worked long hours to provide an income and save money. The team was great and focused on looking after the client.
good,"The company provides structured incentives to allow employees the opportunity to research and get hands on experience in different departments within the hotel. Colleagues usually end up moving to other hotels to advance in their careers but overall, a very rewarding experience with a diverse group of employees."
good,"Going down hill anyway you look at it. Management are very uneducated when come to the job at hand. Workers are not the most friendliest, overall its just a very dark place."
good,Not sure on this 1 it was along time age back in the 90s was in Melbourne had to go up there a few days the job was ok just ent in to was dishers the boss was a good bloke the cefs here great I lent some cooking on the way but didn't go in to it due to the travel
good,"Me encanta mi trabajo, hay un excelente ambiente laboral pero si hay algunas injusticias, por ejemplo los lideres comisionan por todas las actividades que hacen, mientras que los colaboradores abajo de ellos, se llevan la mínima parte y son los que hacen todo el trabajo."
good,Working with Hyatt Infiniti gives me knowledge and teach me how to detail the car in the standard way.  Time management is one of the hardest part job.
good,In the housekeeping department you are busy from the moment you get there. Management was great who made a person feel they were apart of the family. I was impressed to see the General Manager assisting in inspections of rooms when crunched for time.
good,"The pay could be better, and the insurance comes with high deductibles, but I enjoy working here. Management is very supportive and fair, I received excellent training, and I feel that I could grow with the company, If I desired to do so. The hours are the problem. I have to clock in at 6:30, and with my son starting kindergarten soon, I want to be able to take him to school every day. That won't be possible."
good,fun place to work not to good of pay alot of down time can be very slow not to much to do really nice managers and co workers flexable work times very understanding to days and times needed off
good,"Can develop good communication skills and learn how to do provide excellent service to customers"
good,"ok i cant rememeber, "
good,"Hyatt is a great company overall. The culture varies depending on the team/department. Over the 5 years I was there, I had mixed interactions: some people were very nice, direct and straightforward, while many others were rude and refused to speak or engage you. It really ran hot or cold to me culturally."
good,"It was a new hotel that opened so i helped  put the rooms together down to the finishing touches. I feel it was rushed to start provoding revenu, but lacked quality; which caused our guest to complain because it didnt meet there standards for what they paid for."
good,"Hyatt has its own culture. Typical work day is providing all tasks at hand, Management, Server, Bartender, Hostess, Busser. I'm there to provide the upmost customer service to the guest and show my staff all about what Teamwork means."
good,"The Hyatt hotel was not a bad place to work at. The restaurant had a great team and environment but the management was not the best. A lot of empty promises but not something to stress too much over. Benefits are definitely a plus. Free hotel stays, vacation hours, and PTO is always a plus."
good,"If you start here young and can make it through some of the tough days and tough guests, you can really move up quickly if you have the patience and work ethic."
good,"Good company, can improve but union employees make it difficult to improve product. No teamwork environment thus making it challenging for management to improve company standards."
good,"Pretty cool job, it was a fun job, I definitely recommend it, pretty cool environment, managers where cool for the most part"
good,"The Family that we have was great, we all worked their but the management needed help. I was off with the lack of hands they had on part of the Hyatt. a lot of work for so little pay was never a good thing, did not stop me from working. also we were always short of items for the guest which made us look bad. helped me with my computer skill and what not. costumer service was built stronger there I would like to say. learning how to balance 10 things at once that's where I learned how to do it."
good,"Great Employee benefits and perks, very employee friendly but falls short in the salary compensation.  Always considerate of employees and families.  Management not always consistent in their decisions."
good,It very fast pace... Could use more communication. The employees are great but the area is crowded and feels congested.
good,"This is a great job that offers benefits among Hyatt hotels stays. The pay isn't as good as it should be because the look at the hotel stay benefits as a HUGE benefit and privilege. You will be over worked most of the time. You will also have to deal with several managers that you report to, some have better personalities than others, so the goal is not to be ""walked all over"". And the most important key is to always ""COVER YOUR A.."". Make sure you remain by the book and have a good reason for every decision you make. Ask a manager if you are unsure about things. HR dept does a good job of ensuring every department is appreciated for what they do on a daily basis."
good,"Highly organized, efficient flexible and versatile team player, who would work hard and excel in any environment,also dedicated and committed to work, willing to take on challenging roles, tough assignment and work to tight deadlines to achieve the company goals,"
good,Hyatt Regency Delhi was the property from where i started my career and i learned a lot of things from there the best thing the work culture  of that hotel.
good,I have learned to build professional relationships with customers and co-workers alike while working in an upscale work setting.
good,"Fast paced environment. Working among peers and serving customers at a timely manner. Extended time period walking, as well as being in constant communications with managers and co-workers."
good,"The overall moral in this department was low, however it was hard to beat the pay for banquets. The management had a habit of treating staff like children, or on some occasions, brainless. It was certainly a place where you got in, did your job and got out, with not a thought to drag your feet."
good,"It use to be a real fun and continuously learning place, not any more."
good,Hospitality duties as well as in house guest services while monitoring the facility and keeping the Hyatt standard for guest satisfaction.
good,"Hard working individuals working with a sense of pride under minimum manpower.  "
good,"Enjoyable work environment."
good,"I typically work the morning shift from 7am to 3pm. I begin the day by preparing the paperwork for my shift and making sure that the cash drawer is even. I make sure that guests who are leaving get checked out, and that the incoming guest list is accurate and and requests are met to the best of our ability. I manage all incoming and outgoing phone calls, and make sure that outgoing and incoming packages are going to the appropriate places. Communication is maintained between the front desk, housekeeping, and maintenance departments to ensure that the hotel functions properly.  Before closing my shift I balance my cash drawer and pass down any notes that I have to the PM shift associate. I have acquired basic computer skills and furthered my customer service experience in the course of my time in this position. Management is more than fair in its treatment of employees, and my only complaint is that they do not make themselves more accessible at times.  My coworkers are great teammates and we all get along very well. The hardest part of my job is managing the near-constant stream of phone calls while assisting guests at the desk. The most enjoyable part of the job is offering quality service to our guests and forming new relationships with them."
good,". A typical day at work."
good,The Hyatt was a great place to work. You could always move to a different department if there was a opening. You could meet people from all over the world.
good,"Very repetitive everyday, but good benefits. .The hardest part if the job is the hours. Co-workers are always nice and helpful."
good,"after almost 2 years she makes me quit make my days imposible, the y fire people like every day, good uniforms , you work as a contractor"
good,"It is a very active job and i do plenty of different tasks. "
good,"Management was great.  Pay was awful.  They expect total commitment and in return they are a loyal management team.  For the city I was working in, the pay did not allow for you to have a livable working wage even with a degree.  Inconsistent schedule and amount of hours."
good,"I have worked in many hotels asa banquet server and even tough this was the second highest paying one I could not stay there for very long. "
good,"The company, Hyatt, is a great company to work for. However, at Hyatt Place, as a Gallery Host, be prepared to do EVERYTHING. When I say everything, I mean everything. The position lures you in, with the vision of working at the front desk, and occasionally serving a beverage here and there. However, realistically, you will be overworked and underpaid for all of your work. You will manage the front desk, checking in/out guests, handling complaints and special requests, while also cooking and preparing food for guests, serving as a barista, serving as a bartender, cleaning up after guests, cleaning the lobby (mopping, sweeping, cleaning tables, etc), clean rooms when housekeeping fails, serving as an on call maintenance person when maintenance is not there, (plunging toilets, repairing fridges, fixing things you should NOT be fixing...) serve as a waiter/waitress, be a personal taxi for guests who forget to call a taxi, set up, tear down, clean up breakfast, which is a free for all for guests when the hotel is sold out for the night, manage inventory, make food runs to GFS when neccessary, set up, manage, and tear down meeting rooms, and so on!!! And you are expected to do this all at one time. Guests do not understand that you are a combination of over 5 positions in one, and will grow impatient with you while you bartend, bake cookies, check in guests, deal with noise complaints, and not handle their extra pillow requests in a timely matter..."
good,"You learned a lot about hospitality since they manage restaurants, events, and casino besides the hotel. "
good,"My time with this company flew by! Management styles were always changing, it was very challenging to keep up. Had a wonderful time. I learned so much about how a big corporation works, what their priorities are, a crystal clear understanding of how NOT run a business, and how the bottom line is actually a bottomless pit."
good,"Armar las mesas de banquetes, encargarse del servicio, limpiar los salones y dejar armado los salones para el día siguiente. Aprendia trabajar en equipo y a tener buen trato con la gente. La parte más difícil era que al no ser un trabajo diario no me llamaban muy seguido y lo que más me gusto es que aprendí a tratar más con la gente."
good,Typical day at work was spend supporting the operation on the floor. Being at peak hours in each outlet and greeting contacts in banquets and supporting the operation. Meeting in the morning and afternoon. Administrative task and planning in advance was crucial. Maintaining a short term and long term picture of your Food & Beverage numbers was extremely important. The most enjoyable part of the job for me as a manager was always the relationship you built with your associates and managers. Seeing your managers grow and seeing them being promoted either within the same hotel or a different one.
good,Provides many opportunities for advancement and a fun work environment!
good,"Fast paced environment with long working hours"
good,"A typical day at work would be to come into work and be ready to be told what to do. A co-worker would give me something to do on the list, if its gathering ingredients or actually making the product, I will start on it. "
good,"te tratan bien te capacitan constantemente "
good,the organization has a very understanding and friendly staff. it was great working with them.
good,Hyatt is a good hotel management company with quality benefits and a number of opportunities for advancemet.
good,"working 5 days a week,concern more to guest,imedate action when managers not around,working with foreign collegue and share experince everday,sometime miscomunication among staff and manager,"
good,"It's a great place to wok, I haas learn so much to become a great front office agent. I learn how to handling guest issue and your own confident"
good,I enjoyed the time I was with the company but there was not much room for advancement. I enjoyed my co-workers and had a great manager. I took reservations for hotel stays as well as sale hotel packages. Data entry and filing was a part of my daily duties.
good,My time at the Grand has been a great learning experience developing communication skills with various types of staff including union leaders. The location of the Hyatt makes commuting easy from nearly anywhere in the NYC area. Hyatt also offers great benefits such as comp nights at other properties and full medical and dental coverage. The most difficult part of work life has been the constantly changing work days and shift hours making it nearly impossible to maintain a significant personal life and friendships.
good,residence provided
good,Thanks to Hyatt I have been able to move up the ranks rather quickly. They have given me many opportunities and I'm very appreciative of that. Most of my co-workers are great and it's fun to work with such a diverse group.
good,Only a nice place to adquire good experience long hours a lot of responsability with the clients
good,Its a great place for an entry level worker.
good,"I was a camp counselor for the M-NCPPC Dept Of Recreation. It was fun work with the child's we was playing all types of sports such as basketball , football and baseball. We also played board games my dream and goal is to teacher middle and high school students . i love teaching people new things everyday my other goal is to coach football or basketball."
good,"Overall, it is an energetic company to work for. The pay in this industry is notoriously on the middle to low end of the spectrum, especially for the hours that are required, and Hyatt is on the middle to low end of the spectrum for hotel companies. The company is very pro employee, embodies the ideas of dignity and respect, and can offer opportunities to advance from within. It is very challenging to maintain any type of life balance with people outside of work. The hotel never closes, so keep that in mind. If you are a junior manager, expect weekends and holidays as the norm. You will work a minimum of 50 hours a week, several times 60 hours, during busy seasons you may work 6 days a week for several weeks. If you are in F&B, you can expect most of the hourly employees to make as much if not more than the Department Heads and work a lot less hours. It can be a fun industry, but expect to dedicate a large portion of your life to work in order to be successful or advance."
good,Great place to gain experience. Ability to move up quickly.
good,"I enjoy working at my establishment. The workplace is somewhere that I am constantly learning new things in. I am able to build long lasting relationships with my coworkers, which I appreciate. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to talk to and interact with customers."
good,"During my time working for the Hyatt Regency in downtown Austin Texas I was able to help customers and guests throughout the hotel on a daily basis while providing a safe environment. I was the youngest one of my coworkers in my department, and was sometimes treated with disrespect and lack of communication which encouraged me to seek another job."
good,"I have been working with them from May 2014. Unfortunately I start to have injury on my shoulder and arm from repeat movement at work and after 3 year I have to leave the company. Management, was very good and everything was in control since 2015. After the management been change and the place of work become unorganised, harder and stressful."
good,"Very busy hotel spring an summer. Learn great customer service skill. Management work good with others.Very diversity work place.Getting rooms ready for guest while waiting in lobby,When all employees plus management come together as a team to get the job done."
good,"Really did not like how the managers handled certain situations and bad organization of essential items by management."
good,"Very good exposure and interaction with big MEP and Civil companies which gave valuable insight to opening of a very large hotel."
good,"I have worked for Hyatt in the pastry department for 3 years. The benefits and health insurance are very good. My schedule is 4am-12pm, it's a tough shift but I like that I have the rest of the day to myself. My supervisor is fun and laid back. Human Resources put together fun activities and incentives for the employees. The only problem is that sometimes there's a lack of communication with other departments or within the department. And the raise that we get each year is only a couple of cents not a decent raise."
good,Very great company just need more management. Then he a manager. Will stay on top of the staff but keep an eye on their work detail. could pay more money.
good,"Set up work station on a daily basis, tend to guest in a quick and orderly fashion, break down station and maintain a clean area. Cash handling every shift."
good,"very busy property, I think my time here its something that I have to look forward in life am still working here but I need to look for a better opportunity."
good,"In the beginning, it was fun working with the Hyatt Place. Lots of new people and relationships were built. But after 5 years, I felt the need for change and need to move on."
good,"If you are willing to put in the time and are able to relocate, you can have a great career, with the company.  Hard work is recognized and rewarded to those that deserve it."
good,They have  a culturethats is unique the training  is exceptional   and I believe they compete with the other hospitality groups  in the country  some is the communication was a littletime late
good,There are many opportunities within this company and chance to train in many departments. There are co workers that are like family that helps you get through the day. There are advancements for raises and bonuses. You will receive discounts on rooms and travel.
good,01. Handle big events.
good,"To many politics involved at the Hyatt Regency  Chesapeake Bay. HR Dept is not there to protect the employees, only a select few. I would like to think that not all Hyatt Hotels  are operated the same. The actual job and most of the people you work with are great."
good,"Great pay when there is business, there were some months when you would work your butt off, then some when you would get like 40 hours for the entire month!"
good,"This hotel recently transitioned from an old, dumpy Radisson to a nice Hyatt Regency.  For the most part, it is a good place to work.  However, there are many employees (including managers) from the old Radisson days that are holding this place back."
good,"Overall a good job to have, could use a more structured style of operation. With better guidance I believe that the hotel could really prosper. I enjoy many of the people who work in this establishment."
good,"I would love to work with them again. after spending a few years there, I always wanted to become a Banquet Manager and I also love to work in the kitchen."
good,"Tips is very bad, accommodation is far 40 minutes, too many split sheefts. There is no motivation with tgmhat small salary, people are unsatisfied. Meal is bad, only indian food, but the experience is very good"
good,"A typical day at work would be. Clocking in and grabbing my check board of rooms for the day, stock my cart and get straight to cleaning. I've learned that hospitality and the cleanliness of hotel rooms is a very important part in maintaining comfort for guests and also customer clientele. I enjoy working with my enthusiastic co-workers and also my outgoing team of supervisors. The hardest part of my job is cleaning rooms after huge parties but the most enjoyable part would be the really big tips the guests would sometimes leave."
good,"I am well equipped with IT knowledge and skills to give necessary support for users every day. I learned that technology changes every day so I need to update myself each minute. I know how to meet management goals, i manage resources like Server, desktop, switches, firewall and access points, there are numbers of users depends on my position, my co-workers real cooperative to me at work, they believe and rely on me every second, i showed them I am the best in IT."

good,"Great job great responsibilies but long lags with no customers met a lot of important people and was in the heart of historical savannah, ga"
good,"Working as a lead server/ training server I learned a lot of people skills and how to deal with happy and not so happy customers."
good,"very pleasant place to work and to vacation, the hotel"
good,"I worked as a Guest Services Associate for a year. "
good,A very fast pace environment with need to make major decisions as needed.  Opportunity to work with several outside vendors and managing of several employees was very gratifying. Thoroughly enjoyed day to day challenges and opportunity to oversee large construction projects.
good,I wish they would give you an opportunity to move within the company. However it is very organized and management team will work with you.
good,"This is a great place to work if you do not mind working with a lot of different roles and responsibilities. Typical work weeks is 40+ hours every week. Management is new, but really care about their employees. The only downfall is the amount time spent at work, leave little time for anything else."
good,Always busy with huge turnovers with guests which made the work place go by quickly and most of the time smoothly. Management was not concerned about employee opinions or concerns. Every department was for itself. Most co-workers were not happy to be at work and complained way too much. Most days were either too slow or too busy. No communication between departments.
good,"Participe, cómo bell-boy  (valet parkin) en este hotel, colaborando con el sr. Jose plata, capitan de bell-boy. "
good,"good place to do hard work and to learn."
good,"I had fun working at The Westin Downtown Hotel, I just didn't feel I was getting paid enough working there. I found a new job shortly after I was hired there due to the amount of money I was being paid."

Breakfast is really busy but job is interesting cause so many people coming from different countries and it is plesuare to serve this guests. Management is very strict because of we have so many staff. My colleques from different countries and all this guys is very friendly  and  it is making our job easy and funny.
good,"it is a great place to work and there is a good atmosphere , the only down fall is that it is very lenghthy to get a promotion you desvere and hard to progess your knowledge of food"
good,"Unfortunately this is now a Sheraton, but the Hyatt was a great place to work with a lot of great people.  It was truly run like an award winning hotel and restaurant.  Updates were needed but it maintained the character of that era of Columbus which was cool!"
good,my day started by communicating from the prior shift on what needs to get done and also with front desk who will need to be pick up from the airport and drop off to the airport. clean lobby area by sweeping and mopping.
good,"This was a place that made you feel rich. I learned a lot of front desk duties and what it takes to work at a hotel. Management was never really seen, so I cant tell you any thing. I worked alone behind the desk."
good,"Grand Hyatt Santiago was a good place to work, the working environment is quiet and fun sometimes, my co-workers were great, very supportiive and helpful."

good,serving the residence in the dining room with food and beverages. setting up the tables and cleaning the dishes. what i learned is that patience and kindness is necessary when working with those with disabilities. management was good. they worked with you balancing your job and life schedule. co-workers worked together in making sure that everything was in order in the dining room and that food and drinks are ready to be served to the residence. the hardest part of the job was helping those with disabilities that don't want to cooperate. the most enjoyable part was working with the employees and the cookouts and parties that they had for different occasions.
good,Good place to work if you want to work for an Hotel.Lots of advancement if you are in the right circles. Both union and nonunion workers at this hotel.
good,"Answering phones, booking reservations & meeting calls per hour quota. Management was pleasant and helpful. Learned a lot about all the different hotels and resorts."
good,"Good health benefits, decent salary and definitely room to advance. I was promoted 3 times during my time there, however, to move any further I'd have to change locations and I wasn't willing to relocate. There isn't much work/life balance in the Convention Services Manager job at that specific hotel. Also, for all of the time, hard work and stress that you put into the job, I didn't feel that I was valued much as a person by higher management. The thing I miss most is the people I worked with and the benefit of free nights I had at any available hotel as an employee."
good,"The training providing by company which is very good. "
good,"you get notice of a job well done, you get selected housekeeper of the month you receive a extra check of a hundred dollars you get a plack with your picture on it, it a fun place to work. happy place"
good,Going out to the fields and picking vegetables really early in the morning. I have learned to make things easier on my self so I don't work twice as hard and hurt myself. The management was great. My co workers were all ways there to help you out if needed and never discriminated. The hardest part of my job would have to be manually picking the vegetables. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is lunch cause we had shade to eat our lunches.
good,"This Hyatt is going through a lot of changes, but overall a good company to work for. This Hyatt seems to play favoritism from management to associates. Just be careful who you trust at this property."
good,"I learned that working in an fast past enviorment, time manangement is they key to being productive."
good,"To sum up employment at Hyatt I have learned to do many different jobs in an 8 hour shift, as to the competitive hotel brands do one job in an 8 hour shift."
good,"Excellent and flexible opportunity for students. Only problem was hiring requirements were not the strictest, and this caused friction between hard working and lazy employees."
good,"I have never worked for a team who is so supportive of their staff. From the front desk, to housekeeping, maintenance and management, everyone gets along great which makes work enjoyable."
good,"Fun and fast pace environment, great people with different back grounds, meet people from around the world on a daily basis was fun, but management need to take bullying in the work place more seriously."
good,Work friendly place with great employees I've been with the company for at least 4 years now. They gave me they opportunity to enhanced my social skills at the Hyatt Regency Hotel Downtown which is still current. Also a few other Hotel locations throughout the Chicago downtown area.
good,"Good company.  Limited advancement opportunities available due to limited number of properties."
good,When its great its Great. Slow spells can be a exhausting but thankfully there aren't too many. The benefits of working at a hotel are great. Meals are provided among many other great benefits.
good,Very dynamic work environment with ever evolving culture and expectations. The company has changed a lot in the last few years. The work load helps create strong financial managers and laser focused towards customer service.
good,"I truly loved working at Hyatt in the beginning. You were given lots of help if needed and they really worked with you for the first few months. After that it got to where we could depend on our associated for help but not leads. And asking for help was never granted. They gave the""Oh yes we can help you with that. Let me set up something "" and so on but was never seen thru. Then when it came down to your job being on the line no one was there."
good,I would start off by clocking in and restocking beverages for the fridge to hand to guests as I greeted them into the hotel. From there I would proceed to check the guest in and offer a free cookie and offer a free tour as well. I made the guest aware of all of our amenities and shuttle times to and from the airport. I made cook-to-order meals for guests upon requests. I would also take guests to and from Dulles airport during shuttle times and upon request. I would make reservations over the phone as well as close out shifts securely by placing the money in a safety deposit box and sign the date and time.
good,"Easy and enjoyable "
good,You get to work with very different people of different age and see what is happening in the back of the perfect service given to people attending wedding . You experience how tiring it is to earn in the f&b industry and that we should appreciate those who serve us with no hesitation even when if they have been scolded at or working for long hours .

good,"Management was responsive to complaints, kind co-workers, HR did a good job of hiring and bringing in new talent. Hardest part of job was dealing with difficult/negative guests, but was always successful in reaching a middle ground with these guests, Most enjoyable part of job was meeting all of the traveling/ interesting guests."
good,"The Hyatt Shared Service Center is a great place to work for people who aren't looking to advance and are content with the idea of having a job and receiving a raise every year. The culture is fun, but the pay is low, especially if you have a degree and they operate off of the buddy system. Most of the people in management worked together at either Dell or AOL. At this office, it's not what you know, it's who you know."
good,"Working at Hyatt really opened me up to new people, problem solving, and guest resolution. Although i did not think the pay was worth the work. Wore many hats for such little pay."

good,"A typical day was always very busy. There was always constant work and something to be done. I drove customers to their destinations, learned how to fix air conditioning units and handled all basic maintenance. I worked with a team of other and we all helped each other out to get the job done. I am very friendly and always got along with everyone I worked with."
good,"One of the best place that I have worked everyone is friendly and willing to help you ,personally for me the hardest thing was the closing shift at night because I have to take all the empty licor bottles downstairs to the licor room."
good,"As a Hospitality and Tourism Management student at San Diego State University, I have learned leadership, public speaking, hotel operations, time management which have given me a great comfort working in teams and so much more. Additionally, not only the classroom education at San Diego State University allowed me to learn the knowledge and skills but also getting involved with various student associations gave me such a privilege to meet some very influential industry professionals.

good,"I have learned a lot at hyatt farms. Knowing the difference of sweet bell peppers and hot bell peppers. A typical day at work would be starting to pick the vegetables and when there is enough to go to the packing house every one heads there either in there own vehicle or riding the company bus there, then every one participates in packing the vegetables. The co workers are easy to get along with and every one helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was having to constantly bend over to pick and pack the vegetables breaking your back. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."

good,"Typical day easy flowing already know what needs to be done."
good,"improper biheviourral stetus. dominating charecter,no potion to think openly."

Management was nice in the morning but weary near the end of the day. Some of my co workers were nice and respectful but others were not. The hardest part of the job was  having to do 15 rooms that were assigned, then having to help others with there rooms after a long day of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was when everyone was done with there rooms earlier then expected was got to go room right after you were done with your work."
good,Not only does this company have the best career advancement opportunities but most of all the people I have come across to know and have the honor of working with are all so pleasant.

good,"Very busy on the weekend. I've learn to always take time out for myself. Management is always changing hands. The hardest part like all hotel was the afternoon shift,"
good,This company was poorly ran. It seemed as though the management was never on the same page.  As far as a typical day at work the job was very easy the people i go t to meet were wonderful.
good,Most work I have ever done with-in five hours. The elderly keeps a smile on your face to continue this fast paced work of serving 3 course meals to 4 parties at once.
good,A typical day working at the hyatt was getting there 30 minutes before the shift start getting breakfast and coffee clocking in finding out what your going to be doing and transitioning through out the day.In the beginning it was difficult but after the first couple days i found it very easy it was like taking care of your home but a a different pace and a lot more work.I really liked the lunch there was a big cafeteria for everyone to eat very comfortable furniture and they provided good food.The only thing i didnt like was that it was temporary.
good,The only thing required was making reports they was no involvent for bringing in business or even going out to make calls. Reports required were not explained and there was no information or tecnical training given on the system.
good,"es un buen lugar para aprender, te deja demasiada experiencia, conocimiento en la rama de hotelera, se aprende a trabajar bajo presión, pero no existe oportunidad de crecimiento, mal ambiente de trabajo en cuestión de los compañeros de área."
good,The managers will make ex exceptions to the company policies they expect you to follow in front of the guest when convenient and document you for the same actions if you make the decisions yourself. No support until mistakes are made
good,I work at a franchised location. Hyatt has very high standard for the type of service you provide and the condition in which the hotel is kept. They also score and rank all hyatt properties which can be a little stressful.
good,I had great time working for this company however the apporch that management team provided me and ask me to was not accepted by me as an single mom way they treated me and honest person just not accepted. Management were terrible.

good,"I enjoyed working for this property, the culture, the vision and the values of the brand."
good,"After seven years at the Hyatt, I noticed most employees are there for a paycheck.  I cared about my position and the service I could provide, it was very frustrating not having team members who tried to meet service standards."
good,"Si bien el ambiente laboral es el adecuado, cuando se forma un grupo de trabajo acordé se hace más llevadero, mi crítica es para la administración, por como puede tener personal eventual después de 3 años y medio"
good,I learned a great deal about reconciliations and general ledger accounting.  The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to do a thorough and complete job.
good,"My current GM is a pleasure to work for, while I do not receive benefits with the company due to it is private owned.  I have met some very good people within the job and customers as well."
good,"very stressful place to work because a lot of the time you're left to fend for yourself. The managers hardly ever come around,and when they do its for a very short period of time."
good,"The work place has potential but the culture of the workplace prevents this from happening.  "
good,I loved my job here but the management before the change was horrible.. They took advantage of being a manger position to the extreme.. But overall i worked hard to make my paychecks and sometimes not leaving until 8pm and going at 8am that morning.
good,"I would not recommend Hyatt as an employer. Low pay, terrible work-life balance, poor leadership. However, they will support you with transitioning into different roles."
good,"There seems to be some inequity between the scale of pay, the positions and the work distribution.   Expections for working hours and the distribution of responsibilities is unrealistic.  The leadership does not want to act on any of the staff suggestions."
good,"en el hyatt place, trabaje dos años, alli todas nos llevamos bien, el trabajo muy duro y poco salario, viviamos al  dia, alli aprendi a ahorrar mas el dinero aqunque nunca tenia ni un dolar ni para una soda. a veces el supervisor nos reunia y nos daba una merienda y conversabamos de todo un poco."
good,"I like to work on cleaning, maintenance and hotels."
good,"Hard work with less pay"
good,"Take care of all mechanican and electrica work orders"
good,"A typical day at the Hyatt was me answering the phones, taking guest room service orders, cashier and amenity coordinator. I've learned how to handle different situations with guest, how to get more done throughout the day. Management was okay but the co- workers are awesome they make being employed there feel like home."
good,A typical day at work was enjoyable.
good,"Hours vary by the outlet in which you work, as doors your pay. Guests will always come first in the hospitality industry, so if you're a ""people person"" you'll be great."
good,Ser mucho mas rapido y eficas en hacer las cosas bien ala primera
good,I gave up my personal life bc the job is non stop. They call you off duty often. Your automatically expected to cover the shifts of call outs. Keep track of your hours yourself. You'll soon only have friends that are co-workers. They encourage on job dating bc that's where you'll spend all your time. Once you get hired you'll realize how many married couples work there.
good,"Loved the Gallery Host Position & my coworkers - Management went south, unfortunately. Didn't see that great of benefits or paid time off. Worked a lot of hours - and the pay was nice!"
good,Working for this company was great. I work 8 hour night shift. Learned new systems. Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and getting to know some coworkers that became family almost instantly
good,"I work 3 banquet serving jobs, with Hyatt being my favorite place to work out of the three. It is a warm, friendly place to work in my experience, but over the past few years, it has gotten quite stressful, and the business is very competitive , but in my opinion. Hyatt servers are the best in the city of Buffalo  hotels"
good,Busy hotel all year round if not busy always something to do to make necessary changes.Sometimes not good changes but sometimes you have no choice.Higher management get too much involved in our jobs and don’t give us the power to do the correct changes.
good,Good management training program. Tries to make things enjoyable. In middle management gets overworked. Every property is different. The people are nice for the most part.
good,"Have done everything i can to learn what i can, they limit you to your learning.  Its very easy to learn your position. Very family oriented. coworker are easy to get along with."
good,"I've been with Hyatt for a while. As a company, I'm completely happy. But as far as working at the property level it's a true struggle sometimes. It's like people hear you but don't listen. They don't really seem to care about the staff and don't listen to the guest."
good,"The work environment is okay as long as you mind your business. They feed their employees often which is always a plus because who doesn't love free food? However, there's no job security."
good,"nice management"
good,"I opened Hyatt Place where I live. We had a good team. Everything was good. Super busy, on the go type of place. I loved working there. Only complate would be to better train employees better,"
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo ,pero en ocasiones no tenia trabajo suficiente"
good,"Employed during a time of high turnover within the company. did not see many opportunities for advancement, new candidates considered before existing staff."
good,Everybody who is anybody came to stay at this hotel. It was the location for lots of special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. Management hired cheap and inexperienced workers which made it more difficult for those learning and quickly advancing to move up within the hotel.
good,they are great job and obey teams share work for events every time as communicate who are deaf peoples work there so they help to us about organizational and safety job !!
good,"I enjoy working for hyatt. You get to meet people from different backgrounds, learn a word or two in their language, its fun. But, you have to make work fun."

good,The management sucks and the company treats employee badly but the people that work with me are great. I dont like how the environment feels sometimes but if you can overlook all the negative its a pretty ok job
good,"Working for the Hyatt at Penn's Landing was a learning experience. Not only did I enjoy learning how hotels operate, but I acquired many hands-on skills and social skills I enjoyed working in a diligent and respectful team. Knowing that someone else has my back and supporting me as I support him."
good,Very Good Experience with Grand.The Team were very Supportive I had very bad Experiences or Good Experiences also.
good,: Repair and replace faulthy equipment
good,"Communication is the key, be kind and also effective also don’t make friends with the employees.. no mixing business with pleasure. Be honest with your employees as well."

good,"São 14 apartamentos que valem por 30. Cansativo, estressante e ainda falta enxoval"

good,Great company in regards of training but being promoted is lacking- and difficult at times and unfortunately as the competitors have more advancement.

good,A typical day is dealing with customers with a Five Forbes personality. The hardest part of the job is the pay. You don't get a raise or anything while you are working there.  Management isn't the best either.
good,Hyatt is a good company to work for with that said it also takes a lot out of you. Down side is its extremely physical and lots of running around. Management is different in each department.
good,"IT was a good company when it came to benefits and consistent hours, but it lacked in management and caring about their employees as a person.  There were also several days where you work several hours without breaks or you have to do really hard turn arounds."
good,Started out as a great place to work. Money was good and the hours fit my schedule with my family. Things changed in my life and I needed a change in hours and was basically told that isn't possible without seniority. Three years down the tube
good,"The management team themselves were not trained properly to be able to handle ordering food or supplies, to manage a team, or to plan ahead. Projects stay unfinished. Engineers were doing as they pleased and not helping. They finally got one awesome engineer in and I hope they kept him. Housekeeping can't clean properly and their always behind. I loved working the morning shift. The guests are usually awesome, being that there is a bar onsite, that you run, things tend to get out of hand."
good,I love working at the Hyatt only issues I had was the manager at the time. Also this was a temporary job to make additional income while I help to get up my business.

good,"My job was ok , but i dont think the pay was that good but i loved my workers and management coworkers , great people .over all i worked hard nd cleaned my ares ."
good,A typical day at the Hyatt starts by smiling and greeting people and helping them out in any way you can. From the time they check in until the time they leave. I've learned to let things roll off my shoulders and don't take things to personal. Management is coming along. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes you can't please every one. I love my job with the Hyatt.
good,"Un buen lugar para realizar practicas o trabajar, permiten aprender y en algunas ocaciones poner en para rica nuevas cosas."
good,"It was typically hard to perform restaurant host for me because of its mine first job in star rated hotel. Here, I got chances to learn things to make future better in star rated hotel."
good,"You engage and interact with a variety of guests. You are required to check people in and check them out in a timely manner, process payments. You are also required to prepare meals in the kitchen as well as bartend at the bar. As far as management we are currently in the middle of a transition. Fun place to work but its busy."

good,Has been a very hectic three months for me since im coming from a working place where the working and the staff culture is totally different.
good,is all about speed and timing also high standards and organization
good,"it was ok, it was nothing great to say about any organisation. Organisation is always good but people who are working there makes that organisation good or bad."
good,"i am Working in Grand Hyatt (5*) Hotel, i am woking as a safety engineer and it's very good  to learn more regarding safety  and also our management support me."
good,I have work for the Hyatt 2yrs with the exception of giving the company my 110% not to get anywhere I have to do whats best for my future. I play the role of a lead cook at times some times sous chef but never to get this title it's time to move on.
good,Ok place to work but after the name changed everything else changed
good,"A empresa é ótima, se importa bastante com os funcionários, tem bastante festas, possibilita viagem para outro país com a diaria grátis e etc, só que como trabalho em banquetes não tem muito horário fixo e como moro longe a localidade não é muito boa. Aprendi muito, tem bastante treinamentos e etc."
good,"the work was okay, but the way HR resolved some issues were not exactly fair, some issues could have been handled better and there are 2 sides to every story."
good,We need more help with alot of things but we are slowy getting it together as a teamnwe need to work together as a team we need to respect each other we need more communication
good,"Without a doubt the busiest hotel i have ever worked at, I was in night audit and worked from 11 to 7:30 or sometimes late if needed. Conducted guest checkin check out united airlines and football teams"
good,"I worked here for 3 years and was never able to be considered a full-time employee so I never received benefits even though I worked 40+ hours a week. The job was fun and a great summer job, but it was pretty boring during the off seasons. Overall I had a lot of fun being a Rec Attendant because I enjoy working with a wide variety of people and it was a great first job."
good,Hyatt is a fun place to work at. The employees are always interacting with the guests and customers and they offer free lunch for all employees and part time employees.
good,"always plenty of work to be done, great location in the city, friendly people to work with. learned engineering and attended school with flexible schedule."
good,"I love working for full-service hotels for the team atmosphere they bring to the table - when checking-in a guest at the desk, it involves almost all departments; housekeeping to make sure their VIP room is ready, Valet to make sure their car is take car of and luggage is assigned to their VIP room, and the lounge to welcome them with a drink or food after a long journey in."
good,"The Hyatt house was a fun productive place, nice people welcoming guess. The management could be better and communication skills could be better. Great people very productive. Flexiable for your needs."
good,"Hyatt iyeself was a great company and I would go back in a heart beat; however, management at B&B lacks communication and there is no real balance between work and life. I enjoyed my time working here though as most of the staff was amazing and fun to work with. Plus the benefits made it all worth it."
good,Fun environment extended stay guests. Family style hotel and staff is treated as such. I handled arrivals and departures as well as assisting housekeeping. I assisted in cleaning rooms as well as inspect them to ensure guest satisfaction. The only reason why I left the job was because it was a part time  position. Although the pay is not great I would still recommend this hotel. Perhaps to a younger crown would suffice for these positions.
good,"Good to join in startup career level."
good,I've worked for several hotel chains in my many years working in the industry and Hyatt took relatively good care of me. My personal manager was a horrible human being and was having an affair with the head of security whom she oversaw. Aside from that... I enjoyed my team and fellow coworkers.
good,I love what I do. The only thing lacking is the benefits; the prior application for health insurance did not go through. So sought after outside resources for necessary insurance.
good,"Be prepared to work long hours , the pay is good however since its a large hotel, employees are often minding their own matters, and there seems to be a lack of family at work place"
good,"As a bartender, the longer the list of ""specialty drinks"" and different recipes, cuts efficiency. Guests take too long to order, have too many questions, and the novice drinker tends to choose a sweet, not-too-sophisticated drink. It is not likely they will reorder."
good,"Hotel feito por gente trabalhadora e que sonha com com dias melhores e ser reconhecido, mas os diretores precisam ser transferidos para aprender e se atualizar, eles mesmos estragam alguns funcionários e cria um ambiente ostil."
good,I only worked there on the weekend for extra money.  I quit because I was offered a full time position at another company.  I would probably still be working here.
good,"Each night required the hotel to be locked every night, patrolled regularly and unlocked every morning. Because of the recent purchase, the hotel, has recently undergone changes in culture and in management.. I was able to enhance my personal customer interaction skills."
good,"Answered incoming telephone calls"
good,"Job was very stressful when I first started, but that was mostly equated to my manager. I was able to move up the ranks to a position with better hours and eventually became the lead pastry cook (cook 3). I learned to delegate projects and become a stronger supervisor."
good,being able to help out the guests and interact with them on a daily basis is really what makes the job enjoyable. You meet so many different people from so many different places.
good,Hyatt has some of the best benefits I have ever had. The comp rooms are a huge bonus especially when looking for vacation ideas. Management is decent.
good,"Job was faced paced, high volume. Management was horrible and under qualified. High employee turnover. Workplace culture was limited. Guests were diverse."
good,You learn quick how to use the hospitality check in/out system. You are able to connect with guest staying in the hotel on a personal level. The management team could be more concern in making sure their employees have the confidence to deal with any situation that arises.
good,I'm currently an employee at the Hyatt and I love working here. It is fast pace and here is always something to do.  I wish the benefits was better. Management is good.
good,"Overall this company has a lot to offer to their employee in benefits. Depending in which department your working for, expect to be busy because Hyatt cares about their guest services."
good,"It is a company with desire to be the best on customer service, a company based on culture and family values.  An open space for enough visitors to park there vehicles while they do shopping."
good,"Hyatt was a great place to work while I was in school. However, my position at the time was basically everything. I did reservations, while also being a good, while also being a waiter, bar attendant, guest services, waitress, etc. Hours were not consistent every week, I worked mornings and late nights, it was hard balancing that with school but it did pay well and gave me consistent hours per week."
good,"Hyatt regency Boston is a great hotel to work for , advancement is possible to those who really want it . General athmosphere is fast paced but bslanced without being hecktic , generally great staff , easy to get aling with and everyone is polite and respectable . Managenet is great they show respect to their employees , encourage us to alway ms go the extra step in oroviding a great experience for our guests , employees are respected and their needs and wishes addressed , all in all I would reckonend Hyatt revency Boston as a place of dmployment to anyone willing to wirk hard and advance in his/her career"
good,This is a great hotel brand that offers a lot of advancement for staff. The full service hotel environment can be fun but stressful and the pay is only average.
good,Work very hard and learned a lot from my experiences with the hyatt would recommend this job to others advancement opportunity is there for the taking
good,"Great place as a first job  and/or if your goal is going to be in the hospitality sector. otherwise it is nice overall. however, the benefit are too letter for too much working hours."
good,its to much work and not enough hours not a steady 8 to 12 hours a day like i was promised . the are very unprofrssinal and rude even the bosses that are higher up
good,It's a decent place to work overall.  Communications between departments is problematic and some managers tend to be territorial.  Accountability is sorely lacking.
good,Good people to work for always had happy customers the only down fall was no texts taken out and there was no benefits other than that great work place
good,"There are many great opportunities with Hyatt. With a variety of locations all over the world and a handful of departments, there is always a job to be found."
good,"It was a very fast paced, demanding workplace. Had to fulfill a lot of tasks requiring to operate different machinery and tools."
good,"I loved the guests. I cross-trained in reservations, catering and PBX."
good,Getting cussed out for messing up even the simplest thing can get old the chefs are always cool but the servers can be insane and demanding at times. The tips are really good for the servers but not very good for the food runners
good,Me sirvió como experiencia para desarrollar mis habilidades en jardinería y aprender el trabajo en equipo
good,"You earn an hourly rate and your production can add up to great bonus' on any given day.  Additionally, there are often cash incentives!"
good,"I work in Hyatt, but under contractor without any benefit.I like people who work right there but I dont get paid well. honestly, i learned a lot from my supervisors.also, people are very friendly."
good,"Learning is the only way to do something right. Prep for yourself, cause they wont do it for you. Even if its on a production sheet"
good,Since I have been at the Hyatt Regency I have been loved by everyone in there. I also show them I love and care about them as well. The work there is easy. The more you learn the better you will become.
good,"Primarily fast-paced"
good,"Inizio giornata lavorativa alle ore 9, ottimo luogo dove poter imparare diverse tecniche relative alla conservazione e cottura dei cibi. Ambiente lavorativo tranquillo e buona gestione del personale da parte del management. Il lavoro di squadra rappresenta la parte piu piacevole del lavoro."
good,"Its a okay job, nothing special besides them providing better pay as well as good hours. oh and they are really flexible when it comes to working with your schedule."
good,This place is a good stepping stone. If you are trying to get through school and need a job to work with your schedule then this is a good place but the management is hard to deal with and treat each employee differently. Instead of treating everyone equally.
good,"I liked my team and the job I was at."
good,i was a steward at hyatt yr 2005 to 2007..six months after i was promoted as a stewarding team leader because of my hardwork and dedication on my work..shfitng schedules was very accomodating for me..i never found any regrets about my schedules..but  my daughter is starting to grow i need much more on finances thats why i tried my luck to apply for abroad..and here i am working here in dubai..dish to a chef to trainor..hope that someday i could learn much more..add some more knowledge on my career..in hyatt i learn to be more productive coz of my managers..they push me to the limit to earn their trust on me..i live in cavite my workplace is in manila..
good,"It helped you to handle challenges in different work environment."
good,Very easygoing job alot of benifites pay could be better very little drama decent customers no job advancement free stays but have to book months in advance
good,Work task vary  given the  role you assigned for the day. The sheer busyness of the day  causes the time to quickly  go by.Each day  is an opportunity to grow  and learn  and become proficient with each task.
good,"jefes prepotentes con el personal ademas era muy difícil trabajar en equipos cada quien tenia solo 1 labor, a excepcion de cuando faltaba un trabajardor, 1 de los trabajadores tenia que llevar 1 labor extra, se aprende atrabajar asi, pero el tiempo limita mucho los compañeros no apoyan y no hay suficientes herramientas de trabajo"
good,"A typical day at work runs smooth, with minor bumps along the way. Being at this company with the diverse backgrounds and perspective of my co-workers has taught me that guests aren't just the external people that visit the hotel or call, it is also the internal people that you interact with daily (coworkers, other departments, management, etc.) and the same kindness and professionalism that is shown to external guests should also be shown to internal guests. The hardest part about working at this location in my department, is the politics involved when it comes to management. They tend to lose sight of the people that actually work under them and pay attention to only the numbers (revenue), so the morale is low and the turnover rate is high. The most enjoyable part of this job is my coworkers. We have grown to love each other as well as learn from each other. The working relationships that I have built here will stay with me for a long time."
good,I only worked there for a month and it was only part time. I was always out of place and never really shown what needed to be done unless the chef has time to show me. sous chef and supervisor made me feel ill ant ease.
good,A day here was something else. I worked as the plants Pot man. I would melt metal down to liquid form then full up the machines pots that were being in use that day. Co workers were friendly. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was having to be next to the hot reverb that was at a temperature of 1100-1400 Celsius for 10 to 12 hours daily. The most rewarding part getting the job done on time and recognition from management for my hard work.
good,"I worked for the Hyatt for nearly 3 years and during my time there, I was allowed to work in almost every department, learn front and back of house management and fully comprehend the fundamentals of what makes a large hotel property work."
good,my work in this place was very good because i started a new position
good,Must be willing to deal kwih coporate politics in order to advance. The best and my personal favorite manager was fired from the kitchen simply for failing to comply with company politics and gossip. In my opinion...
good,Managed employees from all over the world. Great atmosphere to meet a lot of different people and learn about other cultures.
good,I loved the job of valet service and made good money. The general manager was rude. Lower management was great.
good,"this hotel is my 1st experience being a room attendant,,and I can say it is the hardest one..in this hotel I learned everything about housekeeping.."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Hyatt. The day would start off with a pre shift, which allowed us to have some type of understanding of what was going on in the hotel throughout each day. I became very close with a lot of my coworkers and what I learned was that teamwork makes everything easier on a busy day. I wasn't impressed by management as we changed management 3 times throughout my thirteen months. The hardest part of the job was not being able to advance the way I wanted to; however, the most enjoyable part was the bond I had with the other agents."
good,Every Day is different experience since it was working in land
good,"My over all workdays at the Hyatt were good. I learned how to be a leader of a team and how to be effective at it. My managers were good, always willing to help out and give advice on how to be better. My co-workers for the most part were very good at getting work done quick and correct while maintaining a positive attitude. They made it a really positive place to be. THe hardest part of the job would be picking up the slack from last minute call ins, and my favorite part of the job was leaving knowing i just pulled off another successful shift with my team."
good,It's a great place to work for in regards to benefits and perks but since the corporation has more than one corporate offices. Management can be terrible or awesome depending on the location
good,I am able to display my interactive talent daily with a very diverse population.
good,"checking guest in and out, making reservations, cleaning office area, restocking beverages, snacks"
good,A new experience everyday. Ever changing dynamics. The team is cooperative and respectful. The motto is to live the brand promise of creating energizing experiences by meaningful connections.
good,"in Hyatt Regency I working maximum one month.Then I leave this job,because salary is not will good for me.But when I working in there I working a maximum."
good,"I didn't work directly with Hyatt at this Hotel, Kokua Hospitality was managing this hotel and hired me. That is a different story, Kokua Hospitality is, so far, the worst company I ever worked for. Nothing to do with Hyatt Brand."
good,"Personnel très collaboratif et à l'écoute , sens de communication"
good,"Besides some questionable calls by the managers, the company offers plenty of incentives. I’ve been here for 3 years and still feel like I haven’t reached a point where I want to be, but I know I can get there if I keep at it."
good,"Working at Hyatt provided a wonderful wealth of experience in many areas of food and beverage, revenue generation and people skills.The company have a good culture of inclusion."
good,Never had a job like this and people there were willing to help and teach me things I was unaware of working behind the sean of a big banquet dinner was amazing
good,"A great hotel and company, but hard work as on a tight budget. Great clientele who want good service delivered at good value for money.  Scope to develop your career, but work life balance was not right at time"
good,Salary employees can expect to work more than 40 hours a week.  The colleague team is great to work with and the hotel is beautiful.  Great central location
good,"Great company to work at, they care about the employees and make sure to set us up for success each time. The managers have your back and the constant flow of guests makes it a great place to work and grow."
good,"Great Management, great workers, great opportunity. Really enjoy the company. Benefits, perks, people, meeting new people and providing excellent customer service is Key."
good,"A fast paced environment, coworking with colleagues helped a lot to ensure guests were satisfied. There was always something to be done, either with individual guests or groups that arrived it allowed me to develop my leadership capabilities and get to know different people from all over the world"
good,"Work days were sometimes long, but we got the work done to the client's specifications.  Coworkers were great.  Hyatt workplace culture was laid back and professional."
good,I spend a good time here and will like to work again in future if get a chance. Environment is good and staff is very friendly. Good knowledge can be gained here
good,Promueven mucho el desarrollo y promocion interna.
good,Un environnement de travail stimulant qui permet d'acquérir rapidement de nouvelles compétences.
good,"lovely environment to work in and people are nice and co-operative. The buffet was amazing with so much choice, something for everyone. We had a club lounge room with a fantastic view and we were able to be allocated the room I had requested which I appreciated a lot. Check in staff quick, helpful, friendly and efficient."
good,Otherwise I enjoyed working for the company met alot of new faces I love doing housekeeping it's a good opportunity an a good job working with fellow co workers an always make sure the customers is taken care of
good,It's good company. Mostly team was on contract. It's good to work there. They have good policies for the staff. The one thing I like mostly everyone us entitle for 2 days off.
good,Awesome experience working with the team and the management. Someone was always there to guide you.Loved the training for the management. Overall a great experience.
good,"It was hard at the beginning but i went through it fast ."
good,I love the Hyatt! So many people from different companies that initially become your family through the busy and slow days! The hardest part of the job is taking the heat from other workers because of complicated tables.
good,Fast paced sales and customer satisfaction oriented environment. Not the worse hotel to work for and not the best depending on what department you're in.
good,"Good place to start your career.. management ok.  Pay sucks.  And that’s all I’m going to say.  Wish you my very best..........,,,,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,Disappointed that things talked about in the interview never came to fruition.  No room for advancement.  Stepped up to take additional responsibility when co-worker was out of the office.  Wasn’t given opportunity for training to advance.
good,"Great benefits and employees make the workload easier. However, poor pay scale in comparison to nearby hotels, poor communication between management and employees."
good,"good company"
good,"The staff and management is good, you receive nice hours, and great service. I learned how to engage in more conversation with others and provide good customer service."
good,"I worked for one year with Hyatt and did not know much about details of the company. I had to monitor Fire System working in the 93 storied building. I monitored all activities related to Fire System and had a close liaison with my Supervisor. I was looked after well by my Supervisor. Actually, I was hired by ABM Security Company and deployed there in Hyatt to work. After one year, the Security Branch of ABM was transferred to Allied Universal and I had to work in another sight deployed by Allied Universal."
good,Fast paced environment stressful at times but overall great front desk staff that provided a exciting experience. Learned a lot about organization and efficiency in the position
good,It was fun working at a hotel. People are really nice and help you out in anything. You really have to by focus on your job. Do what you do and make sure the people are satisfied.
good,"Nice company, met a lot of diverse people. However they were not very helpful with my scheduling needs. I was working fulltime hours but was not getting my full time benefits"
good,A typical day at work takes a lot of observing the guest's needs and being able to provide their requests at a timely manner. I learned how to personalize a guest stay.
good,"I liked that my job was easy but challenging it was challenging because some days the guest would leave it nice and easy to clean where I just have to take the trash out clean out everything and be on to my next room and then other time they leave it messy , but it’s not hard because theses are basic life skills , I like cleaning and once I got the hang of the bed they were easy and I could just go right along with the rest of the stuff."
good,"I was in charge of multiple departments and found myself making less than what others doing no management were making with different companies. While part of this comes down to my doing more as a person and having higher expectations for myself, I believe such an amazing company should focus on recognizing efforts as well."
good,"Good place to work team of house keepers here can be short. Sometimes causing housekepers to be a lil over work. However they do offer benefits, they reward employees ."
good,"Good place to work. Fair management, with pleasant co workers. I learned how to deal with all sorts of people of different cultures, attitudes and work ethics."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Hyatt Regency. The staff I had at the time was great to work with. Even though we did not have our own parking lot, nor had any benefits as a part-timer."
good,"Beautiful environment, fun, fast paced.  Living wage, good coworkers, responsive management.  Opportunities for upward mobility.  Excellent benefits. ed"
good,"The Hyatt Regency was a nice place to work, low pressure, great opportunities,  depending on individuals involvement."
good,"It's pretty much what you would expect as a front desk agent. You become familiar with your regular guests, you usually become work friends with your colleagues, and sometimes the customer service part is stressful."
good,"I'll be honest, this hotel does not have a healthy sales team. There is a lot of internal sabotage and tons of turnover is every role. Even the Director left after three years and the Associate director is leaving after barely a little over a year. The GM is also really old and seems to only care with ownership (Hunt Oil) has to say. Also, if you plan on being a sales assistant, plan to do all your sales managers work. Not even the normal amount as your job requires, you will literally clean and touch every single booking, contract, and sales proposal. Some of the sales managers  are nice and wont have you do everything because they are good on their own, but others just cant do anything or choose not to because they feel it is your job.....These are also the sales mangers who sleep around with clients, come in hungover, and ignore their clients calls. Just beware...."
good,"A more relaxed and laid back atmosphere. You have an ability to work on your own pace as long as you reach your monthly goal. A lot of perks, like free stay in hotels when you go on vacation, free meals, free dry cleaning, free parking, discounted rates for hotel for your relatives. An annual Banquet event to recognized employees, annual picnic for employees and their families."
good,I wanted to focus on hair but the emapsis in the salon is mostly nails. There is not a lot of clients who are return guests but mostly out of towners.
good,"All is all I have 4+ years of experience.work culture is good.And we have more balanced work,Having good support team.supporting Environment.Over good"
good,"Fun to work with most guests. Starter as the shuttle driver making decent tips. Lower management (shift supervisors) was horrible and incompetent when I was there.  GM, AGM, and FOM were great to work with."
good,Working as an intern I was able to experience the different departments within the Rooms Department. Interning at Hyatt allowed my to advance my managerial skills because the managers were good at working to foster leadership. Hyatt is a family company and the truly comes across because all employees help to support one another.
good,Hyatt is a exceptional brand with great work life balance. Collaboration is king and hospitality is all about diversity and inclusion. One of the best employment brands in the sector
good,hyatt is an excellent place to work. fully of exciting and energetic employees. plenty of opportunity for growth and expansion. you can definitely reach your goals with this company.
good,"I like he people I worked with.  I liked helping the guests so they could have he best experience possible. I got along great all the other employees, in all departments. Superiors went out of the way to help in anyway they could.to make the job easier."
good,"The best hotel team I have ever worked with. Mr. Nizam Omar Director of Food and Beverage was the best mentor in my life. I learned a great deal working at The Grand Hyatt Amman, Jordan."
good,Hyatt is overall a good company to work for. Poor management can make your experience with Hyatt Stressful. I've worked at 5 different property's and overall I had a good experience.
good,"I joined this company as restaurant cashier and worked for five years. During the tenure I worked as night auditor used to audit all bills raised by cashiers."
good,"The poolside was hard work especially at rush hours, and the amount of tips could be super uneven depending on what section we were assigned. We got a lot of free meals and other benefits, though."
good,"Great Company . They care for their employees & stress the culture of Hyatt is authentic hospitality which improves you ad an individual. They are also  helpful & greatly supportive of their employees & always seek to help, improve & keep them happy."
good,"busy, friendly clean workplace. Located Perth metro area. Training provided. Approachable senior staff. Good communication within the company. Clean staff kitchen with facilities."
good,"I've nothing against the Hyatt brand. Linchris only gave the GM salary. Though my offer letter and contract clearly said salary, it became known that only the GM had salary while all other department heads were regulated to hourly, with approved overtime to achieve contracted ""salary""."
good,"When I first started at the Hyatt Place hotel I really did enjoy it & getting a lot of hours. But here lately I be dreading because work have slowed down tremendously, hours & days getting cut, Im not getting paid what I suppose to get paid, etc."
good,"It was so good working in that company environment."
good,"Hard to adjust to daily routine when there is constant upper management turnover. So many people get hired and fired on a month to month basis, staff find it increasingly difficult to have a ""norm"" and even to remember names."
good,"It was a nice place to work , ;learnt a lot , learnt new things , "
good,"Great Company, Great Staff, Shuttle,Work Hours flexible, Great Customers, Atlanta is a great city to work in as well. traffic is not to bad in this area."
good,"Good place to learn a lot of things,managment is helpful and different cultures to know."
good,"Hyatt City of Dreams Manila let me experience what is truly the kind of work in a busy kitchen. It taught me how to work under pressure, with minimum supervision but still produce work with quality and character."
good,Good company to work for. Lots of long days and sometimes you have to be at the hotel at 4am. All three locations I worked had very good General Managers.
good,"banquet was great On the most part working there was pleasant. I did not like getting off at 11pm. There were times I had to stay at Penn Station Newark, because I got off to late to get a bus."
good,"The workers really made this place so enjoyable to come to work at everyday. The work & hours could be difficult at times but, the rewards & experience was worth it."
good,Me gusta trabajar en esta compañía tiene muy buenos beneficios
good,"Servicing customers in a soothing environment where the clientele will experience a truly relaxing experience. Our spa overlooks the beautiful hill country and golf course, Truly indulgent with our own saltwater pool."
good,Great company to work for.  Opportunity to learn new things ever day.    Lots of opportunities to cross train in different departments to learn what you enjoy most.
good,"I have learn so much in bit of time. It is a great experience and will definitely willing to again. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The"
good,"Le lieu de travail est bien chaleureux, l'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste était la relation avec les clients que l'on avait."
good,I had to start my job from 11am in the morning to 5pm in the evening. I used to go my college in the morning. I learned to work with different people with team spirit and individual.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo!! Se trabaja en equipo y constante evaluación mensual!
good,"This was a fun place to work."
good,so fun to work in that place that time and work just fly.Here work on professional level is an addition to your career growth.Staff are selective and motivated and long span of there tenure in the company
good,"Buen ambiente laboral a pesar de que todos tuviéramos  mucho trabajo, nos animamos unos a los otros."
good,this job is fast pace.work load depends on local and up and coming events in the surrounding area. You will always meet new people from all over the world. this job is good for a person that like to work at you own pace by yourself
good,"Hyatt Hotels is a world wide know brand , I'm honored to work with them. I learned a lot from working in Hyatt. they taught me what hospitality is and how to take care of the guest."
good,Tons of Office Work. Very busy weeks. Also very stressful position. Not your typical job in hospitality. You need to maintain a high level of orgaization
good,"Everyday 12 hrs shift "
good,"Beautiful property. Opened in February 2016. Check it out!"
good,"A typical day you meet guest from major companies"
good,"- teamwork with all team"
good,Hyatt is very advanced with system and processes. Albeit consistency is a concern. Employees are well taken care. Employees need to be treated as per their caliber and work performances
good,"I learned to work in various departments of the hotel ,started part time and was able to move to full time in the Restaurant unfortunately the management changed frequently so the restaurant was run with dysfunction."
good,It was agood and bad experience. I did not like my boss. I was an intern. We did a lot of things at work. It was hot working in Austin. I do not know what else to say.
good,Great company to work for. Management was great guest were amazing. definitely hard work considering it was at the DFW airport. would love to work there again.
good,Good people and management. Not really any opportunity for advancement because it is such a small property. Good place to start if you want to learn more about the hospitality industry.
good,Very fun and interactive with everyone and especially the guest. Guest always was and is hyatts proiotory even long after the guest checks out. And management is really good to their employees.
good,"Balanced work, fast paced. Good people working and good manager. I've worked many hours a day and weekly and always available to work and help people."
good,"the management had no clue of what they were doing or what needs done. blaming people that have nothing to do with complaints, even though they knew why customers complaint but didn't work on resolution"
good,This was a great company to work for. The benefits were not bad and it is a fast paced environment. I wish the hours were better however. I learned many different positions while there.
good,Great location so busines at the Hyatt is always busy. Staff is great but the turn over with management is very high...great place to learn new things
good,Love the job and talking to different guest with different stories everyday. Love the 12 free rooms per year and the discounts that come with the company.
good,"Nice hotel,my first hotel to work,so many thing i learn from this hotel,"
good,Cette experience a été faite dans le cadre d'un stage
good,"I enjoyed working there, while living in my own apartment. "
good,Overloaded work but manageable. Employees are cooperative. We have strict bosses but all is well regarding their management to their employees. The hardest part of my present job is when 2 or more checks are in need right away.
good,"Seat guests as well as served them"

Arranging the utensils, the plates, the tables, the environment of the place if what kind of setting the gusts wants. The management was fine but, they will only accept the locals first before us, foreigners. My co-workers were mostly part-time students and locals there in the place. They were also good but they still don't know how to adjust in the people around them. The hardest part is when knowing that you are already their elder or some sort of like a leader, they will give you the neophytes and orient them from the first til' the end while you are facing the work ahead of you too. It's still fun though teaching the neophytes, teaching them what to do and giving them advice on what to do the next time they are asked about something."

good,"There is no such thing as a typical day in the hospitality industry at the Front Desk.  It can definitely be stressful with long hours (10+) and one mostly always works weekends and holidays.  Due to this, if family is the most important aspect in your life, this can make that a huge challenge.  With the stress comes refreshing moments with your guests and employees.  The guests that always come back because of you is what keeps you going and loving your job.  On the other hand, you have your guests that are quite vicious, but these are the guests that only make you stronger and better at your job.  You build a strong relationship with your co-workers because they now are your family.  Running reports, checking up on emails, checking in and out guests, taking care of their issues and requests are the main things you'll be doing on a day to day basis.  Ensuring your associates are happy as well as your guests is the most important part of the job."

good,"A typical day at work would be greeting guest and helping them enjoy their stay at our hotel. Also, answering the phones, paying attention to detail and going through the check-in and check-out process. I've learned how to use the computer softwares and be more organized. The management at this hotel could use some work. They are all young and naive. My co-workers are great. We all get along and look out for one another, and help each other if need to. The hardest part of my job is trying to please each and every guest that we have at the resort. This seems easy, but when every guest keeps wanting more and more there is just so much that I am able to do for them. But, I do try and please them 100% every time. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the guest and seeing comment cards with sweet notes attached with my name on them.

My co-workers that I worked with on the second shift became so close like a family that we still are the same way today even with all of us having other careers.

good,"Good team and good management. Decent benefit, good hours and a constantly busy day."
good,it iwas a good experience and i like the type of work i was doing in the hotel
good,I have worked at this hotel for over four years. I loved the location and I had a great group of friends. The distance was the only problem with maintaining work and school at that time was a challange but I succeeded in both. I have all great things to say about this hotel.
good,The enthusiasim and optimistic attitudes combined with a diverse crew makes working at the Hyatt optimal
good,No day was routine. I had variety of assignments and high quality technology. Change to outsource work was difficult. Downsizing for past two years.
good,"I am a front desk manager who works hard and gives 120% on myself to this company. I have over 20 employees to look up to me for decisions along with the Assistant General Manager and General Manager and I have to always be alert and be prepared for the unknown. I love my job because I get to meet many different people all over the world. To know that a guest came to my hotel and left with a smile, that means my team and I did a great job."
good,"Working there was fun, it required a team work effort. I got to increase my knowledge in maintenance and engineering."
good,"A typical day at work consist of cleaning rooms, providing for guest request and ensuring that their stay at the facility was pleasant and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was satification all requirements of the guest relative to management decisions. The job was challenging but enjoyable."
good,"I did a lot of clerical work such as answering phones, inputting and verifying payroll, and benefit requests. Handled employee concerns, such as requests for time off and I served as the liaison between the banquets and other departments such as catering, sales and HR."
good,A typical day at work is usually busy you learn new things about the job everyday. The mangement is good and understanding when it comes to there employees and running the hotel. There are days that are full of laughter before the work day starts.
good,"1.) typical day ,when iam facing the guest they cant understand English, so iam using sign language at that time to convence the guest. 2)iam learned more in hyatt. 3)I like my supporting management .4) we are always working like team supporting each other when reqired..5)when iam facing too much complians together,that is my hardest part 6)when we are working together&supporting my team that is most enjoyable part of the job for me......"
good,I learned a lot working for Hyatt Place! The tools and experiences i have under my belt will take me to new levels in my career
good,Nice clean enviornment with great helpful people all aroung.
good,"The Hyatt Regency is the second largest hotel in Houston. My typical day included room inventory control, guest checkin, scheduing, quality control, employee evaluation, conflict resolution, group reservations, departmental meetings, and much more. I learned how to manage a large property, while still focusing on individual guest experience. I also learned how to manage a large front office staff with different personalities and opinions. As a Front office manager I was the face of the Hotel and responded to inquaries in all departments. The hardest part of this job was the unpredictable hours. At times I may work a typical 8 hour shift and other times I would work 16, hospitality never slept. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to exceed guest expectations while providing for all their needs. It gave me great pleasure to hear that they loved their stay and would be coming back every time they are in Houston."
good,My day starts with morning briefing and we do service 13 rooms in a day.
good,"I had joined the Hyatt in 2008, about four months after I moved to the USA. I enjoy the diverse work environment at the Hyatt. In my current job as a server inroom dinning I also encounter people from all corners of the world and this is another opportunity for me to learn different cultures and improve my customer service experience."
good,"great company to work for,i enjoyed meeting new challanges and interacting with the hotel guest,providing them the excellent customer service they deserved."
good,"handling corporate accounting , project accounting, banking , Taxation matters ( direct & indirect both), and involve in verious type of MIS reporting."
good,"I like doing housekeeping but Hyatt did not pay right and the gm was there she did not no what she was doing at all..,................................"
good,"It definitely does get busy, always something to do, you might be able to do ours if you are willing to work in the afternoons and mornings it’s good overall"
good,"As of the night auditors on duty I would come in and see what happened during the previous shifts, how many check-ins were left, complete paperwork, and carry out the rest of the duties. This was certainly the biggest property I have worked for so I learned how the operations were ran at a property of that size.  However, the property was so big it was hard to get to know people and a lot of the departments were as it seemed less important than others.  The most enjoyable part was working with another agent."
good,"Was a good place "
good,I believe working for a cooperation verse not working for one is completely different. I would say this company had a lot of behind issues that I personally would change if it was my company.
good,I was usually by myself learning how to operate my area without help. The company did offer free meals such as breakfast and lunch which was one incentive to keep me working at the company.
good,Good company to work. 3 free meals a day and a locker room where u can change clothes. Worker r nice and on time. Building located in a shopping center mall
good,"When it’s busy it’s busy, but we work as a team, they are nice people, and that’s what made me stay a little longer. I left because of the manager, he micro manages us. But I heard he was transferred. I probably would have stayed. The"
good,"Typically, I experiaced developing good habits on joint work tasks with the sales team and learned on how to build a new team to work with."
good,This Job is a slow pace working environment. The manger try to work with you when it comes to what days you can or can not work. There isnt much hour to give during the holidays.
good,5am early shift cooking for hundreds or thousands of people. You will see a bunch of new face or even a celebrity here and there. You get to learn from didferent chiefs so you always learn something new in the kitchen everyday.
good,"Short and simple. great place to work and be. Everyone is friendly. Benefits are great. "
good,Really busy when the stadium has events. The amount of work is unfair for the day and night shift. The kitchen does not have a lot of support from the Chef. Lacking of management in hospitality.
good,Nothing to say about the company at this moment. Its been a real pleasure working there. people are better workers when they work together as a team..
good,"Extremely fast paced and high demand on servers and employees. Very good money as far as server positions go. It is a sink or swim kind of position on the cocktail side of the restaurant. Either you can keep up, or you won't last too long."
good,In general a great place to work.Created a good team work environment for all employees.Always allow breaks and try not to overwork staff.Genuine care from most managers.Company have regular employee appreciation programmes.
good,"Management doesnt help, but workers work hard and are very knowledgeable. been here many years, many different managers. new managers never talk to current workers about how things are done. they just come in and make new things trying to save money. but stressing the workers out and less efficient cause they dont do the labor part."
good,"People are nice, job is relaxed but the pay isn't good enough. Decent benefits. Most enjoyable part is the interaction with the guest. The hardest part is staying busy on slow nights."
good,"A typical day at the Market at the Hyatt was serving customers their food and drink orders in a fast paced environment. Coworkers and customers were great, but the management did not consider your personal life at all when making the schedule."
good,"This was a great experience for me getting back in the work force after having children. I enjoyed the interactions with the guest and had a great working experience,"
good,La única desventaja cuando el hotel está vacío son pocas horas de trabajo
good,Capacitar al personal staff ya que no posee los conocimientos del manejo adecuado de los departamentos
good,"Working here wasn't horrible. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the coworkers, the guests. Management and supervisors treated everyone equally while I was there. Waterford Group bought out this hotel and it went from a cozy homey job with warm yellow walls to the corporate atmosphere with gray walls and pointy furniture. A lot of guests said the same thing when Waterford took over."
good,"stressful for PM shift no help from AM shift"
good,"Because I was in school, I was looking for a part-time job that would allow me freedom and flexibility to pursue my studies while also making enough money to pay off student loans and pay for housing / fun activities. On top of everything else, it was a fun environment that employees did not dread going into each day."
good,"Fun and exciting job. My job consisted of setting up meeting rooms for conventions , breakfasts, luncheons. I was in charge of 10 meeting rooms on second floor of hotel."
good,"Decent enough place to work. You will be expected to learn and do everything that every other employee does, not just your own job. And you should not expect to be paid any extra for it. That is just the way it is."
good,Hyatt place was a excellent job I wish I have stayed we had fun worked as a team go our jobs done it was just amazing we had an hour break the management was so cool and down to earth we just seen eye to eye
good,"Working with all sorts of people and limitations as well as emotions, this is a very fast paced, emotionally draining job. The hours will fly by, you will be able to help people and you will be in charge of diffusing stressful situations. Both rewarding and lacking in equal parts, this is a good starting job for many people with little advancement."
good,"Part time work as a student, one was front of house while the other was back of house, was not very fulfilling but gave me the experience to move on to better jobs so really value the experience."
good,"Growth opportunity is there if you're willing to put in the work. But you have to be careful. There are always going to be those who only think of themselves and that's going to be hard if you're the type of person who ""cares"" about others more than you do yourself."
good,"Great place to work, however, corporate operational leadership sometimes undervalues professional and technical staff.  Frequent corporate reorganizations and restructuring creates an unstable work environment."
good,Great place to meet new people with the opportunity to build relationships throughout great customer service skill & timely errand runs that provide guest with a great experience in the city.
good,"Beautiful location. Parking isn't the best, but mountain view makes up for it. Ski pass is great or seasonal bonus. Discount room rates for employees are the best."
good,"I have been working for Hyatt for a total of three years now and what i have learned is that the job overall is a really good job but this place will be absolutely hellacious for someone who does not have a very thick skin. The workplace politics and the hierarchy here is ridiculous. Mostly its management. If you don't kiss the ring be ready to be promptly ""forced"" out. So its either you have to learn how to go along to get along or get out."
good,"Work hard and fast in order to complete all rooms and finish on time. "
good,"Es ist sehr interessant aber sehr schwer von der Arbeitskultur,"
good,"fast paced, lots of physical labor, decent pay. staff and housekeeping manager is nice and helpful. however Manager woman of location is very rude and more concerned with her look than anything."
good,"It is a place where workers in this building have been here  for  quite a while and has lost in my opinion a hotel touch as far as services and other. With all the changes of banners and management it takes great people to remain here "
good,The Hyatt was a beautiful property to work and was an awesome experience for me. The management was good and so were the employees. The downside was their was no room to advance in the job and pay raises did not come very easily.
good,"It was a great place to work.. the insurance package was way to much for the average mim wage person..  "
good,"Grand Hyatt is a great brand- Great Hotel culture."
good,Great place to work due to work environment. busyness of days varies daily but is fairly consistent and that usaully dictates workload. Drama free easy to work.
good,"they offer a free lunch which is a plus for me.and good hotel rates for the employees,but no promotions within the department.and there are no pay raise.i feel its a dead end job."
good,"Good experience for working in a high pace environment. Provided full time employees with benefits. Management could improve, but you meet a lot of people in this industry and it's a good place to work if you want to advance in hospitality."
good,Hyatt is a great hotel to work for. The company does well with it's training procedures and is very employee focused. It is always trying new innovative techniques in the industry and welcomes new ideas.
good,"worked as room service server, good hours and good tips. workers nice to work with. good pay, managment good, will work with employees , very flexible"
good,"All employees work together to insure we provide the best service to our guest. We strive to have a fun, team working, environment. Gallery host go out of their way with multiple task to insure every guest feels at home. Management jumps in to help when needed. Hyatt provides plenty of resources to succeed in your position."
good,"always getting busy most days of the week.free dinners included.friendly co-workers. hard job part of it.a lot of cleaning in kitchen,setting up and filled the items for next day;breakfast,lunch."
good,"Typical day at work is when there's a lot of check out."
good,"I learned how to program Micros Simphony and I loved it!"
good,"Meeting new people was a great experience. Managers really help you to become more professional in almost any situation. The only hard part is learning new things when you are so used to the original things you have been doing, but change is constantly happening on daily basis."
good,Working with hard workers as a team. The co- workers respectful and love to work with you. The mangers are good people and they always doing they job when I see them.
good,"My typical day at work would start with reviewing and planning my event amongst the other parties/events going on in the event space. "
good,Fun fast paced environment with many good employees from different countries ability to switch departments if not satisdied with current department also free meals
good,I believe hospitality can be rewarding but challenging. My team works really well together but it was challenging at first because the hotel opened way too early.
good,"I worked for Hyatt AND a property management company so Hyatt didn't fully own our hotel. They always came in with a lot of great ideas and fun visions when the trainers came through, but it was a lot of talk in my opinion. They try to build a fun culture, but they don't train on the actual daily operations of the hotel."
good,"Interesting work ethic, nice people, and beautiful hotel."
good,"Front desk agents at Hyatt Places do a lot. It gives a lot of experience and the shifts go buy fast on busy days. Be ready to work front desk, serve breakfast, bar tend and wash dishes."
good,"hard work jop , work as group , learned alot about management , in amman - jordan - maneger and sale man , long hour work , communication skills , Quick decision-making"
good,"Worked outside on golf course learned various equipment. Supervisor great to work for. Everyone worked as a team. Hardest part of job working hot summer days,but love working outside."
good,"We were able to share our individual skills and leadership upon working with different cultures. "
good,The collaboration between team members has always been excellent. The teams work hard and work well together. Teams always look for ways to improve their ability to work better together.
good,"Delivering a high level of customer service,attention to detail, authority and responsibility, team work, nothing specific,when you finished with your job duties and having nice meal."
good,Hyatt is productive but unorganized. A run environment but very stressful. The pay is low for the type of work that we do. The management is good but can be better.
good,On a day to day basis you meet great people that sometimes becomes lifetime friends. During my four years working for Hyatt I have grown tremendously in professionally and personally. The people really care for you and your success.
good,Typical day at work is providing everyone with a great smile specially to clients. I learned that the best way to communicate is using your charm to provide a good customer service and the hardest part of the job is the long hours of work
good,This is very demanding but rewarding at the same time. The overall team of the resort is great and has been supportive at all time. The company has great benefits which begin from day one for full time employees.
good,"It was a okay place to work. Its understandable why the hotel business has a high turnover rate. The houseman position is fun, but stressful. Pay is very low for the job requirements"
good,-A great place to work if we are looking for new challenge by its ability to provide you all the skills to accomplish your goal and learn to be a leader
good,"- great job, with minimal benefits"
good,"Many slogan to memorise, sweet and professional people surround you which is good for learning and growing, but you getting bored by all the rules and paper work, serious hierarchical environment."
good,"My typical day included making drinks and assisting the bartender with all things bar related. Specifically, I would clean glasses, stock kegs, replace liquor and prep bar. I learned how to be personable, take care of guests, and make drinks. The management was nice and friendly and the culture was mostly young, college age people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with employees and serving the guests."
good,"The job provided opportunities to grow as a manager and a trainer. Also, it encouraged staff to maintain a great relationship with each other. It was very hands on but also hearts-on."
good,"It was an amazing experience at Hyatt. It was a very unique company and they treated their staff very well. "
good,"The pay was okay for location, the management left something to be desired. opportunities to advance were available. Sanitation was underwhelming but good people to work with"
good,"I enjoyed my almost 3 years at Hyatt.  I met some amazing agents even though it was virtual, we got to know each other and grow and support each other as a team, second family per se. I learned a lot regarding the different level of agents we have here.  It was a nice feeling to advance."
good,"A call-center environment in reservations, with an abundance of confrontational interactions with guests.  A good company overall but reservations was not a good job for me."
good,"This place was a stepping stone for me as a transition to start my "
good,"The workplace culture is great"
good,Nice place to work if you are a retired person.Can get some hours but not really a place if you want to advance.I didn't like when I started we had meal coupons once a month and then it stopped.
good,"This job has been a very fun experience for me, and has introduced me to many individuals that I wouldn't meet on a normal basis. Although, there was very little room to advance in the location that I was working at. Great for work/life balance concerns as well."
good,I had good training here . On the job training was good.but sometime very hectic and long hours.my training manager was very professional and helpful.I gathered vast knowledge from Hyatt.
good,"Great work atmosphere, friendly employees. What I learned working there was that you independently have to come in do your job and go home. Socializing at work was frowned upon. There was a new rule change everyday you went to work. No chewing gum, no headphones, no music, no smoke breaks.... etc.! The hardest part of my job was the new management. The most enjoyable part of my job was making new friends and the guests!"
good,"Bonne entreprise dans laquelle la polyvalence est une qualité obligatoire, grande possibilité d'évolution et où la rigueur est essentielle. "
good,"generally typical day ok. there was xmas parties and general games for the workers. bed making contests, birthday card, had contest for workers to win prizes. I was there for a long time went through several supervisors, then the respect went down hill. lack the ability to communicate with workers. a job can be well and then you get some new people thinking they are making things better when in fact the loose the willing support of the worker due to their actions."
good,Not bad company just not a whole lot of opportunities that ly for a person that's looking for a management role within their company so overall it's okay to work .
good,"Fantastically designed place and excellent brand to work with, Good pre launch exposure, Strong principles on Food and beverage service and delivering excellent customer experience."
good,"Overall it was a good place to work, management when I first got hired cared about staff but that soon changed when new management came in. Hyatt really cares about its reception of guests and makes that a priority."
good,Here I was dedicated to a high demand for exceptional customer service and extreme attention to detail. Double verification of identity and payments due to high fraudulence and identity theft. I learned to easily identify fake bills and recreated ID's. Supervised and trained new hires and taught classes for newly promoted staff members.
good,"Plenty of reports which are actually not needed. Top management asks you to send it to them everyday but all they have to do is use the system, and the system will generate the reports they need."
good,"long days with ladys asking me where the towels at, i learned that i was the fastest guy in the building and management was ok just not good with handling alot of women and the hardest part of the job was dealing with the attitudes of women. Best part of the job was knowing that we will be getting discounts on rooms."
good,"I went through management training in every department of this resort hotel. I then decided to emphasize food and beverage. I first went through stewarding, then I was assistant manager in a 24 hour coffee shop. It was many years ago, but I feel it formed the foudation for my carrer."
good,Lovely Place to work.  I adored my boss and my job but business did tend to be slow at times. I learned a lot about different skin care lines.
good,The Hyatt is a great company to work for and provides support in those who are wanting to move up the business ladder and/or relocate to other destinations.
good,I loved working here even hospitality is a thankless job most of the time. We made our guests feel like family whenever possible. The general manager at the time was the best boss i've ever worked for.
good,An overall good company with a very low budget .I enjoyed meeting the different people I interacted with on a daily basis (from all over the world ) a great place to learn different cultures .
good,"The staff is great and their manner of operations is outstanding, there is a negative atmosphere between employees and management in preference. Some are reprimanded others are not for the same questionable actions made by staff. This issue with in the department keeps moving forward. Reprimand is made for whom ever speaks out to management on the issues on hand in the departmentl"
good,The Hyatt keep they employee clean daily with express laundry service they also keep the work within the company because of lateral service and the helps with there turn over rate
good,"Its very good hotel I  learned a lot to become  good leader to my co work how to more productive,and I'm very lucky to be apart of this company .thank"
good,it is a good training ground especially for the people who is just fresh graduate. we can learn so much things but its until there only. No growth no new learnings.
good,"Para mi Hyatt es una escuela en lo que a hoteleria se refiere, tiene buen ambiente laboral y muy bien estructurado, falta mejorar los sueldos y que exista una mayor oportunidad de promoción y proyección."
good,"knowledgeable, friendly, big staffing, a bit traveling, international chain, more physical, less pay. Hardest part is to extend working after a certain limit. Enjoyable part is with great big team equally supportive and energetic and love and passionate for work and food."
good,"our amazing day in park hyatt abu dhabi , start from set up the tables for breakfast , preaper the coffee machine and a cups teas , what ever we need for breakfast ,"
good,"You will not only become a front desk agent, but you have to serve breakfast and maintain other hotel duties. Overall good experience, job promotion takes a while"
good,They gave me great experience with the hot and cold kitchen and other facets of the hotel's culinary field. They made sure I knew how to follow all the recipes and memorize them and know how to work as a team
good,"At the Hyatt Regency Phoenix I have learned what it takes to set a meeting space for our guest needs, and make sure that their stay is a pleasant experience.. The best part of my job is working with my fellow employees, and the worst part is having to stay late nights. At the hyatt regency phoenix i have become more focused to detail and so I hope to use my current skills for my future job.."
good,This property was fantastic until it was sold off by Corporate to Aimbridge who handles business and employees POORLY.
good,"Great place to learn and advance."
good,"sabes a lo que llegas a trabajar ries un rato con los compañeros antes de que empiece el trabajo al 100% llevan cuentas tras cuenta y hay que cerrarlas enseguida de vez en cuando realizan arqueos de caja para verificar que el dinero este correcto, lo mas complicado es cuando presionan y ya tienes el problema solucionado pero lo jefes siguen pendientes, lo que mas me gusto es que pude conocer a mas personas hice amistades vi que el apoyo entre compañeros es importante y que puedo mejorar cada dia en el trabajo"
good,It was a good place to work. You make decent money and the benefits are good. I've learned not to take things personal and always focus on your work and maintain a relationship with your co-workers but they do not have to be your best fried. Management was sometimes slow with information to give to us but all in all they were good with working with their employees. The hardest part of the job was being stable under pressure and I enjoyed the benefits.
good,"Hyatt offers opportunities for growth and development in numerous areas for employees in all departments. Hyatt has enhanced my abilities to be an effective leader and team player. Throughout my career at Hyatt, I have been able to utilize their training modules and classes to become more knowledgeable about liquors, beer and wine and appropriate food pairings. Due to the high volume of business, year round, I have been able to hone in on my ability to multi-task and create long lasting memories and relationships with our guests, regular and transient. Hyatt's dedication to excellence has encouraged all of their employees to go above and beyond to create ""wow factors,"" which will forever be instilled in my dedication to excellence in future endeavors."
good,I had learned so many things in this organization. I was part of pre-opening team. The management is very good . Had enjoyed when having set up the all the rooms and other areas.
good,"bonne expérience de travail"
good,For the short time that I worked for this company I learned a lot from the management team above me. This was a large location that was constantly adjusting to meet the market needs surrounding them. I look forward to using the skills and knowledge that I received by working for this company.
good,"You'll learn to be hard-working esp. if you're a kitchen staff, with or without supervision because if you slack off, your menial work will always backfire on you, so might as well work not just for you but with your co-workers."
good,"Great place to start career, a lot of things to learn, high standarts. But vacations and offs can be cancelled for no reason."
good,It's a nice place to work for someone who is just starting out working. Most the worker's and mangers are down to earth and friendly. Everyone works hard to make it the best hotel in the city.
good,"Manged and prepared all pastry orders for banquet functions, restaurant and the various hotel outlets.Placed food orders for supplies on daily basis."
good,"its a nice place to work but the salary is very low compare to other hotels, there are lots of things learns and they have advance technology systems. man power is very less due to poor management a person cant be stable there for long time. because there is very long duty time"
good,"un lugar donde uno desea crecer y donde en la inducción empresarial todo se ve super bien, la realidad es distinta, compañeros uno o dos que son compañeros y el resto deja muy poco que desear y en la cuales en los momentos de tensión sacan lo peor de ellos y muchas cosas que son negativas que prefiero decir en una entrevista personal."
good,"Review duties and distribute task. Supervising is challenging, but it easier when you are a hands on supervisor and do not mind assisting any workers who may have a difficult time adjusting or learning task."
good,Learned so much of my job history with the company and had great benefits. You get to meet people(co workers) from all over the world.
good,"Lot of opportunity to be as creative as you want! Lot of long hours, 15 + regularly.  Enjoyed the chance to do whatever was needed to make the operation happen but very stressful trying to explain to the leadership Food operations since they had zero knowledge."
good,"Overall, the experience working under Hyatt has been great. Guest services has taught me how to prevent problems by creating preventative strategies. They have also allowed me to coordinate with the Sales department by giving me the responsibility of coordinating banquets and groups in house. Not only do we handle front desk, but we are also reservation agents. The hardest part of the job was testing out how well one can multi task, and I must say it has taught me to be very efficient in that. The most enjoyable part is meeting people from across the globe and bonding with regulars who stay at this location. Team work is the most important thing to having a successful front desk, which I feel is a strength of mine and of this Hyatt location. As much as I love working here, I desire more than anything to begin a career as I have graduated college."
good,"Hyatt is a very good, clean and nice hotel. My co-worker very friendly and GM is nice too. Though I feel tired at work, I am still happy. because the fine environment  give me encouragement. I like to work hard and learn more work skills."
good,Love working for hyatt.The first couple of years were great but as new people come in and new mangement is placed things change. sometimes for the better sometimes for the worst. At the end of the day make it always make a job worth it.
good,"*always busy"
good,"I enjoy working here however because I am only casual (zero hour contract) I will either get hardly any hours or too many. "
good,Hyatt is a good company to work for.  Lots of benefits and deals from other companies.  The only big problem I have is that you can't use your discount at your home hotel.
good,"I started up as an intern and was promoted to trainee in 2001. I was working at the time at Multimarcas, in their trainee program until I was moved to the Sofitel brand, to a marketing trainee program."
good,The central location is great for business. There is a diverse work force. Having a unique shift will allow time for another gig.
good,"Assisting guests during the check-in/check-out process.  Completing daily tasks at the front desk whether it be as a Front Desk Agent or Bellman.  Also assisting management with any daily tasks that need attended to on that particular day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping guests with their needs, whatever those needs may be.  The toughest part of the job is really tied into that as well when a guest is having difficulty with an aspect of their stay and even after assisting them with their needs, they don't have the best experience possible during their stay at our property."
good,"As a front desk clerk I performed many clerical duties such as: answer telephones, screen and direct calls, organize, prioritize duties, sort mail and maintain confidentiality. Providing every guest with exceptional customer service and maintaining monthly quotas in guest enrollment and check-in scores is a skill I exceeded in perpetually. Other duties as a front desk clerk include but are not limited to: check-in / check-out guests, book reservations (hotel, dinner and city attractions) and maintain room status availability."
good,"I loved working over the summer in a resort setting, getting to meet people from all over the world and having the pleasure of assisting guests in enjoying their time, whether it be on vacation, for a wedding, or even for a work conference. While I respect and value Hyatt as a company overall, the management within the restaurant I was working in was extremely informal and unprofessional on multiple occasions. I would have liked to have seen issues be taken care of in a more timely manner and with more concern."
good,working in hyatt its gud . i learan lots of thing manement job  how to deal with geust .and my all co workiers  good
good,"all day up and down sharing information and coordinates different deparments, give the best service with a genuin smile. the hardest part of the job work with some one dosent give the same importan to the requirements or follow ups of the guest"
good,"Room for advancement, as long as you had the right personality.  The pay was very good and it was less structured than most call centers."
good,"get there on time for the clothing all perfect and the rest as well . how to deal with a lot of stress since the job changed each time . "
good,started work at half 7 finishing work at half 4. I learnt how to brick lay because this is where i got my NVQ level 2 in bricklaying. My co-workers were very helpful and giving me the wiliness to learn. The hardest part of the job was working in a very tight time schedule and to  the highest standard possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends and learning new things to push my career further.
good,Great environment and great team. Learned a lot and growing into management skill was a bonus. The hardest part of the job is not getting to grow in the company because of unfortunate reasons due of lack professionalism on the new management. I enjoyed all my team and everyone i dealt with.
good,My co workers are the best. I learned a lot from my supervisors and managers.
good,"Well I work for Ace Parking, but I work on Hyatt Regency property and the management does not care for us as a separate company. They complain to my manager if something is wrong instead of confronting us workers about a problem. Poor management. Fun place to work."
good,"All administrative functions.  Served as Office Mananger.  Expense reports, A/P, customer service, travel arrangements for C-level executives."
good,I loved my job as a person thta loves to be around different culture around the world.

good,Fun work environment where you meet a lot of interesting people and work long hours on weekend and nights
good,"All around my time with the Hyatt has been enjoyable. However I have reached my personal time frame for being a server. I want to have the opportunity to advance with a company and the Hyatt can't offer me that at this time. The management as a core was good but young and unexperienced in ""real world"" work life but having a manager that wanted to have fun at work made everyone time durning work go by much faster. I absolutely loved the international employees that would come work for the summer, they worked hard and were very appreciative. I would say that my co-workers were fantastic learning tools and made the job more enjoyable."
good,"Hyatt Whitney Hotel provided me with the chance to expznd my maintenance skills and to really use my painting skills to full advantage. sadly, this hotel no longer exists. It was converted into apartments."
good,"You will learn a lot working at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans; therefore, when it is time to move to a different property you will be very prepared.  It is a great place to work."
good,"This job consists of the front desk agent playing multiple roles, a coffee barista, cashier, & cook. Also, checking guests in or out while addressing their needs. "
good,Nice place to work. Hours are good and management friendly and willing to work with your availability.
good,This hotel has a great management team and most of the team is willing to lend a hand when needed. Staffing is low so a lot of responsibility is put onto people's shoulders for tasks outside of their department.
good,"A typical day involved making sure all pools were running properly. It involved some swimming, which I enjoyed. For the most part my co-workers were fun to be around. I learned a lot about a diverse group of people from diferent countries. The hardest part of the job was the hours. (midnite-7:00) The most enjoyable was the number of friends I was able to meet over the years and the times I had to go in the year-round pools."
good,"Aprendí el proceso del casfè,los diferentes tipo de cafè,su procedenci.a,historia."
good,"Buen clima, laboral capacitaciones constantes ,con comida y refrigerios incluidos, ropa y zapatos incluidos, posibilidad de noches gratis en cualquier hyatt del mundo,"
good,"A typical day off work is to be there at 5:30am and in a fast paced enviroment. What I learn everyday is patience, every guest is different and has different needs. The management helps out when needed. The co-workers need improvement on teamwork. The hardest part of the job is that the hotel industry is always 24 hours a day 7 days week. The work is constant with no holidays off. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I meet extraordinary people."
good,I enjoy working for Ambridge Hospitality overall. At my current property I would say commuincation through the channels of the departments needs to be worked on. Not everyone is in the same page at all times.
good,My day at work consists of making sales calls and booking groups. I have learned a lot about the hospitality industry as far as working with unsatisfied guest working with food and standards as far as food and beverage front desk and housekeeping. The hardest part of my job is going to work and not loving what I do as a Sales Manager. I love working in hospitality but not liking sales. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking with all the guest and finding out what brings them to the area and about them.
good,"It's one of the prestigious hotel in Georgetown, most employees were friendly and nice,some are not. The management is pretty good, I learned a lot like supervising room attendants work schedules,skills in cleaning, working their duties ,handling guest complains,checking clean rooms, and learned how to email guests."
good,"A typical day of work started when I would clock in a few minutes early, walk to the vault room and retrieve my personal bank then proceed to the front desk. Working at the Hyatt Regency, one of the biggest lessons that I learned was to always remain neutral with management. My co-workers were just that.Co-Workers.. The hardest part of my job was having to work with people who were only concerned with themselves, not the guest's or even their work performance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I got to work with and meet people from around the world."
good,"everyday is just a normal working day,i have learned how to work as a team and gain some experience from other chefs,management i would say it is ok,co-workers they make this place feels like home,the hardest part is the long hours sometimes you knock off at 12pm and you have to be there again at 6am and i really enjoy being able to work with people who knows what they want and able to work under pressure."
good,"When working for this hotel I would sart my day of about 8:00 am. Do a walk through greating all the staff. Then would walk all the walk-ins and put away all the produce. Check all E-mails by phone or office Cumputer. Then would talk with banquet manager. After that I would begin to cook the food for the cafitiria. Plan the food for the lunch buffet and produce it. Then make the soup of the day. Then assit in all the banquet funtions. Weekly preparing food tastings some times two or more a week. Then about 2:00pm send staff on break while covering the resuarant line. Then when they got back I would attend the afternoon dalily BEO meetings. Work with the sales staff on client future events. Write up all the work orders for the kitchen to turn into engeneering. Check E-mals again. Spend some time in sales helping with menus or writing and pricing menus for sales. Then around 4:00 pm do the food order for the next day. Then record and turn in all food invoices to accounting. Then start on special project like. Writing seasonal menus, associate reviews, food production on batch Items like granola, Ancho BBQ sause, for example. If we had any evening banquet funtions I would stay late until they where completed. More than often this job turned into a six day a weak. Because of budjet restants."
good,I supplied general secretarial support and payroll assistance to this group of engineers. I learned about the general contracting business from a great team of co-workers. The hardest part of the job was taking bids for upcoming projects. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such fine people.
good,"Well this job was a nice invorment to work and the people was friendly,and the work I was doing was unloading and and restocking the hotel."
good,i was subervisor alot of over time breaking and set up meeting rooms and the banquets
good,"Everybody that I work with are very kind, helpful and fun to be around. I enjoy working as a housekeeper being brought to a totally different working enviroment that I've never have been."
good,"Overall it is a great place to work. The company is making some great moves & implementing excellent policies and updating others to become highly competitive within their company set. While you work with great people, who are all personable and informative you work long hard hours. It makes it difficult to find a work life balance working to meet the demands and high expectations. Some people are perfectly capable of finding a balance but it is much harder working in operations than in other departments."
good,I enjoy the interaction with guests and addressing their questions and concerns. Everyday is something different. Overcoming even the hardest of situations gives me a very pleasing feeling.
good,Great culture and lots of talented people working for them.
good,"Working for the Hyatt was a great experience. I am a student in college studying Hospitality Management so the environment was a great lab for what is to come. However, there was a lack of connection from the upper management to the employees. It was apparent that the company cared more about making money than providing good compensation and value to the employees."
good,"Company Have good discounts for employees that like to travel and use the benefits of discounts,  some time have to perform other duties not related to the position you have been hire"
good,"give the chance to new gradute to get experience on thier first job, always get good vibe from our friend which is we always help each othe no matter which department you are."
good,"good place to work, expect to be working 90 hours a week minimum. You wont be compensated well in the beginning but for long term employees they are benefited."
good,Great tips but had they pick plus it was a temp job.Some of the girls were very rude and not very helpful also the supervisor were stealing tips out the rooms also.
good,Great opportunity to learn . everyday something new to learn great opportunity to grow . great management.people oriented company they Don't only care for their customers but also for their staff
good,I love my job the guest was wonderful and nice .I miss my coworker they was like family.i work there for 17 years .I learned alot there.I learned how to deal with management .
good,"I love to work for the Hyatt brand standered ,ive been a chief Maintenance engineer for over 10 years and I love working for the hotel industries some management companies know how to treat there employees and some don't even know how to run a hotel, my skills speak for themselves .....my regular day at work consists of meter readings pool readings gas readings boiler readings refridgerator readings preventive maintenance of all ereas as well as rooms which includes HVAC ,smoke detectors door locks condition of over all room, PM commend places.."
good,I really like the job at Hyatt it is very focused on the people. Its a good place to grow within the company. You have alot of room to grow.  They value their employees
good,"The job was fun but the gallery host wears a lot of hat but is only compensated for 1 job. you have to perform check ins, serve drinks at the bar and makes meals when ordered. it simply doesn't pay enough"
good,Great staff - never the same event so it never gets boring.  Always nice to interact with the client and attendees to make a successful event for everyone.
good,Indian bosses have made it average company due to favouritism. Till you are someone's favorite then you can rise the ladder of success else you will struggle to thrive.
good,"It is a company with good benefits. At Hyatt depends on the Branch there are not many employees for each area, you will have to fulfill different functions in the same work schedule. Employees become your family helped each other a lot. You will also learn many new things and work in functions that you never thought you could do. As in any hotel, the high seasons are strong and stressful. In particular, PR hotels in the management field do not have a good organization."
good,"I had that great honer of help opening the Hyatt. It was a great place to work. The only think I was not overly happy with is on Night Audit shifts I would still have to run the kitchen all night. It was to bad on slow days, however on high volume nights trying to close out tills, balance the Night Audit reports and try to keep the kitchen running, got to be to much."
good,"Good place to learn volume cooking, and how to deal with union employees. Good compensation for 45 hr work weeks, but seldom work that. Employee pool for the peninsula was low so hard to fill empty slots. General manager knew his stuff, and backed us up, and helped where he could. Good experience, and met some good people, but don't miss the job."
good,"I had a great time there, sometimes management seemed like they didn't care about the issues with employees but for the most part they did a good job at making sure to encourage us and keep us happy. It's a beautiful place to work."
good,It was fun but at the same time tiring. As a person working in the service industry it was expected to be very tiring and therefore dedication and eagerness to learn is a must. My colleagues are very patient when it comes to training me but at the same very straight forward on what they think about you because of the culture differences. The hardest part of the job for me is when you have 2 shifts a day --- a server assistant in the morning and bartender or barista at night or vice versa. The most enjoyable part of my experience was seeing my guest smile and happy about the service and attention I gave to them. Every attendance in my work is a learning.
good,I was dismissed by a over zealous  GM. Con expo international symposium because of political exposure between China and Taiwan. Governor's meeting wasn't to his liking and I represented Hyatt Phoenix.
good,"A franchise hotel. Never got comfortable with multiple software's to do the same thing. One was ""not supported"" anymore, but longer term employees were adept and stuck with it. (Clunky and unfriendly in my mind.)"
good,I learned about administrative function leads by the Security Personnel's & teach me a lot to improved my skills & knowledge. The management (security personnel's) was very helpful.
good,"Hyatt is a great workplace, it helped me to grow as a person and taught me a lot about the operate world, the managers are very supportive and easy to work with and I enjoyed meeting new people"
good,I am so very thankful to have worked here. I learned a lot of Managerial process and procedure in terms of service oriented nature. Truly to be the best in hospitality it takes a lot of preparations.
good,Has great medical insurance. They go out of there way for employees the only down side is if you want holidays and weekends off do not work at a place that's open 24 hours.
good,I worked at the hotel cleaning rooms. The typical day was cleaning 15 or 18 rooms a night. It was hard work. I needed more hours than part-time. The manager was nice and worked hard too. They paid higher than the minimum wage to housekeeping.
good,sehr kreativ Arbeitsklima und sehr motiviert Management
good,It's a good job to start at great experiences. Managers are currently very helpful and knowledgeable. It is very fast-paced. Events are fun to work with.
good,Do to it was a union job most of your benefits came from them. The Hyatt made sure you felt like you was apart of the Hyatt family and team. I would love to work for them aging
good,"i enjoy working there would recommend anyone that love to cook to apply here and get a great experience in fine dinning, great benefits, medical vision dental and quarterly bonus"
good,"Hotel Hyatt bonnaventure not a bad place for someone come to work inside this place "
good,"Just like any other company, it has it's pros and cons. "
good,It was a great opportunity to learn more about hi end spirits and creating signature cocktails. However mid management was rotated from oversees properties and had no experience in US market. I left company with many others following better opportunities.
good,"I work the morning shift 7am to 3pm ,first thing I do is to setup the line for lunch and cook for the guest and then, at lunch time I work the sauté station ,grille the broiler and the salad station I like staying busy."
good,"it's an terrific , amazing team to be working with , they were very very helpful to me especially at the beginning because it was me first job I got, The manager was so awesome and flexible and understandable beside so proficient."
good,"Hyatt is a great company to work for unless you're trying to advance within your own department. I've been at Hyatt for 9 nine years and applied for an upper level position in my department twice and was denied. I've won many awards, have many years of upper level management experience, but they want me to leave the department and return to achieve any level of advancement. Makes no seance."
good,"I worked really hard for the position I worked. I just wished the raise would be quarterly or even the usual 1 year mark. "
good,"The corporate Hyatt culture cares for its people and my location mirrors that.  Supervisors are fair and supportive, and everyone in the building treats one another with respect.  Unfortunately, the industry does not pay well overall and Hyatt is similar to other companies in that it doesn't pay its hourly employees a living wage."
good,Looking for something more. I enjoy the people I work with. Work hard doing more than what's asked.learned alot from working on an older building. Good leadership team in place
good,"relaxed"
good,"The Hyatt House property that I worked at was a great place to grow professionally. I was able to take on self-directed projects which were fully supported by management.  In addition to my front desk responsibilities, I focused on guest store and back office management. I also provided support to the Sales and Food & Beverage departments."
good,Hyatt is a great company but work life balance suffers greatly.  They treat employees good but do expect a lot in return which can be unrealistic to those with families and lives outside of the work place.
good,It's a smaller kitchen with lots of work to do and not a lot of room to do it all. Everyone was very competitive and they would actually sabotage you to make you look bad in front of the manager. It just wasn't very professional and there was lots of pettiness.
good,"Company  Hyatt is a well brand to grow with . It keeps its employees a priority."
good,Multi-tasking is imperative in this hotel environment.  Trying to focus on the sales aspect of my job is difficult as I am called to operations duty on a regular basis.  I enjoy the staff and the guests but am frustrated with lack of management.
good,"it was my first working place in abu dhabi. i learned lots of things"
good,"As my summary suggests, Hyatt truly does value customer service. As with any hotel, the job is simple: check people in and out and give them what they need and make their stay as pleasant as possible."
good,Management does not know how to communicate with employees and within themselves. Watch out with managers because they are only about sticking up for themselves. They befriend you than stab you in the back when they want. Managers are horrible. I would never trust any of them. The relationship between employees are awesome. The culture is amazing. Guest are great. If you want to move up within the company you have to kiss many butts and be a slave in order to be recognized.
good,It was a fun place to work and the management staff was good. The hotel is very busy and it looks nice. I would recommend it as a place to work. Benefits were decent.
good,It was a great opportunity to advance in skills with dealing with the public. Great team effort and constant communication. It's a great place to stay and work.
good,"It's a seasonal job. Fun and exciting, but keeps you busy, especially during the summer. Recommend finding another job during group season (between summers) because it gets pretty slow."
good,Great job. Management changes a lot. Lots of benefits. I only suggest that they are more flexible with students. This job is 365 days a year. Tuition reimbursement also.
good,I enjoyed working for the Hyatt and my coworkers were fun to work with. However the pay was an absolute joke. Nobody can live on the hourly wage they gave me.
good,"A typical servers day at the Restaurant is a normal day.  Starts with getting the restaurant ready for service, side work, ensure we have enough product in stock. It rains a lot so there was always insecurity about hours or number of covers per server.  Overall it was a great experience catering to guest visiting Old Boston Harbor."
good,Great company with excellent benefited but..... women paid much less. Than men. Work life balance is tough. I still loved the atmosphere and team spirit.
good,this is a great company to work for when led  by a good management team. The benefits are awesome and discounts are amazing. however the team is a reflection of management messy messy messy
good,"Good company overall, hotel industry just isn't for me. Hyatt is a great company though, obviously management will vary from property to property... o it all depends on where you are working!"
good,Hyatt Place is a vibrant and innovative work place with opportunity to enhance existing processes and further advance skill set and product standards.
good,loved working here. my department mananger didnt like me much but the chefs were always funny and looked out for each other. if I had free time and spotted one of the chefs doing something interesting I was allowed to watch and learn.
good,when I worked at the hyatt regency I was student and also was very good and happy time for me because to work and study is always good. I have  many friends  from members or hotel guests.
good,"Good benifits with opportuniy to advance...friendly atmosphere with friendly co-workers, good training with ample room for career changes if you desire"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the day to day interactions with the staff and guests.  Each day is an adventure.  The influx of guests varies from season to season so this impacts the hiring that I have to do.  During the Basketball season, I am extremely busy."
good,"its ok they have great benefits and you will make your hours, they have free food during break , they have a cafeteria where everyone goes to eat and they also have  break room for the employees"
good,Easy to comprehend and fast paced at times. Great team to work with and flexible hours. Easy system to understand but problematic at times. Management is poor.
good,"Hyatt is a great company to work for. There are many benefits and so many places to relocate and travel. Even though it the work load is a lot, the managers help out and its an all around team effot"
good,I enjoy my shift and think the work load is manageable. Guests are pleasant and location is right near everything of convenience.  Spacious rooms are a plus.
good,"Not a bad place to work and great experience, especially if you are looking to learn new things. The downsides are that management has trouble delegating tasks and like to micromanage and advancements are not based on performance and are often only used as a tool to keep employees who are looking to move on."
good,Great opportunity with a good company.  Lots of opportunities to work with other departments.  I transferred to Catering and really enjoyed that.  Lots of hours and not a good work/life balance.
good,"The Hyatt House in Belmont CA, is a fun place to work. It is really fast paced  work environment. No two days are they same and you get to meet fun people from around the world."
good,"Hyatt is a great company, but they still need to work hard in strengthening their job culture of respect among their employees in some of their properties."
good,"It was a quick-pace job and I enjoyed  because it was teamwork job environment. I learned a lot from my pears as much as from my hard work and motivation. The hardest part, when there are big occasions like conferences,parties, everybody is super busy at work."
good,The Hyatt hotel downtown Madison. I was a housekeeper and I also did laundry. It was a great job and seal the management change. I decided to stay with the kids at badger bus. And it was a little less stressful than working at the hotel
good,Good reputation for employee benefits. But still everything depends on individual General Managers. It can be very good if you get a motivational Manager/Director above you.
good,"This company is nice to work for, however it is not a place to go when you are looking to advance your career. The culture and the people are friendly but the overall job is for those who are beginning a career, not advancing it."
good,"The Hyatt is a wonderful company to work for. Fast paced environment with great managers who will guide,and support the employees goals and growth with the company."
good,"Fun working in a fast-pace environment and talking to different customers from all over the world. I worked in a location that had a lot of cruise clientele. What is fun about Hyatt Place is that you get to work not only at the front desk, but also the bar, the kitchen, housekeeping, and even assist management."
good,"Great benefits and place to work."
good,"day at work would be normal as always, learned how to handle tons of guest and working on their needs, management would be great at first after the changes, workplace was great and complete, hardest part was going to work and home takes 2hours. most enjoyable was the multicultural nationalities inside the kitchen which made it colorful"
good,"A very fun place to work. Can be busy on special event weekends. Management is very understanding. A good place to work. Promotes healthy work life, balance."
good,"The location that I am currently at does not have any advancement options. This is also a franchise location.I have learned a lot, but i feel I've learned so much that I need to excel in my career."
good,"Hyatt's culture as a company is great. They believe in you becoming your best. Great, full benefits were offered. All of my coworkers were awesome as well."
good,"My experience has been very good. I always feel supported by management that my well being in the work environment is taken seriously. I learned that I am to juggle several tasks at once and remain calm, cool, and collected."
good,"comfortable place for work, "
good,"Es un buen lugar para hacer carrera o arrancar, ya que son bastante pacientes y sirve como ""escuela"" para en un futuro pasar a otra área o buscar en otros lugares. La exigencia también hace parte del trabajo por ser un hotel con reconocimiento internacional y de una clase de clientes ( huéspedes ) de niveles económicos altos y demandantes."
good,"- Most of the times buys."
good,"Laid back work environment, but can be super stressful and high intensity. "
good,Very early hours for breakfast employees because of hotel setting. Consistent above average pay. Provided lunch daily. Great benefits and vacation time.
good,It was a very nice working environment overall.  Good mix of work life balance.  Most people there embraced the hospitality industry feeling and work ethic.
good,"Good place to work with good benefits. On your feet entire shift, need good shoes. Must be friendly and able to remain calm when guests are upset. Meet alit of new people from all over the world."
good,Lo que más me gustó fue el compañerismo y la colaboración de mis jefes inmediatos para que cada día fuera una mejor trabajadora en mi labor que desempeñaba aprendí la puntualidad y la perfección de hacer mi trabajo.
good,"Nơi làm việc hoà đồng,thân thiện,vui vẻ,môi trường làm việc cao"
good,"good company to work for, good workers great team work open door policy. paid vacation, good hours. must be able to stand a minimum of 8 hours but can be for more."
good,"It is a nice place to work if you know how to work they need to focus in help people that working really hard some people don't  like to do there job and is very hard for those the work hard , management is very nice sometime to nice."
good,Hyatt hotels offered great benefits and vacation time and free nights at all US based Hyatt hotels. flexible schedules to work with when going to school.
good,I'm unable to review this Job/company at this time. I was a front desk agent in charge of checking guests in and out of the Hotel. Making new reservations for guests was also a task I did.
good,"Its a good to work, evryday there is something new to learn work of area is good postive vibes..lots of stress but employee out there manages to work  and at the same time to live there own personal life. over all good place to learn sumting about our career."
good,"A typical day as a Hyatt front desk host allows the ability to use skills that you have while gaining new application methods to ensure satisfaction of guests accommodations upon arrival/departure. Check-ins usually range at a high volume, fast paced environment, depending on the location of the hotel. "
good,Hyatt has afforded me the ability to start my career right out of college. In Five years I have started at an entry level supervisor position and worked my way through 3 departments and two properties to become an event planning manager today. Hyatt encourages movement within the hotel family and works toward training and developing their staff.
good,"When I started in 2012 it was one of the best Jobs to find today. As the 5 years went on, overtime work ethic and managment declined. I advanced a position to doorman which is a more stressful, faster paced position. Thus enabling us a dollar more than the regular valets. The company could not maintain that pay difference and at the same time valet work ethic went down. The doormen then had to do most of the work and management did not do much to help out. If they could fix the current issues they have I would not hesitate to recommend a friend to this company."
good,Die Mitarbeiter werden gut behandelt und haben die Möglichkeit aufzusteigen. Das Arbeitsklima allgemein ist eigentlich ziemlich gut. Das Management ist sehr nett.
good,Working for the Hyatt was a good team environment that gave me lots of opportunity to get along with others. I was able to complete my work in a friendly space and think on my own.
good,All the co workers are helpful and competitive and helps in understanding others and motivating too helps in understanding the work and teaches the new work
good,Hyatt has been a beautiful place to work for.  The associate and Management alike are very caring.  I have been working with this company for 15.  I enjoy the decisions you make and quick thinking to reach full satisfaction of our guest.
good,"Overall is a fun place to work at. Gain a lot of experiences and learn a lot of things from other chefs. Friendly stuff and willing to teach you . Furthermore, they will give you the chance to handle stuff ."
good,First job out of college.  Very scary but rewarding experience.  Amazing training and structure during my time.  Oversaw several restaurants then the conventions department.  Moved to Pittsburg with them to start a new role.  Fun place to work out of school but know balance with work and life.
good,"Park Hyatt Chennai is five star hotel , our duty is to setup the area and maintain the area as well ,I have learned hospitality and how to treat guest with good manner & operations of spa department. management is good, here our work culture is welcome the guest and if they want, we need to assist them, the hardest part of the work is to clean the machines, and gym floors . we have every year staff party and outing for each  department....actually this is a good place to work ."
good,"I enjoy the work I do because I interact with many people from different backgrounds.Finally, I learn a lot on the job that makes my role interesting."
good,I typically worked the night shift from 4 pm until 12:30. All of my managers were easy going and assisted in any difficulties I had. At this job I learned some valuable customer service skills and got used to regularly interacting with guests in a responsible manner.
good,"Like any job Front Desk can be great, or it can be challenging to say the least. It really depends on the guest you have in front of you, and your attitude. Just have to make sure not to let one guest's negative attitude towards you affect your day towards other people. Co-workers are all great. They are what made coming into work a lot of fun."
good,The Hyatt was a great place to work.  I would recommend it as a good place to be employed.  I wish they would have allowed me to return after my illness but I also understood their need to have the position filled.
good,Hyatt Place is a great work place most Hyatt's have great managers.  Just know room to grow for employees that want to achieve there goals in life a little faster.
good,"I always loves to do the things differently and innovatively in my work place. Working in different groups like Marriott, Hilton and Kerzner Internation( Atlantis the palm) since last 7 years was a huge challenge and where i had to work closely with Engg team and making sure the cleaning aspect of the hotel is maintain in the day to day housekeeping. Complete snagging of every area of the hotel and make sure the beauty of the hotel is visible from every corner of the building was carried out along with my team with great pride. I felt proud of playing a stepping role to set the hotel."
good,"Good people and good working environment. Haa a free accomodation, transportation and food in hotel. Good benefits and good health insurance. Your skills and knowledge in work will improve bacause they giving you a chance to explore in each department."
good,"I had the ability to work with different cultures, vendors and departments. I learned strong customer service and organizational skills. I enjoyed the benefits provided and networking with others."
good,"Work-Life balance was not good due to constant overtime, yet, great pay which made up for the critical work hours....Good Culture and great people and management is okay depending on what managers you work for!!!"
good,"Long hours, no holidays off. If you are willing to sacrifice family its a great place to work. great benefits. uper management lives by the care for people believe but in reality they expect managers to be robots working 6 days a week up to 15 hour shifts."
good,"J'y serais bien reste mais je n'ai eu que des CDD, n'ayant pas eu de permis de séjour de longue durée"
good,"I had a short stay at Hayatt  Delhi. I was an industrial trainee during my Hotel Management Course. I was employed in all the depatments of the the hotel in rotation with a total duration of six months."
good,"Love working within Premier Health however, management needs improved as well as employee benefits. There is not much improvement in pay for employees nor benefits."
good,"A typical day at The Hyatt Place, Ft. Lauderdale, included many check ins with airline employees and guest who are going on cruises. I learned how to work our reservation system Opera and how to handle overbooking. The management was outstanding, they always had their door open to the employees. Ft. lauderdale provided an excellent environment for our guest. From the beach to the city life this hotel was a prime location for any occasion. The hardest part of this job for me was  gaining experience in events. Our room was big enough to host professional meeting but no weddings or banquets. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting pilots and people from different parts of the world. I also gained hands on experience at the bar. Over all, Hyatt Place gave me the experience I needed to work at a hotel but I am looking to further my knowledge in a hotel that provides a larger event space."
good,"working at Hyatt regency resort and spa not only was it an outgoing  environment it was a great experience, a collaborative team that valued helping each other and learn new skills as well, helping you grow in all fields as part of developing your knowledge from paperwork receptionist to housekeeping and maintenance"
good,"I loved working for this company, and learned a lot about guest services, and hospitality. I was able to move up quickly, and there is lots of opportunities if your willing to make some pretty significant sacrifices."
good,"While working with Hyatt I had a great experience. I learned a lot of valuable information on how the operations of an hotel works.  The work culture was very family oriented.  The hardest part of the job was trying to have a work/life balance. Which, was very hard given the demand of the hotel.  The most enjoyable part of the job was employees.  Without a great team/mentors, I wouldn't of grew or enjoyed my job as much."
good,"同事之間好nice 認識到好多朋友"
good,You'll enjoy the people you work with and you wont have to worry about job security. The days can be long but are sometimes rewarding.
good,"Good environment and experienced seniors "
good,I love so many things about my job and help customers and team members in a hotel company. my boss is great. I have experience in providing customer and service and communicate with guests and coworkers at all times.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of walking the assigned floors and check on designated housekeepers and housemen daily. "
good,"Loved working for Hyatt, I dedicated 16 years to this company. I don't believe Hyatt truly practices what it preaches. I was asked to meet goals but was not given promised promotion."
good,"Was able to gain visibility and experience in different departments and job functions, allowing me to grow professionally within the organization. "
good,"Good work-life balance."
good,"Very busy atmosphere."
good,"Great job for a young 18 or 19 year old out of high school to learn some entry level work. Low pay was an issue, typical schedule no room or few oppurtunities for promotion. The working environment there was friendly and professional. No credit or recognition of prior military experience. You are view as a entry level employee regardless, didn't take more than a quick glance at your service experience."
good,Nice company to work with.great work culture.only salary is not satisfied.learnt a lot of things.woek presure is high but becuse of the woek culture it was maanageble.
good,I enjoyed my time with the Hyatt. I made long lasting friendships with co-workers and learned the value of team. The  environment is fast paced and there is never a dull shift . The food and beverage director as well as the general manager of the property are true gems.
good,Hyatt Hotel is a great workplace environment that continues to looks for ways to excel as a hotel.Very friendly coworkers as well as managers.  Human resources has an open door policy. So you can come and talk to them about concerns at any given time.  good team efforts in most departments to make sure everyone shares the same goal.
good,"My first job. Loads of calls. Great team to work with."
good,"My co-workers are amazing and full of energy, we learn alot about eachother and our job everday. I love that our guests are the first of the few people we see every morning."
good,"A typical  day of work would be assisting housekeepers clean & straighten their rooms. Also replacing any beverages or items used by guest. My co workers where nice, hard working ladies. The hardest part of working at the hyatt would be moving the trash, but that's not really hard justmeleast favorite thing to do"
good,"Hyatt is good to employees and most are happy.  Management can sometimes be unaware of unrest, but for the most part the company is filled with hard workers and smart people."
good,"This place has great management, good people, it's direct contact in helping people, which I love. However, the pay, hours and schedule are not fitting nor meeting the needs of my livelihood."
good,The day would start off with you prepping for your shift. I learned to focus on my work and continue learn at any opportunity given. Management is okay sometimes they have no clue what's going on in the hotel and fail to tell their employees but they are good people to deal with. The hardest part of the job was sometimes going into situations blind and not knowing what to expect for the day and the most enjoyable part was definitely the extra perks.
good,"Hyatt feels like my second home and they also have room for advancment. Overall, Hyatt hotels are a great brand to work for.-Easiest way to explain.:)"
good,"In everyday work , First start with a briefing which discussed. Yesterday balance of work and any follow up. And also every task."
good,Awesome place to work! Friendly staff and guest. Able to work around outside activities. I highly recommend working here.
good,everyday is a learning day. increasing my knowledge and adopting the culture and system in me. i love that when superiors ask me how do i do. makes me feel they are supportive. having fun and and helping each other. there's no hardest part in the job. for me asking the thing you don't know will help you understand the job. enjoy the achievements and success.
good,"Ambiente agradável onde tive ótima convivência com os colegas e gerência, tendo ainda ótima oportunidade de relacionamento interpessoal."
good,Daily interaction with guests from many different places is always fun and very interesting. I thrive in the fast pasted environment of working with the public.
good,A typical day at work consists of answering calls from guests and other agents with regards to reservations and the Hyatt Gold Passport loyalty program.
good,"satisfait globalement, travail très intéressant et polyvalent, les journées étaient toujours remplies à 200%"
good,"Un dia en el bar de casino era bastante movido, ya que mi turno era noche, me gustaba los compañeros y el trabajo en equipo, esa fue unas de las cosas que nos enseñaban y tambien nos capacitaban para una buena atencion al publico"
good,Working at OC's paid well and was definitely challenging. The management as well as the staff take the job very seriously and complimented hard work.
good,"Entreprise très agréable, personnels et supérieurs très accueillant et à l'écoute. "
good,for this place. I can learn how to prepare food in the different ways and I know more how to work with other people. I know how the threat people in the different ways
good,"I can learnt how to make Thai food in the different ways in the show kitchen. I learnt how to make sauce, butcher and prepare food for Banquet."
good,"Great place to work, fun, and challenging.  At times it can be high-paced but it is exciting and the other employees make it fun and the majority of the management is great and encouraging."
good,"Supportive management team, more like a family. The company is very big on growth within the company. Very big on number but still focused on personal growth."
good,Although this job was very flexible with schedule I have been here for almost 6 months and I have seen lots of people go in and out because of unorganized management.
good,"Overall, I would recommend this job, but it definitely is not for everyone. The overall workload is higher than most front desk positions. You will be working the front desk, bar tending, and cooking. There is a lot to learn, but overall the quality of guest makes the experience worth it."
good,"The best set of people to work with, and the place is light and clean and its easy to be there. The people are the kindest and the most caring, big family that worries and love you no matter what."
good,Working for this company I had encountered obstacles just like any other company did. The company lacked immensely in communication and staffing was always short. I also received a plethora of complaints with the rooms being dated ad smelling like mold.
good,It was a good experience as a security officer but it was a stepping stone. A typical day including checking and verifying all employee identifications. I learned how to be more approachable as a person.
good,"In a typical day, I took a high number of calls regarding guests' inquiries about their current hotel reservations, complaints about their hotel stays, and inquiries regarding their Hyatt Gold Passport accounts."
good,Good place to work as a hourly employee(union) but the manager around you are supportive and helpful. The Hyatt family is a good one to be in.
good,Co workers were easy to get along with. Management don't really pay attention to what's accruing in the work place. The best part about the job was meeting different people while using great customer service. the hardest part about this job was trying to get noticed by management.
good,"In my opinion, working in this company was a great experience for me. I had to learn to adapt to a new environment in a very short amount of time in order to have growth in my field. I was exposed to a diverse set of people. So the adjusting period was a bit of a struggle but with patience and perseverance, everything went into place eventually. A typical day at work for me was having the responsibility of holding one section. I was given the opportunity to handle 4 sections out of six during my whole stay with this company. I was responsible for doing mis en place, checking the quality of each food item on my section, and handling that section during service time. When things get busy, my managers are very accommodating in finishing the job with us. I could say that we had an excellent ethic toward teamwork and professionalism in the kitchen. The most difficult part of working in the kitchen would probably be the long hours and the hard work you have to put in during those long hours. The part that probably made it very enjoyable for me was the encouragement and respect each colleague had for one another. I believe that a team will only flourish with a good mix between respect and passion for getting the job done is being practiced by each one."
good,"This is my family away from family. "
good,"You may never know just who you maybe entertaining at any giving moment. You have the oppertunity to meet people from just about every part of the country! Work is nornally very productive and my co-workers are very much so a team! The hardest part of my day I would say is standing on my feet for eight hours but I really enjoy my guest! You have a chance to put a smile on their faces and a lot of them are regulars, so you learn them by name."
good,"-A typical day at work is hard to define in a hotel industry; you never know what issues you'll come across. Working in an older property makes it vulnerable to frequent plumbing issues, power outages, etc. The property is overdue for a rooms renovation, and it can make it difficult to meet guests expectations. Front desk is small with only three available comuters for the agents so it can create long waits at check in."
good,"Had a blast.  The property gets all of it's money during the ski season, so they are willing to pay overtime.  ""Stay until you must leave""  Good shift meals, if you work a double you can still make a run or two in during your break.  If you are qualified and work your bum off, there's a spot for you. Money is good too.  It's your own lemonade stand.... if you can handle a big section, they'll give it to you.  Go and get it."
good,"I worked for one specific Hyatt hotel, in Buffalo, NY."
good,this company help you i the areas that you will need help to compleate the task better
good,"Training at Park Hyatt Goa has been very productive. I got a chance to work at the front desk welcoming guests, assisting them to their rooms also got an opportunity to see how the bell desk and the concierge functions. I also was fortunate to assist at the business centre and also worked at the communication centre and assisted in meeting the errands. Got an opportunity to learn how check ins and check outs are done at the Park Hyatt Resort."
good,"The day would usualy start with basic things like setting up the table or a buffet depending on the department the individual in being trained in."
good,"I loved working here, it was awesome the people as well as management"
good,"A mi me gusta trabajar en este lugar, solo que no te deja tanto margen para crecer ni laboralmente ni económicamente pero el ambiente es muy bueno"
good,"Everyday is a new Day! Fun and challenging especially busy time. In every places or country, we should respect other culture, so that they will also respect you. Working in 10 months here in Park Hyatt is good. New policy, fair in all employees and freedom to speak about any inquiry. Co workers are nice even though we have different nationalities. Being unhappy is the hardest park of the job, because we need to treasure and love it, straight from the heart. Memories, Learnings and friends is the most stress free part of the job."
good,I was able to move and work in multiple departments in the company and gain knowledge from the different service areas. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and other employees in every department. A typical hard day of work was earned with much effort.
good,"I've enjoyed all of my years at Hyatt. "
good,"Foi uma boa experiencia de trablaho, a gente aprendeu muito sobre cozinha la... Comos melhores chefes da cozinha mediterranea"
good,Assisting to the Guest. Preparing for the Equipment that my co-workers will use.Doing inventory. Appreciate the people around me and thank them for they help..
good,"Every day is a new Day. I learned there is new beginning every day. I learned many things to manage my work my department to upkeep in all ways. Management gives more responsibility so that we can enhances our values, knowledge & skills. Work culture plays a important role in our organisation, we work for our guest first then it comes to us which will lead us to be a  successful person. A change & a new thing to us will be harder for us but we all go through it because of our trust on ourself & our team. We takes part in weekly activities organised by the organisation for us which is the best part & enjoyable thing for us."

good,"Hyatt provides great customer service around the world, "
good,"Customer service is done everyday."
good,This position thought me to operate effectively under pressure. The dynamic environment allows for character growth. High rate of management turnover became a con. The co-worker environment was cohesive and uplifting.

Excellent curb appeal, benefits, and perks.  A good place for a conformist with a strong vision."

good,I work as a Guest Services officer at park Hyatt hyderabad.I possess a good communication .Handling guest complaints and queries. Resolving guest complaints.Inroom Checkin for VIP guests.
good,"This is a busy industry to work in, this environment is solely customer service driven so if your do not have very good people skills then this is not the industry for you. Depending on the hotel size and room count a front office rep could services up to 250-400 person a day this does not include massive size group or conference check-in's and checkouts. The hardest part of this job is knowing that even when you put your best foot forward there will be some people that you just cant please. The most enjoyable part to this job is knowing you did your very best and when the curtains close you're able to smile for creating the most memorable experience for your guest."
good,Hyatt Regency Montreal is a beautiful property conveniently located in downtown Montreal. I have had the opportunity to move up professionally and have had the opportunity to learn from the different departments I worked in.

good,"it is a fast pace, yet self-character building environment for the first time working with the company. management is stern yet understandable with time and work performance. i had to find my own way to get to work in any way possible. the co-worker have teached me a lot when come to team work performance as well as culinary skills required. the hardest part is the to be in strong physical condition while working such as rely on your own two feet constantly and pure body strength for heavy lifting. the most enjoyable part of my previous job is to be with those that are in your exact position that whom you can relate and it's rewards."
good,I spent 3 plus years working for Hyatt and got to work with some great people over the years. Working there really help to take my culinary knowledge to the next level.
good,Food and Beverage Experience
good,I had no options for advancement and was felt like I was pigeon hole to only one duty.
good,"Clean place, great customer service, different type of guest"
good,"I worked for Hyatt for several years in various locations throughout the US. Each property has a unique feel, but overall, the culture is very similiar throughout the hotel chain and you do feel that your opinion is truly valued. I will give Hyatt 5 stars for promoting within and for taking care of employees who wish to promote themselves to a different property. The only negative comment, which would ultimately depend on which department you worked with, is the work/life balance can be lopsided."
good,Great experience worked with hyatt. It is good company and managmrnt is also very nice. I worked here around 4 year 6 month..it was great start for me
good,the company is a time share and not a hotel. The guests expect alot more than they recieve. The manager in HSKP is tough but fair. The GM of the property doesnt seem to pay attentio  to w
good,This hotel is strict on the type of degree you have. I was hoping to transfer with this company and excel to the next level but it was required that you have an Accounting degree to move up.

good,There's a lot involved in building maintenance so much to learn if you keep a open mind to learn opportunities or there if you want the opportunity to succeed in the building maintenance/repair field.
good,"Low pay, basic benefits could be better, management isn’t willing to work with scheduling, free breakfast but lefts over:( don’t have to pay for parking best things about it!"
good,"It's an average employer within the hospitality industry. Nothing more to say. As long as you keep your head down and work hard, you'll go far in the company."
good,If you need a flexible schedule this is a great place to work.  You will stay busy so the day goes by quickly.  They will hire people of all ages and ethnic groups.  It is great to speak with colleagues from all over the world!

When one breaks down, the tunnel can't be utilized which is the main source for washing room linen. The meals are free and the food is very good. Colleagues appear to be naturally happy. The GM is very approachable and appears to be caring and listens."
good,"Hyatt is a great company, the hospitality industry requires a great deal of your time.  I worked with an exceptionally bright team of individuals.  If you are single and want to learn & advance in hospitality train with the Hyatt!"

good,Many opportunities to learn and advance in your career.  Good work culture. Nice people to work with and good benefits.  Good work and home life balance.
good,I worked for Hyatt in the past and then returned to Hyatt quite recently. It is a great hotel to work at the company I work for that owns this Hyatt is amazing. The managers are very understanding the benefits offered are substantial however the pay is pretty low and you will not be able to afford to live off just this job.
good,"The hyatt hotel as a whole was great to work for. But the hotel management sucks, we were not allowed to talk to other housekeepers. If some told what u said it was considered gossip and u were fired. But that was more on management."
good,Working here was good most of the time. The pay was normal. Employees were pretty fun to work with. Corporate management does NOT care about each individual hotels.
good,Have worked there for a really longtime. It is a very friendly and organized environment. Management is very straight forward in their policies. I will miss this place if i ever leave.
good,"Over all great place to work for. Typical day at work is checking in with management to go over paper work(EEO/Consumption report). Being such a spread out property there is a lot of moving parts. There will be last minute weather calls, extended time lines etc. Management was subpar. Great workplace culture.Always doing employee appreciation parties, themed dinner for the staff. "

good,Can be very busy or slow depending on the season. It is a customer focused organization. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers. The enjoyable part is the free night stay employee can get at other Hyatt.
good,"Learnt a lot from this place. "
good,I was working there during the renovation process of the Hyatt Regency Hotel and had the firsthand experience to view the turnaround. Honored to be a part of the improvement process .
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and exciting.  Learned how to interact with guests.  Management not supportive.  Good workplace culture.  Working with banquet managers was difficult.  I had a great stewarding staff that made work enjoyable.
good,Have transport for staff in nearby area only. Provide with canteen for staff. Have break time room for staff can rest. Provide with discount coupon for family stay in hotel.
good,The hardest part of the job is that you actually do not know what your walking into when you come in to work for the day either it can be a very smooth work day or a stressful day where nothing is prepared or in order for the particular event that is going on or theirs a lack of communication going on between management and servers
good,"It is a tough work i am doing and housekeeping is that work will never finish.so i am doing my best however i can give to work and to my organization.My working environment is so nice even i have no words to describe them.My most enjoyment part of the job is when my co managers appreciate me and when i got the chance to learn a new things.Unfortunately,i got sometimes back pain badly while making the beds that part is the hardest part for me."
good,The Hyatt is a very beautiful venue and atmosphere for any good working citizen. The managers make you feel at home and make sure you learn everything you need to know to have a positive work experience here at the hotel.

These meetings helped to keep up the morale of the staff as well as work ethic.  I enjoyed greeting guests, especially long term residents and providing them with special amenities in their rooms."
good,"its was fun and tired hard "
good,Hyatt truly believed in promoting within. I feel that within 9 years I was constantly engaged on what my next career goal was.  When I had my child they did not have maternity leave benefits however now they do.
good,"I liked working for Hyatt and there was room for advancement. It's a company that cares for it's employees. It was a fast paced environment with lots of work to be done, always. Most of my co-workers were friendly and hard working and the management also worked very hard."
good,Typical dat at work to assist guest and call with the standard and well mannered customer service. i've learned how to socialized with different nationality either with the guest or with the colleague. Management have strong relationship with the staff they sincerely care with staff needed and wants. The hardest part of the job to face to the guest which very upset which you need to turn the service into good the way you pacify them and sympathized with them. The most enjoyable part of the job is to learn in every situation and every day life.
good,Great location right off the metro. A lot of foot traffic during the week so Fridays and Saturdays were slower. Many tourists on the weekend as well so good to know local places
good,"Wish there were more opportunities for advancement; however, it is a great company to work for! I have learned so much about the hospitality industry and could not have asked for a better company/team to have worked alongside with."

good,"Tuve la oportunidad de integrarme en una buena época, por lo que pude ascender rápidamente a jefatura del salón, muy buena empresa."
good,The hotels with hyatt that I have training are always busy which it challenging and it's good. Learned a lot of things specially with my workmates learned different cultures. Hardest part of the job is when it's slow season and you've got nothing much to do.
good,"Work culture is very good at Hyatt. You get a chance to learn and grow on a personal and professional level."
good,"A typical day at work varied based upon how busy we were. When it was slow there wasn't much to do and hours would be cut. When it was busy, the restaurant ran in organized chaos. If you like the rush of that then working in the restaurant department of a hotel is for you! Working at Hyatt I learned how to deal with people. Nice people, combative people, rude people, foreign people- it truly taught me the importance of customer service. The work culture was that of a typical corporate company so it may or may not work for certain people."
good,Hyatt has long been a top place to work in Chicago. The work is challenging but the associates I work with everyday are great. It is a place I would recommend to others looking for their next opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of full concentration."
good,"I wish I would have started with them sooner than I did. Employees are general good people to work with. They took care of me, I'm proud that I worked for them."
good,"A nice place to work"
good,"My experience with this property has been good. Its had ups and downs, but every job does. I have nothing bad to say about my job here or my time here with them."
good,every thing are good .management are very valuval time  but coming cha lang every day so that every thing lerns  salary so  coming in time management help every time
good,"I enjoy my guest at the Hyatt, fun environment. I like serving to my return guest.I think this place shows character and is very classy. I like my job there"
good,"Stress levels vary by department and person."
good,"A good place to work in terms of hospitality, good benefits and lovely teams, Management is ok, the most enjoyable are the perks of being able to have free nights as a full time employee and gather points to use the hotel's services."
good,Hyatt is a 5 star hotel. It is a nice looking. It is saturated in gomti nagar lucknow. All staff is very similar to everyone and behiviour is fine. Thanks
good,Grand hyatt dfw is a good company to work for...It does offer good benefits and many people work there for a long period of time...At the same time many people do transfer or get promoted...I am over 65 and they have been very good to me as a regular full time and now part time worker.
good,"The Hyatt Regency will provide a powerful experience, and a great opportunity if you take advantage.   Employees are a part of a union, so you can't be fired for any old reason."
good,"Hyatt was a great place to work.  Franchised to Aimbridge in 2014.  Both great companies, great benefits and fun work environment.  No room for advancement in Louisville."
good,"Oda servisin'de gece vardiyasın'da yine havamda olduğum bir gece çok yoğun bir gece geçirirken o gece bütün upsell yeteneklerimi kullanarak; 1şişe Chivas 18, 1 şişe chivas 12, 1şişe Jack Daniels,2 şişe Moét Chandon ve 3 şişe şarap satmıştım."
good,The company itself is fantastic. Associates are somewhat friendly. The hours are great. Starting at the bottom you work all holidays and weekends. Overall love the job.
good,There was never a typical day as things were constantly changing. Management was always a step behind since most new managers had zero security experience before taking the position. I enjoyed each team i worked with since everyone meshed really with each other.
good,Hyatt is an amazing company to work for. It was my first job in pastry after school. It has taught me a lot and I have learned the face baced industry.
good,People are great and supportive. The team works like a well oiled machine and everyone is always jumping in to help out when things get crazy. Supervisor is always willing to get down and dirty with the staff which has earned our respect.
good,Hyatt Place is a extremely fun environment to work in.  However it can be challenging as there are many different facets  in a signal work day.   This being said multi tasking is going to become second nature.
good,The culture of Hyatt was great. Very positive environment with room for advancement. My coworkers were awesome and most of the guests I encountered were nice as well.
good,"I have worked at several different hotels and this one was by far the best. They expected perfection, but provided you the tools to do so reasonably. Great training however the hours were very inconsistent and hard to schedule around. Overall I liked my experience there, management at my chain was not very good however at different chains that's not the case."
good,"The Hyatt is a great corporation to work for, they have a structured and successful company. The employers care about their staff and try to do their best to create an enjoyable work environment. As with any hospitality job, it can be stressful, but you always have support. It is a great company to work for."
good,Was decades ago. Enjoyed my time there. Management on salary were not compensated fairly for number of hours expected to put in. Overall good work culture.
good,"Overall it was a good experience and the staff were great. People were very encouraging of each other, open to listening and working on any challenges that may have come up."
good,"5 days a week"
good,Los beneficios y la motivación al personal pisan fuerte para contrarrestar las exigencias físicas y psicólogicas inherentes al trabajo de la hotelería (horarios rotativos y una clientela altamente exigente)
good,"There is room for growth as there is training in specified job area and customer service improvement classes. "
good,Poor management coordination and understanding. no fun on work place and no proper planning. no motivation and empowerment at all. No ppm software in place.
good,"Good place to work, a few issues with management but other than that not a bad place. There isn't much opportunity presented to grow, so definitely consider just keeping the job temporary and looking for something better after."
good,"Everything about this job is amazing, except for upper management. They do not know what anyone below them does. They do their best to have their employees have a work/life balance."
good,"Great experience working for a world-renowned brand, such as Hyatt. Furthermore, the specific property I was with, the Grand Hyatt New York, is a huge, fast-paced business oriented hotel."
good,"Habiendo realizado dos funciones distintas, básicamente una jornada laborar se basaba en cumplir la función asignada lo más prolija y eficaz posible. Tanto la dirección de ambos sectores,la gerencia como su cultura laborar son muy eficaces y apropiadas. "
good,"Used  to  work  up-to  10hrs per  day "
good,Everything is good.  There are a lot of good perks and everyone is very friendly.  There can be times when overtime is required which can mess up work/personal balance.
good,Culture d'entreprise forte et appréciable qui permet de se sentir investi
good,This place is a great way to obtain work experience to grow your knowledge. The work is fast paced and can be stressful at times. The management is great and will work with you. The tasks range to pretty much anything. Overall a great place to work.
good,"I worked for Hyatt Braintree for almost two years. From the first day I  began working there I was warmly welcomed and treated as a part of their team and family. It was a great working experience and I learned a lot working there. Although the Management wasn't always up to part, I enjoyed working for Hyatt."
good,"A typical day can be hard but once the task was completed it was well worth it in the end. I learned that good things come with hard work. The management team were very nice, understanding all while displaying proper leadership skills. The hardest part about the job was cleaning all of the assigned room in the time frame that was given. The most enjoyable was the friendly work environment."
good,I love this place. It's very personable and everyone you work with are very influenced meaning I learn from everyone there. Management is very flexible and reliant.
good,"Great place to work, very busy and ever changing. To work here one must be flexible, wear lots of hats and change directions in the matter of minutes."
good,"My time with Hyatt taught me lots of skills in both time and people management.  There were issues in terms of communication between the upper levels of management and my management team which caused chaos.  If communication was better and everyone was on the same page, things would have run a lot more smoothly."
good,"Management do not recognize your hard work and care very little about employees, if you step out for 5 minutes to the bathroom the managers jump on your back and treat the place like a cell block."
good,"It is a perfect experience for me because before the hyatt i have been work in different kind of restaurants with different roles. I start with Demi chef position in hyatt but after two months i got the CDP position. However i seem in rooster as  a cdp but im leading a rooftop bar kitchen as a Chef De Cuisine. This job needs more responsibilities and sacrifices. Im the only one to making preparation , ordering , costing and giving service with 3 comi 1 demi chef. At the begining of the roof top but i had to work 14 hour per day because there was a manpower shortage and i had to create good setup and good menu for coming days. Now every week we are serving our tapas foods at least 500 hundred people and im not counting functions. But actually this was a perfect opportunity for me to becoming a strong and dedicated chef."
good,I have been part of the Hyatt Regency for approximately 3 years. I can honestly say that the work environment and the diversity of people our hotel attracts makes my work experience most enjoyable. The compensation I receive from this company is minimal.
good,great place to work and great travel benefits. great benefits and leaned alot about the opera operating system. You have to have the work ethic. hyatt hotels and resorts is a great place to work
good,"Hyatt place dallas is a great place to work in, management needs some work in addressing issues in the work place. takes months for the issues between workers to get addressed even though they knew about it in advance. they wait until the issue has gotten worse and then leave the issue to get worse once more"
good,"Always looking forward for the next shifts the next day. Fun place to work, specially when you work there for a long time. You exactly know where everything is and know your co-workers very well."
good,Great place to work with lots of advancement opportunities. Hours can cut into personal life but can be balanced out by the pay. Management rotates leaving you with a good chance you will have a different floor manager throughout the year
good,"First shift, would open up the department for the other staff, assist with any issues that guests would have prior to other staff arrival, either on phone or in person.   Generate banquet event orders for banquet department detailing event set up, food, etc.  "
good,"Great workplace if you're just trying to do your job and go home, but management has no desire to listen to employee input and reassess the success of their department and it's ability to grow."
good,Good people gokd benifits if you want a good job you can base your life around it would be this one the people are so nice and its one of the best hotels in the city
good,It is great place to be at. I have learnt lots here from when I joined in 2011. I got to open the entire club floor with 56 rooms including 6 suites and 81 serviced apartments.
good,"Friendly and helpful colleagues who will always smile when you greet them as you come into office in the morning."
good,Got a good exposure in the real hotel industry. Was quite fun working. The staffs were good but unfortunately i wanted to have a job rotation and work in front office and reservation department but couldnot due to busy schedules at the events.
good,"Good hotel, easy to gain good working relationships with coworkers but can be quite impersonal when it comes to management or head office. Work smart, plan ahead and you can rise easily through the chaff"
good,"Typical valet duties of picking up cars from the hotel and bringing it to the garage, and vice versa. Hardest part of the job is when it's super busy and not enough valet drivers."
good,"So much thing you will learn.more on training,Upselling food and beverage,we are getting the revenue monthly.Boss are friendly."
good,"Wonderful experience working for Hyatt. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to resign. If I had it my way I would still be with this company. I worked as a Breakfast Host. I loved my team and took pride in my work."
good,"Responsible for completing deposits, billing and orders before the 2nd shift with a smile. Assist the AGM with daily operating responsibilities. Delegate all tasks to 2nd shift and ensure they are completed. Always initiate team work to ensure the we all work together to complete daily task. Provided downtime as long as all task are 100% completed."
good,"The hardest part of the job were the constant questions from anyone about anything. You had to be on your toes constantly and always, always with a smile. But the management team were amazing at teaching and encouraging the staff. A+ to the whole management at Hyatt and their incredible service."
good,"Accommodating any and all guests."
good,Great place to work. Pay matches what the job is asking. Management was very open to employees concerns. The atmosphere was great to be in and you meet a lot of interesting people
good,"celebrating Hyatt COP within year , learned guest experiences with helpful management & co workers . The hardest part of job is long duty hours but no choice if we chosen this field. Interesting part of job is getting appreciation from management for excellence work."
good,"Their is a strong culture at Hyatt, one that is centered around empowerment of workers. Since the ultimate goal is to treat guests very well, employees are treated well so they will be happy."
good,"A typical day at work generally consisted of 10-12 jam-packed hours of running quickly from one thing to another, answering phones, assisting staff, and managing the department. "
good,its a good place to learn and work on your professionalism. The people their are great and really caring and will push you to be great.
good,my typical day consisted of daily scheduling of tasks to be completed. Assisting or completing these tasks with my team or on my own at times. Long hours exposed to the heat and cold working outside. Management at first was helpful and worked with you. Soon thereafter they sat back in their offices and preferred not to assist staff with daily jobs. Management for the associates that work outside daily needs improvement.
good,A really great place and CHC is a great company to work for-company works with on your schedule and the times you are available to work-great working atmosphere
good,"The work was good"
good,As a front desk agent I have learned multiple new skills and have become increasingly advanced in numerous operating systems. Friendly associates and a welcoming atmosphere.
good,"Benefits are great, discounts are great, and Hyatt owners do a lot of charity work. Newport Beach location managers should listen to employees more."
good,"ottima catena che permettere di crescere, possibilita di imaparare in piu ambiti e aspetti della ristorazione."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, el tiempo para la familia es muy reducido y hubo reestructura en comisiones."
good,"I enjoy the work environment that the Hyatt brings, but the only time you have room for movement or growth is when an associate leaves the Hotel. I feel that you should always teach your associates."
good,"Management is great, you just have to have the right kind of mindset to work in this industry. Management will try to help you out as much as possible but it seems like certain regulations get in the way."
good,"The Hyatt is a wonderful company to work for, very fast paced and ever changing. Hyatt strives in empowering its colleagues to give a 100 percent and the opportunity to grow with the company. A typical day at work consists of guests from allover the world coming in to be checked in by my team and being greeted by me and being offered a bottle of water. My co-workers are generally kind and efficient and team players. Hardest part of the job was being sold out and not being able to accommodate last minute walkins that sometimes were going through some personal emergency. Best part of my job was being able to upgrade and surprise a guest who was coming for a special occasion or just needing a break with wine or cookies for the kids. Great place to be creative and make some one smile."
good,"My typical day at Grand Hyatt Doha starts with getting the newspapers from Concierge. I go through the papers to see any mention of hotels, hotel adverts/promotions, anything hotel related from our competition. If our hotel has been featured in the paper, I cut out the clippings and share with the rest of Sales & Marketing team at a briefing meeting that takes place everyday."
good,"As mentioned fun place to work, but less career opinion, however Park is a brand and that is changes the experience at work."
good,"The overall environment is laid back, but can get very stressful during the busy days/seasons. The management there is awesome, but their isn't any room for advancement at this franchised location."
good,"a typical day at work is very hard because you need to be vigilant and suspicious mostly to undesirable person."
good,"great place to work, great brand and great people who makes you feel comfortable at work, Place where fun is celebrated among all the  employees"
good,"A typical work day would be checking your day runner at beginning of shift, preparing all your rooms and making sure everything is stocked so you are prepared for your shift. I have learned that even though you have great co workers, sometimes they forget to restock the rooms before they leave, another reason it is important to check at the start of your shift :) The hardest part of the job is being ""on call"".  Just waiting to be called for appointments, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the clients. When you finish a service and you have made a difference is someone's day.. that is well worth all you had to do to prepare. Not such a bad gig after all :)"
good,"- Nice Team"
good,"I had to give a low rating for work/life balance only because I was in management. We have no life."
good,"Selbständige Abarbeitung der anstehenden Events anhand einem Tagesplan."
good,"Fue un hogar para mi."
good,"It was a very big hostel in Paris, lots of people worke there, but there is a friemdly athmosphere and the interraction with the customers was very pleasant, you deal with a lots of differents nationalities and it is very interesting"
good,Was one of the most enjoyable jobs I held even on the rough days.  Worked with many people who became life long friends.  Opportunity to advance through hard work was encouraged and aided. Middle management were included in functions and merit increases that exhibited the company's appreciation of a jobs well done.  Even when problems arose and it became extremely hectic there was always a team spirit in the various departments.  I always felt this was a very good company to work for.
good,"good company, because they do a lot of trainings every month which is you can learn a lot of things from them. all of the people surround you are very polite and friendly we always work as a team. the only hardest part of my job is most of the time we are working alone because of the less manning in each and every outlet so we need to handle it by ourselves."
good,"My first experience as a professional rather than an academic. Being an intern for Hyatt gave me a good view of how a professional day in the life of a manager looked. Although I was not a manager but rather an intern, I had the opportunity to overlook and work with several of the hotel managers to learn, experience and prepare myself for the professional world."
good,"The Hyatt offered great job advancement. As a supervisor, I enjoyed managing my team of employees.  my co-workers were pleasant and were very knowledgeable of the Hyatt as a company."
good,A typical day was spent trying to sell cars. work the phones and learn the brand and competitors. unfortunately the economy right now has caused this workplace to become quite strict and unforgiving. The bosses were great but Auto Canada supports the typical Sales motivation of the first one to the customer makes the sale. The bosses were quite understanding and pushed for success.
good,At the Hyatt Corporation I learned many skills that will help me in both the corporate world as well as the tech industry.
good,One of my favorite jobs even though I wasnt there long. The things i did were great i enjoyed joining the hospitality environment. I would most defiantly love to do again if possible.
good,"The early hours are not for everyone and there's nothing like leaving the house at 5am to get home at 5pm, but my coworkers were great. The customers at the Hyatt are snotty business people, but you get used to them."
good,"manage 5-7 tables with 100%  guest satisfaction. "
good,"Hyatt est une excellente entreprise lorsque"
good,GM and staff are grade A. HR is poorly trained and could do with some refreshers in regards to nepotism and proper communication skills.
good,"Typical day at work. Working on a rotation basis within the Front Office team, I ensure maximum guest satisfaction and adhere to the standards required by the hotel. Key responsibilities includes checking guests in and out of the hotel, cash handling and dealing with guest's queries both face to face and over the telephone. Ensuring a quick and efficient response to guest’s requirements and updating guest information in the computerised system in a timely manner. I was trained to work within the Regency Club, a VIP lounge and also Switchboard."
good,A direct guest service position that required management of the guests and hourly employees daily.  The position required being multifaceted and being able to shift focus throughout the day.
good,"Extensive communication and coordinating interdepartmental communication to ensure timely completion of units for residents moving into this luxury CCRC ( Continuing Care Retirement Community) "

good,"Fast Paced Busy or Dead Slow Service."
good,"a typical day at work for me is mainly checking guest in and out of the hotel, balacing guest accounts, making sure all guest needs are met, and making sure my shift is ran smoothly"
good,"Typical day of the AGM would usually consist of 10 to 12 hour days.  Time management is extremely important in an environment where you do front office duties, pour drinks at the bar, check people in, drive guests in the complimentary shuttle, make lattes and cappucinos from our Starbucks machine, take orders for food as well as prepare those items in the kitchen."
good,Excellent tools provided to perform job duties.  Excellent training programs to increase job knowledge.  Staffing levels can be challenging with little assistance.  Culture is excellent with hard working individuals at each property.
good,"Typical shift is 3p-11:30p if not later, morning shifts are scarce."
good,Maintain the hotel appearance and assist the guest with any need that they may have.
good,"My current role entails customer-facing roles in both the front-office & the communications centre, attending to guest check-ins, check outs, and resolving minor complaints in a timely fashion, and elevating other guest needs to the appropriate personnel."

good,"-Taking charge of all the maintenance and operations of the shift"
good,Grand hyatt doha really boost my knowledge and skills in my career to beome a professional  chef.
good,"I start prepping at five am to open breakfast at six am. When we open for breakfast we make sure we have enough silverware and plates. One person will do the omelet stations and the other will keep up on the buffet, tables, and dishes. The management and co-workers are great because when we get busy they will help us if they can. The hardest part of this job is when the equipment goes down and we have to wait a couple days if the engineer is not able to fix it. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers because they know how to make me smile if something happens."
good,I enjoyed taking on a task of closing night audit with more responsibility.
good,"it was a very fund job, customer service is a must. i developed my computer skill, a good management team there to assist on anyway. get alone good with co-worker which we called associate. I was the overnight supervisor and the hardest part of the job was to climb the stairs because it was a 9 stories building. the most enjoyable part of the job was the return customers who were really happy that we remembered theirs names."

good,"is none i enjoyed"

good,"I enjoyed my positions for the sole fact that I spoke with and gained professional relationships/clientele with people all over the world."
good,"I am a people person, so I thrive in customer service/customer relation jobs. This was my first time working for a hotel. It made me very interested in investing more time into it as a career path. My co-workers were friendly and very supportive when it came to group activities. I learned a lot about the intricacies of a hospitality business from just observing daily. The hardest part of my job honestly was leaving, to relocate to Atlanta. The most enjoyable part was getting meet, greet, and work with a lot of wonderful people."
good,"Andaz was an exciting, fast paced, beautiful work environment with friendly co-workers and great team work for tasks. I learned the skills needed to conduct a smooth delivery for the hotel."
good,The job offered flexible hours and a fun work environment. They did not offer a benefits package and the pay was average. Management did a good job of making sure everybody was happy.

good,"Managed hotel kitchen, kitchen staff, bar, and all food & beverage and alcohol ordering."
good,Have been with the company for three years and have liked it as a place to work in several different positions. Always working to develop their employees and give them opportunities to move up. Training was good and thourough.
good,"Arrive to work at 7 in the morning, check emails and plan day until 8. Preshift associates on tasks of the day."
good,love working for this company it has alot to offer but you gotta be willing to do the work

good,"Worked all as a team, fun working enviroment. Always learning different things. Co-workers were very respectful. No difficulties at all and i enjoy being there everyday."
good,A typical day of work is very busy and good if you are a quick multitasker. Close proximity to port allows for a stay short pattern which keeps front desk and housekeeping saturated throughout the peak season months. Hardest part of the job was staffing shortages and most enjoyable part was the guest interraction.
good,"I have worked in Hyatt Regency, Mumbai for 20 weeks as an Intern in"
good,it was ok money but a just there no fun and was getting very slow
good,Great company; it's the people who make the difference. The mission goal and values are motivation to make you go the extra mile for anyone you come into contact with.
good,A typical day depends on the venue I am scheduled in. This hotel has 6 different outlets. Management is very nice. Corporate Management Training programs allow for managers to come in from other cities and countries for 9 months or a year to gain knowledge and experience with the Hyatt Brand. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the people. It's always nice to see the variety of clientele in a hotel. People travel to San Diego from all over the world since it is a tourist destination.
good,"Hyatt Hotels was truly a great place to work. It is so unfortunate that my position was eliminated due to a corporate reorganization. The work environment was positive, friendly and everyone was super supportive."
good,Very hard working and demanding and taught me many lessons.
good,You get to meet new people all the time. You need to undrestand their vacation needs and provide the best package for them.
good,Typical Day as a Hotel Sales Manager:
good,"Enjoyed working with guests one on one. Enjoyed helping them find places to dine, shop, visit."
good,During my stay in Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corporation I have learned a lot to my immediate supervisor. And while working closely with the company president I have learned how to handle small and big task by teaching or not directly thought to me but by his action and decision making. I really admire my previous Boss because the way he handle his company.
good,This hotel is still young and unfortunately it shows in the what they operate.  They are still trying to figure out what works best in all areas.  Including management.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Hyatt, but had left the job for personal reasons. I would recommend anyone to go and apply for a job there. If it were not for personal stuff coming up in my life, I would still be working there."
good,My position is on call so job security does not apply. My schedule is on availability with other hotels I work for and the hotels loyalty to me with making shifts available early. As I am basically a self contractor in my position....loyalty is based on pay and my status on when I am contacted for job opportunities.
good,"I worked there over a year, and I had the chance to work with incredible leaders, the reservations manager and the revenue director, had a lot of experience, and I learned a lot from them. "
good,Good hotel nice place to  work. I enjoy in my work  good stuff big and busy hotel in Delhi even in India also I am very happy work with Hyatt hotel delhi
good,"Prepping and cooking, ordering and scheduling employees. Making sure that all food that went out as above par.  Creating daily specials and preparing from scratch."
good,Only complaint is I found it difficult to balance job and life. When you are full time you get 12 free Hyatt nights a year. Great fringe benefit. Good benefits and salary.
good,"Fast paced environment, opportunity to provide customer service to families, earned tips, discounts available, on site meals at reduced rates, friendly work environment"
good,Overall pretty good place to work at but employee benefits/compensation could be better for employees who have to work for days they are called in when they have a day off or working more than 6 days.
good,The Hyatt provides a safe and comfortable work environment with efforts on recognizing and rewarding staff members for their efforts within the company. They have always encouraged growth within the industry giving staff members the unique opportunity to cross train through multiple departments to maximize hours. There is also a very comprehensive benefit package available to staff members to ensure our health and well being.
good,"Everyday is different, meeting different people with different requests. "
good,not a great company. work culture is not great. management does not think about the employees much. The company technology wise is not upgraded but wants their employee to manage the show.
good,Hyatt i didn't know i left there in 2008.I just keep pray for this Company keep your Employees family first.Praying and Prayers 🙏🙏.The GM Look out for Employees then and Co-Workers look out for each other.I became a Divorce Mom of two children back in 2008.The GM wanted me to stay but other Department Head gave a j hard timehhard tine with my sch
good,"Buenas prestaciones de ley buen ambiente laboral,apoyo a los trabajadores."
good,overall I enjoyed the job and meeting all the different guest. However overnight is not an ideal job for a female because there is no security and I was the only employee working during my hours.
good,Very stress free Job. They are very welcoming and supportive group of people. They have structure to running such a useful business that help others become comfortable away from home.
good,"I am working my way around different brands to find which one I like the best. The Hyatt brand is not  bad brand at all, but unfortunately it is not my favorite. They do not offer as many benefits or bonuses and their employee discounts are not that great."
good,"I was hired on the spot and started that week. I felt very welcomed and involved on site. The coworkers felt like they really cared about everyone, including the customer. This was a business hotel that was very busy during the season."
good,"great people to work with, great leadership."
good,"Good place to work as a fresher in which it will enhance skills and make you adapt to this industry at very ease.Moreover it will give you a nice platform to build your career ,which will work as building block."
good,The Hyatt is a great company to work for as long as things are run efficiently and smoothly. There is a strong team support there as long as the management team currently there it’s doing a great job. Unfortunately management changes regularly so you have to get used to different styles on our two-year plus basis.
good,"Over all great place to work for. Typical day at work is checking in with  management to go over paper work(EEO/Consumption report). Being such a spread out property there is a lot of moving parts. There will be last minute weather calls,extended time lines etc. What i learned the most with working for the Hyatt for 12 years is being part of a family/team. The several times when my mom was sick and I had to take a LOA for months on end. They where so supportive. Management was subpar. Great workplace culture.Always doing employee appreciation parties,themed dinner for the staff. The hardest part about working for lost pines is how spread out the resort is.On any giving day we can have a hour reception on the 12th hole of the golf course while there is a 300 person platted dinner going on in the main ball room.The staff and how much they truly care about there guest.That was the most enjoyable part of working for lost pines. There not just there for a pay check. They know hospitality."
good,"I was at Spirit Ridge for just under year and enjoyed my time there. Hard work, busy hotel, huge potential and very supportive team and owners. Can not say a bad word about the place or the people, felt like one big family"
good,I loved to learn different things with this company help me a lot I learned how to sort a lot of lien it was a tuff company to work for though and it made me a better houseman
good,Strong work ethic encouraged and displayed. Management present at all times. Quick paced environment. Great food. Offers partial matching of 401k. Allows for a very flexible schedule.
good,Good environment in working area. Basically had a effecient and healthy teammates so that we were cooperative in that area. have a great fit and healthy body for healthy work
good,"Fast paced with a variety of clientele . Hotel was connected to the convention center which was extremely busy with a wide variety of conferences , meetings, and contests"
good,"It would be busy when the hotel is full of guests. Co-workers and Chef are friendly. Sushi cooks do not share tips with servers, but sometimes customers may tip the cooks with cash."
good,a very good place to work with multi nationalities around. S.O.P is standard within HYATT company worldwide. You can inter-transfer within the HYATT company worldwide.
good,"good working atmosphere,great staff to learn and work with."
good,"my workday is busy all the time, most of the time i am learning new things. management works right along with you. the hardest part of my job their is no hard part of my job"
good,"Front desk was very busy with up to 1200 check ins on a shift, but fascinating in the people you would meet. Problem solving was a must and satisfying when the customer walks away satisfied."
good,"Geweldig bedrijf het Hyatt"
good,"The job involves everything from waitressing to hosting and tending the bar. The best part is to see the satisfaction on the guest face."
good,Great place to work able to get decent pay. And still live ok at home. Willing to work out schedule conflicts if there are any. Management is understanding about personal life situations.
good,"Hyatt realmente se importa com seus funcionários, de saúde a bem estar."
good,"I worked as a seasonal/on call poolside server/bartender at Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Resort.  I still am currently employed as an on call employee.  I worked outside by the pools, it was a lot of fun, it was mostly slow paced but could get busy during the summer hours.  There is a lot of opportunities working for this company which I liked a lot."
good,"The Park Hyatt Aviara is a wonderful property. As any job, you will find pros and cons but overall it is a good place to work if you are looking to actually work."
good,"It's been a number of years since I worked for Hyatt, though I remember it as a generally wonderful experience.  Ultimately I left having reached a position with other managers ahead of me, leaving me without room to grow and I had not wanted to stagnate."
good,Working 3rd shift at Hyatt can be fast paced or quiet with minimal guest contact. It was easy and pretty straight forward for those who have previous experience as a Night Auditor.
good,"good place to work for those that like fast-pace areas of work."
good,"You have to be your own manager"
good,"Hyatt is a great place to work; however, there are several missed opportunities to mentor and develop its first line supervisors and managers.  If they take the time to develop their leaders, the colleagues will take their time to develop Hyatt."
good,"Great location, and competitive hotel. Walking distance from Mercedes Stadium and the Georgia Aquarium. Most of the rooms are design as a apartment. Great choice for extended stays."
good,We have free lunch A typical workday very busy servicing clients what did I learn more customer service skills my manager was great the workplace culture was good the hardest part of the day sometimes had to help the bellhops and I didn't very much like that the most enjoyable part of the day  assisting the client and getting tips
good,"Hyatt has always treated me well, it is a fun place to work. Being a gallery host comes with a heavy load of responsibility. The only thing I do not approve of with hyatt is that as a bar tender at the front desk we only get tipped with cash, Hyatt does not allow for credit card tipping, making tips very bad for hosts"
good,its very exhausting working in Grand Hyatt since its a buffet breakfast and the place is huge so walking fast is a must plus when it becomes busy since I'm a part time they let me go at the back area where they put all the dishes then I will segregate all kinds of  dishwares.
good,"Hyatt is one the best places I've had the pleasure to work at / be a part of. All of the team members are very knowledgeable, and are more than willing to help a new employee learn. The management is very understanding for personal / life problems, and are very flexible with them."
good,It was a franchise and a fun place to work. Hyatt mission is all about the good experience for the guests. 
good,very nice hotel because its one part of hyatt  hotels of all the world and mangment is amazing they can help you as they can but only salary is not good
good,"Working for Hyatt was great.  It allowed me to learn a lot about hotel work, do's & don't, and how to successful recover irate and bad customer experience situations.  Because the Hyatt I worked for was franchised, a lot of the Hyatt perks weren't given to the employees.  But overall, it was a great opportunity and experience."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Hyatt hotels. The management team is excellent, the benefits are more than decent, and the environment is addictive. I loved everyone I worked with in all departments. The beverage program is great; its full of bourbons, whiskeys, and the managers welcome creative cocktail creations."
good,"I didn't like how management handled the way they went about promoting one of the front desk agents to a front desk supervisor. I didn't get the position because ""we already a supervisor that was a good people person, and didn't need another one""."
good,"Staff is fun, passionate, and dedicated to customer service. Job requires creative problem solving and a basic understanding of certain kinds of computer software."
good,I liked working at Hyatt. I had a well balanced life with a good paying job. Management needed to recognize good workers and reward them with job advancements.
good,Working at the hyatt was so fun i got too meet alot pro athletes & stars..the people are great.light rail right next to it doo didn't have to drive.weekends are the toughest nights because there's so much going on..thats why we each keep setup sheets.
good,It was good had a lot of fun and enjoy the workers great schedule and the hrs were great and the team effort thatthey had and the way things were done
good,"Good company to work for."
good,The company is very customer friendly and the employees enjoyed helping each other as a team during both slow and fast paced situations. Great benefits available to the employees.
good,Since the very first moment I stepped in this company I started to enjoy my job not only because of the people around you but also because my job took a very interesting turn allowing me to do more than what I was used to. Now I can help others learn other languages that I myself do not speak or know.
good,"My schedule was released every Saturday, and every Saturday it seemed like I was working a new shift. My first week I got to know everyone working in the morning and I got used to the sleep schedule. The next week I was moved to dinner, the week after that I was moved to an entirely new position and I was not trained for the new position either. Going from food runner to greeter is a big change, I wish they had given me a little more heads up so I could feel more confident going in. I feel like I wasn't treated very well overall by management and I think that is because I was only there for the summer. I wasn't given information on how to check my pay schedule or how to request days off, they just threw me into the deep end. No rules were ever laid out either, my manager had only been there for two months so he did not seem to have a grasp on the inner workings of the kitchen and restaurant. My coworkers were the best parts of my day, they kept me sane and were the only real teachers that I had."
good,"The day starts with organizing the team, distributing the workload of the team, and executing Hyatt standard guest service satisfaction. I learned the meaning of dedication throughout each project, committing to excellence is a representation of my work ethic, and hold myself accountable for everything I'm responsible for. The culture I worked within was rooted in family, we all looked out for each other, even when we disagreed, and we achieved success together. The hardest times I've experienced while employed under Hyatt was being punctual in arriving at the property when scheduled, which I grew to improve upon learning time management and self-managing priorities. I'm thankful for the management available because they pushed my abilities farther than I believed I was capable of achieving."
good,"Always meeting different people from different cultures and different parts of the world.. fun place to work at very close to all stores and amusement parks. Learned about myself, how to associate with people."
good,This job is really fast paced and time consuming. It is a good job for someone who likes to do strenuous work for average pay. Sometimes you may work a couple hours over scheduled time.
good,"Hyatt is a great place to work if you are a server or bartender. I would highly recommend these positions with this employer. The travel benefits are AMAZING. I miss those tremendously."
good,"Hyatt recency wichita is a great place to work. Employees are treated like family. Employees can come and go quickly, with movement throughout the company available, but there are lots who stay for years. Discounts for employees for traveling needs which is a huge perk."
good,"My position as a Kitchen Steward/Dishwasher is a very challenging job that needs the stewards to be on their feet at all times to ensure perfection and to ensure all the pots and dishes are sanitized and clean for countless use. From this job, I learned that communication is the key to success, from plating to dish washing, we have to be sure we keep engaging in communication to ensure perfection of service behind the kitchen door. What I really enjoyed the most about the job was meeting the staff inside the hotel, we all work in different departments, but we all work together to bring out and represent Hyatt's vision."
good,"I learned a good deal about opening a hotel.  I really enjoyed the day to day marketing and selling with my team."
good,"good work environment, long working hours could be more beneficial in terms of salary , open work environment , get to meet new and different types of customers where you learn more bout customer service"
good,"I cleaned restaurants, bathrooms, and power sprayed driveway. I loved the nice, elegant atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was cleaning elevators."

good,I love when I see a guest after they have checked into their room. I ask the guest how is your room and was it cleaned to their standards that way I can get feedback for the guest on how we are doing and what we can improve on. But I love when the guest checks out and they tell me how wonderful their stay was the rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff is very professional and when hearing that I know that I have done my job. It give me great pleasure to know that the guest consider our hotel as a home away for home.

good,"Love the people I work with, but the pay could be a little more competitive for the amount of work done. good travel benefits and discounts to hotels. Good management!"
good,"This Hotel depends upon its banquet events and normally caters to huge banquet events. The place keeps busy. The staff is very supportive and understanding, the management is also supporting."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is making the guests not feel like guests, but like family. The hardest part of the job is receiving constructive criticism and learning from it."
good,Really enjoyed my time with the company.  Got to learn a lot and see different aspects of the hotel industry.  I liked the benefits included such as hotel stays and discounts.  .
good,El hotel en general es un muy bien lugar para trabajar tiene bastantes prestaciones y ayuda para el colaborador. Están en contaste movimiento y ofrecen muchos cursos de capacitación de cualquier tema. Hay algunas áreas en las que deberían trabajar pero nada que sea imposible de corregir. Es un gran hotel y mi más grande agradecimiento a hyatt ziva Cancún.
good,I really loved working for Hyatt and feel like they truly care about their employees. Sales can often be competitive (which it was) but they would make it fun or have incentives to do your best. I would have stayed with Hyatt if I had more opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"working with Hyatt is a wonderful experience and worth valuable . i learned a various thing like customer handling maintaining OE ( operational equipment ) helping my supervisor. etc. "
good,"In the four years that I have worked with Hyatt, I have always been respected and felt like a part of the family. The work can be grueling at times - customer care is a war that can never be won - but I always go home smiling because of the camaraderie and teamwork that my staff works so hard to maintain. "
good,"Great job to meet people from all around the world. A very well respected name hotel with much to offer to both guests and employees. If ""challenge"" is your thing...this is a great place for you to work."
good,"Hyatt allowed me to get my feet wet by starting in event management and planning at one of the largest Hyatt's in the Midwest. I was not just merely an Event Planning Assistant, in a work environment such as Hyatt Regency Chicago, I was put into positions where I had to lead and consult with clients and implement the necessary changes for the client's event to be successful."
good,"Workplace environment was ever changing with hotel guests. Enjoyed assisting clients with their daily needs. Company provided and empowered staff to assist guests personally before, if needed, bringing in management."

good,"This is a very great job, It's fast-paced most of the time, some days are steady. Great boss and you will get good training. The only problem is that its seasonal."

good,This property is a great location for those looking to get a start in the hospitality industry. The front desk role is a multi-faceted role that keeps you busy and as always at a hotel there are ample opportunities to move up.
good,bon esprit d équipe entre les différents services ce qui rend le travail au quotidien très agréable
good,"I left my position due to leaving the hospitality industry, if I were to go back to hotels Hyatt would be at the top of my list. Hyatt culture comes from the top down, with an emphasis on employees as well as guests. Unfortunately there is often not a great work/life balance for a manager in operations. There is also a lot of variance on your role/amount of responsibility based on your direct management and executives. Pay is not the best in the industry, although benefits are good."
good,"Fun place to work, you meet lots of interesting people. There's not a lot of downtime, lots of multitasking required. Slightly underpaid, but great experience & room for advancement."
good,Hotel room benefits are the best great benefits fun atmosphere always up to date on new trends and great location free lunch was great and unlimited and tasty

I don't have any thing which was bad or discouraged me while I was working here.
good,I worked for 6 months as a housekeeping trainee and working at Hyatt was really a  nice experience that I came to learn many new things regarding housekeeping operation. The whole management team was very supportive. It was very comfortable to work with co-workers as it was in my home country. The hardest part of the work was some it lacked the good communication between management and workers which result in negative customer feedbacks. Working as a team was the enjoyable part of the job also the night shifts were fun.

good,Good workig place and good brand. its very good tings is we are using computer system is to good I learned so mane system oriented work. co-worker are very nice and helpful.
good,"Every day is unique.  Different groups in hotel each week make it more interesting.  Learned most of my computer skills there.  Co workers changed more often than most jobs, but majority were a pleasure to work with.  Hardest part is that there could be a lot of last minute projects that required immediate attention.  Loved working with the guests and the free hotel rooms were a big plus."
good,"I was given opportunities to move up in this company, to some extent. When management changes, many other things change which was a lesson I learned here; to be adaptable. I worked very hard here but in the end felt under appreciated."

good,Everyone is nice and helpful and you can learn new things everyday from people and the work you do and its fun because everyone is like a family thats supports you no matter what
good,"Every day at the Hyatt was different in that the work shifts generally were a result of the occupancy in the hotel.  I learned several skills in the field of hospitality; however, the most valuable thing I learned was how critical each person's work effort could determine a successful day at work.  My co-workers were like family, and we all worked together as a team.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with impatient guests.  The most enjoyable part the job was satisfying the guests and getting good reviews."

There are no typical days at work which to me is a good thing because your always learning something new which makes it enjoyable to be there. I enjoy my co-workers and helping the guest in anyway that I can. There really is no hard part and the most enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck.

good,"That was a time when i used to enjoy working with my co-workers. i have learned how to work under the pressure following the standard in professional way by understanding the job and colleague. It is shameful to say that our company management is playing dirty politics which brings our job in difficult and its very hard to upgrade our career."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that even though we have corporate directives the everyday work experience feels like being with family.  Nice place to work were you can grow and develop with peers and mentors alike.
good,A typical day will be sitting on your desk taking call after call making hotel reservations and trying to assist guests with their memberships .Also calling hotels with any questions or concerns. Managers and Co-Workers were really nice and always willing o help. The hardest part was that the company is not really flexible about personal or family emergencies.
good,Great opportunity to advance and an engaged management staff. Always wanted to see you grasp and move up in the ownership.
good,"Demanding work environment in a 24/7 operation similar to running small town government, involving travel arrangements, special VIP details, guest satisfaction, accuracy of constantly changing information ... days could be anywhere from 12 hours up, but I learned to function in a high state of action on a longterm basis."

good,"A typical day at the Hyatt Regency, I would come in set up my station and prepare for the night a head. Deliver amenities to guest in a timely manner and pay attention to specific detail while taking trays up to guests room. Throughout the night I pick up dirty trays off floors and put them away for the next shift."
good,"I really enjoyed working here as it brought on a sense of responsibilty. It was great working with people like-minded as well. When they started cutting hours trying to budget, that is when things became costly for me and my family."
good,Will work around your school/life schedule. Willing to let individuals grow and move around in the company. Must have another job to work here. Wages are just not competitive. Guests make this a rewarding job.
good,"It was only a Temporary Agent Assignment, but I enjoyed my time there. Got paid well. The work was easy and it was a nice environment to work in."
good,Enjoy working with my management who taught me that you do not always need to be so serious that you can occasionally put some fun into your daily job.
good,Overall this is a great place to work. It's a huge company so if you are willing to move you get moved up every year almost. The bad part of working at this specific hotel is how expensive it is to live anywhere near the hotel. You are in one of the most expensive zip codes in the US.
good,"Opening of store, making sure all employees were available for shifts, retaining, dispersing and balancing cash drawers and vault. Orderning and receiving merchandise, tagging and displaying. Facillitating with Invoices, purchase orders and vendors. Breaking and scheduling coworkers. Managing a safe store for employees and customers."

good,"If you have the desire to learn, Hyatt can really be a great training ground. The best way to advance your career is to be flexible and transfer around the country, giving you a broad view of the hotel business and a varied culinary education.  The hours are long and can be very difficult, but the rewards can be great!"
good,"The facilities are clean and well taken care of. Customers are the main concentration. Their care and, helping them feel welcome. Employees work together to that end. I would recommend this place to work at."

Make sure desk is stocked; packages secure; amenities in places; answer phones; take care of walk-up guest; attend to business center and assist with front desk."
good,"Hiring, training, payroll, part of the executive team."
good,This is a very Social Job. It's different from most hotel jobs. Basically their about 6 different jobs wrap in one. So you dont do the same thing everyday. I learned how to run a Kitchen...lol. Co-Workers are very fun and engaging. Te hardest part of my job was working in the kitchen because I'm a people's person. The most enjoyable part was when I got to work with people
good,Maintain and insure the function of equipment met all required limits. Enjoyed teaching and learning with the department we had established.
good,"Great place to work, very flexiable and everyone is very helpful"
good,"I learned how to help customers further through online services. The stress of meeting numbers was a little much. Also the overtime requirement made it hard to have a life outside of work and it became overwhelming. The most enjoyable part was the guest interactions, I absolutely love the customer service."
good,"A day at the Hyatt Place is always a busy one. Here We do everything from making reservations to reserving a taxi. The most exciting part of the job is meeting people from all over the world. Since the layout of hotels are improving, I learned how to be flexible in completing everyday work tasks. With the help of our lovely management team, I learned how to operate different systems such as Reserve, P.O.S, and Opera. The most difficult part of the job was learning to be patient and understanding that everyone is unique."
good,Working always on the evening shift has taken a toll on my family. Hyatt is a great place but it takes a while to get to the morning shift. Some of the management here is not well played out. Some I have noticed does not hold themselves accountable when something that they did was wrong. The most enjoyable part about working at Hyatt is the associates.
good,Four star high volume downtown hotel. High profile guests and huge events make this hotel a monster when it comes to banquet functions.
good,"Great relation with co-workers, excellent benefits."
good,"Daily tasks include working with clients on guest room reservations, obtaining meeting details and preparing event work orders for clients to review that gets distributed throughout the hotel. Also handle internal meeting requests from all departments in the hotel with setup and food and beverage requests.

good,"I loved working for the HYATT at crown center in Kansas City,MO After 30 years the hyatt contract was not renewed by the  HALL family and the Sheraton took over two years ago.I was told that I could easily be rehired by HYATT at another location and it still has not happened after numerous applications.I had a great work record and am wondering if maybe its my age.(53)"
good,During the summer working at the front desk of a hotel you have to be on the ball about what is going in within the hotel and the community around it. In the summer from start to finish you don't have much down time. Where as in the winter you have some slow days and you have to be a self starter because you don't have a lot to do.
good,starting on time and lot to learn every other day. The team was supportive and helpful at every step. there was never a dull period and was all easy and smooth

Then you would have you daily pm to take care unless and the normal break downs that occur (washing machine, combi ovens, air handlers and ext.).Management is good, they treated me well. My co-workers are hard working, understanding and a good group of guys. Hardest part of the job is that your schedule will change weekly and you have to be very flexible. What I like about the job is that I get to work with a fun and helpful staff."
good,"Great job, great people, nice pay, in the hotel business you work most holidays and that became a problem for me after a few years."

good,"A typical day at work starts off with making sure that work was done the night before. Ensuring that meetings, events, weddings, etc. are ready for the day. I've learned how to create daily report sheets, arrange schedules, and multi-tasking. The co-workers are great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is constant rotation of managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping and meeting new people everyday."

I personally handle about 61 Hyatt properties. I handle the 3rd party billing for the vendors that use Hyatt properties, have close contact with the different departments for each vendor, also work closely with our account receivable department to insure accurate billing in a timely manor. Work closely with the supervisors in the different departments within Hyatt Shared Services for any last minute changes that need to be implemented, while still answering emails that require immediate action.The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers sharing there family's and there daily experiences with there job. The hardest part of my job is to insure all vendors enter accurate information so that billing runs smoothly."
good,"At the Grand I was able to create great friendships and working relationships with some very diverse people."
good,"Very high energy with working in the hotel industry."
good,I was a front office agent at one of the busiest Hotels anywhere.  Please see resume
good,"I worked the front desk, so every shift I would meet new people. It was a great working environment and my co-workers were the best, but it just was not for me."
good,Great multicultural work place. I made great friends here and I learned a lot about customer service

good,"I like this place because working with customers is a great way to interact and have a positive attitude. Multitasking is key to success in this fast paced enviorment. Co-workers are fun to cooperate and management is fair. Early start times, long days and weekends including holidays are the hardest part. Friendly place to work"
good,"The hardest part of the job was probably having to accept the fact that there are some rude people out there and even though they may not be nice to you, it is always professional to be nice and have a positive attitude. I loved meeting new people and enjoying talking to others. i love to work with others and help each and every person."
good,The Hyatt has been an enjoyable place for me to work the past 2 years. The chefs I worked under were fantastic and very helpful. The particular restaurant I worked in however was very high volume due to the fact we provided service for 3 outlets out of our 1 kitchen. This restaurant allowed me to be creative and have a say in menu items and specials.
good,There is no Hyatt in Kansas city anymore. Other than that pretty good company advancement varies on location. Depending on job your its labor intensive
good,Working enviroment is ok. Learnd from various position aroung department.
good,"I love working at Hyatt Shared Services. I have been there for going on 3 years now, and the training is excellent, the management is laid back, yet professional and willing to work hard to make not only their employees happy, but the guest's satisfied. Very dedicated, and easy to work with scheduling, and time off. It's not your every day call center..but like any call center like environment, some times the calls coming in can be challenging, but staff and supervisors are always there to help."
good,"This hotel has been through numerous GMs in the last 5 years all due to the fact that the right person was not hired. I truely enjoyed my time at the hotel, everyday was an adventure"

good,"Excellent Management, met my goals, and happy clients. We had a great team work in the sales office."
good,"All restaurant duties assigned to you, such as waiting, bussing, food prep. and serving. No tips were given since the customers were the residents with the average age being 90 (occasionally there were banquets held that did have outside customers attend). Very fast paced environment, and there was a high demand for being timely and patient with the elderly. Memorization of the menu items were crucial, as they varied day-to-day. All in all, the job wasn't too difficult, but there was no opportunity for advancement. Most of the management were long-time associates from 5+ years that settled, so for almost two years of working, there was never a higher position open."
good,"The benefits are wonderful and you have the opportunity to meet and work with people from around the world. Health care is cheap, you get free room stays at Hyatts around the world after working there for a year, and you get free lunch and breakfast. If you're looking to be a server here, just know that it's DEMANDING. The restaurant gets a lot of business, the sections are around 6-8 tables and the hours are long."
good,The Hyatt Hotels is one of the best hotels to work; it gave me the work experience of a life time which a 4 year college could not. There is a big difference between theory and practice. The Hyatt allowed you to learn by your mistakes and gave one a sense of empowerment.
good,"It is a great place to work, wonderful culture and colleagues. The only drawback if you are consultant/contractor is, even if they promise the role is contract-to-hire, the ""to-hire"" is not certain even after working for few years. Apart from that it will would fun to be part of the company."
good,"Hyatt Regency Hill Country Resort and Spa"

good,"It's a fun place to work, in a great location. Full bar so you don't have to leave the hotel to get a drink or something to eat. The maintenance staff stays late so problems can be fixed in a timely manner. There is all was at lest two staff at the front desk so there isn't a wait to speak with the front desk."
good,"Just like any place you work , you find those who are good and those colleagues who are great. We all wish for the best out of everyone , but sometimes you just get good enough."
good,Hyatt brand is a tag for the fresher and the experience. It’s a very big brand with good management and can learn lots of things even the environment is very friendly among people.
good,Hyatt was full of diversity especially in the customers that came in. Meeting all sorts of people from all over the world was great. Paid pretty decent and the time off you could gain was exceptional.
good,Typical day included giving high quality customer service to guests and providing all guests with an enjoyable dining experience. I learned to prioritize and keep composure even in a fast paced environment. Guests are there to unwind and enjoy themselves and they should always be greeted and extended farewells with a smile.
good,This work environment was awesome because it was the perfect job shift for me at the time also the salary was good and they were flexible with my schedule
good,"Hyatt is a great place to work, but very hard to grow in the field of engineering. Everybody is friendly at the hyatt corporation. There care about there employees and there guest."

good,Great staff treats each other with respect  and they'll treat us with lunch on occasion ..this place stays busy almost every day.the management will  step in and help out as needed
good,The benefits of the Hyatt Group in Turkey is very well maybe the best but the only thing was i had a cross training from another department making 3 hours extra work for 3 months and could not have a chance to pass that department due to the decision of my department manager even i was accepted by the one i didgot the training.
good,"•To find a job where I can apply and explore my knowledge and skills."
good,Was a great place to work at overall. I enjoyed the people I had the pleasure of working with. After I got injured they tried to find as many ways as possible for me to work without missing any days so as not to put me in a financial bind.
good,Hyatt Place was a nice job to have if you like to be off to yourself and just do your job. The staff was friendly and understanding but the  workload was a bit much for the pay. The front desk person was paid more to do less work.

good,"Own and hit/exceed annual sales targets within assigned territory and accounts"
good,"Loved my work environment as it was casual and relaxed, and everyone, for the most part, is super friendly. The benefits are great too, I mean what’s better than free and discounted hotel rooms from a great hotel chain? I would say my only complain is that the job is a bit repetitive since it’s just taking calls all day and that PTO and Paid sick days are a bit weird but that’s about it, other than that no complaints from me!"

Located downtown in the heart of Atlanta you meet all types of people thats the part I enjoy the most working for Hyatt.

good,My time at Hyatt was very short. Great place to work but hospitality was not a fit for me. I enjoyed communicating with customers and meeting their needs
good,"The Hyatt working culture is probably the most appealing trait that this part of my career brought to me.  Everyone that I worked with were people in which actually wanted to develop a relationship with you on a genuine level.  However, the only downside to this position was the work and life balance. The managers in the operations section in the hospitality industry definitely are overworked."

good,Hyatt was one hotel i loved to train with as it gave me opportunities to deal with guest complaints and to learn and grow and gain knowledge about the industry.

I enjoyed training people from all over the world and meeting guests who travel. My favorite part was that every day was different and a new challenge.

good,The job was hard some days but at the same time it was fulfilling.

good,"If you want to get promoted, you have to keep changing hotels. Never stay in the same hotel because its hard to get promoted. I'm a great and fast worker. Im a great leader."
good,Very good work place with many friends and easy to help. Good shift work pattern and very care about the staff. High rewards for those who want to continue working and offers many benefits
good,"Entering the hospitality industry of course you need a passion for people and customer service. It is important to know the type of clientele this resort serves. They are very entitled and will nit pick at the smallest things (which can get frustrating), but they sometimes pay $400+ for a room so you cannot blame them. So be prepared to deliver unparalleled service that can be somewhat frustrating and stressful because the customer is not always reasonable. From my experience, departments are more so concerned about their own gain and are less willing to look at the bigger picture and help one another out in some of the more minuscule ways."
good,"Like being there just not a career choice hard to move up, well at least for myself. The staff was friendly, HR was the best the took care of you. Food was good too, the had a lunch chef"
good,"I did dishes,ran up and down stairs and took the elevator,tore down events,stayed really late due too other dishwashers not being able too complete their jobs.Nice people worked there,hardest part was doing the day dishwashers job almost every day we showed up there.The best part was being able learn that type of job(stewarding etc)and we were able to eat almost every night,cooks would make an insane amount of food for all the staff!"

You learn to understand guest needs, how to handle an upset guest, how to use Opera reservations system and how to give your best customer service. Management is here and there. A lot of the managers give you a very friendly vibe. The workplace environment gives you a family feel. The hardest part of the job is unhappy guest. The most enjoyable is helping a guest and seeing true happiness."
good,"I learned a lot about working in a corporate environment at Hyatt. I was successful in maintaining professionalism in a high-volume customer service environment. Among all of the restaurants I have worked for, I miss this job the most."
good,Great environment.  Wonderful manager with a mentoring spirit.  I wish the job had become a permanent one.  In a great office building with a beautiful view.
good,"Being a hotel, Hyatt was never a boring job. There was always fun and interesting events happening, groups that were staying or hosting events at the hotel. The coffee shop was fun in that I got to learn how to make most of the starbucks drinks but difficult at times when there was a large group or party and everyone would come get drinks or food at the same time(a ""rush"" or ""pop"" we would call it). Probably my favorite part of the job was the relationships i built with people while working there, with guests and employees."
good,I worked at Hyatt many years ago and it was a fun fast paced family environment . I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to work in a fast paced environment where hours are plentiful and days are long.
good,As a Gallery Host I learned a lot about the different aspects of the hotel business. I was able to learn and grow. I would recommend a Select Service Hotel like this one if you would like to learn.
good,"I very much liked this job because everyday we were doing something new, unless you're always out stuck in pool. It never gets boring. The pay does suck though. Rec attendants do so much an get paid so little."
good,"Hyatt is a awesome hotel chain work with (keeping in mind some Hyatts are franchised). They're always advancing and implementing news ways to satisfy their guest. They strive for repeat customers, and stress how important it is to go above and beyond. However, you can learn endlessly within the Hyatt Place sector but we're well under paid."
good,"I loved working there. I loved the staffs, the managers, the location, everything!!! Unfortunately,I was laid off because the hotel needed renovation. Yet, I had my hope high, thinking I would be able to go back. I reapplied, called/emailed managers and all I can think of. My disappointment is that I never heard back from them. It would have been nice if they at least picked up the call and told me they didn't need me anymore."
good,great job oportunity. they care for their employees provide good benefits. oportunity to grow. food is provide for employess. assitent always. good place to start a career.
good,"Starting with the Director of Human Resources who had been there for years!  Working there was like being in a family, very supportive. "
good,Hyatt Regency Savannah es parte de una cadena de hoteles 5 estrellas internacionales

good,The staff made this one of my favorite work places. Most workers and managers here are always friendly and willing to help. The work is what you expect for the position.
good,Hyatt has been a great company to work for. I have cross trained all through the hotel and my drive to succeed does not go unnoticed by management. I am appreciated and that always boosts my work ethic to make sure guests are enjoying the Hyatt experience. Not only are our guests valued but we as employees are as well. Each department has their own team but we all know one another. It's easy to help out when you enjoy working for the company.
good,"The front office can be busy which requires you to be great at multitasking. The main task are assisting guest with check-ins and check-outs, answering calls related to reservations, billing, or conference/group questions, and meeting the general goals of the front office team. These general goals consist of sales (upgrades), enrolling guest into ""world of hyatt"" which is a loyalty membership program for transient guest. The front office agent must also complete everyday reports that is required before their shifts are over. The most enjoyable part of this position are meeting new people from different parts of the world and the discounts the hotel offers to the employees."

good,"I loved the fact that I had only a dress code and no uniforms, felt liberating! the food was a wide spread buffet and we all loved it. Work wise I feel there should be more training and in depth knowledge before heading towards other things. Preferably a set standard SOP for anyone to refer to."
good,"Very much productive, got to learn many new things, good place to work and also for your career growth. A lot of fun activities also involved by keeping the employees always active and happy."

good,A fun place to work in the heart of downtown. Always events going on. There is never a boring day. Always a new and exciting challenge...for those of you that hate routines.
good,I enjoyed working for Hyatt.  I was there for the transition from a former owner of the hotel to the new Hyatt management.  I thought the transition was vey professional and Hyatt really cared about the property as well as the employees.  The food and beverage side has gone through a few changes but continue to bring hip/ relevant outlets to the hotel.
good,"If you enjoy or think you would enjoy an over-the-phone sales job, I recommend this one for you. It's a challenging job, but for people suited to sales, you have opportunities to make a fare amount of money, and it genuinely is one of the better hotel companies out there, they take pride in their products that is infectious to the staff."
good,"Management is good about the staff and fun loving. Helpful and supportive in your work routine.  here is transparent procedure for each and every job role. All staff are treated as same on equal level."
good,"Competitive benefits, leadership, rooom for growth. My typical day at work is working with great associates. Management is very knowlegeable, and also so full of wonderful ideas. Yet, they still allow ou to be creative."
good,Working for Hyatt was great.   A real team atmosphere plus the perks of discounts at other Hyatt properties.  Plenty of room for advancement or cross training in other positions.
good,"Hyatt is all about customer and employee well being.  The experience working there is great.  It's a lot of work to meet the expectations of the Hyatt culture and brand, yet it is well worth it.  Hyatt really takes care of their own."
good,Very nice company to work. You will get friendly environment staff are more supportive but there is long duty hours also they don't have proper incremental procedures

good,"I enjoyed training and developing all departments and approvals of all government agencies. fun working."
good,It was a great place to work at the people were real friendly health insurance dental insurance vision insurance 401k pluswin prizes every two weeks and was able to get bonuses
good,It is a good place to work whether you contract or directly work there.  How your day goes depends on your dept. It ranges depending on whats going on in the hotel. If anything I learned different business practices  and better communication skills from influential guests and managers. It has helped me see with a different light when it comes to opportunity. The people you can come across is amazing. Seeing people rise up from the lowest jobs to office jobs is amazing. There is potential here but you have to reach it. At times it can be busy but for the most part the atmosphere light but active. Everyone here works together pretty well for the most part. The management is very in tune. The hardest part would have to be the days of large events when it puts strain on all depts. of the hotel. Working here as a contractor is just like working for the hotel.
good,"Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay at Cambridge, MD helped me to grow and experience more about the Hospitality Industry. I learned more on the diversity with my co workers and guest relationship.

good,"Competitive work environment located less than five miles from IAD. Staff expected to handle multiple departments including front desk, food preparation, alcohol service and Starbucks coffee service. There is room for growth but only if the time and effort are put in. This property is franchised by OTO Development, a successful company based in Spartanburg, South Carolina. While the hotel itself is a decent environment to work in, OTO Development does not seem to have a grasp on proper management of individual properties.

good,"A typical day at work can be very busy, there is a lot of multitasking involved in this position. you work independently most of the time. Management gives you a lot of space. you might see them once a day. You barely see your co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be effectively prioritizing; you wear a lot of hats in this position. it is manageable, but can be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom tomanage a space independently. Its refreshing to have managements trust in that way. you also interact very closely with guests, and have lots of opportunities to make a real impact during their stay."

good,"On an average day, I would get my roster of my room for the day then gather up all my amenities and some equipment I may need to take to my floor where I would stock up my push cart and prep for my rounds. I would start off my work by ensuring that the VC rooms are all gone before cleaning my first room  My strategy would be to clean as much VC rooms early so about 12 noon I would start cleaning occupied rooms because thats when everyone needs service. What I have learned during this experience was how to manage my time so I can get my rooms done swiftly and accurately. I think the hardest part would be when I first started with position I had to learn the hotels standard of the way they cleaned their rooms which took me awhile to ensure that it was done right. Other then that I enjoyed the staff, guest were nice to me, food that was serviced to the employees was absolutely delicious."
good,I truly loved working for this hotel. I had a chance to meet so many people across the country. Management was great and they allowed you to grow within the company which was really good.
good,Every month close is very typical and some what enjoyable while doing the work why because we face lot of challenges at that time and also we lean that challenges.
good,"Absolutely love working for Hyatt.  They have great benefits (better than industry standard), great opportunities and a well seasoned staff.  Hardest part of the job is the hours expected of the managers which is fine when you're younger but it will get tiring eventually. There's a lot of movement in the company, don't expect to be in the same job/hotel for more than a few years."

good,"A typical day at work would be interacting with guest, I currently work at a 773 room hotel, I've learned to be compassionate and Listening to the guest needs, I now work as an Front Desk Supervisor, I get along great with co-worker were like family, the hardest part about the job would be overselling the the hotel and walking the guest to the nearest hotel, I hate to see a dissatisfied guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a guest bring you thank you gifts for helping them, when you least expected, and having guest satisfaction."
good,"Muy bonito lugar con hermosos paisajes a lado de la mejor playa del lugar."

good,"Culinary meeting in the morning(Preshift)"
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fun, interactive.  If I've learned anything  at working here it is to never take things too seriously, do what you know and do it well, and  focus on whats important. Being apart of the management team you will always come across difficult days, but there will always be tomorrow to have a fresh start at something better. I would say the hardest part of my job is the long hours of dedication that i put in weekly. But i find it very fulfilling to see someone happy and being apart of making that happen."

My colleagues and my co-workers made a great team as we accomplished our daily quotas and beyond.

My only downfalls would have to be when you finish your work you get to leave and go home. So if you think you'll be getting a full 40hrs a week, that wont happen! Also, in the winter time your hours would be cut to maybe 1-2 days week due to low business, but your hourly rate was raise."
good,"Great opportunity to meet people from all over the world.  Your co workers are usually great.  The most difficult part is trying to find solutions to all your guests' issues.

The hotel has also sent me to have a best trainings and to do also training in other Hyatt hotels imparting my skills and also accumulating knowledge from other fellow colleagues. I think the most enjoyable part of this job is you get to do what you love to do and pour out all your heart into it because nothing compares that passion that you have inside you and be able to express it through your work.

good,"Excellent team, learn a lot from my direct report (Controller). Prepared myself for Controller. Difficult commute daily with traffic"
good,"In the events world, you are always busy. Which is exactly how I like it! You learn so much doing just the day to day due to your exposure to so many different elements. The management is supportive of growth, but do not spend time training associates properly. Kind of a sink or swim, figure it out as you go atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoy all of my coworkers, even when things are tough we can always count on one another to work as a cohesive team to tackle the issue at hand. The hardest part of this position is certainly time management. There are just so many different items on your plate and you truly have to decide what is important now and what can wait. The most enjoyable part is definitely the client interaction and seeing your event come to life. It's an incredibly satisfying feeling of accomplishment."

A typical day will involve interactions with every department of the hotel, even indirectly. It also includes interactions with 2 different divisions of the outsourced processes, which provides opportunities to learn about others from around the world."
good,"The Hyatt is a great place to work. There is a lot of room for internal growth and it is usually preferred. With any job in Hospitality/Customer Service industry there is a great deal of stress. This stree is amplied by Management looking for better results. Each hotel is different but most employees are committed to quality work, they become your second family as the hours are very long. Working weekends and additional hours on the weekdays is a given. Much emphasis is placed on survey scores from guests which again adds to the stree. The benefits are great and full time employees can stay at hotels for FREE when available!"
good,"Routined preparation for forthcoming time period e.g breakfast, lunch, dinner menus. Prepare back of house ready for service. This would apply to different areas of work such as conference and banqueting and room service. This taught me that preparation for tasks is essential for efficient working. Management would always have new tasks required of them for them to attend immediately which lead to staff needing to adapt to working environment and provide adequate attention to face to face customer service at all times. Due to high staff turn-over, co-workers would at times be inexperienced which would have a adverse effect on remainder of the team, this increased workload for works at times. that hardest part of the job would be towards the end of a 12 hour shift where energy levels drop however to provide a reputable brand image was essential. The most enjoyable part of the job would be providing outstanding service to customers and being recognised as part of a successful team by management."

However, my peoples skills were enhanced and again time management was key in order to get work done in an effective manner. The management was meticulous.The co-workers were always very focused and  helpful , The challenge faced in such a job is mostly that it is an early start with late hours. The most enjoyable part was that it was meeting new people and interacting with people from all over the globe."
good,"Upon starting employment at this establishment it can be very stressful. There is no transition in pace as you work, once you start there is no crawling then walking then running transtion in pace. You high the ground in an all out sprint. Now this is entirely attributed to the work field, guests can be very high demanding of anything and everything throughout their stay. Which develops a very high strung and often stressful work enviroment if not a skilled individual in this field. But once you have shaken the rust off work can be fun and very competitve among fellow emloyees. During my employment we would always be competing to see who could have the highest rated customer service scores or who could make the most money etc. So once time has been taken to get comfortable in this field it can definantly become a breeze."
good,Working at Hyatt has been by far one of the greatest opportunities I have experienced in my life.

I also learned about several wines as well as foods like sushi & etc... Management had its ups and downs I did see several managers go through my department in the 7 years that i worked for the Hyatt and there was long gaps in between them some of the time. I can and will say that the Hyatt corporation did a good job of hiring Management and employees that showed a very genuine care for their job and Guests. My co-workers all gave a great deal of effort to show their care and appreciation to all guests that walked through our doors. We smiled and we laughed with guests as well as giving them top notch service. Because of that we had a great deal of regulars that we all new by name and made sure they felt at home whenever in our care. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the great turnover of management we had. It put stress on employees and made it hard to be on the same page about happenings within our department and the whole hotel even. The most enjoyable part of my job at the Hyatt was taking care of my guests and making them happy and receiving guest feedback about their experiences there with us as a family. Food and Beverage is my passion Bartending is my love and Guest service is my life! I just need to feel complete again with a position that allows me to be me a SERVICEAHOLIC!! LOL!!  Oh yeah i have a sense of humor too!
good,"Productive and fun workplace with a lot of party days                      Co-workers the best.

Cleaning their rooms in the morning with the help of one of my room attendant,turn down service every night,making reservation for them in any activities they wanted for the day and for the rest of their stay. One thing I really enjoy is giving them my special attention as their butler and personalized service. I always make sure that what ever they need I can give it to them as soon as possible as I can. I've learned a lot how to handle a different attitude and personality of my guests. The management was good nothing to complain. The hardest thing in my job is if I have a check in check out rooms that I need to finished on time,a back to back rooms but I can still make it happen before the guests arrive."

The most enjoyable part about the job is working with everyone there; the staff, the management, and the hotel guests."
good,"Not just a great show, but also a good way to describe the kitchens and culinary team I've had the pleasure to work with for the past three years. I am a part of a family of cooks who are all immensely passionate about what they do. I have learned so much from the chefs I've had the honor to study under for the time I've been here, not to mention my fellow commis.

good,"i have fun in all i do there....... u have to be a good worker to be there, the pace is fast and they expect the best from u at all times."
good,"They have all these incentive games, but when they draw winners you never receive the gift cards or prizes promised. The Food and Bev outlets manager positions have such high turnover, there's a new one every six months. As a result they don't know the ins and outs of each outlet (restaurant, coffee shop, in room dining) and don't know how to handle questions. They patronize staff, blame us for running out of basic things (like bottle openers) even though multiple people told multiple managers. The communication between the managers is terrible. If you ask each one a question, you will get five different answers. They frequently schedule people on days they cannot work due to school and other jobs, even after being told over and over again. There are great benefits such as paid holidays, 2 weeks vacation and free hotel rooms after a year, cafeteria with meals for one dollar check deduction, free sodas, dry clean your uniform, insurance and 401 k. Pay is alright, if you're a tipped or hourly employee, you get a .20 cent raise at the very very most, once a year. Sometimes its more like .10 or .15 cents. Go here, get some experience, and then GET OUT."
good,I learned a lot of stuffs when I was in this hotel for my intership.
good,This is a great company to work for with hotels all over the world.

good,I was a breakfast/lunch (and dinner if needed) server in the restaurant in the hotel. I learned how to train a food/beverage server in a fine dining establishment after being promoted to trainer after only five months. Management was fair and professional as were my co-workers. The hardest part was the long shifts (9-11 hours) while the most enjoyable part was feeling proud to put on the uniform.

good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy bueno, aprendi mucho."
good,"The Hyatt Place has been a great company to work for. I've acquired great skills in multiple different areas. I've assisted in Inside Sales, Housekeeping, and maintenance. For a brief period of time, I was the Night Auditor. My coworkers and I not only check guests in and out, we also prepare/serve food and beverages. My managers and my coworkers have made my time with the company enjoyable. I appreciate the oppurtunities I've been given with Hyatt. I feel that I am ready to advance and take on more responsibilities. However, the opportunity for advancement is low. As with most hotels, we keep a small staff, with a limited number of people in each department. My coworkers and our guests have been amazing. Leaving this company will be the hardest part of this job."
good,"To start off, we would have a morning meeting to recongize what we all could improve on or what the cleaning subject of the week is. After we all came to agreement, we would head off and stock our carts for the cleaning process of the rooms. I learned that costumers are very important no matter where you go. If you please their day, they will please yours will a fantastic report. The hardest part was to pick up after dirty people, but it was my job to be respectful. I loved the community and my co-workers. We all came together like family."

good,"Typical day vaires based on if im in Banquets or working the line. Do in house meat and fish fabrications, sauce production, banquet production and firing. Learn different things everyday in various applications. Strong management with open communications. Fairly strong co-workers with varied skill sets. Hardest part of the job would be trying to get everyone to put out the same quality that is expected. Most enjoyable part of the job is hearing the guests comments."
good,"I have worked for Hyatt since I graduated college. Overall, I would say if you are ready to commit your whole life to the hotel then this is the job for you. I work on average 60 hours a week. I would say that as a manager if I could do it all over I would have chosen a different path in the hotel. As a hourly associate I think Hyatt is fantastic. One of the things that I really admire is that Hyatt strives to hire the best people. Your coworkers will truly become your family as you spend more time with them than your own."
good,"Great company to work for however a lot of changes as taken place the last 3 to 4 months, the people are friendly and the patients are wonderful they give you a reason to want to come to work, the company also have a lot of online classes that is available to the staff at work or on your free time, including CEU's ."

good,"During a typical work day at Hyatt, you'll answer countless phone calls and make countless more notes. You might require some assistance at some point. Fear not, your management and those closest to you are willing and expecting to answer any questions that you might have. Everyone is friendly and happy to help. Management is encouraging and often promotes competitiveness which leads to better call ratings and more fun activity days. These are the days to look forward to as a Hyatt employee! The incentives and rewards make a tough work week worth it."
good,My overall experience at hyatt was great even though it was about 45 minutes away from my house i worked well with my co-workers and was about to relate to everyone my first week there

I’m thankful this company cuz they take me without any knowledge and try to make one of his employee. And now cuz of this company I’m her in Dubai working one of the best hotel in Dubai.
good,My job there was quite simple but that does not necessarily mean I didn't have lots to do. The Hyatt is a place for families to come and enjoy their stay. They want to feel at home and that their vacation matters to us and we make sure they feel that way. You learn people skills and how to send people on their way home feeling happy.
good,Definitely some stressful and busy days (as it goes with a 24-hour business) however the opportunities were amazing! You can pretty much transfer anywhere and the benefits cannot be beat.

good,"Great location to work for summer, plenty of hours and over time if you want it."
good,Fast paced hotel. Strong professional standards are a must and very present. Wages are competitive with neighboring hotels. Nice place to work but close to impossible to move up in this department.
good,They give every opportunity to their employees to grow and prepare for their future as much as possible. They always offer training sessions every month to ensure that the employees are updated to current trends.
good,Linda experiencia. Poca plata pero se aprende harto.
good,It has great benefits and a good work environment.  It felt like a family working here.  There are travel benefits and affordable insurance and 401(k).  There are lots of career advancement opportunities and they promote from within.
good,Love my job at the Hyatt. Staff is very friendly. Working at the Hyatt is like working with family. One of my best decisions was becoming apart of the Recreation department.
good,"Overall great, people were amazing and really forms ypu into a jack of all trades. So even if you're not upto par in one aspect the chief engineer helps form you into a broad talented expert."
good,Fun days at Hyatt Regency Atlanta. Never a boring day and never a slow day. Fast pace and your hours went by very fast. If I had not gotten relocated then I still would be working at HRA.

good,"working for Hyatt can be very rewarding.... if your looking for a career in hospitality. They believe in promoting from within before going outside, training is very good and the company on whole treats its employees as family. That is one thing that I can say the atmosphere is very family orientated."
good,I would go back once I got my health together if I could. Such a warm and understanding upper management team. The benefits alone are so worth it. Although it's remote they make it an importance to build a familial comradery.
good,"I've never worked anywhere else that has so many employee appreciation activities. I loved working here, for the most part. If the pay were better I would return."
good,A typical day starts at 4 am getting everything warmed up and ready for pick up. One thing i learned is how to produce in large amounts. management is a 3 out of 5.

good,"The environment of a hotel is very fast pace, biggest part of our job is communicating. With guest, between departments, on phones, always having to explain everything with a smile. I articulate myself very well my mother was an English major, but for those who have a hard time with split decisions, on the spot questions, and everything in between, this job becomes quite difficult. Also a true testament to your abilities as to multitask between being a bartender, running the front desk, phone operator, housekeeper, and nightly kitchen aide."
good,"Nice to be work there but only negative point is shift timings (split shift) overall very good experience at hyatt regency gurgaon."
good,Hyatt is one of the leading Hotel in Nepal and it provides a good career opportunity to us. Working with Hyatt for 4 years has develop me in all ways.

good,Great place to work for advancement and benefits. Started as a server and over the years I worked in several different positions in several departments eventually working my way up to a food and beverage department head.
good,"Hyatt is extremely special to me as it is become a huge part of my life and second family. Our culture is one of caring to others can be their best every day and providing authentic hospitality allowing others to show their personality while providing great service and great results,"
good,Working  in the world of Hyatt has been a wonderful experience as an intern and working culture also the management take care of the employees as well as the guest.

good,"Hyatt has been very good to me in my 24+ years and I've made some lifetime friends wit the company. The Hotel - Hospitality Business is changing and unfortunately for me I needed to move on. I will always be loyal to Hyatt on a personal level. I really have nothing negative to say about the company or my last position with Hyatt Regency Sacramento. Great City, Great Hotel, Great Owners and good people top to bottom."
good,Hyatt was a great place to work. Management was kind and caring. The pace was fast and never a dull moment.  again hardest part of my job was short staffed.
good,A good place to work. You can learn a lot of different jobs under each division. Rooms division I worked in the PBX Reservations and Front desk. It was a very fun place to work also.
good,"manejo de personal ,efectivo , nominas ,horarios en general"
good,I love working here just wish I had better hours instead of super late shifts. I want to get moved up but it’s nearly impossible due to a “seniority” rule.

good,"Es un buen lugar de trabajo,me gustaba mucho,pero el respeto de los supervisores no lo aguante por lo cual pedí a mi jefe que me hecharan por qué no toleraba la falta de respeto y más adelante de los clientes."

good,"I started to work in hyatt as a laundry department, then I take a chance to learn and trained in room service department after I got transept in pool bar as a waiter after two years I asked to give a chance to room service then I got room service as a waiter."
good,I was no longer growing personally and professionally at this company. There is a lack of proper leadership development and management which I feel is a foundation for success.
good,"Park Hyatt Hyderabad is an organisation that has strong culture and company values. It cares for its people so they can be their best."
good,"Trained in the events and food and beverage department. Hyatt Santa Clara gives an amazing opportunity to move up in the company. Whatever your interest are, you can move around and see what suites you best.  In events and Food and Beverage, it is a face paced environment where you are dealing with large masses of people at a time.

good,"A typical day at work would be coming in and first greeting our associate concierge. The hotel is so huge, the employees have their own concierge. Everyone is very friendly as you walk down the halls to go clock in, everyone says hi and bye. I would say that acknowledging your colleagues and being kind is part of the Hyatt culture. From working at such a big hotel I learned a lot about taking initiative, there is not always going to be someone right next to you guiding or telling you what to do, so I learned how to take things into my own hands when need be. That can also be seen as the hardest part of the job as well,  being with so many people, if you really do need help or important information from a manager then it can sometimes get hard to quickly/ effectively get what you need. I do enjoy all the new people I meet everyday as far as my colleagues and guests, and all the things I learn, everyday is something new."

Compensation and benefits were okay.  The owner of this particular Hyatt House was becoming more and more unfair to the staff before I left.  For example, he was planning on taking away employee parking.  This would have been enough to make me quit because compensation was not good enough if we have to pay for our own parking at the oceanfront.  I had already left for more money by that time anyway."

Working in the hospitality business, I get to overlook and see everything from many different views including FOH and BOH working environment. I learned many different qualities that have helped me understand people more and their needs. Knowing how a hotel works from many different departments helps me learn more and more about the profession. Management is a hard working team with long hours, so I appreciate what tasks they have to go through.

Hardest part of my job is the down time. When all is done and nothing else to do its hard to just sit there nothing to do for hours until the house guest wake up and start checking out of the hotel. What i enjoy the most is getting into the rental cars very new and going to park it.

good,"At NoMi I studied under a world renowned French Pastry Chef.  As a Hotel, we had all the best tools (toys!)...a sheeter for doughs, an industrial ice cream maker, a Paco Jet, an immersion circulator, cryovac, blast chiller etc.  As Chef didn't come in until later in the morning, I would start my day by prioritizing production needs and looking at special events for the day.  We did everything from scratch- including French Macaroons.  There was always something popping up at the last minute so we had to be prepared.  This was a beautiful, highly functioning, and very well organized kitchen.  Management was always available to all departments, the Chefs would jump in as needed always.  From this I learned a respect for my craft and to have a responsibility to all areas of the restaurant.  The best part of this job was learning new techniques and working with Chefs who truly cared about their staff and the amazing food we were able to put out."

good,"Fun work place with very friendly employees and management that will work to ensure your success and satisfaction. Computer skills are required but the training class prepares every sales associate for the challenges that will be faced on the phones. The most difficult part of this job is meeting requirements for call times, as guests set the pace and control the length of conversations. There are many benefits to working for Hyatt Reservation Center, such as access to the free gym, game room, and pay incentives.The only downsides to working there are the lack of mobility during shifts and occasional callers that are not interested in booking hotel rooms."

I leaned how to schedule employees, how to handling catering for golf tournaments, how to order F&B and alcohol based on usage and upcoming events.

good,"Fast paced and a lot of knowledge is required to succeed. You should always be willing to learn new ares of work and be willing to deal with costumers no matter what position. This job is 24/7, 365; remember a hotel is always running. Management is great but sometimes it can be a hierarchy. You get to know a lot of people not in your department, make a lot of connections, meet regulars, and make great partnerships, and friends."

I would then have to verify customers that called and put their request into the computer. some days i would have to fax things or emaill things to them. other days i would have to mail things. my co workers were awesome and very helpful, we had some fun days with different activities going on. the hardest part of the job was not knowing what to do when i first started and then when we would have 68 + calls waiting to be answered."
good,I have worked for the Hyatt for five years overnight as their Auditor. I learned alot. But my posistion does not allow me to be promoted.

good,"The management team, and coworkers were great at this company. The benefits were also great, very competitive pay, great insurance plans, discounts at Hyatt brand hotels, pto. Only cons are the actual job, it’s a call center that frequently has back to back calls so an 8hr or 10hr shift of back to back calls where a good percentage of them were customer service related rather than sales, meaning quite a few very angry customer calls in a day. Also they set some occasionally hard to meet sales goals to meet. That if not let cam lead to disciplinary action."

good,"Management has been so flexible and understand with my schedule. When I got hired, I thought it was corperate but I was wrong. It’s a franchise and that means you don’t get paid maternity or your 12 free vacation nights. I’ve cross trained in just about everything which is nice but I really wish pay was a little higher. I recommend staying with the corperate side for the perks. End of the day I’m very happy with my job and the individuals I work with."

I learned the importance of budgeting and forecasting what was really needed.No good deed went unnoticed, the company made sure we all had a smile on our faces, the company was also really rewarding. The hardest part of the job would have to be keeping the budget down; many departments weren't aware with the monthly spending goals. I enjoyed having a huge responsibility."

good,"I love my job with Hyatt. There are always opportunities for growth and advancement. The benefits (insurance, vacation, sick pay, COMP NIGHTS!) are incredible. Because the hospitality industry tends to have high turn over, there can be some drama between employees. If you can resist the urge to gossip and put your nose to the grind, the results are very beneficial."
good,"it was really more than a pleasure to work as an opening hotel hyatt regency in pune."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company because they were willing to work with my school schedule and were very supportive of my education. a typical day was a 8 hour shift in the laundry area. standing folding and sorting, loading machines.

good,"Very good place to work, the benefits are incredible and Leaders being so open with the Staff , It's big hotel and usually is 100% the occupancy ,because the Convention Center is inside the Hotel."

good,"I have now worked for two different Regencys and I have to say I just love this company! The benefits are great, the management is awesome and all my coworkers have always been super helpful and team oriented"
good,the company was good and the management  was excellent.  re benifit they are provediing as per the  therir policy and thry will follow the labour law. when I am working I actually learned lot from them. its great place to work.
good,I enjoyed working at Hyatt house I was able to learn different skills and work with other positive people who believe in hard work pays off. Totally worth every minute of my time.
good,"Hyatt is the best place to work. It's the best hospitality school. "

good,good job security. co workers and management works well together
good,"I worked at Hyatt Place for 3 years and the first 2 and a half years were great. Great team atmosphere, great GM everything. The last year I was there was awful, not enough HK staff so the days were long, sometimes 10 hours long. The new supervisor for HK duties, didn’t even know anything about HK and once got the HK team so many complaints, including toe nails on the ground and dirty underwear left by the couch bc she didn’t check rooms correctly. She WAS terrible and cared more about front desk than her main area, which was housekeeping. If you work at Hyatt Place beware they will overwork you and show little appreciation in return."
good,"No worth the time or Investment in your life , work for corporate not a franchise.. Intermountain is the worst Management Company sad benefits and poor paying to the employess , and dont be over 30 expect to go any where"
good,I volunteered while in highschool to get community service hours
good,great place to work. meet new professional people. being around great staff.
good,"My experience was one of a kind. Every single Hyatt employee I encountered was wonderful, and truly cared for others so they could be their best. However, the DOS & ADOS I had to work with were the worst! They absolutely DID NOT care for others. They LIVED in the office and made others feel guilty for not spending 12+ hours a day there. They did not support or encourage growth. They did not provide appropriate training when asked, they refused any ideas presented to them and could not handle any objection towards them. They never EVER said Thank You or show any appreciation or positive emotions for hard work! They do not appreciate the incredible team they have and it's really sad!"
good,overall the hyatt is a good company to work for all they have to do is bump up the pay and help people advance their career management internally is tearing the company apart
good,"i work five days a week, yes i really develop skills when i was working with hotel hyatt, the management was fine, my employee was acqua agents, the difficult aspect is when there is traffic hold up, my enjoyable aspect i recieved my salary every months."
good,"Usually the supervisor understands the organization and the employee's profession better than the employee. Consequently, the supervisor is in a unique position to give ongoing advice to the employee about job and career. The employee can look to the supervisor as a model for direction and development. An effective mentor-mentee relationship requires the supervisor to accept the responsibility of mentorship. A good supervisor can be a priceless addition to the career of an employee."
good,"Very Flexible...work..life balancea at this particular Hyatt.  However it is Franchise so there are NO benefits nor do you learn much about the company.  There is no HR department or New Employee Orientation.  Sad but true.  Nevertheless, the Team has great people!"
good,"Clean hotel . One of the cleanest hotels I ever work for. The manager at the time , she went over and beyond for her girls during hard times ..  Salary could've been better , but the job itself was cool"
good,Pay is not good for all the work we do at the Hyatt i think we could get paid more with no problems employees can be more respectful management is good at 100 %. I love my job
good,Decent place of employment. Staff demands the best from all employees at all times. Minimal room for advancement. Beautiful resort to show up to work for.

good,"I enjoy working at the Hyatt resort in Spa and receiving there awesome benefits, but I truly believe it jus isn't enough pay."
good,"Management discriminate against certain people. Had an accident at work and no manager called me to see how I was doing and on top of that, they fired me while still under the Doctor care"
good,"day at work 16 hours"
good,"Great building with a lot of potential."
good,"My typical day consists of answering phone calls, dispatching various departments for hotel and guest issues, problem solving, phone equipment diagnosis and repair. I enjoy assisting customers. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistant work shifts."
good,"I loved working for the Hyatt. However, speaking of the one property that I did work for: front office managers tend to be selfish and so concerned with their own office politics, and therefore do not focus much on the growth of their employees. Great perks, and benefits."
good,"I love the owner of the Hyatt Chelsea,  very sweet and professional it was the supervisor that was a slave driver. You're expected to learn everything within a few days and execute it perfectly within the next week. A lot of competition between certain staff members and as I said the supervisors are not wanting to give anyone overtime but expect loads of work to be completed and absolutely correctly on such a short handed staff. Don't get me wrong you should do your job correctly but if you want the cleaning done down to a tee you should allow the workers time to get it done. Otherwise you will have coworkers taking pictures and showing management what you supposedly did wrong. Overall under different supervision I would say lovely place to work."
good,This place taught me alot . I have found lot of changes in me. I have developed myself in every way. Teamwork is what i learnt.. it's an amazing experience
good,while working at this Hyatt location it has been very stressful and unrewarding. There's a lack of communication between the managers and their employees.
good,The Hyatt was a great place to work. Management changed a lot. For a while we actrully went without a manager. This lasted for about two months. After everything smoothed out it became a wonderful place to work.
good,Turnos agradables buen nivel de presion laboral agradable ambiente

good,"*Inventorying, requisitioning, order placing"
good,"I start by looking at the figures and what's in for the day and focus on the apropiate revenue generating strategies on concerned areas. Day continue with the facility tour, follow-up calls and email for outstanding tasks and issues. I put my efforts in the most busiest areas coordinating smooth operations. "
good,"in a same place learning got stopped. everyday,every month is same. it is nothing but stucked in a well where learning is limited."
good,I enjoyed greeting te residents and I love toput smiles on there face
good,"I liked it but it was very repetitious and a lot of standing in one place."

good,Great people and environment. Longevity is common with many of the employees. Hyatt was recommended as one of the best companies to work for 3 years in a row.
good,"Al llegar hay que verificar los pendientes del turno anterior, hay que tratar huéspedes no muy contentos y muy contentos, el comité ejecutivo rara vez anda por áreas ya que tienen muchos cursos, el ambiente entre los asociados es muy cordial, somos un equipo muy armonioso, lo más complicado es tener un mercado tan variado y satisfacer las necesidades de todos, mi parte favorita de mi trabajo es escuchar un gracias después de haber ayudado a un huésped o compañero con alguna tarea."
good,Hyatt is management based company and care for the employee directly depends on the owners. So it needs to be improved a little bit. There should be transparency between company and employee.
good,A great place to gain experience.  Lots of exposure to different cultures and different types of consumers.  Good leadership team.  Lots of employee activities to enjoy.
good,Long days customer facing. Working every saturday and most sundays. Strong family like team. Hardest part of the job is the weekend work taking social time away. Best part of the job is working with an amazing team of people with the same drive to succeed.
good,Review on the spot..my main work schedule was on the conservation of energies on different fields..as i save about 4 lakh dirhams per year..on my ist effort to schedule the bms timing..and i also got appriciation for those things...thank u

good,"This position was a great starter job into accounting. I was given opportunity to work in different parts of the hotels accountng system. In addition, we worked in many parts of the hotel. The management of the hotel was over the top. Our General Manager knew all 900 employees by name. She was an outstanding roll model. The hardest part of the job was the commute having two small children at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery the employees and the management had together."
good,"Lots of things to learn."

good,"learned many things how to make understand a guest . Its very difficultt to work in this company , but the co -workers seems to be very Pleasantable"
good,"A typical day of work consists of coming in and communicating with the previous shift. Next, I review the system for check-ins and any changes that need to be made to reservations. I am responsible for check-ins and check-outs, answering phones, making reservations, tending the bar, making food orders in the kitchen and occasionally driving the shuttle, along with anything else that is required of me. I have learned to be more observant and precise as a result of this position. Management is overall good with the exception of one or two people, they are usually fair and impartial in regards to workers, but not always. There is sometimes a lot of drama with co workers which can be frustrating at times. The hardest part of the job is having to go behind the team to make sure that everything is completed on our checklist, the most rewarding part of the job is that I have learned to pay closer attention to detail"
good,"Very large hotel"
good,Very Good Palce to start your carrier as well as for Experience person

good,"I only gave the overall rating 5 stars because I love Hyatt. I worked for Hyatt Bethesda as a Bellman for almost two years and LOVED it...until it became franchised by Highgate Hotels. The money was GREAT i will say that. Being a Bellman is awesome. I will encourage anyone to work for Hyatt that is corporately owned because it was the best company to work for. However i strongly recommend to NEVER work for Hyatt Bethesda or any franchised Hyatt. Hyatt Bethesda being operated by Highgate Hotels was the worst day of my life. They rennovated the property and lied to cusotmers for months about even having a rennovation until they got so many astounding complaints. They treat their employees like trash and the customers even worst. The management is TERRIBLE and Hyatt Bethesda and Highgate are VERY greedy and only care about the customers credit card being approved and that is it. As an employee i say this because the customers at Hyatt Bethesda are such great lovely people and they became family and treat the employees so nicely which is rare so it was an awful feeling knowing the people know that they are being taken advantage of. I loved my job and took great pride in it and was even written up and eventually fired because i went ""too above and beyond"" for a guest. It was a nightmare working at that location while being operated by Highgate Hotels because literally everyday they flex their muscle to make you feel like you will be fired and given day. But again Hyatt corporately is the best hotel chain to possibly work for and i was sad they day it became franchised. I highly recommend"
good,"Hyatt was a great company to be apart of. Talking to our guest and making a memory for people by creating great service was a typical day in the life of a pool server.

good,Job highly demanding with non standard hours. Professional attitude required. Meticulous preparation required with extra care in food management health requirements. Social skills required especially dealing with customers/guests.
good,"Management always has monthly meetings which motivate the staff to want to do better and meet front office goals. Very fun environment overall but as most businesses go, you will deal with difficult guest/customers."
good,This is a great starter job if you're interested in the hospitality industry. You really learn all aspects of how to work in the hotel and gain a lot of experience
good,It was a nice place to work but the food that they gave is bad and the people whom work there was nice if you dont know Spanish. I work roughly 8 hours a day outside.

I learned a great deal about Real Estate which added more valuable & useful information to my office, clerical & administrative knowledge I have gained through years of work in various professional office environments.

"
good,I learned the ins and out of providing exceptional customer service and ensuring every guest had a memorable stay with us. The hardest part of my job was how far the property was spread out. It was a challenge finding the tools you needed to do your job at times. A typical day at work is non stop busting tables and attending to every customers needs. My co- workers were supportive in every aspect and all the departments worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I knew I played a role in making sure every persons vacation was one they will never forget by displaying excellent southern hospitality to our guests.
good,support for innovations and all are welcomed to the front row.

good,"I loved working here. I worked with a great team. There was definitely some butting of heads due to personal differences but problems were easily worked out. Biggest downfall was the call-ins from employees were then needed to be covered with no days off. I went 21 days without a day off and still didn't get the best paycheck. Over-time is nonexistent and unless you have a bachelor's in the hotel industry, you can forget any advancement opportunities. Raise was only 2% of your current wage per year."
good,"It is quite normal that the hotel is on a complete High Occupancy, here you will know how to handle guest at most difficult way when rooms are all occupied and on back to back status. The hotel is a multi -cultural oriented work place. The most enjoyable part of the Job is after a hard work and pressures from the heads but at the end we all end up great colleagues."

good,"Son personas que al realizar su trabajo son muy dedicadas al hacerlos bien , tratan de utilizar el 100% de los materiales que se utilizan"
good,It is a fun place to work at. Most of my friends are Hyatt Employees. Upper management is mostly kind and wish you to succeed. You are expected to work long hours (14 hours most days)
good,Hyatt is a great place to work. The people are kind and easy to work with and all the perks are amazing. However the pay is below the average for the job you will do.

good,"Everybody stays close and connected with each other, each department works and flows well with each other. The managers are encouraging and seek to make each employee grow while staying interested in their personal lives. Everybody is eager to get their jobs complete with great customer service. The hotel has grown high in ratings and built a reputation making it easy to be prideful in the work I do. Working with the friendly faces at work and communicating so well makes the job enjoyable. Keeping up with all the business and different diverse groups can make the job a fun challenge.

good,A typical day at the Hyatt Regency Dallas was profitable and fun. I learned how to design and print out gift certificates and also how to manage credit card disputes. The workplace was fun and friendly and sometimes fast pace. The hardest part of my receptionist job in the accounting department was not being able to get overtime. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the department staff.
good,Hyatt is a productive place to work with the great work culture and room for advancement. Although the competitive nature of the company encourages those looking to move up to relocate every two years or sooner. I am looking to start a family and this just does not work for what I look for.

good,"I loved my job at the Hyatt even though I had an extremely long commute. I worked at a Resort/Spa location. In my restaurant outlet, during summer vacation season the money is amazing but the hours can be grueling, averaging well over 40 per week. The flip side of that is out of season my department is not busy at all most days and we drop from 5 employees to 2...even then there were weeks I wouldn't make 30 hours. The management for the most part are awesome and the coworkers are amazing and a very tight knit crew...that lets in the new people, lol. We are like family."
good,"I think the Hyatt is an excellent Hotel, with amazing people, You learned different cultures, because more of the employees are from different parts of the world, you will find Manager with high quality of work, as example Emad Daniels, Cassandra Hope, I learned with them, they really care about the person."

good,Its a revolving door there and they never made you feel like family. You were just another employee who they'd let go if they were not into you. I was very excited about the opportunity but was quickly let down despite my frequent attempts to learn and do the job to the best of my ability.
good,"Good environment "
good,"Hyatt is a great company to work with though that was my first experience in industry i found company very creative and always ready for changes."
good,"I've worked for Hyatt for a little over 4 years now. They definitely promote from within. They will test you; make you work shifts without a supervisor and take on supervisory roles, maybe with extra hours. If you can take that for a short while then you will have no problem working your way up. They reward hard work and recognize it with employee appreciation celebrations. I'm only leaving because I don't think I want to work in hospitality forever. Wonderful if this is your career path!!!"
good,"Hyatt is very good working place they offers better salary better work life balance.better training & chance to learn ,I get very good  opportunity learn the management & technical skils"
good,I did  not enjoy this position due to the fact that I do not approve of gambling. I would watch people mortgage their house and max out their credit cards for their idea of fun. It was not easy to do.
good,Great place to work but very very poor rate of pay..very good ... possible of advance in departments which is GREAT...a great place to learn more for each department all around good team...

Loved my job, staff, and guests who became friends.  Learning from my GM there was and still is something I've never forgotten and have taken with me since I moved back to Texas.  I would watch her, listen to her, took every ounce of what she said to heart and wanted nothing more then to be a great manager, just like her.  By far, walking into work everyday seeing the guests and familiar faces was the best part of my job.  Our Hotel and staff brought them back time and time again."

The management is very warm and are easy to approach also with my co workers they are easy to work with and are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is when a sales engineer gave me a project I  need to design and estimate and tells me it should be done within the day because is a special project.

good,"Hyatt Park Elementary School is an aweome place to work. It has an enhanced instructional program with teams of interventionists who worked with targeted groups of students during the school day to provide interventions and academic assistance. A comprehensive after-school program and individualized tutorial sessions for students in kindergarten through grade five also increased the school’s ability to assist students in meeting academic goals and standards. Supplemental tutorial services are also provided to support students in meeting academic standards. Class size has been significantly reduced at each grade level so that teachers and instructional support staff were better able to provide individualized instruction, enrichment and academic support. Teachers worked with the literacy and math coaches to refine teaching practices and to identify the most effective methods for teaching and supporting the students. All students were eligible to borrow laptop computers for at-home use. Laptops were loaded with the Success Maker program that provides support in reading and mathematics. I can personally affirm that efforts to significantly increase student academic achievement is made through the effective use of data, a clear focus on learning and results, and positive relationships and collaboration among the staff, students, parents and the community. It is an awesome place of employment."

I enjoy coming into work everyday as it gives me a rewarding feeling, and the support I receive from other managers is a great added bonus. I would say the hardest part of my job would be the 'on the run' changes that are made, however this is part of the hospitality industry, and you learn to adapt quickly, nd adjust you plan to fit the situation.

I consider myself fortunate to have worked with 30 other massage therapists and 8 estheticians, all from different backgrounds, and we were able to share with and teach each other. Even more than that, I loved meeting clients from all over the world, with different backgrounds, and many were very eager to share their stories with me. I cherish the memories of the people I met. It was a beautiful environment. The only reason I left was because the nature of the resort spa requires one to work holidays and weekends. The stage of life I was in at that time made it increasingly difficult. I am much more flexible now, and if I weren't moving to Atlanta, I would probably return to this job part time, just for fun."

Additionally, experience doesn't always play a real roll in your compensation either."

good,"They try to keep it fun.  You are dealing with customers billing concerns, admins and anyone researching billing issues.  CS has wonderful management.  Very peaceful, kind and fun.  The hardest part of the job for me was the extremely irate customer.  People think they can be abusive while on the phone because they can't see you.  The most enjoyable part was the people, volunteering, and the cookouts."
good,"Before a shift starts daily ,  the duty manager normally gathers everyone on duty for a short briefing. Successful communication, teamwork and good relation of the personnel in each department  is what makes the hotel  keep it's good business   .Each department has a vital role to make the service memorable and excellent  for every guest and encourage them for a return visit . For me, one of  the most challenging part  when I was working in a hotel was  handling guest complaints. In some cases , I felt  guest would just make up some stories in order to avail complimentary services. Well, I believe  all kinds of jobs have their own  hassles.   Above all, the experience was interesting. I met different nationality, I experienced different behaviors of people when they're freaking mad or pleased. I learned a lot from encountering people with different languages, attitudes and culture. Overall, it was a fun and a very significant experience for me ."

Oversaw their check ins and checkouts, received calls from guests needing bell service, managing the front drive with valet, receiving calls from associates needing luggage to be sent up to the room, handling misplaced luggage. I learned to work as a team and to do basic staff scheduling. Management was awesome and was readily available whenever we needed them. They were not afraid to get some of the work done when there was a lag in the service. Co-workers were extremely fun to be around, and although I was only there for a brief time, they made me feel welcome and a part of the team. Hardest part of the job was actually having to leave. I was seasonal and there was no job for me after the season. The most enjoyable aspect of the job had to be interacting with the guests and the staff in my department."

good,"I enjoyed my time with Hyatt. The property I worked for was ranked the 3rd busiest Hyatt in North America. We won culinary team of the year in 2012. We hosted the Denver Broncos during super bowl and I got to make the team's omelets every morning for the week they stayed. I learned a lot from the mangers I first started with not so much from the mangers that were there when I left. I enjoyed working in a banquet kitchen, though I covered shifts in the restaurant frequently. I was able to work with different produce from around the world and experiment with recipes when we were changing menus. I loved that our menus changed every season. The job was satisfying in allowing to take on managerial responsibilities with the hope of moving forward. The downside is that the advancement in my position at this property was limited and not a lot was available at the time in other properties in the area. I would absolutely work for Hyatt again in the future."

I learned many ways to deal with upset customers.  My manager was always willing to hear out any questions, comments, or concerns we might have and was very helpful in the developing of my skills.  My co workers are close to my age so I was able to get along with most of them fairly well. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with an upset child.

good,"I've been working at the Hyatt Place Germantown for two years and I've learned so much and met so many people. We strive on customer service and excel in our scores. I work a second shift and we're usually pretty busy ALWAYS! Our managers make a great team and really do care about their employees. The hardest part of the job is the multi-tasking. We check in, check out, make starbucks, alcoholic beverages, answer phones, and prepare the food. It can be pretty hectic but we are alway fully equipped with staff and our reoccuring guest love us. I've made a few connects with our corporate guest who have opened up doors outside of hospitality for me."

good,"In a typical day at work, I would check all arrivals to be sure there are or aren't any outstanding requests for guests checking in day of. Check-in and check-out guests, make reservations, give tours of the property and provide information about amenities, rates and local attractions. Depending which shift you work you wear a different hat due to the fact we are not a full service hotel. So when it is after hours and someone needs a light bulb changed, new sheets, trash taken out, or even a toilet to be unclogged, we at the front desk would be assisting guests with that. I have learned many things in the years I have worked here. I have learned how to be a much better multi-tasker and problem solver. I think it is easy to do the job when everything run smoothly, but it takes a certain kind of skill set to solve a problem under stressful circumstances. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people from all over the world and most of all, my co-workers. Everyone at the front desk, including management gets along great, feels like family."

Banquets differ from working in a restaurant environment, which has a menu and public clientele. Every day you will find yourself working a variety of events for a variety of guests. The first thing is the preshift with the captain, who goes over the menu, and the specifics of the funtion.

good,One of the largest convention hotels in North America. You work hard and put in long hours but the reward of a successful day/week/year are worth the time you put in. Areas of growth are everywhere and Hyatt promotes a culture of training and preparing managers for their next roll.
good,I had a great work experience there. The field to the job is to improve my life and make it easier for me to make a difference. The secrets are not popular that they are not popular
good,It’s a call center environment but the company really cares about their employees. Training was on going and they really gave you the tools to succeed.  The pay was just okay but there are often other positions you can apply for within the company in order to increase your salary.

It requires detailed knowledge of the hotel meeting facilities, group dynamics, and event details."
good,"Hyatt pier 66 sixty that’s the really place for people come to working with all honors and respects "
good,"Working there as a teenager wasn't so bad. It was mainly heavy work for most of the day as we picked up beach towels and spent many hours in the sun depending on the season. You'll learn how to connect a projector and sound system while setting a projection. There will be outside companies you will assist on the other hand you can be a camp counselor that will take care of kids. One difficult thing during my time working there is having to pick up cement umbrellas and move them around the pool area. Towels will also get heavy once their wet and I definitely had back pains working for most of my time there. I made a lot of people who are still in my life now after five years. Ideally, it gives you a broad idea on how to act and be mature about having an actual hospitality job or having an attitude towards work. Which is working very hard and obliged to the work you do."

good,"-Setting up buffets, plated dinner, or receptions for guests."
good,"Great company to work for.  You're a name not a number.  Plenty of room for advancement.  Hyatt takes time to train all managers and employees to collectively achieve their goal.

good,I loved working for the Hyatt corporation. I was a night supervisor of up to 20 plus employees that were great people. The unexpected passing of my wife required me to take the days shift as a line employee. I also had to take a cut in pay as I was no longer a supervisor. I struggled for two years and there was no advancement in sight so I regrettably was forced to leave and accept another job at another company. I loved working for the Hyatt and in a perfect world I would still be working there. But sometimes life gets in the way.
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar, buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Por ser uma multinacional e um hotel cinco estrelas, a quantidade de coisas a serem feitas no dia era grande, mas por ser um ambiente tão agradável, isso acabava que passando sem a gente perceber."
good,Worked for 14 years and didn't feel like I was paid properly but enjoyed my job.My fellow employees were good and provided great team work to get the specific task
good,"I have been at Spirit Ridge for a year now and I have personally enjoyed seeing how the hotel has grown over the past year.  There was some organizational challenges when I had first arrived as many management positions were vacant or did not exist.  The current management team is working very hard to make this a better place for the staff to work but also a great place for the guests to stay at as well.  Lots of emphasis is being made on making sure the staff have what they need to do their jobs and to do it well.

good,It’s a great place to work but when it’s slow it slow !  And you have to be a people person or you won’t like it . Because you are dealing with people who are paying money to stay at a place and expect the place to be a certain way
good,It was my pleasure to work with the company like Hyatt and i have learn lot of things from the hotel and the owners and the Management is really good and very friendly.

As I would go through my days answering phone calls, replying to emails, giving potential clients tours of the hotel, it felt like time flew by. It was always hard work, but that's what made it worth it. That, and my coworkers. The management staff included, I worked with and for some of the best people I've met in my 27 years on this earth. I would say the hardest part of the job was anytime an unfortunate event happened (i.e. the power going out due to a bad storm). However, this was also one of the best things. When the power went out, and you have 148 rooms that need taking care of, everyone steps in to help. From management staff to kitchen staff, we all did our best to make sure customer satisfaction was met and even exceeded, if possible. You'll never find a harder-working crew than at Hyatt Place Fort Myers at the Forum."

Everyday was always something different since there was always new groups staying at the hotel.  The staff was very fun to work with because they had such great energy and I learned a lot from them.  Management there is very helpful even though they already have enough to deal with themselves.  They are always willing to help and hear people out.  The hardest part of the job was being able to please everyone.  There was always someone who disagreed with something whether it was a guest or an employee.

This could simply start by telling guest about the city of Buffalo to listening to their own stories of where they are from. Of course we also served guest their meals and prepared their drinks. Our main goal was to make sure every guest walked out of the restaurant extremely happy. I've learned many different skills from this establishment including bar-tending and general social skills.

good,I am constantly pushed to improve and learn. They appreciate hard work and help you develope and they recognize someone going above and beyond. They also care for you in times of loss.
good,"Meeting the guests during breakfast or before they check out in the lobby was the first thing with which weekdays would start with. This played crucial role as guests would share their honest feedback and helped in improving the overall services of the hotel. From the sales perspective, there was lot to learn from this morning duty as you would know more about the guest, his or her preferences and the purpose of visit. Negative experiences were shared on priority with the respective departments so that they were worked upon meanwhile appreciations were also not missed. The management was always keen to improve the services keeping in mind the cost at the same time. Hyatt is surely a great place to work as you get the opportunity to work with people from diverse cultures and background and to know them. Regular trainings and especially online modules were really helpful. One of the best benefits about Hyatt is 12 complimentary nights for their associates which assists in maintaining work life balance. And yes the way an employee and his family is treated during these vacations is far more amazing. Another opportunity for sales employees at Hyatt is referral earnings, when an employee cross sells another Hyatt property."
good,Hyatt regency has been an extremely great place to work. The management is willing to work with you in every way possible. So many opportunities to move on up.

good,Great company to work for. Management mostly lets you do your job and if you need help they will step in where needed. Clientele is mostly people that have family in one of the three hospitals across the street. So you have to be aware that it can be a sad place to work sometimes.  We also get the corporate crown that are attending conventions at our hotel. Overall a fun place to work. Busy in the summer a little slow in the winter.

good,"My day starts with a morning nature walk accompanied by resort guests through the nearby cottonwood forest. Followed by a thorough tour of the cultural museum on the resort premises. in between activities, a resort walk-through is in order to greet guests and answer questions. During my time with Hyatt, I have gained much experience providing excellent customer service and information. The managers throughout the resort are all down-to-earth, respectful and easy to approach. They share their knowledge and lend a helping hand when needed. My co-workers are all respectful of one another, as we constantly greet one another just like one big family. If help is needed, they are sure to offer what they can. The hardest part of my job is knowing that I can't personally meet and greet every single person that comes through the resort entrance, but I try. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting people, whether its a first time meeting or a reconnection with guests from past visits. This is the best way to gain customer service experience and I'm sure glad to have gotten the opportunity to work at Hyatt Regency Tamaya."

The management treats all of its employees like a family and you could feel welcome through the smile of your colleagues.

Management always knew how to handle situations the right way and never made you feel excluded or awful if you made mistakes. They were there to work with you in any way and would take the time to help with any problems you were having.  I got along very well with my co workers. We always had each others back and always helped each other out. We were like one big family that cared about one another and wanted to see each other exceed.

The Hyatt is the best company I have ever worked for, and I was so proud to work for them. we were next to the convention center and the bar would get so busy at times, I loved this too. I could feel myself come alive whenever we had a large crowd of people. Had it not been for the recession, I would have never left. Most of the people I worked with had a college education, like me. I liked it, so I found a way to get along with all of my managers and co-workers. Even when I thought things could have been done more fairly, I never complained. Hotel managers tend to come and go, it is not important if one treats you better than another. What's important is that you play nicely at work, because you never know when a subordinate may become your next manager. I learned to see the best in my employer no matter what. I shared this attitude with my coworkers and clients. I learned how pleasurable work could be."
good,"Checking guests in and out of the hotel, making sure all the guest feel welcomed and comfortable immediately after entering the hotel.

My co-workers are the best!! I love working with them, they make work feel like home. The hardest part of my job would have to be closing! We have to go around and refold every piece of clothing in the store.. It's such a hassle on busy days. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to watch a guest leave the store knowing they was completely satisfied."
good,I loved working here! The staff was so friendly and open with everyone. The managers could get a little rude sometimes but other than that they were very sweet. I enjoy going to work everyday knowing I would be around people who also enjoyed their job.

They just provided me with a good set of skills and some more values to live by. Strong management work-life sailed smooth. The hardest part of the job was keeping a good compare for the guests because if only they knew how the disaster process it was to get to the parking structure/park in the structure alone. Put a lot of unnecessary pressure on employees from guests and management. The most enjoyable part was the fact I was working for such a strong union at the time and simply working for the Hyatt corporation."

good,My experience here has been no other.  I look for the bigger picture now.  I have ordered food and supplies.  Checked guests in and out of the hotel.  I have driven the shuttle van.

good,"Knoxville is not a large town, and many celebrities, bands, and athletes would stay at the Hyatt (now the Marriott), and our department (room service) would get to wait on them and often assist with private parties held in their rooms.  Room service was responsible for bringing food and beverage items to guests hotel rooms.  This job really honed my math skills since we had to make change on the spot.  Management expected professionalism but encouraged having a great time at work.  My co-workers were salt of the earth and we all worked together well.  The hardest part of this job was bar tending.  Learning all of the drinks was not my forte.  It was all you could ask for in a job, physical exercise, meeting amazing people, having fun in the back of house, and the pay was outstanding."

El director es muy accesible con el personal del departamento  y muy comprometido, el personal aveses se porta un poco fuera de lugar, pero solo en algunos casos. La mayor prte de las personas son muy amigables y dispuestas a enseñar al personal nuevo. lo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es que no trabajamos todos los días bajo extrema presión aunque esto n significa que no pueda trabajar asi."

Everyone helped when it became busy in the restaurant or hotel. My co-workers were the hardest working people I have ever worked with and if I needed anything from them, they always went out of there way to help me, as I would for them. The hardest part of my job was making sure that when the Health Dept. came in, we scored 100. I was good at this.

We try to make change in lives of those we ''touch'' every day. We do not simply surve the food, but we try to make people happy. During my work in The Cafe i really learnt much. First of all i learnt how to work in a multicultural team, i gained skills in handeling different  difficult situations, solving unexpected difficulties and facing challenges. The management in my working place is built in the most efficient way, that contributes not only to succesfull operation but also to a creation of comfortable working environment, helps the employees to learn and develop themselves.My team turned to be very friendly and helpful. They helped me a lot in the very beginning of my work, when i was so new in the place, and had much to learn. One of the biggest challenges i face in my current position is organazing my time. It is indeed becomes hard sometimes to decide which thing should be done first when it gets really busy. But day by day i learn more and more, and I am pretty sure that soon I will do it more easily. The most enjoyable part of my job is the live communication with people: the guests, as the co-workers. I find it really interesting to communicate with guests. It is very amazing to meet new people every day, and see that with your efficient work you make them happy. Also i really like my team, and no matter how hard the work gets sometimes, we still have fun."

They also keep me informed when on new things. The hard part is time management in a room. You only have some many minutes to spend in each room.
