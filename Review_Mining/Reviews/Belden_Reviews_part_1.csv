rating,review
bad,"The culture was toxic.  Only focus was onmonthly results and threats of termination when results were missed.  Very short term focused, expected immediate fixes to long-term problems."
bad,Very poor management and hourly pay do not like to give annual raises and if they do is only 2 percent .i would not recommend that anyone take a job ther unless they are in a bind and really needs a job
bad,als vrouw zijnde en je  doet je werk  word je toch even goed met je nek soms aan gekeken door je colegas om dat je een vrouw bent en in hun ogen is het  heren werk dus
bad,"As if the low pay and managements ""get it or get out"" attitude weren't bad enough, the total lack of ethics on the part of management sent me over the edge of seeking new employment after about 16 months. "
bad,Sometimes it can be stressful To run machines Theres great people that work there When we get bad parts for the machines When its time to go home
bad,"The company boasted a long established culture. In reality it was the worse run company I had ever worked for. Management was a revolving door, no lean culture, people are worked long hours, dangerous conditions, millions of dollars annually to scrap and mis production."
bad,"Customers and Employees be damed....Total shareholder focus. Lack of support from management. They only care about Sales Force customer relationship management software updates and metrics. Inordinate amount of time spent in meetings giving management the same updates that were just entered into CRM."
bad,Overall it was bad in just about every aspect.
bad,"I was housekeeping at the mall. I didn't learn much from this job. I mostly cleaned the food court and bathrooms. My manager was nonprofessional and he made my work enjoyable. I felt very stressed every time I came to work, like i could do nothing right."
bad,Lack of morale. My department is full of high school drama. Management plays favorites and makes it clear if you are not by focusing on the negatives.
bad,The people i work with are good people. The bunch that run the copany do alot of stuff that leds me to beleive they are not at all faimily orenated
bad,"It wasn't about what you knew, it was about who you knew."
bad,"Belden Inc is in the business of buying businesses, outsourcing the work to overseas locations, and then closing the factories down."
good,"If you're looking for supervisors to lie to you, pick favorites, force you to work 6 out of 7 days a week, make you feel not so good about your work, constant supervision changing you'll love the place, you enter as a temp, and kept as a temp over a year working close to a lot of holidays. Constantly on you about breaks and not taking to long. They dont care about your life outside of work."
good,It's an ok place to work. Laid back as long as you keep yourself busy they won't bother you. They always have work and rarely ever slow down. You will be working alot
good,This place has some issues when it comes to promoting minorities. They would rather hold you back from growing. I worked many long hard hours for the company and was left out to dry in the end.
good,This is a good company that start out at. I would say this is a good first step to start a career in the fabrication industry. Other people it talked to that worked there in the past called it a  “revolving door company” because a lot of people will start and leave in a short amount of time. But overall it is not too bad to work there
good,"Hard work, steady work, position moved to mexico"
good,Trabajo rudimentario pero con los equipos de seguridad necesarios ademas de un buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,Temporary work has yet to be rewarding for me of late because there is never a place for advancement and pay never changes no matter how much experience I have accumulated.
good,"En esta empresa exsite un buen ambiente, en casos administrativos o de control hay un poco de desorden pero ya se esta resolviendo. En los tiempos de descanzo no existe un horario muy restinguido ya que se fabrica cable, no es por piezas es po pies por lo tanto no es tan indispensable que el operador sea como una maquina."
good,los turnos eran de 12 hrs. pero el trabajo era sencillo.
good,I was an extruder operator for 2 years. I didn't work for belden I worked thru manpower. And if you're looking to get hired on forget about it. I know many people who worked there for 3+ years thru the temp service. Never missed a day and was never late. Use you until they don't need you anymore.
good,"it was a good company to work for when i first got there. But it was going through hard times and phasing out the older management and employees, cutting wages and benefits. I was only forklift mechanic, also in charge of cleaaning and maintaining all of building, All audits and repairs of sprinkler system, gauges and valves."
good,"It was a good job overall, and the defining factors came down to management. When I started it was great, the manager was positive and motivated. A bit unorganized until I took the role of assistant manager and together we were a great team. When he left a year later, and was replaced, the entire team slowly left due to the poor management skills of the next manager. I also stepped down my position, which also led to me leaving the company a few months later."
good,"I worked at Belden's Richmond, IN office and it was a really great group of people, around the world. Corporate leadership seemed far-away, though. I was lucky to be plugged in to the global company, most are only focused on their region."
good,"Amazing place to work , i really recommend people to apply and work there. it is what you make out of your job, the harder you work , the better are your chances of advancing in this company."
good,"es una  empresa  donde  se  puede  trabajar y  aprender  muchas  cosas , ya  que que  utilizan un sistema  de  kaisens  y KPI muy  bueno,  solo  que  el slario es muy  bajo "
good,buena empresa pero pocas oportunidades de subir de puesto.falta mas entrenamiento personalisado por operadores con gran experiencia
good,"Belden es una empresa que a estado creciendo y tiene un gran equipo, sin embargo aun falta mejorar pero lo hace cada dia y es bueno reclutar a gente con talento para tener un mayor avance."
good,"Public company striving to make the numbers look as good as possible. A continuous cycle of loose budget then tightening, including sudden lay-offs. Company evolving and changing its identity to include more than cable."
good,"1) Every morning provide data for updating plant metrics, 2) review and dispostion customer returns and disposition product, 3) When needed address root cause and corrective action measures, 4) monitor in process quality "
good,Buen ambiente y personal laboral. Comedor limpio y siempre ven por el empleado.
good,Belden Company is a wonderful place to work. They treat you like family. I would absolutely recommend anyone to work for Belden Company if they were given the opportunity.
good,Great location in Horsheads NY. Employees have been there for over 10 + years and alot of experience within the building. Going to be very sad when the facility closes at the end of 2013. Going to miss everyone I have work with for all these years when I was there before and when I came back.
good,"This company offer support to all employees and will allow them to take time off as needed or a scheduled on the vacation calendar. The company likes to use temp services to find the right talent to permanently hire into open positions, and will promote within the company before hiring outside the company."
good,Overseen all internal audits of the facility.  Planned internal audits and reported findings in corrected actions and opportunity for improvements to responsible managers.  Maintained all ISO documentation. Trained and supported all Internal Auditors at facility
good,"Belden has been a great place to work, really nice people here."
good,Belden is a great company to work for.  The work environment is fast  paced but enjoyable.  Everyday represents new experiences and new challenges as the wire and cable industry is constantly changing.
good,Brindan un buen area de trabajo y capacitacion ademas de los servicios que proporciona la empresa son de gran ayuda.
good,我是Belden EURO 在中国招聘的唯一一名管理亚太OEM供应商的员工，在Belden EURO工作近9年，很喜欢这种人性化的管理，老板只care 与所有供应商的技术交流顺畅，所有产品出货之前品质都有抽检确认，我基本都把可能的品质问题在出货前都给keep在工厂。除此之外有比较大的发挥空间。只是，由于我个人职位比较特殊，Belden EURO在亚太只需要这样一位产品认证工程师，所以，9年来我一直保持这样的职位。公司团队协作友好，气氛融洽。
