bad,"This job has been hectic from the beginning and it’s in a constant downwards spiral. Management is terrible. You have no clear job description and no understanding of what type of patients you’re going to encounter on a day to day basis. It’s like a psych ward, rehab, nursing home, and skilled nursing all in one. They make and change rules constantly. They allow people   to be bullied and harassed. From the charge nurse to the nursing supervisors, the communication skills are subpar at best. We’re ALWAYS understaffed and they’ll appreciate and acknowledge the work of the slackers before they even attempt to say good job to those who actually care about the patients and their work. You go through 12 hours of labor, constantly on your feet for pennies and dimes basically. I stayed for as long because I do love helping people but with so much drama, lack of staff, no recognition, etc. I’ll be sitting this one out for sure. Soon."
bad,Interviews was very unprofessional. Staff was in a click and not friendly at all. Had to yell as if you was at a party to be heard by the interviewer and keep repeating yourself. It was like a party you knew you wasn’t welcomed at. Very uncomfortable environment.
bad,This company is not a pleasant company to work for. The management deletes legitimate worked hours without your knowledge. The facilities the company provides therapies to are no longer willing to refer. There are no set ground rules and when they apply the rules it’s to their benefit. They treat their employees very unfairly and they do not stand by their motto as  “A Better Way to Care.”
bad,Very unhealthy work environment. Never positive reinforcement from management. Staff unsure since buy out and work for hours not compensated. No support from management when on call.
bad,"I would not recommend working here to anyone, nor admitting a family or friend as a patient.  There is no culture of trust, respect, or support from the management/leadership team."
bad,"I loved the clinical staff, it was an honor to work with them   I enjoyed the work -the pay was ok   On the down side,  I felt unappreciated and under valued by management almost every day.  With it being a very small office, it was all but impossible to avoid office drama   I loved what the company stood for, but I did not like the negative office environment"
bad,That employees welfare dont matter.The director awful.She micromanages .Policy not followed at all although it spell out clearly processes and procedures.
bad,I worked PRN approximately 4 shifts per pay period for about 18 months. It was all I could take. They are very understaffed and constantly pull from other areas. You never know when you might be pulled and sometimes it is after you take report and you go to another area to take report again! You are behind the rest of the shift. The nursing assistants do what they want and they allow it! Never in my 15 year career have I been told that nursing assistants were part of a team and we are equal??? I did not go to college to be a nursing assistant. I can do their job but they absolutely cannot do mine. My opinion find a different place to work!
bad,Horrible company to work for.  They are liars and backstabbing.  Higher ups are prejudice.  Only one black director in the state of MS.  The rules for Caucasian are different than the rules for African Americans If you have more education than higher up you will lose your job.  The administrator and avp for the flowood area are liars.  You lose your paid time off if you quit. run run run from this company
bad,"I worked for this company in the home health area and they set you up to fail. They will report your license to the board while they offer no help, guidance or assistance for anything you need.  Their benefit sucks while their stocks are so high in the market.  They do not care for their employees with the stupid UMR which is under United health care that they offer as their health plan. Burnout will happen quickly and  they are just concerned on numbers of patients that take on. They do not actually care in providing patients needs. The negative reviews on this board are actually true and wish i read hem earlier."
bad,"I was lied to upon employment, they do NOT care about their employees only the patients. They expect cnas to handle 16+ patients, the nurses do not help at all. The job security is non existant because they fire good people over whatever a patient said, whether they are in the right frame of mind or not. Cnas get $11"
bad,"When I worked there it was extremely difficult work. They would require lots of patient lifting, toileting and assignments could be up to 17 patients. I do not recommend working there"
bad,Hated for years don’t know How to treat there nursing tech need to pay more and hr job to much of a physical poor management patient are horrible due to what encompass tell them to get them in just a mess stay away
bad,"I wouldn’t send my love ones here or ever recommend anyone to work here, supervisor always defending nurses firing you for the he said she said rumors. Always short staff and WORK you for a low pay ! Leave you there with 15+ patients alone !"
bad,"Worst place to work for between their scheduling and horrible insurance, it was a waste of time. They don’t follow their mission and are more concerned with what looks good on paper than actually taking care of the patients"
bad,The CNO is a very passive aggressive person that is not personable at all. She will not say hello to her staff or acknowledge them. She spends her entire day in her office gossiping about staff members with her small tight group of peers. She does not practice or follow the organization policies or philosophies and does not adhere to the mission. She will back stab you and throw you under he bus to save her own backside. The new CEO from Texas came in acting like he was going to change everything and improve things but he is just another corporate puppet !! No backbone at all !! This place has huge potential if they would only get rid of the CNO first and foremost and get someone in there that truly cares about the staff and the patients.
bad,"You are over worked  under paid and at times they will belittle you.  There are some LAZY nurses and the administration is down right rude especially the DON and CEO. They make up rules and will lie to your face and say thats the company policy. They are very short staffed, you can have anywhere from 8-21 pts which is unsafe for staff and patients. When you voice your concerns you are told ""A patient is a patient just be lucky you have one to take care of""."
bad,"The company has no loyalty to its employees, you can dedicate yourself to them, but it doesn't matter!!! If your not managements favorite employee your screwed!!"
bad,"Management is inexperienced, pay is not fair among employees. There is no rhyme or reason as to why they pay anyone what they do, its the luck of the draw."
bad,RN case managers have 20+ on caseload.  2 to 4 days of on call. Expected to do admits on top of large case load. Scheduled to see 10 patients in a day. Supervisor has no experience.  DON nor director help.
bad,"Morale is low, boss needs to retire. Census seems low all the time with many job frustrations. Pay is low compared to other home health agencies. Only working here until something else comes up."
bad,"Hospice is one of the most delicate services that can be delivered to the elderly. Somehow, Encompass takes this beautiful gift and focuses on how to monetize it. Yes, it is a business but the way people are viewed and recruited to enroll on service with this company is sick. The staff has high turnover, the leadership is toxic, and the meetings are simply place holders to pass the time. Would not recommend to work for or use for their services."
bad,I would not work for this company ever again.  They don't appreciate their employees skills.  They don't listen to employee concerns.  I didn't feel a part of the team.
bad,I thought it was so nice till you see the big boss man with 3 executives in short dresses everyday and low cut shirts bossing around nurses like cattle!  I saw more cleavage than care!
bad,"Terrible place, you will leave this place physically, mentally draining. I would not recommend working here. They don’t care about there employees. Only money"
bad,Alot of favoritism nurse manger and cno does come in to help when short staff. They allow you to work with more pts then allowed & ALOT OF TOTAL CARE.
bad,No communication between office staff and field workers in the Bogalusa LA office. New management was not a hospice nurse and the management did not provide continuous care with dying pts
bad,Do not work here . Poor management company wide . Horrible co-workers . Very obvious all they care about is making the companies wallet fatter . Horrible patient care . Might as well work for a nursing home where is get better pay .
bad,False pretences upon hire. They make a lot of promises and keep none. Management don't even acknowledge you if your not a nurse or higher. Worked there for a year and still was not acknowledged.
bad,Just dont work here I seen the most disturbing things in this company. Alot of bad changes 3 different CEOs in the past 5 years. Workers are treated like awful force out the door. Always low on staff it seems like they never have enough supervisors on the floors.
bad,Not worth working there 1 mexican girl in housekeeping will discriminate again you if you are another race. Not worth the effort in working there. Only good thing is the pay
bad,"There is a lot of favoritism here with management and supervisors. They give the easy patient assignments to people they like and give the heavy load to new people or people they don't like. The rate of pay is horrible for the job that does the most physical work, besides the physical therapists. Just a place with too much favoritism & unprofessional management."
bad,"Respiratory Care management is lacking, I worked 2 days with HR and 3 days doing computer work and new employee training and the manager placed me on the schedule to work alone with no formal training with how the hospital works or where everything is. I would not recommend this facility if you value your Respiratory Care License. I told the manager multiple time I was uncomfortable and he told me I had to work it."
bad,Ratio of patients to nurses and techs in NOT safe. Workload is not safe and patients and employees suffer. When hurt at work management treat employees horrible.
bad,"Company promotes bullies, saw many great staff leave due to poor management from upper level. Area management supportive and clinically appropriate, Florida team manger non clinical, often bullying to field staff."
bad,"Yea you get PTO time but unless you tell them they will use it when they see fit. Management is very disrespectful, other nurses and techs have no respect to other co workers the amount of nurses that are lazy is unreal. I’ve never seen patients call for pain medicine and nurses take 30-45 minutes to deliver it when they are doing nothing at all. The people who have been there a while get babied and yet new employees get treated like scum. The patient to tech ratio is too high."
bad,The management team was terrible. The maintenance was even worse the educator knew it all and I had no personality towards anyone. But the nurses work toward long with the dietary staff.
bad,Multiple turn over with directors. Office staff horrible to work with everybody knows what is in your profit chart and will tell everybody else.  Run!
bad,"I worked there for almost 10 yrs. The turn over rate is very high. The nurse manager is not qualified to be in that position. Race played a huge role in that. As did race play a big role in many other factors working there. I personally worked very hard and my patients doctors and therapist enjoyed working with me. There were some very lazy nurses that would never help, and bully you. I had health issues and they were well aware of them, it was there at work when i fell ill and i was sent to the Er by them. When asked about it again for unemployment the nurse manager lied. Alabama is a right to work state. It was very sad that this company that i had worked for for nearly 10 yrs would block me from unemployment. The patients loved me as well as the doctors. But it goes to show that when they put people in positions that they should not be in no justice or fairness is there. I would never want to be a patient here. Many of my  coworkers have said the same. And would not recommend family or loved ones to go there. Again it is really sad that a place that i held close to my heart and a job that i was excellent at, does not care about their employees one bit. The management there is some of the most pathetic that i have ever encountered. Dont take my word for it. Ask any of the employees. I never thought i would be bullied at work as an adult, or see such racial, social, and economic prejudice. Sad Sad Sad"
bad,Don’t work here. Management Is terrible. They are all about money. No teamwork. Severely Understaffed and treat employees like slaves. They can’t even keep a Doctor on staff because of the management.
bad,Expect to be treated as if you're disposable while you juggle patient ratios of 1-12 on average with increased acuity and poor leadership. Management will watch you fail from the chairs in their offices. They have an extremely high turnover rate and can no longer keep employees. Prepare to work with mostly contract nurses/techs.
bad,"Seven days total. No more after that point. Was told not a good fit. "
bad,"I liked the job opportunity. It was great pay but no real hours. The lowest I have ever had, no chance to work here and have a real way to pay your bills."
bad,they have great benefits at this company. the nurses and cna are very nice. the place is really pretty and big. do your job and you should be fine. thank you
bad,"The Encompass-Woodlands Branch is the most unorganized, unstructured, and understaffed hospices I worked for. The RNCM are now managing 15-20 patients each when the norm is 10-12. This has caused us nurses to work way outside of our 8 hour window. We are required to be on call at night which entails us working  8 hours that day from 8am-5pm, then being Oncall after hours from 5pm to 8 am the next day for any other visits that were missed during the day, potential admissions, emergencies, and or deaths. The marketing/sales team are ridiculously too involved in patients care. They add more fluff to make the patient look appropriate, make unreasonable promises to family, and constantly place blame on the staff when something goes wrong in one of their sales communities. If we don’t admit a patient based on them meeting hospice criteria, then they request we send another nurse out to reevaluate and admit.  They don’t care if we have the staff to provide for them or not. All that matters is their sales goal. We seen so many patients revoke/transfer due to unfilled promises, and lack of staffing resulting in missed visits. The employee turnover rate is very high. The office Nursing staff is not supportive. We are bombarded with nasty emails, text messages, and phone calls. Oh and don’t take a sick day off because the job has affected your mental and physical health; you are then ridiculed for taking care of yourself and not the patients. "
bad,"Nursing management is very poor. Current CNO and nursing supervisor had no experience in either position when placed in their current roles. Short staffed everyday due to call ins or scheduled did not schedule enough staff. Management expects you to handle 7, 8 or 9 patients and not take acuity into account. Patients are more med-surg and anymore it feels like a nursing home or respite care and some of the patients are not even appropriate.  At times the equipment we need to perform certain task does not work and then the CNO gets mad when we ask her to “fix” it.  Nurse techs are lazy and hide so they don’t have to answer call lights. The nursing supervisor does not help out on the floor. We are not shown ANY appreciation at all. Pay raises were nonexistent this year for some except for a few favorites.  This place is out of control.  DO NOT WORK HERE. YOU WILL BE PUTTING YOUR LICENSE AT RISK!!!!"
bad,"DON stated grt opportunities if no work in sherman we will put u in motel and work u in fort worth or another are. None of which is true..Left job and told by DON would get good reviews for a future job. d"
bad,"Poor Management was a huge issue in this facility. The company is now called Spire, and I sure hope things have changed since it is under new management."
bad,Healthsouth had a high patient to nurse ratio and poor leadership. Staff turnover was oftern and included high senior leadership turnover. Insubordination of CNAs was frequent.
bad,I was housekeeper there and the housekeeping  supervisor she was messy always watching you making up lies on workers she is a poorly supervisor I would send nobody to that job you wouldn’t last long and the hr people never had things straighting out and the housekeeping supervisor picks with everybody
bad,I got this job through an agency. I was there for three weeks and then got fired by my recruiter because they apparently thought that I wasn’t catching on after THREE WEEKS. There is a lot to learn and I was learning something new every day. The CBO is a joke and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. The turn over rate is absolutely terrible.
bad,"So I had an interview with this place, went well. Shadowed someone (didnt get paid for this) and then didn't hear anything! Called multiple times with no response!! Really have someone think they have a job then nothing. Unprofessional "
bad,"Management was terrible. Very cut throat and management was very nice to your face but horrible behind your back. Very clicking type atmosphere and if you're not ""in"" on the circle, you never will be."
bad,"Focused on their employees and their job advancement."
bad,"Just a poorly ran company. Never received my company vehicle as promised, poor management that appeared overwhelmed all the time, and my territory kept expanding without receiving additional staff. Bottom line, the company was a sinking ship with no one at the helm. I've never seen worse overall morale in a company."
bad,"I transferred from the Corpus office to the Houston area on 529. I questioned management in corpus about my salary, they got extremely mad because I went to HR on them and they set me up with the current management in Houston once I moved up here!"
bad,Poor management. Very hard to advance. Pay rates are horrible and unfair. Some nurses make less than others with equal amount of experience. Schedule is constantly changing and management won't accommodate. Constantly working short staffed.
bad,I have never worked for this company. I was a student doing an internship when I was located at this facility.  So therefore I cant rate it at this time.  Sorry
bad,"There was an issue with harassment from a client's family member and the company managers didn't handle the individual, so I quit. Very low paying with no benefits or advancement."
bad,Management is awful! Staffing is horrible. They only care about profits and patient satisfaction. They don’t value employees. Don’t waste your time with this company.
bad,Encompass (formerly Healthsouth) only cares about profits. Patient care and employee satisfaction are not a priority.  Management staff is rude and uncaring. They expect you to do more with less. Nurse: patient ratio is often 9:1 on days and 12:1 on nights.
bad,"They made you sign an agreement saying you would work 2 weekends a month, not including your normal work week. I once worked 15 days in a row and had to ask for a day off! Over all, they didn't seem to care about their nurses, and the office staff seemed clickish."
bad,Poor communication among managers and directors.  The territory is over saturated with your own coworkers and this causes a lot of internal negativity and hostility.
bad,"The director thinks like a lawyer, Always covering himself making sure he has no part of any wrongdoings saying one thing to come in if you’re on call but yet if you don’t get called in lunch in the coming of weather conditions want you to watch the weather 24 seven want you to order parts like a supervisor but yet if you order wrong parts you’re at fault 100% You Must Be There And Do Everything For The Director of facilities"
bad,"No growth you will ruin your body they dont care supervisor is messy and chief of nursing two face they don't have consistent work they will run you in the ground  trust know one there everyone in that building is,sneaky they tell lies to get you in there"
bad,The job is very high stress with little managerial support and decisions based on profits not patient care. No support for work/life balance from management.
bad,Unorganized rude careless unprofessional poor pay overworked messy environment nothing is confidential they treat staff poorly stressfull job. Dysfunctional team of people
bad,"The facility is so focused with profit and numbers. They don’t care about their employees. The pay is not competitive. Staff are working so hard but not well compensated. "
bad,"I feel that some employees get away with to much and the rules only apply TO SOME EMPLOYEES and certain employees jobs is harder then it have to be. ""DRAMA"" I was a new employee and hurd more gossip about the previous employee for which the job i was hired for. All I can say is"" 2 FACE PEOPLE"" GLAD I WALKED OUT!"
bad,"very very stressful; always getting low censused or you work under-staffed, there is no middle ground; rude lazy nurses; they really don't care about the quality of their employees, only that they are a warm body in the building when they want it; they have no qualms about calling you off or sending you home early and you not getting your hours in to get a full paycheck, but if you have to not come in to work because of a sick child or whatever, you'll definitely hear about it; doctor's excuses tend to ""disappear"" around there"
bad,"This is THE WORST company I have ever worked for, and management only cares about profit. If you value your nursing license FAIR WARNING DO NOT WORK HERE. You will put your license in jeopardy with the unsafe patient ratios. Their quality of care is subpar, Please read patient reviews online to see for yourself! Patients are left to lie in their own feces and urine. I wouldn't even put my dog in this facility. This place is full of vindictive liars (aka management). There is an unrealistic expectation to take care of 7-9 very sick patients at a time. Seriously, DO NOT work here if you value your nursing license. Awful, awful terrible place to work. Research the Medicare Customer reviews online and see for yourself. Fair warning. Do not believe anything you are told in the interview because it is a lie."
bad,Poor leadership drama poor team work doesn't care for patients all about money poor communication between staff and managers shows  favoritism to  certain employees
bad,"Was hired at Virginia Beach office as a full time LPN in the Chesapeake area.  I never received full time hours or worked in the remote area that I was promised per pre hire agreement.  The Branch manager is nasty and so is the office staff, especially the CFSS just sit behind the computer and use emails as bullying tactics.  Management is horrible and so is the orientation and pay."
bad,All of the HealthSouth's closed due to the owner embezzling money.  I found out the HealthSouth was in financial trouble and resigned.  I accepted another job at a local hospital. I heard later that some people who stayed were having their paychecks bounce.
bad,"Healthsouth was the worst place I worked at. It was not the employees that made it a bad environment, it was the CEO, HR, Payroll, etc. Extremely unfriendly, they treated their employees unfair, and there was so much drama. Everyone is underpaid, the benefits were awful, and there was no room for growth. The census was always low, so staff was constantly being cancelled. The nurse manager had no idea what she was doing, and they went through so many CNOs. There is no organization. The women in payroll would change peoples timecards without speaking to the employee about it. The CEO would make you feel like an idiot. He was unfriendly and made it extremely uncomfortable."
bad,"If you are looking for sub acute experience as an LPN, do not try here. They will treat you so different and make you feel useless. dreaded going to work every morning. Administration are ready to fire you no matter the circumstances."
bad,"Huge employee turnover, laying off nurses to prn or complete discharge, office staff is disorganized and rude to field staff. Work load is very unbalanced. EMR is difficult to deal with."
bad,"Very fast paced environment, patients come into hospital with many chronic health issues, and the workplace culture is extremely hostile and toxic, the most enjoyable thing about this job was seeing a person come in so very ill and leaving the facility many weeks later with a new found sense of hope and wellness, due to the therapy staff they do excellent work with the many different types of patients who come and seek help from them, great therapy group at Healthsouth"
bad,"Over worked under paid, No respect !"
bad,"No direction and very disorganized. They push Productiviry above EVERYTHING else! Too much money put into advertising and not enough into developing upper management to train them to be more competent and inspiring. "
bad,Worst place to work for Management has favorites and when there is a problem it is never resolved unless you are friends with the manager. This hospital working conditions is very hostile and harassing. This is not a professional work environment
bad,Terrible company! Health south ruined cardinal hill! They are all about the money and care nothing about their employees. If you're sick they will write you up in a second. Like you could have the flu and they wouldn't care. Management is so horrible. They will pick favorites and fire the good ones. The management on the stroke unit is the worst! And the cafeteria is a joke. An aide could easily get stuck with 13 or more patients because they will call off staff to save money. Employees will then get in trouble for not documenting properly. They put there employees under so much stress and are surprised when a patient falls. You never get praised from management. It's only negative no matter how hard you work. Very toxic work environment and place.
bad,"Management treats their nurses badly. Worst nursing job I've ever had. The fact that they are offering a sign on bonus should be the first sign that they can not keep their nurses. Save yourself the stress and find a company that values their employees. Nurse/patient ratio is dangerous, workload is overwhelming. Management takes a punative approach rather than creating a teaching enviornment. Nurses are always WRONG! CEO who is not a nurse, makes decisions that potentially puts our nursing license at risk! If the nurse manager dislikes you, she will purposely mess with your schedule. Nurses beware!"
bad,"Very unorganized , flaky management, pay was poor and benefits nonexistent . Seemed more like a temp job ... Very high turn over and office culture was hostile ."
bad,"Do not be fooled! This company bought out a Hopice with a fantastic reputation and now is dragging themselves, employees and patients through the mud. Do not work here!!"
bad,"They want you to work more hours, but all new hires get paid more than you do. The administration covers for themselves and each other. So if one of them doesn't like you, then they are all out to get you. Their documentation is not compliant and they allow back dating, by pretending it isn't happening. It's a really terrible place to work."
bad,"Management is more concern about social gatherings and status than helping their teams be successful.  Unfortunately management is not driven to making the employees successful.  It is easier to burn out staff and rehire.  The work is fairly routine but not fulfilling.  Ideas to improve the program are not considered.  This is a ""good ol boys club"" and they seem antiquated and rigid."
bad,I gave baths and took patients. Did vitals and took care patients For 7 pm to 7am Three days a week. IT was rehab places. Nice place to work.
bad,"Worked in the corporate office.  Very old school, good-ole-boy atmosphere, has not changed management attitude in all these years.  CEO and Vice Presidents are all arrogant and women are beneath them.  Women are treated like it was 1950 again and as if they don't have minds.  If you like to get food, clean, get coffee, working in the corporate office is for you."
bad,"Exhausting, and unrealistic!  Playing of the favorites.  Unbearable patient loads and safety concerns.  Terrible food and rude ancillary staff.  The Right never knew what the left was doing."
bad,I worked for this company for 3 years they do not care about there employees Nurses are lazy and the Techs are over worked I could be running around with 5 bed alarms going off and not once would a nurse go check the bed alarm the DNO was the fakest she never followed through with what she said she would do talking to her or anyone in hire management was like talking in circles you got no where couldn't get away from this place fast enough
bad,"From day one I was told about how short staffed the entire company was (they have acquired many smaller companies and had many mergers) and how stressed and busy upper management was.  If you are someone who enjoys working 50-60 hours a week this is the job for you!! If you want to try to have healthy boundaries, stay away.  "
bad,"Its all about the money"
bad,I worked there for a year and a half I got treated bad and they do not care about their employees or patients . I actually hear they higher up management say they only care about the insurance money and not their patients. They do not care about anyone but their selves. I had to get out of there. Health south has no idea what they are doing they can not keep any patients or employees and good luck trying to get hours.
bad,"This is the worst job I have had as a physical therapist. The office staff is unprofessional and immature, while being borderline unethical. The pts are constantly going on hold, and there is poor communication between the office and the pts. There is no compassion or caring for the pts, it is all about the numbers and the money for this company."
bad,Lost medical insurance the day I was terminated.....Last check was less than half what was expected.....Schedule changes without warning or input......United healthcare insurance not accepted by most providers...No gas or milage reimbursement.....Documentation had to be faxed and mailed at employee expense and less than 24 hours after your shift or pay was held 2 weeks.....Training not paid at 100% regular pay......Lowest pay per hour in my 12+ years as an rn....2 Hour on job orientation with first client.....Very bad experience overall
bad,"Too many patients assigned per nurse. I learned that I should refuse an assignment if I think it will be too bad, and that is my right as a nurse. The management was vicious and bullied the nurses, co-workers also bullied each other."
bad,"Upper sales management is a running joke. The RVP is condescending, emotional, back stabbing, gossiping and grossly unqualified. The Dallas management team is equally as useless. Please run from this company. They will promise you the moon, and deliver nothing. The offer to solutions, insight, training or qualified upper management."
bad,"From the sales RVP up, the management team is clueless. This is the worst company I've ever worked for and was honored the day I resigned from this miserable company."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job. It could have been ran a lot smoother, workers were rude to patients and so were management. I do not recommend anyone take a loved one there."
bad,Don't do it. Dangerous staffing and disrespectful managment. No regard to patients safety. Ridiculous staffing radios and fast turnover of staff. Staff will go to lunch and never return. This happened about once each month.Review CEO and you will understand the legal history of this shady company.
bad,"HealthSouth in Memphis, TN is liable for the deaths of multiple patients, and disregarding my advice. It's a horrible place to work, the staff is basically incompetent, but not nearly so much as the CEO. If you're a patient or a medical professional, avoid this place at all costs! They've killed more than one person with their stupidity."
bad,"When I worked there, the environment was terrible- very cutthroat."
bad,Its Horrible. Co Workers don't Help.Management Sucks. I don't enjoy any of it. typical day at work consists of being angry all the time.
bad,"Management is sneaky, unfair, and conniving. They have favorites and the RULES doesn't apply to them. It is really sad that the company has people in superior positions who are racist and treat employees unfairly in 2016...sad."
bad,"New grads, they will train you with their software for about 2 - 3 weeks and then you will be with a preceptor for about 5 to 8 days AND THATS IT! After that you have to defend yourself.  I was there for 1 LONG YEAR until I completed my BSN and it was hard for me to get to a hospital setting because they are also not recognized as an acute care facility.  There is NO CULTURAL DIVERSITY and you are not going to fit in UNLESS YOU ARE CUBAN AND SPEAK SPANISH. The nurses speak in Spanish while in the nurses stations and while being in the patient's room with patients who do not even speak Spanish. THE NURSES WILL EAT YOU HERE. After the administration changed in 2015 it has gone downhill even more.  As a full time RN I was working more than 3 days per week with 9 - 10 patients each time and an admission.  The patient care technicians (who are called RNTs) are overwhelmed with 10 - 15 full care patients.  Management is horrible and so are most of the supervisors.  Just don't even bother applying here."
bad,"If somone would have told me about the company a year ago, I would never can here the CNOand CEO has no clue of how to treat the employee less compassion for there staff, staff turnover very high, paid is low consisting the amount of work you do.If you are a Rehab tech you might receive more patient then you can handle, Its like working in a nursing home not a Rehab. The name should be Hellsouth not Healthsouth"
bad,I worked in the patient homes to provide direct patient care and education on their disease processes.  It was a pleasurable experience.
bad,"I have never worked for a company and dealt with a more disrespectful, unprofessional group of woman.  Management uses fear to manage staff. Unsafe working conditions. Nurse to patient ratio is dangerous. Hardest part of job is heavy and unsafe patient load, heavy medication pass and trying to stay within the limits of company policy. Lower management contributes to low moral of nursing staff. People frequently quit and turn over is high.The culture within this company is horrible. The CNO and Supervisors are like school yard bullies. I would not remind this place to anyone."
bad,"I would clock in get report from a Tech and do my rounds. I learned that teamwork is very important in a setting such as that. Management is very confused. My co-workers were the best they were like family and we knew how to pull together and get the job done,. When you work in healthcare any aspect can  be difficult but when you do not have the support of upper management can make it that more difficult. The most enjoyable  part of the job are the patients meeting and talking with them on a daily basis."
bad,"Enjoyed this job, husband relocated. learned a lot regarding inpatient rehab."
bad,"Most enjoyable-the patients."
bad,"This company was not fair and sometimes did not follow proper procedures. They claim to care about their employees, but they don't."
bad,"I was employed at this company for 4 years and loved the company. At first the office environment was very friendly and was an enjoyment to be a part of. After the change in management shortly after a year, the branch took a different turn and became focused not on the patients or employees but on company profit. Another major change  in management brought on a more demanding atmosphere with little to no regard for how expectations was accomplished both by field staff or office staff. Concerns and complaints fell on deaf  ears or you  had to endure the story of how much the Assistant Administrator  was over worked and sacrifices she had made and why your complaint was not justified up next to hers. It was frequently said if you do not like it find another job. Advancement  in job position was   allowed with little to no support or education to perform the job. When overwhelmed  you was left on your on to work it out or was give the feeling you were less than adequate to do the job.  If felt by this manager you could not do the job  you immediately became very unimportant on her scale of employees she wanted to keep. Allegations against you was never handled in a way to make you feel  you had  a right to defend yourself. Most employees that left on a bad note was turned into the Board for one reason or another, If trying to transfer and you was not liked a call was made to the office  and negative information shared to prevent your transfer,  I  went from one management position to another  but was then told I would be doing another job for less pay and I could like it  or would"
bad,Worked with peds/pulm patients. Learned a lot about resp patients and vent care.
bad,"The Pueblo branch was absolutely the best when I started in 2013. However once that Branch Manager promoted, and the Colo Springs Manager took over the Pueblo Branch the culture spiraled the drain. She is an angry, untrustworthy, demeaning person. The training was poor, the expectations were very high, she constantly complains about others in the company, the rules changed depending on her mood. Beware nurses, you won't be informed when hired that you will be expected to work a 12 day stretch each month, you will be told that you can use PDO but it will be denied. If you ask for more training you won't get it. You are told you are hired to work 27 points/week but you will be scheduled 40-50 and will then have to chart all evening."
bad,"Heavy work load 10-13 patients. Plus you get experience of doing admits with no help. Charge Nurses provide no support as team leaders. Co-worker relationship among nursing staff poor. Preach to be watch budget so Administration can have catered lunches. HR lady has no dignity in discipline, very unprofessional toward staff. Calling everyone ""sir"". I gave 4 years for nothing. Heartless organization especially HR department!!!!!"
bad,"This place is absolutely horrible. Nurses take on patient loads of 9 and 10 patients on a regular basis with no support. There are hardly ever techs working to help and then management expects you to perform like you have a load of 5. They constantly hound the few nurses who are left working and don't care about your life or what you have going on. Beware they will lie to you and say you work every third weekend but reserve the rights to bend the rules to make you work as many as they wish. All you do is toilet clients, they want you to take care of your 10 patients and then answer other nurses call lights. Please, please, please!!!!!! Save yourself. They have limited staff now and other nurses are currently looking for another job! Save yourself the upset stomach. Do not come to work in this place."
bad,"Very understaffed!  No matter how hard you work they expect more. No company loyalty.  Management is to busy to answer questions.  Company policies are made up as you go along. "
bad,Very positive work culture in first HealthSouth I worked in South Carolina and just the opposite experience at the Florida facility where I worked.  I would never recommend this company mainly due to the experience from the Florida facility.
bad,I was a RN here for almost 2 years.  I Never got a raise and they treat their employees badly
bad,"Healthsouth is probably the worst place to work, unless you like pulling doubles all day in therapy (seeing 2 patients at once). Their documentation system takes twice as long as anywhere else. The staff does not respect you so it is quite difficult to have a positive attitude while you're at work. I won't work there again."
bad,"Worked only one month.  Management didn't really care about concerns but expressed at interview that they did.  Had to be off for conflict with child and sitter, they completely took me off the scheduled and lied and called it a no call no show. My calendar was already made out on google, so I know what days I was suppose to work.  Then emailed me saying I resigned. I was told not to go work for this company.  I worked alone, didn't talk to staff, they weren't friendly and did a lot of gossip amongst each other.  New employees are put on the back burner until they feel comfortable with you.  I'm so glad I'm gone. I love patient care and that isn't being done there.  It's all about getting the money."
bad,Run from this company if you want to have a home life. You will be on call 24 hrs a day for visits. Management is horrible. They don't care about anything except making money and will do whatever it takes. Clicks and prejudice is what they do well.
bad,I see based on reviews that this company sucks nationwide! They are all about money and the people that work hard are rode the hardest! I am glad to not work for these people anymore! The company sucks! 
bad,This place is so under staffed. They don't care about the staff or patients. They just keep cutting staff to patient nurse ratio to keep the bonus for management. No supplies ever you have to scrap by with what you have. I wouldn't take my dog there for care. The nursing staff is so incompetent that's very scary. Would never recommend anyone going there to work. Very dangerous on your licenses if you wanna keep them don't work there. Management don't give raises. It's all about the census an keeping there numbers high so corporate don't know what's really going on. Very scary to put your licenses on the line. DON'T DO IT. Very sad for the employees that are there because there not smart enough to go else where. Sad sad sad scary scary scary!!!!
bad,I left a great company to come work for this dump!
bad,Don't work here. Management is all about money and revenge no one pulls the rein in on the management. Unless you are spineless and willing to break the law you won't last here. Management style is to instill fear and there is no job security. Ask at your interview how many staff have left the department since it opened 2.5 years Ago that will tell you everything
bad,Health south took over a hospital that I had been workin for for 3 years as a nursing assistant then they come and take over and they give me and 10 other people their walking papers I had nothing in my file never called in or nothing. They had not even taken over yet.
bad,Management team is a joke! No opportunity for growth. Company says that they are family oriented....that is a lie. This is the worst company that I have ever worked for.
bad,"The staff here are rude, they lack customer service skills. Patients get treated bad and no respect is given to anyone."
bad,"The entire reason for Healthsouth's existance is money. Ethics, integrity, professionslism were absent here. Sr. RN management covered each others backs and ran off the truly caring staff at all levels. Play ball and turn a blind eye to the lack of patient care and you'll be fine. Bonuses were way short, a workmans comp claim by an employee spelled the beginning of the end of your employment. This is where the lying by management was extraordinary. The liasons scoured hopelessly incapable patients from nursing homes with absolutely no hope of completing their PT ""recovery program"" but were forced to participate till their benefits ran out. (REFERALS) One patient kept complaining of the difficulty level. Nursing management would not listen to the RNT's who actually had contact with the patients, well this one died of a massive heart attack in the gym. Then they called EMS to pick up the body. EMS thought they were responding to a call. They were furious and said they dont't transport dead people call the coroner."
bad,Long work hours. No appreciation. Rude management. Robot nursing.
bad,"Healthsouth in Tinton Falls has by far the most drama ever. there are two main reasons this is the worst place to work: 1.) Employees: All employees are after each other, nurses try to get other nurses fired, and the same goes for the aides. 2.) Patients: this is supposed to be a rehabilitation hospital, but it is a nursing home. people are constantly falling because of understaffing, and there is no one to do the 1:1. the 1:1s end up being one aide or nurse watching 5. if you are busy with one, and the other falls, it is your license."
bad,healthsouth nursing admin are very lazy and when it comes to patient care they expect 100% from nursing staff but will not enter patient rooms to help and they ignore patient needs
bad,"This is a company that PRIDES itself on Firing Employees and not granting them their unemployment and PTO benefits, once you have been terminated. In the economy we live in that should be against the law.....but this company continues to get away with it."
bad,"Not a pleasant working environment. Understaffed (therapists and RNs) with high productivity standards that affect patient care. They’ll mention that they have “great outcomes”. Their outcome measurement is discharge to home, so you’ll often get people who do not require two or more therapeutic disciplines. If they are appropriate for inpatient rehab, you’ll find yourself co-treating or treating in groups to meet productivity regardless of patient acuity or diagnosis."
bad,"My time at Encompass was largely spent being harassed by the resident “abuser” "
bad,I was let go for no reason and was called on the phone when terminated ! I was never late! They have clicks and if you’re not in one they will discharge you! The pay sucks as well ! $12.50 for all that work
bad,"Management is terrible, as a nurse I have never worked in a hospital so understaffed and the DON doesn't care , I would never place my family member here either. Pay is not great but the current work environment is horrible."
bad,"Matrices rule in office staffing. Unrealistic expectations in regard to absorbing duties for multiple roles, expected duties and answering phone calls. "
bad,Fredericksburg facility is in need of new management from CEO through Supervisors. Management might want to try to lead by example not buy throwing the staff to the wolves and fending for themselves.
bad,They make promises they can't keep.  My drug test results went to a staff member instead of the boss & they acted like it was no big deal!  I'm on ADD medication & had the labeled bottle in my hand to validate.  They refused to look at it & demanded I leave the office.  DISCRIMINATION all the way!
bad,"Cardinal hill cleans house with their staff quite a bit and makes job security very frightening. Nurses and techs rarely help each other out and when they do it’s very unpleasant. I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone. It’s a very hostile environment and when approaching your manager about what is happening they don’t listen very much or take action. With calling in, no matter the situation they don’t reason with you and make you seem like the bad person no matter what and are quick to let everyone else know about what is happening."
bad,"Administration continuously overworked certain staff members. If you were not part of the ""group"" you were mistreated. Promotions given to close friends who were not qualified for the position. While intentionally  bypassing the ones who were better suited for the position. Management unwilling to address employee complaints in order to make things better. I would describe the in-house team as refrigerator nurses (lazy/only in the profession for the pay) and believed in paper pushing, versus being a pt advocate and team player. Help was limited. in the end, you will become burnt out! And minimal time for family life."
bad,"Poor unprofessional management turning a blind eye to high staff turnover. Dirty environment with no natural light. Had to provide own therapy materials in order to treat patients. Difficult to get education reimbursement or time off to attend professional education, as management played favorites."
bad,"Not a fan of some of the directors or CEO.  Don’t like feeling picked on or attacked and don’t like seeing it happen to my coworkers ."
bad,"Management is a disgrace! They all have their favorites and they are NOT organized at all. This place will burn you out! They treat their workers poorly and that is the reason for their high turn over rates. Gossip is the main focus here. The nurses don’t help and when we complain, it’s over looked. They need a brand new nursing management team. The night supervisor smokes all night. The day supervisor is nice. Nothing else to be happy about"
bad,It's a job it's all in what you make it but in all it's a nice place to work you have some nice people that works there some of the nurses are good they pay good the job is self it's flexible home you have to live over a hundred 50 lb
bad,"Poor management and overloading nurses with 10 patients a day and even though they are suppose to be low acuity these are renal, CVA, and cardiac patients."
bad,"Although I love being a nurse, this was by far the most terrible place I've ever worked. You will never feel comfortable as they fire people CONSTANTLY, extremely high turn over due to that and poor job satisfaction. Administration does not care about you as an employee, they do not help you, nurse to patient ratio is horrific and dangerous, you will definitely have 3+ admissions with a patient load more times than not (I would have 10+ patients a lot and acuity is not taken into consideration), rules are not the same for everyone, people quit often, they will throw you into situations you are not ready for because they are short handed, you'll NEVER have enough help and management will throw you under the bus given the chance, they do not have your back at all. They care about making money and that's it!! Although they say patient satisfaction is their goal, they sure put them in danger by being understaffed and continuing to take admissions anyways without enough staff. Don't do it!!"
bad,"The therapy care that is given to the patient is very good and that's where the positivity stops."
bad,"Since leaving this company I have met many other professionals who agree that this was one of the worst. Poor mgmt, back biting, poor support of staff"
bad,"Don't work here if you value your license."
bad,"They don't complete training, many times you work late.  you have to pay for all your food.  they cancel you less than an hour before work.  They have their favorites and show disrespect"
bad,Management is poor and favoritism is rampant. . There is little camaraderie or support. There is no professional development. In-services are not structured very well. Typically you read something and sign a form.
bad,"This company cares more about money then patient care. The management was untrustworthy, and unprofessional . Staff to patient ratio is way to high and acuity of patients are not looked at . I feel like this company is something bad waiting to happen."
bad,"Encompass Health Hospitals, and I worked at two, have inexperienced nurses, i.e., brand new and foreigners in multitude."
bad,Huntsville office team don't know what they are doing. They try to cut patients cost to you save money instead of providing what's needed.     Poor management
bad,"Management is the biggest issue,, never on the nurses side ,  there are a lot of clicks at this facility, management condones abusive behaviour by the patients."
bad,"Never ever go to at least to this branch. Company itself is ok. But this particular branch management is horrible. Set you up any minute. Directors have changed 5 times within last 3 years. They always seek new nurses because people come and go or they make them go. Worked there less then 6 months and company went through 2 DONs. On call days are not worth the compensation as you are literally responsible for everything that is not finished throughout the workday (missed visits, wound care, emergencies, etc). In addition, communication from upper management ineffective and vague, for exmaple, you are not told that you are being disciplined and do not have an option to disagree with their decisions. Zero support from the team or management, everyone that survives only looks out for themselves, therefore there is no teamwork whatsoever. Even the decent workers are not able to speak up and only stay there because they are silent."
bad,"move you to different positions whenever they wanted. thus, deleting other positions and giving you more work. the ceo didn't seem to care about staff members."
bad,The lady that does the schedule changes it to suit their needs even after it’s been posted she has done this to me twice now even when I said I can’t work
bad,"The dietary position was easy it was the underhanded managers that work there ! Sneaky, underhanded, dirty ! They play very foul ! I wouldn’t recommend anybody to work in the dietary position as long as those same managers there ! My coworkers we lovable thats the only thing i miss !"
bad,"Staff to patient ratios are often unsafe and many staff members have recently left due to numerous changes. Very poorly staffed facility for the patient census and acuity. Employees are not appreciate and hard work goes unnoticed. More and more tasks and expectations are placed on the shoulders of fatigued and overworked nursing staff and even though problems are brought to the attention of management, there are no interventions or positive changes made."
bad,"I would never suggest anyone work here.  There was never enough staffing and it was quite likely that multiple areas would be short. It would not be unlikely to have 36+ patients for CNAs and the Nurses would have well over 10 patients as well. Rather than assist and stay, nursing management would leave at the end of their shift.  Patient care was lacking due to these numbers.   "
bad,Just worked you pretty hard. At times you would have 12 or 13 patients and it was difficult providing good care.Managers didn't care about team members and pay was poor.
bad,"The patient load is incredibly unreasonable. Nurses can have up to 10 patients on night shift and up to 9 on day shift. Expectations are unreasonable for such a high patient load. Patient satisfaction suffers and so does employment satisfaction. Corporate has NO idea what it is like to work on the floor as a bedside nurse and it seems as though they have no idea what our job entails because they are not understanding when it comes to making nurses and RNTs comfortable and happy with their workload. Immediate management is great but their ""hands are tied"" because they're just a puppet with corporate breathing down their necks. Patient's cannot receive the proper care with such a high patient load. It's just unfathomable that they feel it is safe for a nurse to take on 9-10 patients. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Be very weary of any job offers you get from here. They offer bonuses and high pay FOR A GOOD REASON. You will definitely work for that extra pay. In my opinion, the extra pay they offer is just not worth your emotional health. The stress ends up taking a toll on you. That's why they have such a high turn over rate."
bad,Typical work day was watching over your back to see who was stabbing you in the back next. Very stressful place to work after new CEO took over. Very cut throat CEO if you did not see eye to eye. Only thing on the management's mind everyday was MONEY!!! Plain and simple. Did not care about employees or patients.
bad,Dont wanna say.A horrible place to work there is no COMMUNICATION nursing staff very two faced tell you one thing behind your back something totally different. DONT GET SICK THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT CERTAIN EMPLOYEES.
bad,I would not recommend this facility for anyone who wants to have a life outside of work.  Hours are long and employees feel very unappreciated. Upper management leaves a lot to be desired. Benefits are good but employees are not treated fairly. This is the worst place I have ever worked.
bad,"Management talks a good game, but there is no follow through. Staff are abused with dangerously high patient loads. Good co-workers but everyone is so exhausted and overworked that it creates an atmosphere of ""everyone for themselves"". Management is clueless and doesn't care about the employees."
bad,The worst nursing job I have ever had. Management is awful. The nurses were great but management does not care about their nurses. The fact that they are offering a sign on bonus should be the first clue that they can't keep their staff! Save yourself the stress and look for a company that cares for their nurses
bad,Healthsouth's management only cares about money. If you get sick on the job HR catches and attitude if you nees to leave. Even with a doctors excuse your still not excused. Healthsouth wants you to work on your off days and don't want to pay you your over time.
bad,"Healthsouth is a great place for people getting into the health care field . You learn a lot working here.. my only issue was there was no way for me or any other nurse tech to advance. Unless you were going to school for nursing. The CEO at this location was very active in communicating with fellow employees. I would have stayed if there were more opportunities of me advancing within the company. I know exactly why there were no advancement for ""some"" of us.. working there.. I just choose not to say on here. I will say this though.. equal opportunity needs to taught here!"
bad,"Worked in management and realized this company regards $$$ as the only worthy goal. Patient care, employee satisfaction and daily work culture suffer from poor upper management. Folks.... This is an acquisitions company...straight up! The cookie-cutter approach from state to state DOES NOT work. Certainly, some branches of the company are more satisfied than others. Overall, this company does not work for the patient or employee best interest. There are much better home health companies to work for...really."
bad,"The pay is a joke, your worked like a dog and treated like one. Management yells at you in front of patients, fellow staff, and family members."
bad,"Health South of Round Rock has a horrible record of patient safety.  Three deaths within a month due to nurse/patient ratio. This is a rehab facility.  Patients should come to us whenever they are healthy enough to do a little rehab and then go home.  We receive patients who should never be sent our way.  Our liasons should never accept these patients, but they do; knowing that we don't have the proper staff to take care of them.  The CEO is over 3 hospitals in Austin, so he's never around to make sure that the hospitals are safe.  He bounces back and forth between the 3 facilities. He only cares about our census and that we stay full."
bad,"Understaffed techs have anywhere to m 15-24 patients at night,  day shift as well, no support from  management, more of a nursing home instead of rehab, techs are expected to get up all patients for all meals even in the mornings when techs have had a heavy load with a big patient loads the night before. Day shift nurses have to take assignments because of lack of staff, majority of the nurses don't help and most nurses will be in a room with a patient, and the patient will ask for something like a bedpan bathroom, or water they will either put on the patient call light or call a tech on the walkie. Anything the nurse complain that a tech does they are written up, the techs don't have any support, this is a rehab hospital but it's not treated as such, it's a skilled facility, techs and nurses are putting in their two week notices at an alarming rate.Management don't care about the nursing staff, the working conditions are overwhelming, you be better off working for a nursing home, less stressful and less back breaking work, nurses talk to techs like garbage, but it's OK, but if s tech respond back it's called insubordination, not worth your lively hood. They tell you in your interview it's a non lifting facility, that's a fat lie, they don't care, it's a head and bed policy that marketing have, the patients can range from being oversize to violent and they continue to take them in, especially the non compliant violent ones.....if you really need a job go there otherwise turn the other direction, worst place ever, no staff very heavy work. FYI I have put my two weeks in can't"
bad,"Not enough staff for amount of patients. "
bad,"No training, administration does what they want. Elitist administrators who are not qualified. Policy only applies when convenient for administration or management. CEO has no experience and management style is fear based. Backstabbing co workers and no support from administration. Worst HR ever. Retaliation is very common. Stay away from this place. Census is always low and they cut your hours so you never get a full paycheck. Gossiping, hateful staff."
bad,"Encompass says all the right things, but does NOT practice what they preach. They pride themselves on education and training, but at least in Colorado, training is minimal. The Assistant Regional Administrator is angry, defensive, unprofessional and demeaning. She gossips about both the office and field staff, rarely saying anything positive. I heard things about staff in her other branches that I had no business knowing. It made me wonder what she was saying about me to them. The minute you disagree with her she turns on you and your days are numbered. I was encouraged to let her know if I needed more training or was becoming overwhelmed. When I did, her response was about how overworked she was, having 5 branches to cover, the long days she had to work and how overwhelmed and exhausted she was. It was very demeaning. "
bad,Run  from this company is horrible backstabbing and very poor management
bad,"Management is terrible. They lead with fear and threats and action plans....but there is never recognition for going the extra mile, only recognition for areas of improvement. The benefits are good, and you can accrue PDO quickly, but that doesn't do much good when you are worked to death and not allowed to use it. You are not allowed to ""have a brain"". Never ask questions just do as you are told. If you ask a question you are labeled as a trouble-maker or insubordinate simply because you want proper training. I highly recommend AGAINST working for this company. They have almost 100% employee turnover because of how terrible they are. They also have a terrible reputation in the community & with physician groups."
bad,"Was lied to about scheduling. No teamwork, no structure. Very disorganzied. The staff was cliquey. The therapists were nasty to me.Patient care was compromised. I was given the run around about a transfer position. Overall just a humbling and eye opening experience. I felt like I was doing so much work and if I had a question or complaint, it was just brushed under the rug.HR was ok, but that was it. Glad I kept my first job. I was barely here a month.No thank you......."
bad,employees don't care about patients. They treat staff horrible management doesn't care about anything CNA's care too much and get in trouble for bathing or caring too much 
bad,"No advancement, too much politics. Some staff are really nice. The hardest part is when they cut help and still expect excellent care."
bad,Lots of lip service but wont back up any promises they make. They protect themselves first in every situation. Managers talk bad about the company. The staff does not like new comers.
bad,Highly political environment and they work you to death. We all make mistakes working here was one of them. It’s like joining a cult. Micromanagement and backstabbing is just the beginning. A façade is in place for the patients. The employees get treated pretty rough.
bad,"Poor training for new hires. Management did nothing when I brought proof of insurance fraud. Nothing when I came to them a out harassment from another employee. I had to use all of my PTO and savings due to no work. All nurse visits went to RNs that were salaried. Hourly LPN's had their regular pts taken away, sometimes while driving to their home for visit."
bad,Not a good place to work. No employee value or appreciation. No manager or leadership support. Excessive work load and goals. Better places out there that will value you
bad,They dont like to give raises then they want u to do everything . I do four people jobs and dont see any money my rent is more then I'm paid. They dont like black people at all this company is racist and dont dont like black people to make any money.
bad,The company as a whole has a good track record but locally no one prepared me for this job. I had no support from upper management and they set me up for failure
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this facility to my worst enemy. Staffing ratios are DANGEROUS! Complaints from patients and family members are constant, and justified. Work load is unreasonable. Patients are put at risk. Agency runs the building now. The atmosphere is junk. Managements mentality is “I don’t work the floor, so not my problem”. Nursing management are all friends on Facebook and post vulgarity, which is very unprofessional. They tag one another in posts that are sickening. No family work balance as they will work you to the ground I will say the staff nurses I worked with were superb, and it was like a family on the floor. Nothing like working dangerously short staffed to cause bonding! However, management is a joke. They don’t care about the employees. You can be drowning, and verbalize this, and yet they still sit in there offices joking and talking without a care in the world. CNAs work dangerously short. Turnover is heavy. The CNO is very rude, unhelpful, and cliquey. If you aren’t in management kissing behind, then you will be targeted. The wound care nurse is a joke! She sits in her office all day and doesn’t even look at these people and their wound care. I’ve never worked in such a place where management so blantantly doesn’t care. Save yourself trouble, apply elsewhere."
bad,"Management is poor, no advancement unless your liked by upper management.  Clean house Encompass. All you do is work long hours daily. Micro managed. Verbally abused by employees."
bad,This is not a place you want to work!!! It says rehab but you are dealing with nursing home patients. Management don't care about you they just want shifts filled and they will not help if short ... the pay sucks the company sucks
bad,"I worked there for 5 weeks and management failed to give me the proper training for their software and giving the essential tools too do my job. The 2nd week there; 1 Cash Application Specialists was fired for doing what the Team Lead told her to do! At this point, the Manager and Team Lead took off the day after Thanksgiving and I sat at my desk for 8 hours doing nothing! Why, because it was my 2nd week there and I only sat with the Team Lead for 30 minutes for training. Just because you have Cash Posting experiences, they expect you to jump right in and do whatever they lay at your desk. But it’s not that simple if you don’t have the knowledge of their software, access to websites, numbers to call payors for recoup information, and how to properly post to the Home care Home base system. Then the manager apologizes for the lack of training and promise more training time; nevertheless, the training was never giving. They like to bully you by writing you an email; in which, the Team Lead try to cover herself by saying things she told you too do and how she told you to do them. CC the manager, but when you call the Team Lead our on the email on how she tells you one thing and come back with something different! The manager response is “your email was very harsh and that you have too show management and the Team Lead respect!!! Where is my respect for being Lead to believe that we all work together as a team and willing to train and give you tools you need to do your job. I love what do; an I don’t have to be lied too nor setup for failure in the long run. The patient are important"
bad,Ridiculous patient load...other facility near us had a walk out recently. Poor management & lack of things you would normally expect to have at work like AC & heat. Working and living conditions are quite poor due to current massive renovations. Patients and family complain only to be moved around the facility to the nicer rooms. They do provide fans & heaters...
bad,"They pay only 30 cents/mile, then cheat you out of hours and mileage on your paycheck. They hire you as “full time”, then don’t give you a FT patient load. Then they email you and say “you’re not meeting productivity.” They have the nerve to say you’re not permitted to work anywhere else, yet they don’t give you enough hours to pay your bills. Preceptors act like they are better than you, and management gives them their dirty work to do."
bad,"I worked in two branches, they have a terrible training program. They have you do these online training videos then send you out expecting you to do a great job with your documentation. Dont work for them they talk a good talk but what it comes down to is the bottom line. The corporate people will tell you one thing and the local management will tell yo another. Dont waste your time."
bad,When you have over 10 years experience 13$ an hour is a slap in the face and only 0.50/0.75 more to lose all your benefits and become prn is disrespectful! Nursing manager is okay but the night shift supervisor and one second shift supervisor is are horrible they have friends and cliques that they show favoritism when they make out assignments and house call you.  No cohesiveness at all between techs and nurses. A lot of the younger girls are lazy and lack compassion and empathy towards patients.
bad,"Encompass pays $21-23/hr for LPN’s. The lowest paid in the company. You will work and must meet productivity points. Patients are spread out through multiple counties and if you have that territory you will spend half of your day driving. Compensation 32cents per mile. Management has their favorites. If you like backbiting and are a brown noser, you will fit in. Lastly, if you make overtime, make sure you meet productivity because they don’t like to pay out."
bad,"Understaffed. Some employees care, but some are rude, uneducated, and uncaring. Cno is not very visible/present, and when she is, she can be unprofessional and insulting.  Most of the doctors at this location do not seem very knowledgeable and dont take action very quickly. CEO seems to care and is visible and approachable. Housekeeping staff is kind and so is maintenance department.  The business office seemed pretty professional,  but therapy staff was usually immature,  selfish and gossiped alot, even the patients would tell me. I often heard employees say they didn't have time to do the things they needed to get done."
bad,"Little to no training, every time there was supposed to be training or a meeting it was cancelled. Since I was the only one who did the job, there was no one else to ask for help but my boss, and we were taking turns being ""flexed off"", basically not allowed to come in, due to low patient census. After that went on, for several months, and a hostile work environment, I finally left."
bad,An unproductive workplace with an air of distrust among shifts and poor management. Employees are expected to do more than stated in their job descriptions. The turnover rate is ungodly and it is the fault of extremely poor management and under staffing.
bad,"Has gone downhill in the last few years. Understaffed all the time. Management doesn't care about anyone's concerns, and they have their favorite picks of staff."
bad,I am a former employee I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I worked as a nurse and what I saw was awful there's no structure the CMAs come and go as they please long lunch breaks tardiness absenteeism and will tell you what they are and are not going to do they work short a lot the Staffing is horrible there are understaffed some shifts as a nurse we have no say so because some employees have a personal relationship with the administration I wouldn't recommend this place to any one that includes CNAs and nursing alike the pay also sucks no room for growth unless you are part of the clique so when when will best it's not worth it and the ones that say is good is because they can get away with anything and nothing is said or......
bad,The CNO (Chief Nursing Officer has no nursing skills  and Management is not very helpful. Nursing staff and Therapy staff act as if they are not  working for the patient as a whole and seemingly disagree often. Stressful work environment.
bad,"If you are looking for a full time job, this in not the place to work. When census is low, to save money they send staff home. Some employees actually show up for work and get sent home. The culture here has completely changed since my start of employment, as well as the company name itself. The turn over rate is ridiculous! They lose outstanding employees that have been working here for years due to being overworked and underpaid. They make promises they can't keep. They show favoritism to certain staff members. There is no team environment! I say don't waste your time. Seeking new employment!"
bad,If you want to be worked like a dog and not appreciated at all then this is the place for you! The management is horrible quick to point out all your mistakes but never acknowledge anything good you've done. The turn over rate is unbelievably high and its because they fire everyone for the smallest things. You can't miss a day if you're sick even if you have a doctors excuse you better be there. I am convinced if you were dead they would still ask if you were coming to work.....everyone hates their jobs there and it doesn't matter if you are short staffed or not you better make everyone happy and not make any mistakes even if you have 16+ patients. Dayshift gets praised for everything and nightshift gets blamed for everything somehow. Most of the nurses are so lazy and rude they wont help. If you're ready to work over 100hrs on each pay check then come check this place out!
bad,"This company was great when it was Healthsouth. Once they joined or whatever they did with Encompass it all went downhill . Pay was changed, many policies were changed, lot of turnover and new staff. New staff doesn’t know what’s going on there and they are management and tell you what and how to do things while your pay is cut and you work more hours."
bad,"A typical day at HS, now Encompass in San Antonio was extremely stressful, which included high workload, unrealistic expectations, from leadership. Favoritism is noted, and leadership will not hesitate to rid of leaders who promote holistic care methods, safety, advocacy for patients and staff. New leadership does not assist on the floor and are quick to find fault, do not offer support measures rather will terminate good nurses and leave the bad, meaning senior staff who ridicule new nurses, & are cliquish. If you value your humanity, even more so your license, do not work there."
bad,"Clinical field team  was very good and we took great care of our hospice patients. However, this company will NOT take care of you as an employee. On 40 hour salary but worked mostly 50-60 hour weeks. Heavy call load with administrative back up who would not help. Worked 16, 20, 24, 30 and 36 shifts on little or no sleep. You worked all day, got called out all  night and they would work you a full shift the next day. "
bad,"Their software PointCare is very time consuming which takes more of your time at work and at home. I spent my weekend making notes. I have a huge area of coverage and since I’m the only therapist in the area I’m swamped with patients which demands more paperwork time. My assistants are primadonnas trying to make points so that they’ll look good with the admin. They will file a complaint about little bitty things instead of communicating it to you."
bad,"No continuity of care for the patients. Daily scheduling changes are extremely ridiculous and not achievable. Management is very disfunctional and Medicare fraud is something you will be asked to participate in by seeing non home bound patients, If you bring this to managements attention you will be silenced, If you value your license you should not work here."
bad,"Very cut throat environment. Very unqualified management team. Accused of things that i did not do. Have seen many people leave due to hostile environment and back biting by upper level management. Horrible, hostile enviroment"
bad,Accused of things I did not do. Manager had me followed by her staff every night to make sure I left the building!!! Why I don't know!! Other nurses were nice. Immediate surpervisor nurse was terrible. Many patients to nursess. Just a terrible place.
bad,Company only cares about money and not patient care. Terrible harrassing management. Worst employment experience I've had. I worked 21 days in a row without a day off. Abusive management. No time for family.
bad,"Management was not that great, they would never help when short staffed.  The CNA’s refused to listen to nurses. The cleaning  staff would bully nurses. Most of the time you were not allowed to take lunch breaks."
bad,Over worked and underpaid. Turnover city. Poor communication. Hours get cut if not productive. Inconsistent information one way or the highway people.
bad,I worked for the wheat ridge hospice office in Colorado. The branch Director very rude always focuses on the negative things that people did never focus on the postive things. She had her favorites . They are pushy when it comes to signing on people for hospice. The branch Director was very judgemental about a person characters. I felt very discriminate against. I will never recommend working for this certaim branch Director.
bad,Horrible and stressful the hr director is a nut case  and has been caught falsifying fedral documentation and still will not be terminated the ceo that was termminated was amazing but set up by the hr
bad,"Nurses are over worker and understaffed. ratios are unsafe, CNAs are under trained. It is unsafe to be a patient on the nursing units. Management/administration does not provide proper funds for continuing education so no one advances and no one is properly trained. Only concern is profit and ratings."
bad,Workers who aren't as successful are given less and less and the ones who can handle the job are given more and more. I do not recommend anyone to work for this employer.
bad,I was discriminated against for being ill! Walked in to hear the branch director and an area sales manager gossiping and mocking me for being sick! Do yourself a favor and avoid the negativity.
bad,"Horrible place to work ! Way too many patients per nurse tech , way too much work for one person ! Can never find help , I was there every night at least an hour over charting my insane patient load . I felt sorry for the residents I tried my very best to take care of . I've been a CNA for 5 years, I'm in nursing school, and I've worked in nursing homes and a hospital . This was by far the hardest job I've ever held . Don't recommend unless you are an RN, and you will still be pulled to the floor as a tech when they're short (which is most days.)"
bad,"Management has all the excuses as to why they cant make life better at this job, but none of them add up to change. I was afraid of coming to work in fear that i would lose my nursing license. Dont apply to this company! You will be overworked, stressed and abused!"
bad,The CNO is incompetent and the CEO makes decisions with no regard to the impact to patient care.  I worked here before as a temp nurse and the culture in administration was so muncher better. The CEO was fully aware of every department and what we were going through.  And our HR dept is a joke.
bad,"Not a good place to work. It's a nice facility but the people are not very friendly or helpful. If you are looking for something dependable, this isn't it. You get flexed a lot based on census."
bad,Worst  management I have excountered in  30 years of professional experience. MsWs are not valued or used appropriately.  Beware! Social Work is either unverused or discounted altogether.
bad,"This was a great place to work, until new management came in and took over.  It was a place where you wanted to go everyday but with new CEO and her friend CNO it is pure mean and derespectful!! At times you have 16 very sick patients, some that should have never even been there... Very positive the first 2 yrs till new management came in.  Over worked understaffed and treated like dirt. Very negative atmosphere"
bad,"I was a Health South transition employee.  When HS bought ENCOMPASS we all had high hopes. I was honest and told them I would be retiring somewhere around December. They replaced me 4 months before I was ready and then took away my Job titles so the "" new manager"" would not feel uncomfortable. But I could stay and help out until December.   They allowed the Division Manager of sales to lie and manipulate what she wanted, which was to get rid of current office staff. No field staff was interviewed to verify rumors.  I have never worked for such a thoughtless company. It's all about making money and numbers.  There is lots more to say, but in my opinion run the other direction as fast as you can, there are companies that care about there employees, this is not one of them."
bad,"Poor training for new employees.  Basically you are given several folders and instructed to read them, but had to sign stating you read them.  Poor training time on tablet , especially on oasis questions. Preceptor wasn't helpful with the tablet and was preoccupied with other items. Decided to load up my tablet with several start of.cares and regular  visits. All management cared about was getting the.visits done for the day. Management did not.care that their employees were out 12 hours per.day. had to work on call without extra pay or day off."
bad,"I would not wish HealthSouth Littleton on my worst enemy and would never trust them with someone I care about. They kill patients, the clinical staff is incompetent, and management could not care less about patient safety. HealthSouth Littleton is horrible. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time even applying. Protect yourself and your license."
bad,If you want no home life this is the place to work. Very poor local management.  Don't believe your going to get company vehicle and everything that is promised.
bad,"hugh POLITICS poor director no longer there no secure job In HOURS   lots of favoritism ....Poorly management, when you have a employee that narks on everything you do ......."
bad,constantly understaffed. please a lot of good people because of favoritism and straight up bulling. I have nothing more to say
bad,"Would not recommended no job security , tons of politics, favoritism,  job was eliminated"
bad,"Hiring Manager DMO was inappropriate for position, fired!"
bad,"No teachings, no regulations, patient and families were wonderful but staff no leadership, no team"
bad,Micro management out of control CNO inexperienced and dishonest. Supervisors are out of control and do what they want. Managed by fear with no direct chain of command. No amount of money worth working here.
bad,"I use to work for this company in Midland, TX.  Everyone that worked in the therapy department were mostly from out of state. This company offers great sign on bonuses to lure you in because they cannot find help from around their own area because everyone knows how unethical this company is. The actual therapy department has great therapists but the therapy management and administrative management are Horrible. I have never worked under such ruthless people before. Every hospital is different, but this one is definitely more of a prison than a hospital. The upper management only cares aboutbone thing and that is hospital reimbursement, not patient care. "
bad,I was promised help with learning and I got none. I was told i would get a raise and that didn't happen then I got laid off because they got ride of my position.
bad,"If you like understaffed, underpaid, lack of management skills, lack of team work, lack or organization and constant micromanagement then this is the place for you....sadly not for me. Based on patient census so you may or may not get the hours you need. Nursing staff unable or unwilling to help with patient care for the most part. CEO that is clueless and could care less what goes on with the patients as long as the place gets the scores needed. Everyone is treated like a budget item...even the patients... No breaks and sometimes no lunch...or at least a lunch without work interruptions or duties."
bad,"These women will ruin your career if you are not careful enough. Management are Looney tunes. Never worked with such a crazy place. Give you too much to do, not enough resources to do it and then send you to the board when you finally screw up."
bad,"CEO just FIRED (GOOD RIDDANCE). He lost the company MILLIONS by bringing the SAME ACUTE patients that are not rehab able. Nurse/pt ratio 6/7/8 in day shift with one tech for about 20 pts. On top of that you are basically your own charge nurse and tech. You attend team conferences, do admissions, rounds with the MD and wipe buts at the same time. If you're a good nurse and you want to make sure everything is complete before you leave, you can on most days leave 3 to 4 hours AFTER your shift ends. Everyone has a back injury lifting those heavy pts without the proper lifting equipment. Upper management is on a witch hunt against nursing. Whenever there's a problem, it's nursing's fault. The is no team work between nursing and therapy. If the pt's pulse ox is 85 and you're trying to give them a breathing tx, you better get it done before 9 so they can get to therapy or you'll have your but handed to you. Still working there until I find something else but don't waste your time or hard work getting your license to work there. I hate being a nurse because of HELLSOUTH!!!!!"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for Healthsouth at Drake for many, many reasons. The administration is TERRIBLE. The right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. There is absolutely no nursing support. I can't speak for other Healthsouth hospital's, but this one has a very corporate feel. Quality patient care is not a focus. Maintaining a high patient census is priority one. Not enough nurses to take care of these patient's? This is of no concern to the administration. It is very common for a day shift nurse to have 9 or 10 patients. Administration picks and chooses how they staff the units. Recently, corporate was in the building and we were overstaffed with nurses and aides on that particular day. The previous weekend, the nurses had to work short staffed despite requests for additional help. The patients are often medically complex. The acute out rate is extremely high. There has been an extremely high turnover of staff. Seven nurses have left since October and nearly everyone is looking for employment elsewhere."
bad,I really am sad to say that HealthSouth management is not good at all.
bad,"Health south North Houston has a lot of ""in-fighting"" among staff and between departments; very little team work. Ancillary staff fear for their jobs and try to make co-workers look bad in hopes of looking like a company ""person"". Management staff ""push"" for numbers and require admission of persons not qualified and not at a stage where they can benefit from acute rehab they don't employ enough skilled nurses to take care of the heavy care patients. The doctors don't like admitting their patients to the hospital; reimbursement rates are down because they admit patients that don't qualify and they loose their appeals. No specific speciality, lack of guidance, unhappy patients and patient families. Case Management is a ""joke""' they ""pencil whip"" everything from admission assessments to weekly contacts with family. Dangerous place to work if you care about your reputation."
bad,This place has the worst management and supervisors.  CEO and CNO knows of all the complaints about the supervisor and brushes everything under the rug . Supervisor harasses certain staff and management doesn't care about its employees.. They only care about money when it comes to this company..
bad,"Management is terrible there, they look down on you as the lower class.  Employees are wonderful, but not management. Someone needs to go through and clean management out and start all over.  Their has been people to leave the one I am talking about and went to another one, and said it was wonderful where they went to, management was a lot better they said."
bad,"Absolutely horrible. I was treated like garbage. Very racist and homophobic, rude and micromanaging. The benefits are laughable. They reward you by giving you gift cards and stuff but its all taxed on your paycheck. They never told me that part of course. I reported their harrassment to managers and HR and no one would help me. Worst hospital. The nurses are rude everyone was full of themselves. Certain people made it bareable but after they quit and i got injured on the job and refused workmans compensation. The elevators tipped the large food carts and hurt me so many times. I ended up needing surgery to fix the damage this company did. Never will step foot in that establishment again."
bad,"This facility has so much potential, and HAD so many great employees until the turnover rate became completely ridiculous especially for nursing. The crazy thing is leadership broadcasts the idea of wanting employees to speak up about things and act like they care so much about what we think on the engagement surveys, but when you speak up now you are a target. When I tell you that the HR Director has to be the most incompetent HR person I have ever seen. Good for her for lucking up into this position, seeing that her and the CNO both do not adhere to the basics of being a leader, such as the codes of conduct. There have been so many complaints about retaliation and unfairness and nothing seems to be done about it. There have been issues raised to the HRD about feeling targeted or even harassed by the CNO and it just gets swept under the rug. The CNO sends emails to the staff about things with such a nasty and condescending tone, when a simple face-to-face conversation could have addressed the issue. When this is relayed to the HRD, nothing is done, she just says that they will investigate further and look into the concerns and sometimes she never circles back and if she does it is to basically tell you there were no findings. I am seriously concerned that as long as I have been here so many people have left and no one from corporate is looking into this. No one under the CNO can be successful as she takes no accountability and does not advocate for her staff. I am eager to know what exactly is being taught in the ""Leadership Training"" they are now doing because I hope it focuses"
bad,"Management there is very poor. Human Resources are only there to make the company name look good, and offeres no help when employees have a problem. Nurses seem to be confused about the care of their own patients. Racism and favoritism seem to be allowed with no consequences. Please think long and hard before accepting a job there."
bad,Manager is poor no direction but like if things they want you to do for no compensation.i had not only do my job but everyone else.managrment don't recognize good people but will miss their good employees at the end.
bad,"Poorly managed. I wouldn't recommend working at Braintree rehab hospital. Supervisor was terrible - no clinical supervision, weird unsupportive environment."
bad,I did not care for the environment at Encompass Health new management was brought in and they disliked employees who have been with them longer therefore making it a vary stressful environment to work in.
bad,"Nurses are wonderful, management is horrible.  Bottom line is all that matters. To many patients to staff ratio making unsafe for staff and patients. High turn over rate."
bad,"Management needs a new overhaul,  they give perks to their favorites, and the rest of the staff, good luck.   They  talk about employees in front of other staff making fun of them which has been overheard by patients and their families. And, they are 20 years behind in their nursing care."
bad,"The nurses have way to much on their plate, sometimes having 9 patients you aren’t able to properly care for your patients. The management do not help you at all and just leave you there to drown. The techs are not very helpful to the nurses as they have way to many patients themselves and therapy pretty much runs the show so you are constantly hunting down your patients to give them their meds and do their dressings. Definitely not worth the risk to your license and the pay is awful."
bad,"Sometimes you’d have 18 patients and the supervisor would say “what’s the problem?” Then tell you “your fine” after you tell them you can’t do it.  Don’t work here!!!"
bad,"You are only a number remember that if you apply for a job at this company, oh get ready to go down South as well because encompass is taking over October 1st, 2018!! Guess what’s in store for you nothing it gets worse because it’s going to be more like a nursing home. And get ready for health benefits to go down hill too. Oh and to clock your time it’s on a phone applications or a computer in your department now and you are in charge of your own time as encompass health keeps track of everything you do! WHATS NEXT HAVING A CHIP IN YOUR SKIN! Just saying. So my advice is SAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
bad,"I was let go as part of a reduction in force so I honestly don't have much good to say about a company I was with for 18 years. Other than management, I enjoyed the people I worked with and my patients."
bad,"Management was awful, felt no appreciation or support from upper management. Unsafe staffing most shifts. Employees not held accountable. If you’re “in the click” your okay, if not you were “picked at” constantly. No consistency throughout. Employees are burnt out from having so many responsibilities on their plate plus working short staffed. I WOULD NOT recommend working at the facility."
bad,"Very toxic environment,  blatant racism against all non Filipino employees.  Sexist comments daily against make cnas. Amazing place to work if you're a female Filipino. Horrible if you're anything else."
bad,"A typical day at work includes having an unsafe number of patients with no support or assistance from management. Management doesn't care about their employees' or patients' safety, only cares about bringing in the revenue. Retaliatory and hostile work environment. Would not suggest this place of employment"
bad,"All of management seemed to be in fear for their jobs, so there was always blame and finger pointing. Greedy. We had one of the highest margins in revenue in the country yet were constantly hounded to sale, sale, sale, even when it was more than the nursing staff and providers could handle."
bad,"Poor management, negative working environment, poor patient care, negative work life balance, poor staffing, high staff turnover, very stressful and lack of appreciation."
bad,"Management is Dishonest , Disrespectful, Bias, Disloyal, Rude, Inconsiderate, Harsh, Unprofessional, Cold harded, Stressful, Bullies, Lack management skills"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at this place to my worse enemy! Nurse staffing can vary from 1:8-10.  There is no RT coverage for night shift which makes nurses responsible for respiratory treatments as well. You can complain to management but they really don't care.  Management is poor, leadership is nonexistent. Due to high nurse to patient ratio, patient care is subpar! RNTs/CNAs are constantly understaffed.  Oh, and RNTs have NO medical training which put the patients at an even greater risk. If you value your license, sanity, and livelihood, don't work here... you will regret it!"
bad,The management does not care about healthcare staff. I have been there 3 years and there are a lot of turnovers. Things have not gotten better. It just has gotten worse over the years. We have gotten 3 mangers since I have started. No cno at this time. Both cno's have been fired. We also have a new ceo. Overloaded nurses and techs.
bad,Mangers don't do their jobs. And some treat their employees awful. All employees are divided into cliques. Departments treat others departments poorly. Pay isn't all that great. Was lied to in the interview about holidays. EVS techs are ran to death.
bad,Management is terrible. Do not work here if you are a nurse! They treat nurses horrible. It seems great in beginning but they will stab you in back in a minute. Management does not care about their nurses at all and never have your back.
bad,"Management with no management experience. 12-14 hrs in field. With additional hours for documentation. No continuity of care for patients. When RN attempts to be advocate for patients we get disciplined. No assist from office/scheduler/ manager with making phone calls, follow up, Constant turnover of nursing staff due to dislike of branch manager. Behaves like a highschool mean girl."
bad,"Staff for the most part is ok but you have the back stabbers that kiss up to the management. Management is corrupt and don't care how good of a nurse you are, if you don't kiss up they treat you horrible until you quit. They say you can bring your concerns to them but if they do they get mad. Unsafe nurse to patient ratio. Staff getting hurt all the time. All they care about is the money and survey scores. Bring in nonrehabible patients with too high of an acuity. If you dare say anything you're on the hit list. Very toxic environment to work. Everything is run on fear and intimidation. Feel sick just walking into the building its so bad. Rules dont apply to the management's favorites. CEO won't even make eye contact with his employees. Treats us like we are worth his gaze. Don't work here, it's horrible."
bad,"DCM was ""Challenging"" to work with...unable to control her temper"
bad,The First 3 months were ok. But after that.. Changes out of no where. HR is one person who seems as if she makes her on rules up as she go. I wouldn't advise anyone to wanna even stay there . The Nursing staff is UNDERSTAFFED!! So when the call lights go out there's little help for the patients. But that's how they save money. Oh and let's not forget about the census.. That never stays up. So don't expect a full pay check. I could go on and on...
bad,"Was hostile environment with no respect from local management. Lead manager in office incompetent, With no clue as to how what the rest os the staffs jobs entailed on a day to day basis."
bad,"As a male caregiver, I can't stress enough to STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL!"
bad,"Start up company with huge turnover"
bad,"The culture within this company is horrible.  The Marketing Director is a micro-manager who does not listen to new ideas and has unrealistic expectations.  The CEO does not have a clinical background and is a bit naive when it comes to medical terminology and patient criteria for rehab services.  The medical director does not seem to take on challenging cases and plays it safe.  There is no room for advancement.  The attitude within this establishment is negative.  Everyone complained about their jobs.  A bunch of old, negative individuals."
bad,Work place moral leaves a lot to be desired. Overwhelmed with amount of work to be done
bad,"This is the worst company you could ever work for; I have read reviews for different HealthSouth facilities across the country and they are all awful. We stayed loosing staff members, people literally walking off the job!.. They feed you with lies to get you in the door but you never see these holiday bonuses and such; the management does not care about the floor workers. We STAYED under staffed having to take care of 10-13 patients each night. Weekends it's usually 13-19 patients a piece. Management is corrupt, nurses are all messy and stirring up drama and they hide things to cover their own tales. Incidents with ruses don't get reported to corporate like they say they are. WARNING: avoid this company at all costs. It's not called HELLSOUTH for a reason. "
bad,We have had a 100% turnover of the Dr's for our facility. We are regularly WAY understaffed. Typical RN/patient ratio is 8/9(sometimes 10) to one RN.
bad,"Liars.Only concerned about money.Talk a good game, but only"
bad,"Job specs never truly explained. Received no teaching, guidelines pretty much fly by seat of your pants. No support, requirements change at the whim of administration. Was ""Exempt"" yet expected to"
bad,You will work overtime most 12 hour shifts. There have been many changes in management and much turnover. Management does not appreciate staff at all. The work assigned is beyond doable. You will definitely be exhausted when you finally go home.
bad,The management and HR were very shady. There was unethical things everywhere and even corporate didn’t cars. The department was extremely understaffed and work conditions were disgusting. It was horrible just don’t do it.
bad,"Leadership does not support the employees and lie to make up things if they do not like you.  Nurses are disrespectful and feel they are above following rules.  The pay is horrible.  You are overworked.  If census is low, you are forced to take PTO.  Some of the doctors talk to you like you are garbage because they do not like the rules.  It is a nightmare.  They will tell you that they promote within, but it is an outright lie."
bad,They never have enough staff.  I was having to do stuff that was not respiratory related.  I was called in the office to be told that they was downsizing and my job was one that was being affected and I only had a couple days notice before I was left without a full time job and no benefits.
bad,Management sucks they are very narcissistic and condone Evil being done to patients and staff by other narcissistic Dogs that work there! Just a Demonic and evil place to work! I was compensated 34/hr and it still wasn’t enough to make me stay and work part time! That should tell you something 👌🏽
bad,No room for advancement....poor management....drama filled old people like crabs in a bucket....poor management overall...Dietary Dept sucks and is treated poorly.
bad,RN’s prefer to socialize over getting up from a chair to help a patient. Very unorganized management. CNO has her favorites. She likes the ones that do all the slacking. While their best workers pick up all the slack. High turnover rate. They have a “no pass zone” meaning all staff is supposed to answer   But they certainly do not or if they do they just come and tell one that they know will do the work.call lights.
bad,"Was the WORST hospital/health care setting I have ever seen. Patients were neglected, cursed at, and made fun of in earshot distance on a daily basis as well as family members.  Multiple patients crying everyday due to awful treatment. Pain management was NOT key and multiple patients were discharged, because they had a 3 strike policy meaning if they missed 3 therapy sessions they were out, and “someone else’s problem”, but would be In so much pain they couldn’t physically stand to move, therefore they were not getting adequate care, or even a chance to heal and progress before being thrown out. Insurance money was main focus, would except patients who had trach tubes, paralyzed, or in coma like states, who could not even hold head up on own, and make them try to do therapy. There was already a lawsuit filed because of negligence, resulting in busting her head wide open. Another woman’s hip was rebroken during her physical therapy session. Doctor would brush off anyone he didn’t like, and only made rounds once every two sundays. Some patients would stay 3 weeks and never see him. Nurses were rude, and would not help CNAs at all, several call lights going off at once, two CNAs for 48 patients and they would sit scrolling through Facebook, not paying any attention. Most nurses would take all day, more than half the time, would not even address patients concerns or problems, would leave it for “next shift” who would also neglect to take care of it. Some upper management was racially insensitive to Muslim/African American staff regularly. Staff would bicker and yell at each other"
bad,"Decent work-life balance.  Compensation was arbitrarily changed from full-time to part-time then PRN (per need) without benefits. A previously-retired employee was brought back in, presumably for considerably less than they were paying me.  "
bad,"Poor Management If you are new to this area in Augusta you will be treated poorly compared to the ones that have been there years. You won’t win when you know you are telling the truth and they field workers certain ones are nasty poor no infection control, certain workers are poorly dressed and hygiene is not presentable to be in contact with family’s and the clients."
bad,not a good place to work they flex you every other day so it was hard to get 40 hours  the CEO is crazy  and does not know what he is doing and helen the him director is mean and and will not listen they want all the him work done  with less hours and they make u work off the clock
bad,"No health care facility is perfect, a hospitals priority is always the patient . Their satisfaction, the care taken to provide for their health. This hospitals leadership, their directors had no sympathy in their soul. The pressure was always on and being understaffed never helped. Expect the most out of your employees always but it should be noted that they ought to be given the appropriate number of patients and be encouraged to take the time as needed to provide the correct documentation. This job definitely teaches you how to hustle, utilize what you do have but overall draining."
bad,"This is a great job if YOU ARE A RN!!! CNA's BEWARE!!! They will lie to get you in the door and make everything sound good but IT IS THE TOTAL OPPOSITE!!!!! The patient/workload is very stressful. Most nurses DONT HELP!!! AND THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO!!!! They are always charting or passing meds. I was told by the manager that technically it is my job to answer the lights. Techs run around all day attemping to spend the appropriate time with a patient for adequate care but most times it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE. You HAVE TO RUSH!!! This is not fair to the patients. You will be handling 10-15 patients daily ALONE!!!!  THERE WILL BE ALOT OF TOTAL AND BARIATRIC PATIENTS!!!! There is alot of favortism shown at this location and Tons of things that are swept under the rug for the right person. I enjoyed the friends and relationships I made here but BE CAREFUL OF MANAGEMENT. (ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIENDS) "
bad,"I have worked to Encompass 4 years. I found out supervisors/ upper management  don't care with their Clinicians. They care about the numbers in survey ( Management does not want to hear compliant. Even the compliant is non valid Clinician is always at fault and getting blame)"
bad,I worked at this place for 4 years and let me tell you it is completely stressful not a day went by when I didnt feel like I was in fear for my job. Management does not care about its employees and you have no voice. They mistreated us all the time by calling us on our days off saying if we did not come in it would be considered a no call no show. So happy to have departed from this place.
bad,Very poor management with little concern for how over worked the nurses truly are and patient safety.  Management does not listen when nurses voice concern over the types of patients admitted or the lack of help on the floors.  The management is only concerned with keeping the beds full and the money coming in. Many of the patients should be in hospice or nursing home setting and are just plain too sick to be in a rehab facility.  Extremely high stress at the nursing level.  Nurses have difficulty doing what is needed for the patients when they also do the jobs of the techs .  Patients are also in a dangerous situation due to the high levels of patient acuity throughout the patient population and the nurse/patient ratio which much too high.  Many staff have already quit and some are looking for employment elsewhere.
bad,"Many promises, zero delivery!"
bad,"When you see an opening to work in the Admissions Department at Health South in Florence, SC Run!! The staff here makes huge errors and then put is on you. There is no tracking system in place to make sure errors are correct. Bad place to work. I should've known something was up when the other worker left and went to another state to work. I went from full time to part time in one month."
bad,I worked for the company for over 4 years as a PRN professional.  The daily work load was taken on evenly by the professionals that I worked with and I helped to consult with doctors concerning dosage levels and medications.
bad,"the management sucked, any time a problem was reported they didnt listen and just took action, very rude, the only good thing about this place is the pay"
bad,"Although the benefits package, sign-on-bonus, hiring process was sufficient, the patient:nurse ratios were unsafe.  Management as well as the CNO position appeared to be revolving doors.  Very little leadership and organization.  Poor environment for new nurses as bad habits can be retained if not careful.  The only pluses to the facility were the speech pathology and physical therapy/occupational therapy departments. As an RN, I hope to never be roped into working for such an inadequate company that has a primary focus of making money.  Be very careful as this facility and company has been investigated several times by the department of justice for Medicare fraud."
bad,"Communication between Management and employees are very poor, also  with the patients."
bad,"I hated working here. I just needed medical skills so after 5 months I switched to PRN and worked 4 days a month and still couldn't stand it! I had an awesome team and that is what made it hard to leave. I completed a year in this hell hole and am happier than I have ever been. I worked both day and night shifts and there were very few CNA's that actually cared about the patients. A lot of them were so unhappy and mistreated the patients. I would always have to do the patient care during medication passes because the CNAs would be hiding! They tell you in orientation that as an LVN at Healthsouth you're not allowed to spike IV bags but no one has time to help even if they wanted to. So ALL the things they said an LVN is't supposed to do...well, guess what? You do it anyway because the RNs have their own 13 patients to tend to.  The patient to staff ratio is horrible for the number of patients that have IVs, tubes,  wound treatments, or are fall risk. Most patients were not even able to benefit from rehab and Drs admitted this. The ratio was 1 nurse to 13 patients and ONE CNA TO 20 patients!?!?!? They say the norm is 8-7.....which never happened. Plus there were no computers...everything was done by hand on paper which made it hard when you have 10-13 patients and getting an admission. I hated night shift because there was only ONE unit clerk for TWO units!?!?! She was running back and forth trying to transcribe orders and answer phones. And if she didn't finish she would leave at the end of her shift and leave all the charts for the nurses to transcribe even if we were processing"
bad,"The best part about working in this rehab factory is that any other job feels like a dream afterward. Mandatory overtime and high caseloads prevail. Simply too many patients for staff to handle effectively.  Management is uncaring and dishonest. They work employees like dogs and in general, do not respect them. The patients themselves(the appropriate ones anyway) were delightful. Some were far too sick to be there, but therapists were to drag them to therapy anyway to meet their ""intensity"". The environment was rife with backstabbing and tattling amongst employees. SO happy to have moved on!"
bad,"This is disturbing, to see all these comments on this company. I unfortunately have seen it all first hand a little to late. Management is horrible, they do not care about anything but numbers. Policies here are worthless and patient care is questionable. This place is so understaffed its disgusting. I would never have anyone I know have care here or work here for that matter. You dont get paid enough for everything you do and all the gossip....do not tell anyone of your life because its used against you in the end. There should be a warning sign here that says:WORK OR RECEIVE CARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
bad,The people that were hired to manage me knew nothing about acute rehab....I worked at Largo and had 2 CEO's and 3 DMO's in a year's time. There were many qualified internal candidates but corporate brought in outside people with zero clinical skills or knowledge of the market. The hospital lost alot of experienced people because they failed to see that they had great employees that should have been promoted...I left because I was so frustrated with my new boss who was completely inept and drove people away. It could have been a great place if they would have promoted from within but apparently corporate decided to bring in inexperienced people who were unable to grasp what this hospital was all about...I blame MM for being so short sighted...when I started there it was great but corporate and MM created an environment that was untenable...I wish you all the best but my ride alongs consisted of looking for condos for the DMO...she was the WORST person I have ever worked for....I also left for a better job with higher pay!
bad,"I’ve been doing home health for 9+ years as an LVN, I have never experienced the lack of organization, poor management, and lack of care for employees as I have in the Central Houston office. The branch continuously took on hi acuity patients that needed extensive nursing care yet didn’t have the staff in place to care for the patients. The training for new employees was minimal at best beyond the “in house video training program”. The manager was new in his role and had never managed a home health office before. It showed in the lack of support and leadership in the office."
bad,"The staff is shell shocked distrusts upper mgmt due to high volume turnovers of mgmt in the last 5 years. They can't keep middle managers/supervisors because when not allowing staff to undermine them the upper mgmt is undermining them in some game of ""gotcha"" that's obviously been going on for a long time there. Questionable use of surveillance intimidation of staff for HR matters rather than patient safety or security of the facility. A total mickey mouse operation. always understaffed and overwhelmed. not enough bed alarms or other safety equipment. Always playing small ball, jumping from crisis to crisis with no big picture plan. sleepy or drunk CNO. Nurse Manager missing in action. Both convinced if they could just discipline enough people problems would be solved which never works. They use a core of foreign nurses under 3 year contracts (on work visas I assume) who can't or won't complain to slide by some of the least safe patient care I have ever seen. I understand this is a company wide policy"
bad,"The company itself may be okay, but the Management at the Houston/ Cypress office is horrible. Very incompetent. Very high turn-over rate among nurses. Until they understand that it takes a strong, professional staff to solidify a company, they will never really be successful. No loyalty among Management with field staff. Cut- throat and offensive."
bad,The RVP of sales was literally worthless. I don’t understand how she even received her position. They push all the Encompass propaganda on you. The operations team is amazing to work with.
bad,"If you are full time forget having a life, you are required to take call at least one weekend a month and expect to see a full load of pts those days.  The PRN staff rarely work weekends so you are required to see all the patients on top of your full load Monday - Friday schedule."
bad,"This facility has the rudest bunch of employees I have ever worked with. Management knows, yet they just respond with, ""during your interview we mentioned that there were SEVERAL different personalities here."" They won't fix the problem because they cannot find people that want to work here. That alone should tell you something. "
bad,"The cooperate mission and direction is amazing. Unfortunately, the individual branches are not held to that standard. The branch I worked for was run by a clique of nurses who were rarely doing their actual jobs and a field supervisor with ZERO clinical experience. It was hard to get responses from the field andvwhen you did get it, it was rude. I once finally decided just to go to the office on the issue to find everyone huddled in the office in a handbag discussion. You were never informed of who would be in or out of the office on what day. You were required to deal with impossible schedules and some very unsavory home environments. Anything and everything is done to keep patients on service, making your job a charting nightmare!"
bad,Company is great to work for while in orientation but right after your out there is no teamwork and no follow through with what has been promised. You will be told one thing and it won’t happen.
bad,"It is a very fast paced environment with little appreciation from the CEO.  She is rude and disrespectful. Is unfamiliar with certain roles, but has no problem insulting the profession.  The pay is laughable.  Don't expect to advance if you do your job because it won't happen. The staff do not like to be held accountable and you will be blamed for enforcing rules.  You are automatically guilty without hearing your side of the story."
bad,CEO came from Texas and everything seemed great. We learned he likes to micro manage and tries to charm people but doesn’t mean well at all. HR is very only believes the person who complains and doesn’t like to hear your side of anything. CNO can’t be approached and doesn’t practice what she preaches. The leadership team needs a revamp and corporate doesn’t seem to notice it.
bad,Very fast past some nurses are great some techs are ok. MANAGEMENT HORRIBLE and if your not their friend omg watch out they will treat you very bad. I’ve never had to work some where that I felt I had to watch out for my job due to personal reasons. They show favoritism and all. They want you to go above and beyond but never say thank you!!! Was like a slave plantation!!
bad,Encompass has finally heard the continuous complaints from the sales team regarding poor upper sales management. This postive change has inspired those of us who were beat down and discouraged by this person. The threats have subsided and there is light at the end of the tunnel.
bad,profit oriented- zero concern for employees or their lives   no work life balance at all.  horrible place if you have children or any type of life or people who may need you
bad,"The administration at HealthSouth is atrocious.  I love my job and I enjoy the people I work with; however, the leadership makes the environment intolerable.  The turn over at this location is high due to the incompetence of the leaders."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the patients, families, other entities, etc. but was not treated professionally by management. The flex in hours was not what expected or told on hire either."
bad,"I would not recommend HealthSouth to anyone.  The nurse to patient ratio was low, and I feel that both the patients and staff were at risk for possible injury."
bad,"I really enjoy my co workers and my job taking care of patients in need. Healthsouth offers great compensation and benefits for all positons. However the administration and management at this particular location are extremely unprofessional and lack compassion for their employees and patients. They offer ""self-scheduling"" but once you make your schedule in the available slots they change your schedule without asking or telling you if it's ok. I had a day shift position and they pulled me to nights without even asking me if it was ok. I have family, school, and a second day shift job that will not allow me to work nights at this time. After being a employee in excellent standing with the company for well over two years they refused to work with me or let me go part time or PRN. If you are a student or have a second job, do not apply. They will not work around other employees schedules either. They have also failed to give pay raises to deserving employees. I am a nurses assistant, not a nurse. The nurse assistants are always understaffed and have back breaking work loads. The patient to nurse ratio is too high. Nurses are required to take up to 11 patients that require very demanding needs. The types of patients that are being admitted to this rehab are generally ""too sick"" to be in this type of hospital. They should be at a more critical facility. The work load for the nurse to patient ratio is extremely dangerous. Administration is allowing patients that are too sick or too critical to be in this type of hospital setting which is extremely dangerous and they are doing it solely"
bad,Patient ratio is unsafe.  Nurses have no backup from administration.  It's all about patient satisfaction and patient load is never taken into account.
bad,The manager is very unprofessional and does not take the job seriously. More like here for a paycheck than for patient care. I truly loved all my patients though and hate that I'm no longer able to see them.
bad,"Changed drastically over the last five years. Case Managers keep quitting, office personal turnover every year, company hires nonprofessionals to replace nurses without their knowledge of medical terminology etc.. No evaluations which means no raises! All other pedi. agencies pay higher."
bad,"Great pay but never enough help to get everything accomplished, still paper charting, no consistency on how things are to be done, changes made but not related to the staff, quick to blame things on nurses, nurses are at the bottom and catch things from all departments."
bad,"I loved working with the patients, but the management was terrible. I was bullied and when I sought was threatened by the director of therapy to not speak with human resources."
bad,"Management was poor, employees were flexed weekly and not always in fair routines. The demand they put on the nurses were too much. Due to low patients, they would bring in anyone, but to save money flex staff when they needed the extra help."
bad,"So disconnected, they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  They forget appointments and forget even who they speak with. They demand performance but never show up on their end."
bad,"At a local level, this company is devoid of ethics. Ironic that the ads for employment focus on ethics, because in reality they are not open to discussion of ethical concerns when brought to their attention by employees."
bad,"Although it was nice at the start, I quickly realized how naive I was. Certified Departments treat everyone else like they are worthless because Management spoils them like children with pay.... EVS and Dietary deserve better pay, but more importantly better respect! Maybe management could take a few days out of the year to observe how hard these fine people work, the attitude they have to put up with, and how, through it all, still tries to remain ""cheerful"" for the patients and visitors .... all that  for a 25 cent raise a year?!?"
bad,i had some great co workers and patients but managemet had cliques and does not care about work preformance just bodies
bad,"If you are looking to apply for the Cash Applications role at the Home Office in Dallas, Tx do NOT do it . The “manager” shows favoritism to her “team lead” , makes up different rules for different people. She also likes to spread lies and create drama around the department.  All she does is sit in her office all day doing absolutely nothing and talk about other employees to her “team lead”. the “team lead” will barely train you and then will blame you for all the errors. She likes to tell you to do the wrong thing on purpose then turn around and say you don’t listen and swear up and down she never said that . You have a team lead who can’t even keep up With the same workload that they give others.  These people love to try and bully you (especially via email) then when you give it back to them they love to play the victim. You stick up for yourself and they will do whatever they have to to get rid of you . Save yourself the unnecessary headache they’ve been through 5 cash applications Specialist in 2018 alone!!!!!"
bad,"If you interviewed ever for a position and was not chosen, they automatically ban you from ever interviewing for any other opportunities you may be better qualified for..that's just not right. That's not a good employer to me."
bad,Poor management through out the entire hospital . Management attitude is very foul and sour towards employees. They just don't have any respect to the employees.
bad,Management sucked. They thought they can talk to you anyway they wanted to. They made us do heavy lifting that men should do. The whole environment was negative
bad,"CNO is a bully, she belittles people.  Never enough staff. You are always being threatened that you are gonna lose employment.  CNO makes Lots of mistakes in the company.    She is horrible.   She is very unprofessional and  comes at you in very aggressive manner."
bad,"New leadership spends too much time in her workout gear and long lunches, her staff have no idea where she is.   Special considerations to management where staff are not afforded light duty,  There will be no resolution and no team building as long as the SR. Leadership is still stuffing their pockets as they are downsizing the people that need to work the most.  Yet special bonus are agreed upon with RNs.  No fair and equal treatment there.  Stay far away from this place until the corporate office finally catches on that the problem is easily corrected.  If you currently work there, keep your resume updated."
bad,I would never have taken this position if I had known that hospital policies and procedures are so lax and most of the time not even followed.  Staff get away with many activities which are directly against hospital policies and  there are no consequences for these actions
bad,Management is running the place in the ground. They will let the nurses drown. They do not come out of their office to help when the workload is unbearable. It could be a really nice place to work if it was managed fairly and professionally.
bad,Something isn't right with the way that corporation is doing business. There needs to be a group of professional administration employees willing to take over & fix the quirks.
bad,"Hospice"
bad,"It was very uncomfortable going into the office. Promised 10-20 visits per week but worked 2-8 visits per week. Offered more visits only when the other aide called off. Communication was horrible, pretty sure none of the office staff knows how to use a phone. Discharge patients too soon."
bad,Overall not much positive to say. I would not recommend this as a long term place of employment. Management was not what I would consider to be caring or interested in their employees.
bad,"The hiring process for this company is ridiculous! You have to have 5 emails from former coworkers or friends and they send them lengthy questionnaires to fill out about you.  No one wants to do all that, then the RN assessment and app. I can understand the assessment and app but all those emails! I've noticed a high turnover cause they always need help, and word of mouth I've heard it's a horrible place to work."
bad,This is HealthSouth. They are horrible and only care about $$. Not the safety or wellbeing of their patients. Don't let a name change fool you. This place is a death sentence.
bad,applied got the job. Did my pre employment the next week. Was told I could start on the following Tuesday. Waited around for almost 2 weeks before they called me back and told me I could start. I had to apply to another job because they could tell me a start date. Needless to say I called and emailed HR for over a week before anyone got back to me. Glad I took another job.. If the hiring process was that bad lord knows what it would've been like to actually work there.
bad,You would always be understaffed for every shift.  Documentation was repetitive and had to over document everything.  No help was available when it was necessary.  Felt overworked and stressed all the time.
bad,Does not care about workers needs. Care about money and let you know thats all they care about non appreciative of workers.
bad,"Scheduled yearly physicals for  employees, drug testing.  Submitted Workman Comp application for the employees. Scheduling bio hazard removal, and planning yearly health fairs.  We attended to minor injures."
bad,staff and management unorganized. Definite need more staff to achieve better patient-nurse ratios
bad,"The staff were all great to work with! It was a fast paced facility and everything had a routine. A typical day at work would include several showers or baths, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Some people of the management team were really great and you could tell that they were there to help others but then there were several people that didnt care about the patients or their employees, they were just there for the paycheck. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the patients that wanted it most. I dont like seeing someone having to give up their homes and go live with a relative or in a nursing home because they were no longer able to care for themselves like before. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the patients. I love to hear stories from the elderly about the long ago days."
bad,"OMG!!!!!OMG!!!!!!unless your willing to be a undercover snitch,you dont stand a chance,money is all they care about,not the client or the employees.patients are not cared for,the nurses tell them certain patients needs alarms,do they listen,how bout a patient walked out of there into a busy morning of high traffic all because they didn't listen to the nurses concerns about that patient.I thank God for delivering me out of that place!!this is Memphis north facility which is ran as a nursing home.""""UNDER STAFFED""""YOU MIGHT COME IN AND THERE WILL BE ONE RNT WITH 40TO 30 PATIENTS,THEN THEY EXPECT THE NURSES TO STILL BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS,TURNOVER ARE SO RIDICULOUS!!!NURSES CANNOT DO THEIR IF THEY HAVE TO BE AN RNT AS WELL AS A NURSE,THEY NEED TO BE FOCUS ON THEIR JOB!!!HORRIBLE FACILITY!!!"
bad,"OMG!!!!!OMG!!!!!!unless your willing to be a undercover snitch,you dont stand a chance,money is all they care about,not the client or the employees.patients are not cared for,the nurses tell them certain patients needs alarms,do they listen,how bout a patient walked out of there into a busy morning of high traffic all because they didn't listen to the nurses concerns about that patient.I thank God for delivering me out of that place!!this is Memphis north facility which is ran as a nursing home."
bad,"loved my co-workers, the doctors were very in to training me on new things. but the management needed work"
bad,Not a good choice. There was room for many improvements. I did not like this job at all.
bad,"This place was absolutely awful.  I worked here as a new graduate and never had worked in healthcare.  I got 2 days of training and then was on my own with 2 patients.  By a week, I had 5 and some we're rather complex.  Everytime I worked, it always seemed like I got the most complex patients, all the ones with trachs, peg tubes and immobile.  By the end of working there I have up to 10 patients at once!!!  I only lasted 3 months."
bad,"It was the best job, a typical day at work would be to help others and do your job on time. I learned how to do the job correct and ask for help if need. I really enjoyed helping people get well. It was not a hard job at all...."
bad,This company does not care for the welfare of their employees. Nurses are given workload that are not possible for a nurse to complete in a day. Quality has been declining.
bad,"Nice work place "
bad,Run don't walk.🏃🏃 Terrible place to work. New management is only concered about themselves. Heavy work load. High stress environment. You have no work life balance. No one listens to your complaint.
bad,They are not understanding of people's personal issues going on in their life and unwilling to work with your schedule or make any accommodations.
bad,terrible management
bad,"If you want to experience nurse burnout this is the place for you! You spend 8-10 hours out on the road working only to come home and have 2+ hours left of documentation to do. Documentation is ALWAYS scrutinized and you’re never shown the correct way to do things, but if you do something wrong you’re likely to be in trouble. The orientation process is terrible. If you’re lucky the preceptor you’re with wants to teach you the right way of doing things, but if you’re unlucky, they’ll teach you the wrong way of doing things and that will come back and bite you in the end. Ethics and compliance are a joke and any concerns that are brought up will be swept under the rug if it’s not beneficial to management or the management clique. Most of the coworkers are great, some are out to cause trouble, and it’s hard to tell the difference. When you’re on call for emergencies you basically have a day’s worth of work already scheduled to you so there’s no break often for 12-14 day stretches depending on staffing. They try to entice with the pay and the benefits, but you’re better off going and working at a hospital and leaving this home health organization behind."
bad,"Over a year with lack of pay! Lack of management, lack of everything! Find a better place to work! Everyone gossips and there is always drama! Always Drama!"
bad,"Of all places this is by far the worst place. The FAVORITISM the lack of care and appreciation of employees by CNO, nurse manager and supervisors is unbelievable. When there have been so many complaints and concerns with how staff is mistreated, treated unfairly and even situations of racism, the CNO and management cover for the person. Look at the high turnover the reason for so "
bad,Probably one of the worst places I've worked.  Average case load of patients can go from  7-10 patients for an RN.  NO help from supervisors or managers.  You no longer discharge a patient and you have an admission coming in.  Management lies and the work culture is poor.
bad,"health south is rehab hospital, since the CEO of the company awas arrested for medical or insurance fraud,, the employees became very frustrated, they have no annual increase or promotion, so most of the senior Respiratory therapist Quit the job."
bad,"Management was not supportive, was unsympathetic, showed favoritism to some in the detriment of others based on personal likes and dislikes. There was a constant turn over due to this climate. Often it was understaffed, assignments were unfair due to favoritism. It was very hard to get a day off when you needed it, nurses were expected to ask 2-3 months in advance, and even then it was not guaranteed. Workload was heavy."
bad,"No, don't work here.  One week they will call every day wanting you to work every waking minute.  Next week they give you leave every time they can.  Management calls the employees lazy and no good all the time in front of patients."
bad,While working at HealthSouth Albuquerque I found that the work life balance is bad if you expect or need a solid schedule with solid hours this is not the place for you.
bad,There was a high emphasis on productivity and a lack of emphasis on patient care in the clinic I was based in. I did not have strong support from management.
bad,"Encompass has gone down hill since I first started with them 3 yrs ago. Especially now that it's run by Health South (another horrible health care provider). "
bad,"Too consumed with profit and lack of concen for patient care needs. No urgency to get out and provide skilled patient care needs, worried about getting the business but not providing quality care. Would never refer a friend or family to be cared for by this money grubbing agency."
bad,"HealthSouth bought out our hospital and ruined it. Took a company that was dedicated to patient care and turned it into a 3 ring circus. Had shifts of nurses walk off the floor. Shifts of kitchen staff walk out. Therapist going home and working hours at night to do documentation because they are not given time to properly report patient care. Management wants employees to be ""puppets."" If you are willing to be a puppet this is the company for you. Don't ask a question about their unethical practices towards patient care though. You will be fired without question. This company doesn't care about what the patient's needs are. All they care about is how much money the patient's insurance will pay them. They understaff units and departments and overload employees beyond extremes. Then get write up happy towards those employees when they get behind or ask for help. Their benefits are atrocious for such a large company. It's affordable but doesn't pay for anything. Co-pays are ridiculous for medications."
bad,No team work AT ALL. No help from management in any situation. Accepts patients that are not stable enough for rehab with limited amount of resources for help.
bad,If you are nonclinical you have no value as an employee. You are expendable. This type of environment is difficult to work in when you are considered to be of no value. They have made promises but in the end they never keep them.
bad,"Encompass does not make orientation a priority. You set in front of a computer for days however the computer doesn't support you in the ability to do the required job."
bad,"DO NOT work for Encompass- they are an unethical company that will make you feel that managers/upper level managers care, when in reality, it is all about the profits and patient count."
bad,Worst place ever.  Used to be a very awesome place until new management.  Now its cut throat.  Will only advance if you are good friends with management not by how well you do your job.
bad,"Overworked, under paid. The patient to staff ratio is dangerous for both employees and patients, especially if you base it on acuity. Nurses consistently have 8-9 patients each, and techs have on average have 15-18 patients, and that is if everyone shows up for shift. I cannot count the number of times that I was the only tech on the floor with 25+ patients."
bad,They select who they like and train them as charge nurses not minding how many years experience they have. As long as they like you or your color you will keep on rising. The segregation in the York PA  facility is terrible.
bad,"I can honestly say without hesitation this place is the worst place to work if your a cna. Nurses are more important, no voice,cut hrs of ft employees"
bad,Patient care is one of the most important aspects of the job. We were ALWAYS short staffed. The patient techs are always asked to work extra shifts and it is extremely easy to get burnt out if you are always at work. The base pay is extremely discouraging and there are not a lot of opportunities for advancement in the company without years of schooling which you will never have time to complete since you’re always working.
bad,"This location is horrible ! The upper management shows favoritism.They will switch the schedule on you without notice. This is suppose to be a Rehabilitation hospital, but it’s more like a nursing home. Patients are dying to often and a lot of the workers, don’t want to work.  People have been leaving left and right due to their lack of management."
bad,No work life balance. They expect you to see 8 or more patients a day because there is not enough help. Management talks about employees and has favorites.
bad,Overall the company has gone through alot of changes. The company isn't fair to the employees. There are alot of other things that could be said but it's not worth it.
bad,"Worked 12 hr shifts with patients who were very confused, multi-trauma, and wounds. Immense amount of medications given. Any complaint by a patient or family was ALWAYS the nurse or tech's fault. Poor place to work."
bad,"I was employed there for over a year as contract prn RN. I witnessed three nurse managers and three CNOs come and go. Current CEO is an occupational therapists who DOES NOT know what physicians and nurses go through. While company emphasizes on diversity, all directors from each departments are Caucasian. Lateral violence is a common denominator as well as high turnover rates and acute care patient transfers. Nurse to patient ratio is anywhere between 7/1 to 9/1 with the expectations that the nurse pass out all meds, collect lab samples, attend meetings, provide wound care, document on FIMs, provide basic care and toileting, attend interdisciplinary meetings that last half to one hour, perform unit clerk duties on occasion, admit and discharge patients, etc etc. All with expectations of getting out on time. Leadership leave early and are not actively engaged with the staff. They are always in ""meetings"" and take 2 hour lunches, leave half day on Fridays etc. Beware of the techs and lifers...they are the spies and instigators. Take care of your license. Document document document. Most patients admitted are not rehab appropriate. Watch out for the ""click"" who take care of each other and run anyone out they see as a threat to their sub-par nursing practice."
bad,They push you to your breaking point underpaid overworked horrible staffing most of management does not care about what employees are going through they push it to the side. their orientation process takes two months and they make you sit for full weeks doing computer trainings of things you can’t understand fully because you need to have Better explanations of during orientation for straight eight hours shifts.  you don’t even get orientated the correct way then they throw you to the wolves and expect you to know everything. some of the coworkers Are helpful however most nursing staff will not lift a finger to help the technicians so all in all you are a technician who has up to 9 to 12 patients on your own and even other Techs will not help.  The supervisors do not care what condition the employees are in while they’re doing their job as long as there is a body there to do the job i.e. under the influence of something.  When I asked for further education so I could do more in my job to help my job flow easier for me and whichever nurse I was working with I was pushed to the side and basically told no one ever asks for that so they didn’t feel it was necessary. Do not recommend them at all.
bad,"This company is likely a great place to work in other areas of the country, but in New England is not competitive in wages, work/life balance, or in benefits.  Health Insurance plan is unusually bad compared to other employers in the area.  Clinicians are great, and I wouldn't hesitate to have them treat my family members, but very high turnover in management and support staff makes job feel insecure and prevents smooth sailing out in the field."
bad,"Company rating based on ""encouraging"" employees to vote them as the best place to work. "
bad,The hospital still has paper charting. The work load is not what was told in the interview. The best part of the job were the other nurses. Eight hour shifts only available. Do not ask for a day off because you will not get it.
bad,"It was a very hostile work environment. They have infastructure issues, and a management team that really needs improvement.  THEY are disrespectful to one another, and disrespectful to their employees. I am  a professional,  so I will not list certain names."
bad,"Upper management of hospital and company are poisonous to a positive work environment. Constantly pitting one employee against another. Secretly and deliberately creating scenarios to discredit employees and then fire them. MANY personality conflicts between management and employees. Severely understaffed often. Census stayed very low for extended periods of time, employees were often called off and would eventually quit to find a more stable work environment."
bad,"A typical day included treating 20-40 patients for various injuries and physical ailments. The day also included communication orally and/or written with physicians and case workers.  The hardest part of my job was realizing that athletic verses nonathletic injuries could not be treated equal.  The intensity of the treatment programs varied on the age of the patient and the patient's response to treatment.  the other equally challenging part of this job was the every changing insurance coverage for treatments.  At the time this career came to an end, I felt as though my hands were tied in how much time I could spend on treating a patient.  It was as if big brother was telling me what was best for the patient based on cost and not based on concern for the patient's well being.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to improve the area of injury, answering the patient's questions and putting their minds at ease in the event of surgery, etc."
bad,"One thing that bothers me about this company is the lack of Appreciation this company fails to give its hard working employees. they are more worried about a budget that their employees. I don't think they completely satisfy their motto when it comes to us. Some of their policies are wack and they always get the better end of the deal. As far as management, they say they are on your side and sympathize with you but its all for show they can talk the talk but never walk the walk. I can say one of the perks is that you make your own schedule, no if ands or buts and there is always room for overtime and job security."
bad,"Employees are overworked, unappreciated, & expected to keep going to keep the administrators' pockets full. It's more about the numbers, # of pt's brought in, not the quality."
bad,"Difficult management , low pay, poor life /work balance, more work for less pay, no set schedule, very long days, not much flexibility, poor benefits,"
bad,More concerned about complaints then real satisfaction.  No support from supervisors. Pt nurse ratio is terrible. Staffing was more about them than employee concerns.
bad,"I refused to be on call every other weekend since “on call” means you work the weekend all day.  So, because management ran off all of the nurses with their dictatorship management skills, we had 2 LVNs to take call.  I was given 2 options.  Work the 12 days straight, 2 off, and repeat...or, I could work 6 days a week.  Filed a complaint and was told my job offer said I was obligated to take call and to figure it out. 8 gave them my badge and tablet."
bad,"Unable to keep nurses, poor leadership.  Leadership more worried about their breaks and don’t know what’s going on  They don’t reward hard work and just keep “bodies” for staffing numbers"
bad,They offer great benefits. I have worked for them 10+ years. The management use to be Great. Use to really care for employees and their families. However they are not a caring company now. You are just a number to them. They need a better management team. It really is awful to see such a great company lacking in that department.
bad,"In this facility only pay attention to bullying ladies, making up that I hide , when I was providing care to patients. All other RN AND CNA’s chanting , telling the story of their life instead providing care to the patients. I couldn’t understand how they have too much spare time when I was running in the hallway room to room answering call lights. I hardly have time to eat or take snybreaks"
bad,"When first came on board, the culture was more relaxed and even-paced.   Work was hard but not overly stressful.  It was rare to work past 5pm, when after-hours oncall was to take over.  Since new management came aboard earlier this year, the culture has become  very stressed, and clinical staff are tired and overworked.   Mgmt insists on high productivity goals weekly.  This causes clinical staff to sometimes work from 8am-9pm just to meet daily and weekly productivity goals.   No overtime is offered for having to work those extra hours.   Personnel are discouraged from taking time during their day to stop and take care of essential errands that cannot be done any other time.   Stopping for lunch is out of the question as that takes time away from seeing patients.   Management does not protect employees who speak up about substandard care they night see at homes or facilities we see patients at, preferring to protect referral sources.   Management is not interested in hearing from employees about how they are feeling overworked and burned out, telling them it is their individual responsibility to get their work done."
bad,They don't offer enough staff to help with the position leaving ONE person to complete the work for 70-80 patients nor do they enough pay. It's a 10 hour job expected to be done in 8 hours by one person.
bad,"This facility is a constant revolving door of nursing staff.  After 2years only 2 nurses left from my hire on.  This organization follows a punitive education policy.  No support by management at all.  Nurse to patient ratio goes up to 11 pt to 1 nurse.  Extremely understaffed , to the point of DANGER.  VERY negative atmosphere.  Beware."
bad,Unreasonable assignment.  Management more worried about numbers than care of patient.  Staff is disposable.  21 RN have quit in the last year.  Management does not take care of staff.
bad,"After new CNO...short staffed, extremely high acuity for such short staffing. Poor staff morale, patient neglect due to staffing shortage.  Scheduling personnel known to delete requests for days off. A lot of dirty politics. This place has changed in the last year and not for the better. I was proud to say I worked for this establishment at one time because there was a patient first mentally, but now due to the decrease importance of the patient first motto and more of a let's line the pockets of the CEO and CNO mentality, it is a day to day chore to continue to work here."
bad,"Always having your tail. No support, and micromanagement. Pressured to grow sales team, but not allowed to hire, and multiple roadblocks with on boarding process for team members."
bad,"I can only rate this hospital when I worked there which when it first opened. There was a terrible, first-time CEO who waffled on everything. She relied on everyone else to run the hospital. Within the first year of the hospital's opening, all management had left except for the Rehab Director."
bad,Leadership changed over 3 times since my interview and acceptance into the position. All staff was a revolving door. Poor expectations from upper management. Many hours spent unpaid on tablet trying to get documentation in on time. No work/life balance.
bad,HealthSouth has provided what I've needed up until now.  The environment is professional and fun. My days are generally busy and at times can be a challenge
bad,Great place for therapy rehab. Poor upper management. No respect for nursing staff. Frequent nursing turnover. High patient ratios. Pay fair. Not flexible.
bad,"Encompass has wonderful top leadership, but leadership directly above the branch level leaves a lot to be desired. The experience for employees at each branch differ greatly depending on region. The Eastern region needs help. The excellence from the headquarters in Texas often does not trickle down to the branch level or field employees. Salaries are not competitive in the DMV area, neither is the reimbursement for mileage if you are a field employee. Cost for benefits is not competitive either."
bad,great hard working folks; hardest part of the job was the vague nature of responsibilities that went with the position. The best part was the challenge. Fun place to work never a dull moment.
bad,The branch I work at in Virginia is so unprofessional. The office staff is rude & condescending. You work long hours for little pay. You are given patients all over the place despite being told that you will only work in a remote area.
bad,"understaffed, management just causes problems....over worked. branch directer makes my girlfriend cry every time they have a ""talk""... she is sad so im sad too"
bad,As a front desk coordinator I had many responsibilities but was told that I could not advance past my position. Management was insensitive to both the needs of customers and employees.
bad,The pay is very low. They expect you to meet points but don't schedule enough patients to reach points or hours. You don't get hours while other nurses get overtime. You have to be willing to take job home with you and give  a lot of off the clock time. Holidays you are the only one on call and expected to see 14+patients in one day. They don't care if you have no time with your family or church on the holiday. Manager shows a lot of favoritism at this office.
bad,Terrible place to work. Management suck . The company only care about the money and half of the staff don't care about the patients
bad,"Typical day at work changes frequently because they are always adding another visit or two for you see that day."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of carrying a load of 12-18 patients who all required maximum assistance with bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, transferring, etc. ON MY OWN. The majority of the nurses never helped with patient care and worked the techs into the ground. Management is NOT oblivious to the issue, they just do not care. Director of Nursing and Nurse Manager are both useless and do not care a bit for their employees. Hardest part of the job was going in knowing I was going to leave in an immense amount of physical pain from lifting and pulling on 200lbs+ patients for 12 hours. I drove home in tears some days because of the severe pain from the shift I just worked. Did I mention I'm only 21 years old? Leaving a shift in so much pain that I could hardly move the next day? Highly recommend you do NOT work for this company."
bad,There is no typical day there. The hardest part of working here is having to perform job duties across multiple departments.
bad,"I enjoyed my position as a Receptionist.  I thrived on the client and co-worker interactions as well as helping with many various needs that came up.  I also enjoyed the data entry and various paper work that I was responsible for.  I liked the environment and independent aspect of my job.  "
bad,The pay wasn't good at all. If you weren't a higher up they didn't care about you. Management strictly all about profit and numbers. The foundation of the lakeshore facility needs a makeover from corporate down to the techs. They over work the tech staff in nursing and look down on the tech staff in the therapy department.
bad,"felt that I was doing all the work by myself because I was the late person and worked alone mostly and had a lot of responsibility that should have been handled by supervisor, lack of communication between co-workers and supervisor."
bad,A typical day at work at Health South for me was med passes and patient assessments.  I learned how to manage my time.  Management was a disappointment.  My co-workers where like family.  The hardest part of my job was leaving my patients each day.  The most enjoyable part of my job was know that I was able to make a difference in someone's life everyday.
bad,Nurses are working unsafe with up to 12 patients per shift.  No help.  Management is into getting their bonuses at any price.
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had. The pay was nice, and my director was very intelligent and interested in seeing me succeed... However, she had difficulty working with me because our CEO contradicted everything she had to say. He would even call me into his office to offer ""constructive criticism"" without her present. He seemed to get excited to find reasons to let people go, hospital wide, and had very questionable personal life problems that he brought into the workplace regularly. No one at corporate seems to notice or care about the very high turnover rate, and it seems like he intimidates his directors to do what he says, or else THEY are afraid of the consequences they will have to suffer from him if they do not. In just under a year, I've seen so many people get fired or quit, it is astounding. If you are looking for a stable work environment, this job is NOT for you."
bad,I love rehab nursing because of healthsouth. With rehab you get to see your patients get better. But healthsouth of tallahassee is th worst healthsouth ever.  They treat their employees badly and their patients like idiots.
bad,This job is physically demanding and employees are frequently prone to injuries.
bad,Ok place to work lots of confusion with management great place to keep up with cna skills
bad,administration as much as they try to put on a good front really doesn't care about its employees or how they treat them.
bad,currently looking for another job over worked management does not show compassion for staff
bad,"Nursing side not as rewarding high turn over rate, first time in 19yrs i went PRN normally 10% rate hike in lieu of benefits. actually lost raise's for 2yrs and base pay wet down from actual starting wage after 3yrs. i was not impressed. not the way to retain an employee."
bad,I have been at this hospital for quite some time and I have to say that the administration keep such a stranglehold on money. They are unorganized and every time I come in I see a new face because everyone quits or gets fired if they make too much.
bad,"Great co-workers, poor and messy Management want to control everything, disrespectful, no work life balance at all. Manage and boss act the same way. No support at all even in the HR. Glad to be able to move forward. Policy sucks."
bad,They expect you to work 27 visits a week. Too much for hospice. Not enough pay for on call. Expected to take call during week and weekends after working 40-50 hours a week.
bad,"Worked there for 4 yrs. horrible treatment by management. DON prided herself on being “nice, nasty”. Lots of favoritism, back stabbing. Pay is too low. Office manager does what she wanted, when she wanted. Never able to take lunch. On call schedule was a joke. Favoritism toward call schedule. Poor compensation for amount of call.  IDT was a joke. Admitted pts that should’ve been home health patients just for productivity. Only care about productivity and money!! Don’t waste your time with this company. Talk out of both sides of their mouth. No employee support."
bad,"If I could give this company a ""0"" I would. The culture and upper management is very poor. Management  don't value hard working employees at all. My advice would be to ""Run"" don't waste your time and energy because your only a body to Encompass, nothing else!"
bad,Health South gave me the opportunity to learn many skills that I would not have learned elsewhere. One supervisor was great. He taught me many skills as a new nurse. My job consisted of coming in and taking care of my patients. I learned how to do phlebotomy. Management was not the friendliest or very helpful. The workplace culture was negative and not friendly at all. The hardest part of the job was taking care of 21 patients to myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my patients.
bad,"constantly being told our jobs are safe but then they lay off 12 people within 1 week. management in therapy very unfriendly. staff very exclusive group, a clique . not welcoming to new employees"
bad,Continue doing the same things and expecting different results. Tenured leadership with a poor reactive mentality and no forward thinking. Cut-throat business development manager with no leadership skills. Massive turn-over.
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see the patients smiling and compliment the work I done in there room that always was a big part of my motivation to keep striving at Encompass Health
bad,"Environment that manages with intimidation and expectations are high w/out resources to meet the expectations, short staffing either requires nurses work overtime to meet the patient needs, or that the shifts are short staffed leading to potential patient safety issues. The Therapy department and therapists are superb."
bad,Working outside the actual hospital is fine.  The atmosphere inside is one of harassment and ridicule.  Need a new Director of Marketing and CEO.  Micromanagement at its best.
bad,"The hospice side and the home health side  do not communicate with each other. I tried to work both hospice and home health at the same time but each would not consider I was admitting a hospice patient when they thought I was admitting a home health patient. The manager of Hospice had an agenda to obtain the branch manager she stated she was firing me because I did not know what I was doing, but I was just helping out until they got the manager in place. She announced this in a staff meeting. I worked prn with no benefits but still working 40+ hours a week and doing the case management for the clients"
bad,"Marketing within the community to build relationships with Physicians, and case managers to get referrals to convert to admissions."
bad,"Short staffed and stressful"
bad,Sales people are pushed to much as the market may be very slow but they don't understand the pressure that is created and the overall stress that you feel.
bad,"From the top to the ""bottom,"" there is absolutely no support. Those who might give support are quickly weeded out. The cno has no managerial skills. I saw more staff resign, within my time there than in any other work place. Unfortunately the good ole boy cliche' is true."
bad,"Very stressful place to work.  There is no teamwork among co-workers.  Because the facility is small, everybody knows everybody business.  Nothing is confidential and you can't trust anyone."
bad,"Started off good, but when they became short staffed they wanted you to work lots of extra days. A coworker of mine was working 13 nights in a row (which is ridiculous). I'm currently in school and have children. They weren't very flexible with my schedule. They wanted Healthsouth to be my entire life. They would always ask me to work extra, but never wanted to give me a day off. I had to call in because I had a sick child and they didn't want to give me the night off! So ridiculous. Most of the nurses are lazy and don't want to help take care of the patients so you're basically stuck taking care of 10-14 patients on your own while your nurse sits on her phone. Upper management is awful. They sit and gossip about the workers and spread everyone's business around. We also had lots of in service mandatory classes which ranged from 2-8 hours. Not good when you're in school or have kids."
bad,Nice enviroment and friendly co workers. Nice place to work but was hard to move up in the company. Was able to see how exams were done. So you can tell patients what to exspect.
bad,This company is so far behind in terms of actually understanding  a team atmosphere. No one apoears to know what the other is doing.  The onboarding  process is so dehumanizing and long and wasteful. It's unstructured and impossible to actually understand the needs of the patient and the company because it is so drawn out and useless. The pay is not at all competitive.
bad,"Very low pay, poor benefit, no bonus. No recognition of achievement. Long working hours. Management people aren't very friendly........................"
bad,"Would not recommend as a company to work for due to gross expectations of staff "
bad,"A company that markets itself as the best place to work.....that it is NOT. Won't hire help and expect staff to see 8 to 10 patients per day driving all over. Don't care if you work 50 hrs but if you work less than 40 on a slow week, you get charged pdo. Don't care that you have a family or other commitments outside of work. Promise you territories but then put patients that live 40 miles away on your schedule and demand you see them. Worst HH company ever. So glad I left and am back at the former company I was with for 4 years. If you want work to be your life, then this is the company for you."
bad,"This company could be great if the administration  knew what they were doing. Policies are always being brought up but they tend to get manipulated when it's to the companies benefit. The patient/staff ratio at times is ridiculous. Nurses ended up with 10-12 patient a shift at times and aids up to 26 due to the lack of staffing, which is against the law in the state of West Virginia. The nurses and aids work very hard but do not get compensated what they are worth. Very low pay for what we do. Bonuses are offered if you pick up extra shifts when staffing is low, which is almost an everyday occurrence, so if you don't have a life and want to work 16 hour days then this is the place for you. You can also expect a phone call on your days off asking if you can come back in to work because they are understaffed again. The only positive thing I can say about this company are the nurses and aids are great. These men and women work very hard to give the patients the best care despite the work load."
bad,"So much drama with the Leadership and workers. Not enough training, unrealistic goals.They are only interested in the Census , not providing overall care"
bad,"The corporation as a whole has it together business wise.  Company wide there are good opportunities and probably great work cultures.  "
bad,"Not a good place. Poor management personal, long hours and not much gratitude for doing a good job. Have to take up the slack for other people that don't do their job."
bad,"As soon as I got to work I was already hours behind on the things to do, lots of stress and no support from employer. They expect you to take verbal and physical abuse from patients, family members and even from some of the doctors. If something goes wrong is the case manager fault but if everything goes right, it is team work! The management hires friends without concerns of experience. Never get out on time, it is a salary position because sometimes you spend 12 to 14 hours a day, no worth it.  Very bad place to work for,"
bad,"Very hard place to work . MANAGEMENT was very hard to please. CO works where not very helpful . my clients are the reason i went to work . i love helping  people . i assisted in daily care ,showers ,undressing and putting to bed my clients ."
bad,Management doesn't know when to stop micro managing their good to excellent employees. They let the allow the mediocre employees dictate what happens. Two departments has a continuous feud going on within each department and the higher ups don't do anything about. The feud is on the verge of harassment. The manager of these departments won't do anything about it. Because the manager will say that everyone is picking on these employee that's causing the harassment.
bad,"The atmosphere is dominated by fear. Management uses fear to manage staff. Unsafe working conditions. Nurse to patient ratio is dangerous.  Patient acuity is disproportionate to capacity of staff. Time constraints are in place, yet nursing staff must complete multiple assignments during course of day.  Hardest part of job is heavy and unsafe patient load, heavy medication pass and trying to stay within the limits of company policy.  Lower management contributes to low moral of nursing staff.  People frequently quit and turn over is high."
bad,"The CMO at Lenexa, KS location was sexist and two faced. She would do anything to help her chances of advancing to CEO no matter who it affected in her department or other colleagues. I would never recommend working for MARH to any family member or friend of mine."
bad,"A typical day consists of assisting with active record reviews. Collecting discharged charts,(not electronic) for coding dept to ensure payment in a timely manner. Calculate delinquency reports & letters for medical staff. Coordinate permanent filing for completed medical records."
bad,"High rate of nurse turnover. "
bad,"Having worked in other rehab hospitals, HS CEO and upper management could learn a lot from other organizations.  You don't call off hourly people for a few hours just to make your bottom line.  These lower paid people are counting on those wages to pay their bills.  Does mgmt take a pay cut when census is low?"
bad,"Lack of orientation, unrealistic expectation. Micromanaged. Will not educate you or give you opportunity to learn"
bad,"Basic health bene, PTO time also includes Holiday pay-not seperate as most companies. pay is lower than most companies on the south shore area. very quiet work place, they frown on chit chat in the office."
bad,"Encompass Health is an amazing company but unfortunately the CBO is just an awful environment. The director and executive management favor certain employees and feel they are untouchable when it comes to the clear favoritism. It's like working for a gang leader who makes it clear they can remove you at any time. They will make up reasons for discipline if you are not a favorite and HR does nothing about it, at times they encourage it even. "
bad,While really enjoyed my job out in the field going to the office was a bear. The management would yell and demean the employees right in front of your co-workers not a great job sitting.
bad,"You have 3 nurses for 36 pts and 2 cna's.  The cna's call in often.  You have to be the nurse and the cna.  There are very few RN's working there.  Many time I have been the only RN for both floors and had to go back and forth to both units to do iv pushes, hang blood overide meds in the pixie or do admissions.  Admissions can only be done by an RN.  Many times I have gone in and their are 4 admissions waiting for me."
bad,"Part of the Richmond VA location management team likes to harass people which creates a hostile and intimidating work environment. There is  a ""click"" involving about 4-5 women and if your not part of it, you may as well pack your bags ! They have created a toxic work environment in my opinion which I know is shared by many other employee's as well but perhaps Corporate will eventually see that it's not all about number's and do something about them. You have had many great employee's leave simply because of the way you are yelled at like your 5 years old."
bad,"This company talks a good game about being the best, but management is horrific. As long as numbers are good they really don’t care about patient care. They brand their business as the best place to work by telling their employees to go vote  for it.  This job was one of the worst in my career."
bad,"When I first started working at Health South it was nice, not to many people work was nice, but then we started to grow, the bonus went from great to ok, they were hiring all Spanish people and it was hard to hear when speaking on the phone with other agency's, I worked before I worked here as a Manager/Supervisor, it took me 4 years to become a supervisor, they kept advancing people who did not know half of what I knew, but I waited patiently, when finely promoted, they put me through the ringer to get it, it was horrible after that, they treated me like I was in fear of my job everyday, stuck me with the worst people in the place and when I tried to help they shut me down, it was a hostel place to work and the director was really bad, seemed like she didn't know what she was doing and had (her favorites being promoted) it was bad working in the business office. after I left a number of people also left, bad place to work very stressful and if the director don't like you watch out!!! they need new management!!!"
bad,This is a lovely facility for rehab but issues with staff (including management ) persisted month after month. New management at change from Health South to Encompass was a nightmare. Suddenly patient needs were secondary to numbers. If staff had issues they were likely to be ambushed than worked with to develop a plan of action.Regional staff was very inappropriate but did know their job. Several staff members were allowed to act out in an incredibly unprofessional way unchecked. On more than one occasion it was witnessed by patients. Very stressful due to chronic low staffing numbers. Temp nursing manager from another state was awesome but had hands tied. I do believe that therapists were great and department ran pretty well. Low morale was pervasive.
bad,"The company culture as promoted at the Home Office does not translate to the local offices.  There is a great deal of turn over due to unrealistic expectations, lack of regional leadership and direction, conflicts between operations and sales and reduction in staffing."
bad,"I hired on as the nutrition services manager, which apparently means glorified cook, dish washer, and clerk all rolled into one. I worked 12 hour days to start off to ensure my team was successful. As the month progressed I found my self working from opening to close due to being short  handed.  Never really felt appreciated and only got noticed when patients were not happy."
bad,"From corporate down, it is expected for all to work lean and long hours. The hours and the amount of work expected is beyond reasonable. You need help? Too bad, you aren’t getting it. It isn’t about patient care or getting appropriate patients in the door, it is all about head’s in the bed and money to line corporates pockets. If they don’t make as much money as they anticipated, employees are cut and the ones still standing will be doing more jobs and work.  Management is a bunch of people who haven’t worked on the line in decades and would rather go to two hour lunches together and sit in their offices than actually help staff."
bad,Lots of new grads hired which is fine but the turn over rate is fast here.  I like the layout of the hospital. And patients enjoy going to this place.
bad,"This is a company whose primary concern is maximizing profits, at the expense of patient care. They are poorly managed and the upper ranks are filled with family members of the owner, not a great environment for providing any criticism or critiques - they are immediately shot down. Do not talk to anyone about anything personal in your life unless you want it to be used against you, even the HR department is not a safe place to be heard or felt valued. If you are anything BUT an evangelical christian, just plan to keep that to yourself. Difference is not welcome and it is a very ""old, white, money"" company. People here gossip like crazy! Very cliquish and hard to penetrate, even if you are extremely nice and go out of your way to ingratiate yourself with management. It will not be appreciated and instead, be looked at with suspicion and then gossiped about with other people who think you are trying to sabotage them. Very odd place to work."
bad,the company is almost always short staffed.  they offer step up points to get you to work then they do not give them.  They always hire outside the company for positions in management.
bad,"Over worked and understaffed facility. Very little chance for pay increases,"
bad,"If you never want to know to which manager you answer then work for Encompass Home Health. While all of my managers were not bad, I didn't know from day to day to whom I was to answer. Even in a contract job, I've never had such a negative experience."
bad,"Healthsouth could be a wonderful place to work, but it is Always short staffed.  Huge turnover. No education provided. No coordination.  Its a struggle to work there,"
bad,"HealthSouth nursing is limited as they short staff nursing, overall condition,equipment and staffing inadequate.  they did not have much education opportunities within the system"
bad,"The hospital had a great therapy group, offered physical, occupational and speech therapy. The management team could have been better, though most were nice and easy to work with and for."
bad,Encompass has recently bought Camellia Health care. The transition has been difficult and discouraging. We are currently Limited on staff which makes a stressful work environment. We are required to follow these guidelines but do not have the staff to compensate the needs.
bad,"Branch director indifferent and non personable. Clinical Field Staff Supervisor, non personable and unprofessional. No teamwork, poor communication. Good pay, high stress."
bad,I felt like I was working on pins & needles. I felt I caught on to the job very quickly but any time I made a mistake I was scolded for it and did not feel like I really got the training I should have before I had to start doing the job. Got laid off after 3 months because they did not get the accounts they were hoping for. I feel like I should not have been hired in the first place it they did not think they would have enough work to keep me on.
bad,"Liked all the employees, upper management not invested in employees only money.  Regional director the worst.  Worked there 5 years never seeing anybody from corporate, then surprise she shows up and makes me do everything her way (filing!!) and tells me I'm doing everything wrong while never having been trained.  TOXIC"
bad,It doesn't seem that those who work hard are appreciated for their efforts. It's a very stressful environment and lots of pressure to rise above the negative when there's no answer to anything.
bad,They have treated their staff poorly with unethical behavior and gender inequality. Many women and few men is not equal! I fear they are doing this all over the country
bad,"Sarasota is a small community, they have treated their staff poorly with unethical behavior and gender inequality.. there are few guys that they hire and management is rebuilding"
bad,"there are many females and few males that work for this company both in management and clinical staff... im really upset at the direction of this company, they need leaders not people who all know each other. the men only last about a year, there have been 6 men come and go since i started"
bad,"Very little opportunity to participate in any leadership.  Staff was over-worked and not allowed to give individual care as was advertised."
bad,This is a place that I would not tell any one to apply for a job. They are not team players always gossip and cut throating one another.  The environment is not comfortable
bad,"Nationally, Encompass is a fortune 100 company to work for. However, in TN, it is severely lacking. It is poorly managed on a local level and has a very high turnover rate. Within 6 months there was a high number of employees that either resigned or were terminated. I have never been treated so poorly by any other employer. I think the Encompass mission is fantastic and I think there is hope for the local branches, but there needs to be a change in management. The job itself is awesome. I loved the patients and providing one on one care is something i grew to love. "
bad,"The position consists of heavy, outbound calling. You are expected to meet a quota every week. The company has contracts with multiple physician offices and the nurse is responsible for a certain caseload. You have to call patients and do a lengthy screening via telephone. Of course, most patients aren't willing to share their personal health information over the phone. This is more like a sales position, I definitely did not stay employed here long."
bad,"Check staffing is adequate"
bad,"As with most medical facilities, they constantly understaffed.  With the rehab environment, they began accepting more patients that required more extensive medical care vs rehab."
bad,"That job was stressful for me because of the care that the patients needed and not enough staff available to work."
bad,"I worked here as a Certified Nurses Aide while attending nursing school at University of New Hampshire. I enjoyed the learning opportunities and patient care experience, but it was poorly managed."
bad,"typical day depended on the patients"
bad,"Very poor management, NO training and jeopardized my license by not brining in someone to train me till after I gave my resignation. Good for the new employees, bad for me.  Found out later there is a training process but the CEO decided not to initiate."
bad,"This is a great place if you are a patient. We accomplish great things with them, they do get better and I love how that makes me feel - but the job itself and what they give you to make it happen are undeniably, stupidly, contradictive."
bad,Work is work...The company is like any other company they all have there advantages and dis advantages. getting patients ready for the following day!!!!
bad,"Nurses work hard at this company."
bad,Wanted to give excellent patient/family care but was written up if stayed over shift to make things right.  Educated and demonstrated many skills to new employees but always passed up for manager positions.  Too much verbal service by management without any physical changes.
bad,"*Demanding"
bad,Managmwnt team has a tendency to look down on your work and the workload for nurses are to much. Rn would have up to 11 to 12 patient and tech 15 to 20. Stressful place to work.
bad,very understaffed. Loved the patients. Management wasn't very good. Staff wasn't treated very good and caused many to leave. The only thing I enjoyed was the patients
bad,There were times when the staff had a great mix of staffers but when the mix was not positive it was difficult. They have numerous sites and I can only talk about one of them.
bad,"If I had completed this review when the office was under previous management, I would have given a 5 star review. However when incompetent managers took over...my goodness. We began driving 100 miles per day, we were told to ""make our own schedule"", assigned 15 points in one day. The workload was not reasonable to say the least. Our office had 5 nurses quit within one month. Your experience with Encompass is only as good as the managerment and staff."
bad,"I hated this job.  No room to get raises, no appreciation.  The work environment was awful and the patients didn't wan to be there."
bad,"Frequent short staffing, up to 10/11 patients per nurse on some days. When staffing is good, nurses are sent home (flexed) to save the company money. Patient and staff safety is clearly not a priority. Nurses and aides are constantly asked to sign up for overtime because there is not enough staff-where is the work/life balance? Very low morale. Everyone is miserable. The pay and benefits are okay but not worth what you have to put up with."
bad,"Nursing and Therapy staff are very knowledgeable and caring towards the patients, but frequently management places higher emphasis on PEM scores, Nursing hours per pt day, and other metrics."
bad,"Oversee community start-up program.  Obtain referrals from Doctors, Social Workers and skilled nursing."
bad,"Nurses are given an average of 10 patients and expected to do both their job and the techs job. Patient acuity is never a staffing factor and everyone works short on a regular basis. The techs are taught by management that nurses are supposed to answer call lights and sit around waiting for them to do so even during med passes, some of them sitting in the supervisor's office chatting. When nurses complain to manage about staff not working they are the ones that are monitored more closely and written up.  Instead of counselling or disciplining the ones that need it a blanket memo goes out because it would be ""too much work"" to deal with just one. The CEO has no idea what the nursing supervisors are doing, he didn't even know about an agency nurse being fired for not letting a tech tell her what to do. HR is joke, she tells you to call or email if you have any questions or problems but never answers any messages."
bad,"underpaid staff"
bad,"Worked from 5;00 am- 2:00 pm as a baker. Made all sorts of breads, cakes, pies, Jell-O, and cookies. Detailed cleaning of worked area. Helped was dishes."
bad,Absolutely no room for advancement. Completely micro-managed. Management does not respect employee's expert opinions
bad,"Decent co workers"
bad,"Working at one of the facilities was very stressful with no work/life balance. If you are single and/or have no family obligations this can be the perfect place for you. If you truly care about your work, want to contribute but also have a life outside of work, this is not the place.  Whether you work in a clinical position or not, the Regional Team for the facility expects you to be available, willing and able to work 24/7, 365. I have a family and want to be with them rather than work all the time. Wasn’t possible in my position."
bad,"Super profit-driven  Not much support when the census is way high   I could not take vacation other than one day here and there  because of the patient care requirements and little backup coverage. I left with 60 unused vacation hours that they would not pay out to me, despite the fact I gave three weeks notice.  I will not work there again."
bad,"Poor office support. Understaffed in the field. Most days requiring to go over productivity and spending numerous hours completing documentation at night. If work was not submitted by midnight, at risk of being given warnings."
bad,"The nurse to patient ratio is extremely high and some patients coming into rehab are very sick. It sometimes reminds me of working in a nursing home. Look further,  this should be your last option."
bad,When I first started working for healthsouth i enjoyed it. The longer I worked there the more I realize that the management was horrible there. The therapy department is amazing.
bad,It’s a good starter place to get your experience very fast paced In which I liked but lazy RNs that complain about their job as if someone forced you to b a nurse some even tho u don’t suppose to u can sleep on night shift nurses and nurse tech have done it we all have at one point as long as u get ur work done
bad,Pays well.  Never adequately staffed.  Pt/nurse ratio very dangerous.  Managers not available and does not help when needed for the most part.  Will leave you in a staffing crisis and not come in to cover.
bad,"Management could have been a little more involved, but other than that a great place to work. The staff was friendly and always willing to help one another out."
bad,Management ask employee to preform job that they are not trained for or have much know about. Supervisor and upper management are quick to harshly confront an employee without learn all then information.
bad,"I loved working with my coworkers, great teamwork however the work load is unbearable, management (Nursing CEO) has no idea what she is doing. I also did not like the fact that I could not advocate for my patients the way I wanted. There were many times we were expected to take 8 patients a piece which is very unsafe. Many times the charge nurse or supervisor would have 2 patients while everybody else had 6-9. Very rough place to work as a nurse."
bad,"Supervisor was biker buddies with co worker, co worker always got cherry jobs, best shifts, time off requests approved.  I was sent to remote site two hours from home, each way, had to commute for 9 months.  Was promised an advancement when remote job was com-pleted, but was actually brought back to home site, and hours were cut."
bad,"People are great. Doctors are approachable and dedicated.  Management is ineffective "
bad,The location I was at was so stressful with poor management that I started losing sleep. I literally couldn't sleep the night's before work. Going to work a 12 hour shift on 0 hours of sleep and stress causes more stress.
bad,"As with most facilities, there are some good staff and some poor staff. Due to staffing shortage tho the good ones get burnt out quickly which has an effect on the whole facility."
bad,"Healthsouth Rehab Hospital is highly stressful!  You work hard for the lack of pay.  Nurse to patient ratio averages 10:1, but you do wound care also!"
bad,"Overworked, too many hours cutting into off hours and family life.  Lots of on call hours. Not enough training and manager is inexperienced. Great job if you have no life and are a working fool. Baker city Oregon has a very high turn over. Gone through several nurses in 12'mos."
bad,Good  benefits.There is poor communication between management and staff. This is a great field to be in but staff is overbooked with no back up which makes for long hours.
bad,That which that accomplish in rehabilitating people is unmatched.  As with any large company it sometimes takes years to develop the ability to create an work environment that focuses the internal customer as much as the external
bad,"Never knew what your work day would consist of. Your group of residents would get changed in the middle of your shift very frequently. It was very hard to talk to management. They always had their favorite employees that they allowed to do what they wanted. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company, Hours were not guaranteed on a typical work day, would arrive to work in the morning and get turned around and asked to go back home because their were not enough hours. Some employees were not licensed."
bad,"Very demanding workload with high patient/staff ratios. Non competitive pay. "
bad,Short staffed on a regular basis.  High volume turnover in nursing.  Nurses feel like patient safety is a huge issue.  Upper management does not listen to staff.
bad,"For the most part I enjoyed my position at HS for ten years. My co-workers were fun and professional and great to work with. However, the company itself didn't pay well and was poorly managed."
bad,Very disorganized. always short staff which means overworked nurses. Management limits time off. No guidance or support in any way. Issues are ovelooked and not addressed. Expect 100% patient satisfaction while understaff and not addressing the issues.
bad,provided me with scheduling freedom to care for my family while still making money
bad,They pay way under industry value. They play favorites with their reps and give the good accounts and areas to certain people.
bad,Great services to the patients needing medical rehab. HealthSouth Leadership not connected with local hosps. it is more about the heads in the beds at times vs what's best for the patient or the hosp.
bad,"It could have been a very nice place to work, but with all the back biting going on and reporting every move a person makes to upper mgt, it just made for a miserable work place."
bad,10 hour days without time 4 lunch or anything in between patients. Gossiping within management & cliques. Pay is decent but not worth it if u have a family because u will never see them. Charting is unrealistic
bad,Management is very cheap with compensation and has a hustory of layoffs
bad,"Regional management is too focused on profit. Patients are admitted without concern for whether they are appropriate for or able to participate in outpatient rehab. The focus is on filling the beds. Nurse patient ratios are outrageous, particularly considering the acuity levels of the patients. Hospital staff is blamed for low census, even though there is a newer, better staffed rehab hospital within 1 mile. Staff morale is awful due to the fact that staff is held acccountable for things over which they have no control."
bad,"This hospital admits patients that do not meet rehab criteria, in other words sometimes Medicare patients should not be admitted because they do not meet the criteria, but are anyway and Medicare is billed. Nurses to patient ratios are poor. 10-13 patients per nurse and they are always short handed. Management staff is not supportive of staff and always pushing for admissions even when there is not enough nurses to care for them."
bad,"Not a happy place to work. "
bad,"Was over worked to the bone, 10-13 patients in a 12 hours work day. Lazy nurses who would just sit around and gossip, even while call lights would ring none stop. I would go home at night and hear it in my sleep. worst job ever."
bad,"Management is like a dictatorship. Communication, job environment is below average. CEO and Administration say disparaging things about employees.  Upper Administration practices favoritism and shows no real concern for staff. Situations are adjusted unfairly depending on employee and falsification of situations has occurred."
bad,Nursing management leaves much to be desired. Not much support or actual development. Inappropriate employee relationships and everyone pretty much doing as they wish.
bad,Experienced poor contact with management.  Admit nurse still has to take a patient load.  Most admits are late and after-hours.  Good to have some autonomy.  Self schedule.  Better communication between departments would be nice.
bad,If you like to work hard and not be appreciated then this the place for you. I have seen them walk people out the door that have been there for years.
bad,No respect for nsg. Verbally abused from pts on a daily basis without administrative support. High influx of admissions without regards of patient safety or nurse staffing. Nsg is the only department held accountable and picks up the slack.  Very unethical
bad,"I liked my co workers but managment was a revolving door. Nurse to patient ratio was high, and I always felt like i was second fiddle to the therapists"
bad,Therapists are great. Amazing work being done every day.  Patients overall benefit from rehab.  Nursing has its challenges.  Therapy is definitely strongest part of program
bad,Poor support of nursing staff. Average of 9 patients per nurse with very acute issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference in patients and families lives.
bad,"I worked for this company for almost 12 years.To keep it brief. The first 10 were great,last 2 not so much.Be prepared to work your behind off,and still feel like You didn't get it all covered. I chose to arrive prior to my shift (off the timeclock) to review charts and gather info prior to my shift and was told not to do so!!! High pressure MicroManagement. I planned on retiring from this company..management changed that for me. Was sad to leave. I wouldn't recommend my facility in this town to anybody."
bad,"overworked, underpaid, no room for growth. long hours, short staff, no bonuses, minimal raises, okay benefits package, poor staff morale, additional duties with no training."
bad,"This is a fast paced job that requires a high amount of time and effort from employees.  Training is inconsistent, leaving some new employees better prepared than others.  Not a good place if you're family orientated.  You will spend a good chunk of time outside of your day following up with patients and doctors.  Field staff members are not treated equally regarding opportunities to work outside of business hours.  New people are working in the office every day and you don't know who they are or where they work.  Managers spend a lot of time in meetings and can only be seen by appointment.  Good place to work for experienced home health workers that like being outside and on their own."
bad,long day because you work by yourself. management is good. didnt give clear directions on what i had to do though. didnt really have nice co-workers but i didnt work with them through the day.
bad,"The hospice management team in the Houston area offices is predominantly home health personnel transitioned into the hospice division of the company with little specialty training in hospice. Most of the field staff are newer to hospice care as well.The preceptor that oriented me to the company had been a hospice case manager for less than a year. Managers are slow to fill vacant positions. High turnover of staff and managers. Office staff have good intentions but, again, have not been well trained and have no prior hospice experience. The Medical Directors are wonderful and add palliative care expertise to an otherwise lacking program."
bad,"Almost 10 years with this company and you hear the same stories over and over. Upper management is horrible. They are reactionary in all of their approaches. Advancement is non-existent and they will do everything possible to let you know that you mean nothing. Any mistake you make they will hold over you even though they will not train you."
bad,This company offers a nice compensation package.  Nice co-workers in the field.  Good work/life balance.  Good and comprehensive orientation that lasts over a month.  Administration lets you know if there are any problems.
bad,"Dedicated group of individuals that work at Healthsouth Sunrise Rehabilitation in Sunrise Florida.  The work can be very challenging and at times, extremely stressful.environment.  However, it can be very rewarding seeing patients progressing from admissions to discharge."
bad,It started out to be a great place to work. But i didnt receive enough training I was trained by someone who spoke little english which made things hard..And pay for the amount of work for one person .WHAT I LIKED ABOUT it OVER ALL STAFF FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS MADE YOU FEEL SO WELCOMED WHEN MY OWN DEPARTMENT DIDNT.
bad,"HealthSouth is a great company with a difficult future due to the regulatory environment at hand. The companies current business lines are limited to moderate or slowed growth. Promotion and job security are near the bottom for a company its size. Significant talk and promotion is given to HR policy that promotes a ""great place to work"". However, when an issue arises, almost always the policy is ignored and the Company wins out and does not promote the employee. Considering the other great companies in the area, I would not suggest HealthSouth as a long-term viable option for a career."
bad,12-18 hrs work day
bad,"Being hired on you are told that you will be covering a specific area, but you actually will end up driving across the entire valley. This is common for everyone. When it is slow, per diem people and LPNs are not staffed - so you end up with a lot of low-productivity visits all over the place. "
bad,"Leading with positives...  job was overall flexible and I really did like my branch director and clinical staff. However..."
bad,"Lots of turnover ( almost 100% ) in my department.  CEO left, and hired another.  Director Marketing fired. Did not hire another.  Poor morale, rude  Medical Director."
bad,"Low rates for visits "
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of patients in the field.  I would dread anytime I had to go into the office.  The atmosphere was often stressful and a bit depressing.
bad,"The acuity level of the patients is too high for the tech to patient ratio. Often we are stuck trying to move 250+ lbs patients with little to no help. Most of the nurses have ""hurt backs"" or ""I'm just not feeling it tonight"". All management has to say is ""use teamwork"", when no one is willing to help."
bad,Slow paced environment with low stress. If you get bored easily this is not the company to work for. Minimal expectations for employees across the board.
bad,"Worked as a data entry clerk and later went to the Admissions Office when an opening was posted.  Unfortunately, after I accepted the position, I was told that my pay would not increase because the position was a lateral move and not a promotion (this was not the case) the position of an Admission Assistant posted was a higher level that that of a Data Entry Clerk. After I left I found out that the last position I held as an Admission Assistant was not processed and I was listed as a Data Entry Clerk when I left."
bad,I would not recommend this company for any professional wishing to act and practice autonomously.  Corporate management does not support or appreciate this type of employee.
bad,Very difficult place to work as a new grad. Not enough training. Everyone speaks Spanish and as a English speaking nurse very difficult to communicate.
bad,"CNO is rude, plays favorites, favors therapy staff over nurses. Too many patients, never adequate staffing. The pay is high Bc no one stays very long. Management is ignorant and becomes testy when nurses question authority. Very little room for growth without kissing up to management."
bad,"Its very hard work, you have to use your body to transfer patient. Most patient are very weak(cva,recoving from sugrey). Lots of transfers, hard to find help from co workers, they are also very busy.. nursing ratio is 1:11.. very hard 5 days a week. Always short staff."
bad,"First and for most the management is absolutely non supportive of their staff. From the CEO to the Nurse manager the only thing they care about is making the company money and their own bonus. After saying that, the pay is competitive and the work is a typical inpatient physical rehab hospital. Ratios are 8:1, sometimes 9:1 and even 10:1 in some circumstances. Nursing staff act like they are in high school.  If you don't mind getting treated like disposable garbage by management and don't speak up for yourself, then this is a good place for you. If you tend to speak out when you or your coworkers are treated unfair then the CNO wrath will be upon you. Good luck."
bad,In the beginning time with healthsouth was great however. Once I got a new job  they didnt appreciate the days I provided to then that I was able to work. I signed up for. 3 teir position which only requires you to work one day a month however was let go because I had 6 tardys  in one. Month
bad,Nursing employee work  there Butt off. The nurse to patient ratio is 8:1. The wound care coordinator has 10-13 patient daily alone without assistant some patients are obese. Many put arrives very ill and not rehabilitation. potential.  Benefits are great but you'll be to tired to enjoy them lol
bad,Great job and learning different things and experiences with the people and patients through my journey of being an hospice Aide through it all it’s a great company
bad,I have worked there for a couple of years and I have seen a change since I have been there. The patient load is heavy. Short staffed. I have had 22 patients before and that was stressful/hard. Some days I have had 4 dependent patients to myself and its not easy when staff aren't helping out. The management also acts like the care about what is going on with the staff but in reality they don't because there is nothing they can do. Don't really see management on the floor helping out when we are short staffed. Some teamwork depending on what nurses you are working with. The benefits and the bonus pay during season are very good!
bad,I spend most of my time on a computer when not covering for field RN's. We have a very small office. Lots of new changes with this company and not many of the changes are positive.
bad,"It was a fun place to work, but flexibility regarding family life was difficult. A typical day at work was hitting offices to generate referral sources. I learned effective time management skills. Workplace culture was somewhat difficult in regards to various boundaries between home office, employees in the field, and clinicians. Hardest part of the job was not enough communication between clinicians and field employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was hitting numbers and bonusing."
bad,"I have been at Encompass for over 2 years. I am recently leaving due to poor management. As a Registered Nurse I feel it is very important to get adequate time to take care of your patients, some days I would have up to 10-11 patients. Management is always down your back to get charges right so they can be reimbursed, however if they offer you a bonus to come in for an extra shift, 90% of the time the bonus will not be on your check and you have to nag them for it. It makes it really difficult when you were expecting it to pay bills and it’s not there. Therapy runs everything there, so nurses are often working around them to pass meds, do wound care etc. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"Work life balance is ok if you are experienced. No time to care for patients due to monotonous repetitive charting. Patients admitted even though they are not home bound. You are told to make the patient look worse off than they really are, All about the numbers. Management makes decisions about patients without even seeing them, changes your assessments. Basically I feel like it’s Medicare  fraud. Medicare patients is all they care about.  Nurses make less than other disciplines. Management has favorites and allows the rules to be broken and covers up for them."
bad,"Was treated unfairly. When I reported what I felt was unfair, it was used against me later. The older employees pushed me out. It was almost like, if they didn’t like you, the Management forced your hand. Very poor management."
bad,"Perform touch calls with DMO as needed. Perform assessments on new referrals from local hospitals, clinics, home health's, etc. Market to various medical facilities in designated area."
bad,They have a great theory of what a day should look like and how you need to operate. They do not understand the varying demands on your time and create unrealistic goals and expectations.
bad,"could have up to 10 patients, Have to discharge several possibly and then get new admissions. Its all about keeping the beds full. Crazy busy and lots of walking. chasing down your pt. in various dept. to give them medications"
bad,Management are not so supportive of employees but go extra mile to satisfy the patients which is really good. Employees work as a team thereby helping each other diffuse a difficult situations.
bad,The concept of this company is good. But with the quality of the clientele that visits some of the goals are hard to achieve Fun environment when busy. Low pay I felt like.
bad,I worked for HealthSouth for numerous years and still maintain many close and wonderful relationships with those I worker with.
bad,"Hospital never had enough staffing. If you wanted to work 20 hours of overtime a week you easily could. Job was more physically demanding than mentally. You're doing LPN work at RN pay. Very poorly managed. Cafeteria food was atrocious, but the benefits were great!"
bad,"Braintree hospital was taken over a year ago by a texas based company,  There were initialy over 100 layoffs and layoffs are still happening weekly.  Patient care has suffered greatly, offices are understaffed and employee morale is at an all time low.  Working there has been incredibly difficult and there is  constant added pressure and workloads.  Nurses are leaving weekly and the hospital is currently staffed with new and inexperienced help.  Everyone working there is miserable and is just waiting to be let go."
bad,I helped out to learn my job as a medical records clerk.  I was a good experience.
bad,"Very nice older facility in country setting with professional staff, 44 beds consisting of rehabilitation pts.: med-surgical,head-injuries,parkinsons, and CVA/chronic illness and disease clients. Young admissions were the hardest part of the job, and discharges to home were the most rewarding part of the job, Management was reachable but very unsupportive to staff situations and needs shift to shift.."
bad,This review is from the early years when the atmosphere was bad.  I think the current HealthSouth is ok.
bad,"Staff is very friendly and helpful."
bad,Helping my patient recovery and getting there strenght back
bad,"As a nursing student and a CNA, i think starting out at Braintree Rehab Hospital is an exellent move!"
bad,Work was very easy and not to demanding and the management is ok but not great.
bad,"Management seems to listen to employees, but may not get support from corporate necessary to implement things that would increase employee satisfaction.  I don't feel valued as a team member by all staff members.  Patient to tech ratio makes it difficult to give the highest quality care."
bad,HealthSouth is a great company.  Unfortunately no good training is offered specially when you don't have any medical background.  It is like a big family except for some managers that really needed a little training as of how to deal with their employees.
good,I am a per-diem (part-time - floating position)
good,"The facility is in a good location and has the potential to be one key location for Encompass Health. The facility is ran like a high school if you are in the in crowed, do what you want if you are not then sit in the corner."
good,"Not an employee friendly company. All about finding ways to employees less. Pressure you into seeing as many patients as possible, providing minimal care, and saving the branch office money."
good,Always short staffed. Would be a better place to work if they had more structure. Also would be a great place to work if they took in the right kind of patients. Need to learn how to work as a team.
good,I was promised a full time position after a year of my hard work and flexibility.  Director hired someone else.  That is all I wish to share.
good,"Poor management, lack of training, and no work as a team.  Just a heads up.  Only take this job if you really need the money.  The hardest part of this job is working short handed.  You will have plenty to do and will not get any help from your co-workers including the manager."
good,Positive culture.
good,"The nurse manager in Encompass Health Henderson  is very inhumane with her employees.Even we have doctors note if we are sick she still giving you a write up."
good,"Sadly, with a change in management, employee moral plumeted, along with referrals to keep LPN's, COTA's & PTA's at productivity, which resulted in either loss of work hours or using vacation time to maintain paycheck. No encouragement or solutions from upper management to solve internal issues. Great company if you stay away from the Rocky Hill branch until they can get better leadership."
good,Constantly hit with reports that have been run finding fault in all work performed. No thanks for anything positive accomplished. Constantly checked up on to see if you've done everything.
good,"I was very happy until new schedules were enforced. Budgets were spent on frivolous endeavors rather than best interest of patients and employees. "
good,As farva a company towards their patients they demand the best which is great!  As far as office organization and management they are lacking greatly.  Manager very out of touch with employees as well as patients.
good,It has been a every changing environment.  That has been a challenge to handle at times.  Management has changed a lot in the time I have been there and it is hard to keep up with the changes because of that.
good,The management put unreasonable demands on the nursing staff.  This caused many very good nurses to leave the company.  Then the demands on the remaining staff was unbearable.
good,Management did not have therapists back with regard to patient concerns and forced therapist to see patients that they were uncomfortable seeing. HR/ therapy management was difficult to confront with any concerns. Pay rate is extremely low for cost of living in Orange County. Merit increases are almost non-existent
good,"The Corporate offices of Encompass would not rehire personnel to fill positions where employees had left. They would expect the remaining employees to take up the slack. Because of this, I not only was the only Medical Records Specialist handling 390-420 patient's, but I also was the main person answering the extremely busy phone lines. I was expected to be able to keep the unbilled percentage at or below 25% while I was trying to complete two full time jobs for Encompass. Since my termination at Encompass on December 8, 2014, I have been working in the same capacity but as Document Tracking Specialist at Brookdale Home Health and we have three DTS's now for 500 patients and we do not have to be the only ones who help answer the phones. Because of this, we are able to keep the unbilled percentage well below the 10% that is required by the Corporate offices of Brookdale."
good,"Reviewed Expense Reports"
good,Turn over in the Nursing Dept is consistent which means newly hires are not as experienced and that is not a positive for the patients. One can have too many patients to care for a one time which is almost impossible.
good,very stressful they did put me thru a cna cross training course where I learned how to do bladder scans n tube feedings. management  was not good back  then
good,"I no longer work here. My current job is Home Health. "
good,Maybe it was hard because the personnel in charge of the kitchen was very strict and I felt as if I was being picked on to the point I had to start taking pictures of my work. I feel like my supervisor didn't like the fact that I was the youngest on her team. I feel as if I still did a good job even though I was never told so.
good,Healthsouth wasn't a terrible place to work it didn't feel the pay was worth the extreme depends in the nursing field. Management was also non-exemplary
good,I think encompass is a good company but the office I was in was an acquisition and the employees were still doing things the old company way. I think if it was an office of all encompass hired people the experience would be different
good,The company culture leaves you feeling like you should be cautious and always make sure that you are being perfect or the upper managers will pitch a fit.
good,"Little or no support, encouragement.  When census falters, have to give staff off and do work yourself.  No holidays off/no extra pay for supervisors.  Upper management unaware of what is going on on nursing floors.  No inter-department collaboration."
good,"Case management at Encompass Health hospitals is different. From providing continuing education programs to offering tuition reimbursement, we prioritize the individual growth of our employees. Because the average length of a patient stay is longer than acute care, our case managers work with patients and caregivers to offer in-depth discharge planning services and can customize the best solution for each patient’s transition to the next level of care."
good,"Rehab director often begs therapists to change documentation, change FIM scores or begs therapist to perform simple treatments to ""get the minute""--  reminds me of SNF."
good,"Management has changed over 4 times in the last 2 years!"
good,The work was awesome and our team was great until we got a new supervisor.  Little support was offered..  Our sense of TEAM was great.   Staff were told they were useless
good,"A typical day was overloaded with work due to poor management of employee to patient ratio."
good,Middle management is cross trained to many different functions. Senior leadership turnover is very high. The corporation has excellent patient focused strategies that are intended to flow through to every hospital location.
good,"I have to say, I loved the job itself while working with Encompass.  The patients were fun, and for the most part, the other clinicians are wonderful.  I left because I became the target of one of the manager's bullying, and couldn't do anything right.  The culture was great on a surface level, but there was definitely some back-stabbing occurring if someone in the higher ranks didn't like you."
good,"Large patient load, long hours, work is available all the time. "
good,"Overall I believe Encompass to be a great place however overhead as is usually the case in a work place definitely put me through a test."
good,"Poor management. No process, no one knows whats going on or who is doing what.   Within eight months of working with company 10 people were gone.  Branch and upper management are worthless."
good,"it was disappointing to feel as if your were moving people through like cattle because they are a census driven hospital. There's a lotos convincing to get a person into rehab and even once you've exhausted all recources, it was not good enough if a person didn't admit or choose us"
good,"Enjoyed the job and the work although management was not cohesive due to high staff turnover. Company did provide good electronic equipment and supplies, training and in-services were professional and interesting."
good,treated employees terrible when they got bought I don't know why anyone would want to work there
good,It is not a very fair company to work for if you are not the right race for a certain department. Employees not treated the same within the department. Definately alot of favortism. Would not reccommend if you get your feeling hurt easily.
good,"A fast pace place to work at.Always looking forward and start the day with the smiling faces and with warmth greetings of co-workers.I have a very good relationships with my co-workers and staff and a lot of respects to one another regardless of culture.There are a lot of hardworking employees but the management is not appreciative enough ,their main concern is to have a full-bed hospital and not enough staff to assign in each section,that left the staff/employees no choice but to quit and  look for another job. In my department alone ,if a housekeeper resign they don't usually replace with another housekeeper but to add more duties and responsibilities to the housekeepers who was left behind. Being a housekeeper in a private house is a lot different from the hospital, but honestly i preferred working in a private house."
good,"I worked in the kitchen and my Supervisor played favoritism. Pay wasn't equally distributed, nor was 8.37 enough to live off of. You were on a time limit to get everything done that was needed and you didn't always get help."
good,the typical work day was very hectic but once you get used to the scheduling and timing you learn how important your team is to you
good,"Company has some good aspects but the longer you stay the more you start to feel devalued.  A lot of people have left recently unfortunately due to this.  It's not the worst job, but they are definitely doing things to help remind you that you are just a cog in the machine and not valued as a human being as well."
good,"This job is good for someone who enjoys working in the healthcare feild, i took it cause i needed a stable job, however my boss was not the friendliest and was upset because they hired me while i was pregnant so it caused alot of issues. over all besides my boss, the comapny is nice to work for. just dont miss work for anything"
good,"I was hired and 3 weeks later our branch director quit. Followed by a social worker, a RN and a marketer. As the ONLY RN it was stressful. Then 2 months later comes another branch director FROM HOME HEALTH !! Hospice is 360 degrees different. She had no clue zero experience and to top it off, she hired only people of a certain color and the vibe was extremely ghetto. When my husband died unexpectedly, she harassed me on when I was returning to work, then as soon as I returned, she had me in her office show boating in front of her new boss and said my co workers are complaining I was rude, RUDE??? I just lost my husband. And from that point onward I was harassed and ultimately left. Be very aware of the culture of the office. This one was TOXIC. "
good,"The company as a whole is great and they offer decent benefits and pay. My problem was with my provider. The administrator showed favoritism on a daily basis. I was promised a promotion that was never going to happen and when I gave my notice, I was told they were getting ready to move me. Overall I wish I would have never worked for encompass. Live and learn."
good,"Covered 3 roles simultaneously without compensation. Branch given zero autonomy on actually managing their own office. Very negative culture by other office staff and this was allowed to continue to Regional. I was essentially forced out of my position by very jealous, spiteful women. I worked very hard to advance in my career and I saw encompass being the stop for me. Tons of opportunities to advance. Overall a fantastic company."
good,"Good learning experience,  Management can be better. Workplace culture is improving but there's definitely a lot of improvement needed as far as employee retention."
good,"Overtime is frequently offered due to short staffing. A high turnover of nurses related to the staff being overworked or suddenly fired. Drama between some staff members, however, good nurses and team."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the clinical team collaboration with other specialities. We work together to provide our patients with the best possible outcomes.
good,I enjoyed working for Encompass. I enjoyed how they drive towards their mission statement and everyone is like family. The work environment is fun and I enjoyed my job.
good,"To much buddy system in place, not enough incentive or room for growth. The organization is small so many of the managers play favoritism to their friends instead of giving the job to those that are qualified for the position."
good,"A lot of turnover of management staff, account managers, as well as therapists and nurses. There were 10 -12 that left in the last 8 months. Very poor morale."
good,The staff give great care to patients. Wonderful to see patients improve. The tension and stress level within the facility has increased over the past few years. Staff members are not always friendly and kind to each other. Management is not supportive of staff. Benefits have declined.
good,"I enjoyed working here because I met good people but some co-workers don't care or are not accountable for their responsibilities, especially those in a high position."
good,Idabel management is terrible. for other offices i have heard working for Encompass Health is great and I'm sure it can be a wonderful place to work for at other locations.
good,"The company is wonderful, the branch can be bad if management is bad. The patients are the best part of the job. Very difficult to truely work a 40 hour work week.  Poor employee morale.The company itself seems to be Ok."
good,"Our last manager was worthless in dietary had no idea how to run a kitchen and how to be a manager sat in her office all day, if we have problems in kitchen nobody seems to care to help us fix it all employees work against each other instead of working together. To much negativity in the kitchen DRAMA! Nobody follows spread sheets or diets for patients RN LVN and CNA lose trays all the time! They give it to wrong patients . just an overall bad place to work the pay sucks and it will suck the life out of you."
good,"Worked here as an RN. In the beginning the job, staff, and management was wonderful. Very rewarding job as most patients got better and went home, saw several miracles walk out that door. On the other hand towards the end of my role there, management had a large change. Concerns including patient care issues were listened to but never resolved. Nurses were never taken seriously or appreciated. Staffing crisis and high turnover rates made taking care of patients difficult as well as patients are now more sick. Due to not having enough staff, you are constantly messaged/called during time off. Education requirements for this job including constant mandatory meetings, classes, etc become taxing and make it seem like you have no time with family. Most times when I worked I felt like a lone man on an island attempting to care for patients, poor teamwork due to staff feeling overwhelmed I think.  Nurse ratio during says 8 to 9 and at night 10 plus. They do have PCTs, if there are enough on the schedule."
good,To much travel.  Not close to home.  You could be required to travel more than 400 miles per day and attain quota if you work in the rural area of the state.  NO company vehicle.
good,Working for Encompass as an area manager was a little like being thrown into a job blindfolded. The training I received was not pertinent to the area I worked in. Getting answers and clarification was next to impossible. Changing supervisors so many times in a year was confusing to say the least. Each supervisor expected different things in different ways.
good,"Very busy daily no time for anything but work. Learned everything I needed to know and a lot more> Last position started out doing what I was hired for to at about the second year doing the job of four people. Management were the best managers. The hardest part, not enough help. the enjoyable part was greeting the patients everyday and able to help them in anyway possible."
good,You leave the corporate office fired up and ready to go but local management squashes that quickly. BM Very demaning and micromanaging branch manager.
good,Not organized. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Certain people don't get held accountable for their actions. Make people do more then they get paid for.
good,"Benefits are good and the work is easy most of the time. Overall, Healthsouth is an ok place to work. Hardest part of the job is getting about 3+ patients ready within 45 minutes. Easiest part is simply clocking in & clocking out! 😂😂"
good,"If you don't suck up to upper management, you won't get very far. They will quickly throw their long time employees under the bus if it makes them look better. With one hand,they throw all of these ""perks "" in your face, all while holding a proverbial knife behind their back. And the morals of the "" higher ups"" are questionable. I would not work there again."
good,The pay and benefits are wonderful but the work culture is less than desirable. Management is supportive but the other staff is not. The average work load is also way too high on most days. It is a physically demanding job and you will hurt when you leave for the day.
good,"-Average nurse:patient ratio"
good,It was a great environment to work in. There were a lot of quotas to meet and never a chance to be bored. Constantly moving.
good,"I enjoy working Home Health. I love to drive to different patient's homes. I love helping my patients and having interesting conversations about their past history and their interests. I get along well with my co-workers. I love being able to time manage and schedule my visits with my patients and still be able to take care of my family's needs. the hardest part of my job is that I'm only a part time employee with out benefits, which sometimes makes it hard to make ends meet financially."
good,The staff and co-workers were a pleasure to be with. The management was unreasonable of their requests.
good,did not always have the tools to do my job. staff behavior not always professional
good,I learned a lot about helping others that had surgeries and needed therapy for a few weeks.
good,"Top heavy, not in business at this location anymore."
good,"great place to start and hone in on your med surg skills, you as the nurse are performing all the duties and you are getting you experience, there is management there for you to talk with, competencies, meetings, documentation, computer skills."
good,"Just sat at the front desk and did numerical data entry, answered 10 line phone system, and assisted patient families."
good,My day usually started with the scheduling of patient's chart for pickup and transport of patient's from local hospitals to the Health South rehab facility in a timely manner. Patient care and proper transportation technique was learned and required for a seamless and painless transfer from one medical setting to another. close contact and information was provided by excellent management and team of coworkers. Transporting certain patients had it's challenges and required team participation. this was the most difficult part of the job. The day seemed to fly by working as a transporter.
good,"Worked there for 4 years, Office manager was not professional, discussed private personal employee information and situations with non administrative personnel. Office environment was thick and tense. Field staff were awesome and very knowledgeable. Would recommend"
good,learned upper management and enjoyed most of the other workers
good,"Hospice at Encompass is still not where it should be. Pay is much lower than majority of competitors. Productivity driven model not suitable for hospice at Encompass. Until upper management recognizes that, turnover will continue to be high and composite scores will not be as favorable as expected. Hard to keep great nurses when they are worked so hard and don’t have separate on call support."
good,"Shortage of employees which causes longer working hours and days. Favoritism, too much back biting and no willingness to understand employee's conditions."
good,High turnover with staff.  Focused more on numbers versus patient care and employee satisfaction of doing o good job.  Staff meetings and visits were not coordinated well.
good,"Sales goals are strictly based on traditional Medicare patients.  This is clearly outlined in the offer letter to the salesperson.  There is a huge turnover rate in the Houston market due to the growing Medicare advantage plans.  The sales teams must care for those patients just as other patients but they get no credit for it.  Therefore, they feel unfulfilled because the supervisors continue to put pressure to meet Medicare goals.  This causes the sales team to feel that Encompass doesn't really care about a patient if they do not have traditional Medicare."
good,"I came to Encompass after leaving a very difficult place.  I thought it would be different here.  I expected great things and I was told to expect great things.  However, the current branch director is a lazy micro-manager who is more concerned about ensuring that he stays in his office chair than about anything else.  There are nurses here that are doing patients and the company great harm and nothing is being done. The branch director loves to talk and his meetings go on forever, as do his emails.  If he doesn't like the way his staff is doing things, though, those meetings and emails can get very threatening and petty."
good,"Heavy workload, constantly short-staffed. No phlebotomists, nurses were required to draw all labs. Great incentives for picking extra shifts. Great acute rehab hospital for pts."
good,"The transition with Healthsouth was handled well by the upper mgmt"
good,"Nurses there are not very nice, be prepared for a lot of attitude. You get a lot of experience especially if you are a new nurse, next best thing to being on a Med-Surg floor; if that's what you are looking for."
good,"Not very organized and very little communication between staff and the management.  You do not know what to expect when you come to work, having 12 patients sometimes more to care for in a 12 hour shift on your own is too much for any one."
good,"For PRN positions, Healhsouth is an acceptable place to work. The weekend environment is relaxed and not stressful. Management communicated with me effectively, but I wasn't challenged at my position, ever."
good,Typical fast pasted HH Agency. High volume Marketing plays pivital role. Corporate structure with home headquarters in Dallas Texas(Every employ has the opportunity to go to Dallas for approx. 3days call Foundations)
good,"I personally needed to leave due to they would not give me the shift promised in interview - day shift.  I was stuck on second shift and worked a lot of holidays and weekends.  Some nurses there were very difficult to work with, which was not enjoyable.  It is very physically demanding, as you are working with a lot of recent knee, back, hip surgeries and need to rehabilitate them to walking again.  "
good,"For a job that should have been low stress d/t lower acuity and lower pt/nurse ratio, this was a very stressful place to work. Poor managers, lots of back-stabbing and cliques in the staff. One of the most stressful places I have ever worked emotionally."
good,"The work was fine, but the environment left much to be desired. I often felt like I was in High school again with so much pettiness surrounding me.Good benefits though."
good,"My time working at HealthSouth was a major learning experience for me. I became very good at multi tasking, working with others, and reacting off instinct. At HealthSouth they run off of twelve hour shifts which taught me to push through even when I felt like I couldn't. There were many employees and sometimes drama with them. Through that I continued to do my job and remembered why I was there....to serve the patients and make money."
good,"I learned a great deal working at Health South. I met some nice and cool therapist. My supervisor couldve been more hands on. Some of the Occupational therapist were very rude,and the nurses included. I feel like the amount of work they require you to do doesnt match the pay rate. However, i enjoyed working there,and I was sad to go"
good,"Hospital is only a couple years old, the only thing bad that I have to say about it is that when census is low expect to be cut from working 3 days a week to only maybe 3 days per month. Had to find a 2nd job and eventually quit because I couldn't afford my bills once they my hours."
good,"Immediately after report, you must hop straight to medication pass. Health South is a very busy place. Management was fair. Diverse place to work. Pay was excellent!"
good,"workflow is slow and is great for someone that really wants nothing to do or to do little as possible while at work.Typical day is morning pyxis fill, then afternoon pyxis fill, and drug ordering."
good,"A good job for new grads but not a long term position. The work is often back breaking, the caseloads are big, the paper work is extensive, and the management is typical corporation."
good,"I enjoy beening around my co-workers and the patients"
good,This job is very demanding.  Short staffed. We work long 12 hours shifts.  Employee moral is really at a negative deficit.  I don't look forward to going to work
good,new grads welcome to build up confidence and skills as a nurse to take care of the growing demand in rehabilitation services. Compensation is on the low side but that is to be expected for a new grad position.
good,"management on this job was very poor ! Everyone in every department had to much put on them, which made a lot of stress. I would not go back there unless I was hungry and had to."
good,"Patient load 9-11 nights and 8-9 days, more and more higher acuity patients, daily transfers out of unstable patients. CEO of location main objective to fill as many beds but not concerned about the acuity and that puts overwhelming pressure on RNs who want to provide great care but have hands tied with heavy pt load. All for growth but need to do it responsibly. This is not rehab it is a med/surg or IMC floor. Nurses are helpful, minimal infighting. Typical nurse managers react to complaints with minimal support and illogical reasoning, remember taking care of 9-11 patients with usually a few requiring higher level of care, hence time consuming other pts and family suffer. Computers, glucometers, wound supplies in short supply, waste time looking for equipment - antique IV pumps and supplies as well as disorganization. Supervisors calling over PA that pt call light on and needs assistance instead of answering light - because the nursing staff is giving report, performing nursing care and CNAs doing vitals, CNA care, passing trays if nurses were available we would be getting lights. Facility does have great rehab personnel and equipment and RN approval in high 80s to 90s consistently. I commend executives for attempting to increase census but need to staff and provide equipment for additional patients"
good,"Evening Supervisor, my job starts off getting report, then I view staffing for the next shift.  I do leadership rounds on the patients assessing their needs and listening to their concerns.  Assist staff as needed. Audit charts, admit patients. Start IV's if needed, perform LPN, assessments. As a supervisor I have learned that you are viewed not by your work but what others think of you.  It involves interacting will everyone. You have to be fair and consistent in what you say and do. The hardest part of my job is the realization that some people work for a paycheck not because they love nursing. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others."
good,I really liked working for Encompass. At time I felt like there wasn't enough work and I was under the impression that eventually I could be hired on full time until I started working there I found out they don't hire aides full time.
good,Nice place but the company had some problems at the time. I was given the opportunity to stay there by learning different positions and then training my replacements. My bosses were very supportive when I decided to change jobs even though they did get me my dollar raise.
good,"poor management, low census at times, good benefits, and enjoyable coworkers"
good,Got many certifications to advance my career  Left this position because of harassement and  bullying
good,"Small inpatient hospital with outpatient services, close net group of employees with genuine desire for patient care.  Trouble with executive management produced instability, or perception of.  Limited opportunity for careers outside of clinical."
good,"Very busy. Low compensation. Out of touch management."
good,short breaks poor management great co-workers shortage of staff
good,"This region closed due to the fact it was doing poorly in the market. Therefore position was eliminated and then eventually all other centers were closed eventually. Job was good, flexible and enjoyed coworkers and friendly atmosphere."
good,"Some of the nurses and other staff members had a terrible attitude toward the patients, treating them as an inconvenience rather than people to serve and take care of."
good,"It is a good rehabilitation hospital for the patients. I would recommend it to a person in need of rehabilitation from a stroke etc.  Good hospital,.."
good,Encompass has a great back story to the company. As you start to work there you’ll notice a change and that the people don’t care about you as an employee as much as they say or display they do.
good,"The raises you get from promotions and annual evals are just insulting. There's no reason to be loyal to this company, the new hires are treated better than the ones who have worked there for years. Now the business office will be moving to a new location 30 minutes away, it won't be worth the extra gas, tolls and wear & tear on my car to stay here."
good,Encompass Health is a nice place to work. The facility I worked had some renovations going on for the building to make more space and update the building which is a great idea.
good,"This is a very fast paced job. Except to walk over 17,000+ steps in a 12 hour shift. The rehabilitation hospital is ran more like a Skilled Nursing home. It isn't a horrible place, it just needs to be less like a nursing home patient wise."
good,"U better buckle up and down for this job. Management is the worst everyone hangs out with each other and discuss employees who they don't like. Nurse manager also make up extra job requirements for certain employees. They actually wanted me to cross train with a  physical therapist. No one else scheduled for this, but me. Lot of favoritism in this environment."
good,"A large national company with a great theory for patient care, but too focused on “the numbers” and bottom line instead of the quality of visits and patient care. Good wages, but insurance and benefits average."
good,For the most part working here was good was able to see patient recover from accident and conditions quickly. It was a decent environment to work in. Work with awesome nurses
good,"Good starting pay"
good,"Wonderful place to work until it wasn't.  As long as the patient census was adequate and the marketing department did their job with referrals, everything was great.  The moment the census dropped, it was like Survivor and someone was fired every 2 week.  Especially when new regional and staff came in. Health care is a ebb and flow and they never cared, only regarding their management bonuses."
good,"This job was challenging and very rewarding. Corporate was fixed on numbers Vs patient care, and left us understaffed most days. I have no problem helping other departments, but there was always something lacking in one area or another. Developed life long relationships with coworkers, and bonded over stressful times."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the collaboration with other clinical specialties in order to produce the best outcomes for the patient.  Team collaboration is an important part of the job.
good,CEO and head of marketing was let go.  Again not enough emphasis on patient experience.  Medical input was reduced to minimal.   Ongoing education was limited.
good,"They do not take disabilities into consideration. Unable to stand for long time, difficulty climbing stairs. can't see at night. yet I had to continue same work without consideration."
good,"The staff itself within the therapy department were wonderful, it is amazing to work with individuals who truly care about their clients and put 100% effort into everything they do. Unfortunately everything was about the numbers, clients, staff and their loved ones were never as important as the compensation, scores on press ganey and making sure insurance was paying for everything. There was a high turn over rate from the beginning and as there were several changes of CEOs within the region, the work environment became hostile and unmanageable. The staff was called an abomination at times by DOT.  Lack of empathy, communication and unrealistic standards forced the staff to go to corporate to complain. There was a lack of staffing due to a ""matrix"" made to keep costs down, but never took into account the client needs. "
good,Very large organization spread out across country.  Not a very strong presence of corporate here.  The clinic was run pretty autonomously locally with little corporate input.
good,The job offered extensive and elaborate training but unfortunately it was not practical. I often felt like I was on my own to learn all the many (too many) responsibilities that came with the job title.
good,"Most hospitals are patient driven. Each hospital has their own ""rules"" there is no consistency within the hospital. Things have definitely changed over the past year."
good,"The company's management was OK at best. It had 3 CEOs in 3 years. Each of them had different opinions and made their own impacts on the company."
good,"The management is an issue, also staffing ratios is based off of who the unit manager favors, and organization of acuity of care lacks. Investing money in making the place look better though"
good,"I really loved working here and my co workers were like family.  All that changed when they changed management and cut staff.  No matter how many times I spoke to them about it, they were unable to make any changes."
good,Good co-workers throughout the hospital. Company has several programs for providing good customer service and improving patient outcomes. Regular scheduled meetings to hear how building and company are doing in the marketplace.
good,"Worked midknights on floor crew supervisor. Enjoyed working with staff and family members, get to know how people are . Long hours and very low pay but chould learn as I went on such as cpr, patient transport, and nurse clerk."
good,"Encompass Health taught me a lot about the healthcare industry. The  company is a great place to work for and provides many benefits. They offer quarterly bonuses, health insurance, and 401k."
good,"Flexible work schedule, 6 weeks PTO, good culture, benefits are good but they low ball you with your pay. Management micromanages. I approve of the CEO."
good,It promotes stability and job advancement but management is new and still needs to work hard and improve. Coworkers are great but some patients needs acute care and not rehabilitable.
good,"I did PRN there, and every time I came in, the staff would seem more disgruntled than I remembered.  There were some very unhelpful RN's who never answered a call light, or would have an attitude problem when I needed help with a patient. However, the therapy techs were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable."
good,Flexible with time but was asked to perform duties outside my job description. Did not feel safe working here and felt my license was in jeopardy so I found a new job pretty quickly
good,They will call you off 90% of the time. You are required 2 weekend days a month and sometimes are cut for those hours too. Small therapy gym. Old equipment. Very friendly staff. Great orientation. Under paid compared to other local facilities. Needs updated! No cafeteria food on weekends.
good,"Not enough staff! They expected CNA's to have between 12 and 16 patients and complete patient care in 8 hours. This was almost an impossible task. I didn't want to work there any longer, I felt that my patient care was suffering and that is not fair to me or the patient."
good,"Worked in both inpatient/outpatient therapy enjoying my job, however security of employment is limited by marketing of services. 90% of day was clinical."
good,PT does a good job. The Drs do a great job and show compassion. There are some very good nurses however they are understaffed. Sr. Mgmt and Corp could do a much better job in communication. They are reactive not proactive. The building is outdated in comparison to other similar facilities.
good,"Typical hospital work environment, a bit chaotic but overall okay. The staff is half way decent some RNs will help with patient care others will not, however, you get that everywhere."
good,"Typical day included helping patients dress, taking blood pressure and other vital signs; helping patients as needed.  It was enjoyable helping patients feel better, but it was difficult sometimes multi-tasking many patients at once."
good,"I went in there in hopes of learning and growing. But unless you plan on being a nurse or a physical, occupational or speech therapist, there is no room to grow. You will stay stuck in your job and only get a 2% raise every year if you're lucky"
good,"There is minimal opportunity for training or advancement. You have to be in the clique or part of the ones who are well liked by upper management. Your work ethic or quality of work don't speak for you. The raises are only the minimal cost of living and have nothing to do with the yearly reiews or the work you do. Most people in management roles know nothing. It seems the more you know, the more it works against you."
good,Challenging at times  to meet the demands of Director of Marketing. Often times you are flooded with touch base calls and distracted from your work load. There is a weekly meeting that went over two hours that could be considered as non productive
good,This job has a lot of work. low pay. but could do better hireling more help sometimes. But the nurses are good to work with. its a lot of work. the charting on patient care is difficult the chart on. Sometimes they would be short handed and work was overwhelming.
good,The branch manager was dishonest and unprofessional though she left and staff says the Fredericksburg Branch has improved. Far too much charting for my taste but it comes with the territory of HH Nursing.
good,When the census is low there are regular destaffings which can affect one's pay drastically.  Management seems to put nursing on the bottom of the list for priority. Turn over is extremely high and perhaps one reason is poor selection of personnel by HR as well as hard working conditions.
good,"7 to 10 patients unless assigned total care then 4 to 5 patients, learned how to care for and manage rehab patients, management ok, workplace culture was very diverse, hardest part of job was getting exact instruction from management as to what was expected or what had changed that needed to be done or performed differently, best part of the job were the patients."
good,"Staffing ratios are almost unbearable due to the amount of patients and the acuity of care they need. Minimum of 9-10. "
good,"There are only two pharmacist and one technician for the hospital.  We had an excellent Administrator the first couple of years I worked there. There was a lot of turnover in nursing staff and  management over the last five years.  The hardest part of the job was the drive back and forth which took 1 1/4 hours one way and that I was unable to take a long vacation the last three years, in fact I never had a two week vacation the last five years. The best part was knowing that this hospital provides an excellent rehab service.  The work was good but could be extremely busy at times."
good,"I loved my job at HealthSouth. It was a great place to improve my nursing skills, and I enjoyed working with the staff.I did learn to value my work ethic, expanded my patient care skills, and decided to maintain my CNA as a profession."
good,"New people new company a lot to learn on building employee moral. Flexible schedule and good benefits, management cares a lot about patient satisfaction."
good,"Great place to work ; very fast-paced; must expect to work in an environment where day to day you are not sure if you will be flexed off.  With small staff, it may be difficult to cover all tasks that must be completed with the relm of patient safety."
good,Encompass has many great things going for it. It has great medical software that they use that is very powerful. I didn't feel I had the support of the supervisor that I had toward the end of my time there. She was based out of Colorado and would only come to Utah once a quarter and usually just spend a few hours here before going back. High stress and demand is how she managed.
good,I got a wide range of experience and learned a lot from the great nurses that worked there. Only downside was being understaffed and having a pretty heavy patient load.
good,Not a good work environment. Typical day included direct patient care of physically handicapped adults and adolescence. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was the physical strain of lifting bending and repositioning patients. The most enjoyable part was bonding with the patients and listening to their stories.
good,There was not enough staff to cover all the patients in a timely manner.  People were stressed all the time. Management would not listen to anyone or any suggestions.
good,"Typical work da. Management is okay, co-workers are sometimes helpful. The hardest part of the job is getting through the day."
good,Corporate could care more about the time and work that employees put in. You're under paid for the work that is required. All in all it is an ok job I just wish the pay was better for the length of time I have been with the company.
good,"I enjoyed my job immensely.  Working with people with disabilities is so rewarding. I did not work alone. There were physicians, nurses, case managers, physical therapist, occupational therapists, and speech therapist.  We all worked together; we were a team."
good,Its a very good place to work for a hard working person.  This company could use a little overhauling as far as its employee to patient ratio.  Also management could be more open and understanding to their employees.
good,"My time with Health South  was not rewarding at all.  Limited training provided, supports lacking from a Nurse Manager who did not know how to be a supportive supervisor and overworked Social Workers who worked too many hours and could never get caught up.  The bottom line for this company is obtaining ratings and making money.  Patient care is second.  While there I was constantly stressed, harassed by the Case Manager Assistant and felt like it was time to go, until I finally went.  Limited training options.Managers constantly meddled into one's personal lives and sped it amongst each other.  Although the money one can earn is decent, I would stay away unless you desire to work more tan you ever worked before and not be thanked or compensated for doing so."
good,"Higher price PRN staff are first class."
good,"Good place to work, very friendly co-workers, flexible schedule. Great benefits."
good,It is very obvious by even a short-timer that if you're not in the click you will be talked about and bullied until you can't take it anymore and eventually leave.  The team runs well when certain supervisors are working and very stressful when one other one is there.
good,I am enjoying my time at healthsouth but I will say their is not much  room to work in other departments because we are strictly rehabilitation and the work load can be a lot with not much support at times
good,"Its a good facility to start as a new grad to learn nursing skills. Its a very fast paced and productive environment. Team work, prioritizing, time management and multi tasking is a must. Overall enjoyed it but it was a night shift position I had and its very difficult on the body for rest. One major problem is being short staffed, because it can be a block to providing quality care."
good,Great place to work and gain experience. Learn a lot and had exposure to a variety of patients with different levels of acuity. Turn over is high I think because of nursing burn out due to short staffing so the PRN requirement changed from 12 hours per month that I was initially hired under.
good,"Rapidly changing, shifting priorities, management changes, physical rehabilitation as a field is excellent with good stability and growth potential but Rusk losses staff and changes administration frequently."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was working with patients
good,"I enjoyed working for HealthSouth Corporation"
good,"Work at home using auto cad"
good,"Loved the company as a whole. President and CEO has good moral values and her attitude drives the philosophy of the company. I really felt like they stood behind and believed in the company mission statement.  The employees are friendly and helpful and it feels like you work with family and friends. The accounting team was made up of some of the hardest working and smartest people I've ever worked with. Unfortunately, pay is low, benefits are expensive and no promotion from within. There was also a culture within the accounting department of being perceived as a hard worker based on how much overtime you worked. There was also LOTS of work and responsibility but the compensation didn't match."
good,"Clinic outreach environment for athletic trainers. I learned a lot of hands on skills, as well as how the Physical therapy environment worked. Management varied to Excellent, to the worst boss I have ever had in my whole career to this point. My co-workers were outstanding. Hardest part of my job was having a difficult boss. I loved working at the clinic as well as the local high schoo."
good,It is a average place to work. The patients appreciate the care we give!
good,"I enjoyed working at Healthsouth Rehab because of the patient care and the great employees, However, there were severe staffing issues which created stress on the employee and danger to the patient."
good,"HS offered me a great opportunity, but management support was lacking.  It seemed like every time I initiated a project, management didn't follow through with support of the project.  I felt that what really mattered to the administration was the bottom dollar."
good,Staff is amazing
good,"Healthsouth is a enjoyable place to work. The only thing i don't like when the cenus is low we get sent home, but other than that it's a great place to work."
good,I enjoy interacting with patients and learning new life lessons each day.Work is high level on a daily basis.Management are understandable and caring people.Co-workers are blessings.
good,Encompass has a great work environment but the salary and benefits are lower than average and they do not promote from within. It is hard to justify staying long term
good,Good pay. Looking for something more flexible without working so many double shifts. Schedule not changing without notice and better management. Overall ok place
good,"Good place to work very helpful lind compassionate care for stroke patients  excellent therapy care, good food. Kind caring helpful people to get to work with"
good,My time at Encompass Health was amazing ! Loved working in several different departments as I learned and grew within the hospital. My supervisors were patient with me in learning new aspects of different positions.  My career as an Admissions Representative ended due to layoffs and budget cuts . I was an employee for 7 years.
good,"I enjoyed the environment, but I didn’t like that we didn’t have good management when it came to the amount of hours I was working. Getting full time hours is nearly impossible."
good,Worked here for years; cafeteria was not an issue they were open normal hours; just bring your own lunch. Manager was horrible; didn't KNOW ANYTHING only wanted to micromanage. Director did not direct-- only wanted to keep down confusion therefore allowed manager to run around department and gossip. Best thing that could have happened for this company was the relocation.
good,They run their nurses ragged. They hover and micromanage everyone within the branch. They contradict themselves all the time. I would work there again if management didn't hover.
good,This is a place that overall is good to work in. However for Managers is very difficult given that the Company does not support them that much when they need to discipline employees.  The Company is too permissive. Pay could be improved to match cost of living. Benefits are good when compared to other companies.
good,My biggest problem was the pay. It’s roughly $3-5 lower than most companies in the Houston area. Always short on staff.....covering all the patients and areas is almost impossible. High turn over for nurses.
good,"Great culture and Great people. Long days, Hard work, Expectations high, turnover average, management unpredictable. Like the challenges, no crazy about some of the stuff that goes on but overall good company to work for."
good,"Company went through many management changes 3-managers, 2 CNOs, and 2-CEOs, in 1 year, hopefully all the changes are finished, company also merge with another company Reliant, so not sure what pro/cons happened with the merge.  Staff was friendly and helpful, CNAs were not always helpful, complained a lot, upper management not supportive with nursing/cna staff."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is to learn new concepts on daily basis. I enjoyed interacting with doctors,Nurses, patients and their families answering their questions and was able to handle difficult patients with Grace."
good,"Like any other company you work for, there are good things and bad. It depends on what you let effect your work/day. "
good,would not work there again;  too much management and no one listens to the nurses.  tried to cheat you out of money for being on call. need to hire a weekend nurse to pick up the slack on the weekends
good,"I really enjoy helping those less fortunate, and unable to do for themselves. I helped people whose age ranged from 15 to 99. Also, I've helped a number of stroke and cancer patients."
good,"Heavy patient loads often enough to cause irritation."
good,"It""s a good company to work in. Benefits wise. The environment is conducive to learning. People are nice to work with. The hospital culture is commendable."
good,"Aside from being poorly managed, the people you work with on the floor are excellent and the teamwork is great. Administration has really gone downhill over the last couple of years but the co-workers make it easy to want to come to work."
good,i get called off more than i work it seems. i keep being told that it will pick up but its a rehab facility and i think they bit off more than they could chew.
good,There were many times where a CNA had too many heavy Patients and no help from nurses or any staff. Pay was not worth every thing a CNA did there. Hours are cut often due to census
good,"Patient overload.  You were on the move when you got in a 630 until 730 or 800.  Breaks not long enough.  Overall, it was okay to work there but I would not recommend anyone to work there."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed 1 on 1 care with the patients. "
good,"good company to work for, great benefits , team oriented, fast paced, great working atomsphere, supportive staff, provide staff with tools to adequate perform their jobs."
good,"The job is hard, fast paced, and stressful. Sometimes there is no time to even chart the million things you have to chart per shift. The nursing staff, and therapy staff are wonderful. The administration, especially HR, on the other hand don't care for the employees and are only looking out for the bottom line."
good,Poor training.  Lack of support for nursing.  Abundance of blame for nursing.  Stressful and threatening work environment.  Great deal of employee turnover.
good,"It was a great place to work at first but as years went by, the greediness set in and the teeth came out. Eventually, my role was changed from someone who provided guidance to fellows employees to someone who has to hold down the fort because folks were leaving in droves."
good,Frequently had assignments changed due to urgent needs and other staff members having family emergencies needing to be off work and adding their assignments to my schedule.
good,"Time off is few and far between, but patients are very sweet and appreciative. Most nurses work well with the techs, but working second shift is the hardest and includes the most work. Great job to learn and gain experience."
good,"I wished the pay had been better ,raising  3 children was difficult, i guess that is life working till you drop still  happens ,I  hope the company appreciate what they have ,cherish  it"
good,Good people to work with. 40 Years in Health Care Supply chain operations. This is an incredible time for me to share my experience in the Healthcare supply chain.
good,No work/life balance. Patients added to schedule throughout week when appointments are set on current schedule. Other OT left and had to reschedule or miss all pending evaluations with family members blaming me.  Unable to fulfill PCC meetings because  of staff shortages. Work device/tablet non therapist friendly. Often up all morning scheduling and night finishing paperwork.
good,"Not good team cohesion.  "
good,This was a very good company to work for. The mangement was very laid back and easy going and let you basically set your own schedule. I really enjoyed working for them .
good,"Encompass outside of the home office billing department is great."
good,HealthSouth closed to another company while I worked there. From what I know Select is an good company to work for providing both outpatient and inpatient care.
good,I loved the people I worked with and even the job I worked. It was a lot of fun working with rehab patients. It was cool seeing patients get better and be able to see the their progress.
good,"Directors need to be more involved in the departments that they run, they need to know the work itself as well as the work load. There needs to be proper amount of time for proper training."
good,"You have to want to do the work & that's the problem there, a lot of the employees don't have the heart to take care of the patients. 98% of the Nurses DO NOT help you & will run you to the ground if you allow them too. I've witnessed about 2 of the charge nurses on day shift willing want to help you. You are very underpaid especially for all that you do. And it has become more like a nursing home and not a rehabilitation."
good,Professional staff to work with however upper management was not supportive. Good benefits and a sign on bonus were a plus. Patient care was a team approach as it should be.
good,Intimate inpatient rehabilitation hospital that has very successful patient outcome thanks to their fantastic therapy team. Clean facility. Competent staff.
good,I just did my job and everything was peaceful.  I implemented several new programs while I was there.  I started a Coumadin dosing service and an aminoglycoside dosing service.  As well as I changed the entire drug delivery system.
good,"I worked part time, but wanted full time. It was very hard to get. People were nice, but I don't feel I was compensated for my experience. Nursing staff was nice, management was not all that great."
good,Healthsouth of Columbia has gotten so bad. The turn over rate is awful. The management sucks. The CNO and nurse managers scare to help their staff. They love to see them drown. I would recommend. You will have 9-10 patients a day with admission.
good,"Work load can vary."
good,Lack of enough staff to adequately care for patients. High nurse patient ratio. Many of the managers don't have hospice experience and don't adequately understand what hospice does. Many have a home health background. Other members of the team are awesome.
good,This is a good place to work and the raised are well worth the work but management likes to pass the buck so to speak and will through you under the bus very fast. Lots of favoritism in the nursing dept by management.
good,"Though HSRH of Richmond took higher co-morbid clientele than other facilities, this would not be reflected in the allotment of staff as compared to other HSRH or other comparable facilities. "
good,"My typical day at work is anticipating on leaving from there."
good,Job load is pretty hectic  the nurses don't  help  the techs. And the nurses that do is slim to none. Staffing is not adequate for  patient care. The facility itself  is not bad but a few staffing  issues  could be fixed if they paid a little  more.
good,Overall it is a decent place. Some of the management could be better and pay could be better also. Sometimes patient load is a little too much
good,Not for me . Long hours and really short breaks. Great staff and coworkers. I work night shifts and wish I had thought of the hours and how that would affect my school. Not working out for me as well as I hoped.
good,"good place to work but very hard on body  good benefits that start almost immediately.  Pay is very good."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, we always made our goals and received a bonus for that. We were treated well. It is a great place to work."
good,Typical day is 95% patient care.  Caseload is manageable.  Management supportive.  Co-workers make working there great.  Hardest part of the job is managing your schedule on busy days.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with patients to make a difference in their lives.
good,great cowokers and team players under new management that still working out kinks and they still need to have open line with nursing.
good,"Caring for patients with multiple traumas. such as CVA, heart attack MVA, amputation, TBI. Learning to meet the need of the whole patient for the overall wellness and rehabilitation back to a better quality of life. teaching and redirecting patient and families toward self care and independency."
good,They should hire more help. Not enough staff. Techs usually have any where from 15- 20 patients. Nurses have 8- 10 patients. Its more like a nursing home than a rehab hospital.
good,"Initially, very impressed with the company and its staff, felt staff was recognized for their efforts, positive environment, and great compesation and benefits. Unfortunately, the management team skewed my view of the companies integrity and ethics along with its mission statement. "
good,cleaning/ i learned a lot about elderly people and my coworkers are good people management was alright no part of my job was hard.
good,Didn't like being attached to a phone. I do believe it was run well. I wouldn't hesitate to send someone there for a procedure.
good,"assisting patients  to and from therapy, taking vitals and chart progress."
good,"Very busy workplace with some very dedicated and hard working staff.  I learned that patients who come to Cane Creek for rehabilitation services had to be actively monitored and treated for premorbid conditions. We had various issues with management and very high turnover of employees including the CNO and Medical Director and Administrator for the facility.  When I started this job, moral between employees was very high. By the time I left this job, there was more chaos and confusion than structure."
good,Driving patients to rehab appointments. Learned the stories of different people and the problems they had to deal with. Mangement does not care about employees or who they put out of a job.Co Workers were the best HealthSouth could ask for 'The Back bone of the company without them HealthSouth would be nothing.Putting up with state and federal regs that cut funding to programs that support jobs in the areas that cost people their jobs while the politations live high on the hog. The enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and the patients I came in contact with day to day.
good,"Cook, prep, serve diet foods off the tray lines. This company was good place of employment."
good,I enjoyed working withthe Nursing staff especially.  Going to an electronic medical record system was challenging but the staff worked hard and were very successful.  The patients are enjoyable and really appreciate their expereince.
good,"I enjoyed working for HealthSouth, and only left because I was offered a job by Emerson Pro Sports Medicine, which was just down the hall."
good,The clinic I worked at was wonderful.  The staff was very close and worked well together.  Healthsouth Corporation never seemed to really know any of us other than by a number.  I enjoyed my work enviroment and co-workers very much.
good,driving patient to and from doctors appointments.i learned cpr and how to get around the city.management was ok.some co-workers should have been fired for their attitude
good,It is a okay place to start off but one needs to definitely go to an acute care hospital setting to get the appropriate experience to become a valuable RN.
good,The company has grown a lot since I started working for them 9 years ago. They pay well and give you education to do the job. Overall it's a good company to work for.
good,They are a for profit organization which isn't bad in itself but the main focus here is profit.  It shows in every decision they make.  They hire mostly young/newly graduated therapists and under pay them since they don't know how to negotiate or what they are worth.  They have paid as much as 7 dollars below average for the area and haven't changed that standard in over 10 years.  It has great internal promotion pathways that other companies don't have and the benefits package is par with most other companies.  They have a bit of a bad reputation being that they were recently known as HealthSouth and if you look back in the last 20 years with various billing scandals they were one of the top companies that were in trouble and they have had to re-brand and sell off clinics.That is due to the profit first mindset and not having more clinicians in the top offices.
good,Caring staff and co workers. I did not enjoy the point system to determine visit numbers per week. Little high of a load to he able to provide the care you want for your patients
good,Empresa ofrece un buen servicio al empleador. Considero que me puedo desenvolver en otras areas. Quisiera explorar otras alternativas de crecimiento profesional.
good,"I loved my job and the people i worked with. we all worked as a team to help each other to get the job done. I really liked the company's purpose to help elderly people, the nurses and physical therapist were outstanding and great to work with."
good,encompass health rehab  hospital use to be health south rehab hospital. the name was changed about nine months ago and we were told that things were good and our jobs were save two months later I was laid off.
good,"I was very productive. I learned a lot about Physical Therapy. I transported patients, maintained the therapy gym, and assisted the therapists with the exercises for the patients."
good,No perks for long time employees & insurance gets worse every year..  Corporate ideals are great on paper but dont transfer to branches.  Medicare cuts limit perks but hard to keep staff when no incentive to stay.
good,I am fortunate enough to work with a great team of office peers as well as outstanding clinician team.  I have had the opportunity to grow and learn during my time at Encompass.
good,"The staffing was inconsistent and at times did not meet safely meet the patient load and acuity.  Management support was also inconsistent which compounded the pressures of the job.  Many temp workers were brought on the replace regular staff absence or departures making it difficult to concentrate on one's own work and patient responsibilities.  On the positive note, the exposure to a broad variety of patients made the job interesting and the ability to learn a daily experience."
good,"Overall I enjoyed some of my working days at this company because of many wonderful staff members. Be ready to be called off constantly when census is low nursing staff. Many RN's and CNA's were called off multiple times in a week. Some RN's help with patient care and others believe that is not in their scope of practice ""they only pass meds"". CNA's are not treated very nicely, long 12 hr shift, and nurse supervisor on day shift needs to help more often instead of yelling on the intercom ""ANSWER LIGHTS""!"
good,Marketing a designated area and doing patient reviews to get admitted to this facility. Lots of time to be spent with doctors offices/clinics and patients and their families.
good,The hardest part of the job is that you will be assigned in a different area every week. Even when you are called in and requested a specific area for a single shift.
good,Overall the staff of the Encompass Hospice office carries the day.  They are dedicated and well educated for their position.  Management is another story in that they are lackluster and lack initiative.
good,"If you like home health, this is a good company. Benefits and compensation are adequate but far from superb. Must have a clinical license to advance. Excellent PDO benefit!"
good,Good company in need of a focused strategy.  Management understood what needed to be implemented to success but execution sometimes lacked due to the inability to invest
good,"Overall, good place to work at but work and life balance is an issue. "
good,"able to see patient load evening before so was able to lay out day, had anywhere between 7-15 patients daily, drove anywhere between 35 to 110 miles daily"
good,"This hospital has so much potential to be a great place to work. Unfortunately, management can be described as the definition of insanity: expecting different results doing the same thing over and over again. It does not matter who comes to manage the hospital, we have the same issues: lack of personnel, patients who are not appropriate for an inpatient rehab; lack of accountability from management when they make a mistake; micromanagement of census, intensity, people are fired and you don't even know what happened to them until you don't see them anymore; lack of communication,  honesty, and transparency."
good,"This is not a bad company to work for, the benefits are very good. Could use more people who actually care about their jobs and how they do their jobs."
good,Fast pace busy environment hospital setting working under physical therapist. Its rewording to see patients make progress and recover. I really enjoyed it
good,"home health visits to clients for teaching/assessing, IV therpy, wound vac therapy, wound care, venipuncture, catheter management, OASIS assessments, on-call rotation"
good,I felt the work I did there was productive and made a difference in people's lives I was fortunate to serve those families in the last phase of life. Working here has change my on life and priorities
good,"I was sitting in cubicle typing my fingers to the bone and was told this job was mainly marketing. There was 5% marketing with this position. Took a $18,000 pay cut because Amedisys Home Health closed their doors."
good,"Good work environment, unfortunately it is now closed, another company bought them out. I did not care for the manager I had, she had a bad attitude and it seemed to be getting worse."
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers. The company was pretty much diverse when I worked there. The most enjoyable part for me was getting patient back to near or close to 100 percent and getting them back to work and on their way to a healthy lifestyle
good,I love working with the patients. I enjoyed helping those who needed help.  It was a lot of driving that took a toll on my back at times. I was in car most of the day
good,Productive fun and nice place to work. I enjoyed going to work doing my job and getting it done correctly. The staffs are helpful and friendly and I enjoy talking to the patients. You
good,"Great people to work with, corporate is based in the South and is difficult to negotiate with at times, salaries on the lower end of the spectrum, great care and great pt outcomes"
good,"Worked as a staff therapist doing evaluations, treatments, FIMs, and documentation.  All treatment were 90 minutes.  Worked with a great group of therapists.  Director was fair and supportive.  Hardest part of the job was the daily showers that were required daily. Most enjoyable was the patients and the therapy staff. Learned different techniques from other therapists. Had a good relationship w/ most staff members. Had access to innovative equipment."
good,Don't like the way HR handles new employees very unorganized needs a lot of improvement. HR is very slow with returning calls very very slow needs a lot of improvement they don't make phone calls they address you with text messages unprofessional
good,"Schedule patients in order to be seem, general assessment, obtain vital signs, educate medications, provide wound care if ordered, order wound care supplies, obtain labs if ordered, communicate any patient changes with doctor"
good,A great place to work with great people. Everyone is very team oriented. Great with communication. Also will gladly help you with questions if you may not know the answer
good,Great place to work but poor management by the branch director. Working at encompass expand my knowledge about home healthcare and providing good customer services.
good,"Okay place to work. Do your research on people in branch before hire on. Good flexibility, hours, patient care. Bad management education/experience. Make sure your supervisor has self esteem."
good,"A few of the staff and managers were not so friendly but it's a good facility. Bad part they change your schedule and you're not aware. I was actually let go due to coming in late, I thought I had the day off but apparently the days were switched I wasn't notified and was told it was my fault I should look at the schedule each day."
good,A typical day at work is good with the staff provided when we aren't understaffed. Management doesnt apply the same rules for all and lots of favortitism is an issue.
good,"The dates that you mentioned was when I was working for HealthSouth, I did not know it as Encompass. It was a long time ago so my memory may not be as good as with my previous jobs."
good,I worked PRN. It was very difficult at times to be thrown into organizing groups for treatments with individuals with different diagnosis and needs. The documentation seemed very redundant.
good,Good place to learn. Fast paced and teaches you to be independent and self sufficient. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smile on the patients faces
good,My job got eliminated I had to find something else went back to GCMC I liked my job but it started to get where the work was becoming  an overload. I loved all the therapist that work there.
good,work ethics are remarkable for the most part. time management is somewhat of a problem related to understaffing. stress is not uncommon for this position as you take quite a bit of work home with you in which makes it hard to leave work at work and be at home doing what is needed at home
good,"Great services, questionable leadership at the time of my employ. Good, caring staff. Staff pulled together to foster a great working culture. Immature leadership at the time of my employment."
good,"Health South is a small organization with little or no scope for promotion, not a unionized organization - got hurt on the job and was constantly harassed to return to work before properly healed"
good,"Receptionist for hospital and enjoyed the various duties that included interaction with visitors and helping other managers in various capacities."
good,Care for and monitor patients daily. Medication and wound management. Educating patients and family's of disease processes. Assisting with daily needs and exercises as well as therapies.
good,...work starts with getting a list of the  patient census and checking for consults.  See all consults and complete nutrition assessments . Follow up weekly and attend team conferences for updates and interventions needed.
good,"Very good benefits. Interactions with the patients and staff is almost always pleasant. The company name changed, the CEO is new, and policies and procedures are all new."
good,"Although I enjoyed helping patients to achieve positive outcomes, I felt management was more focus on appearances than actual patient care.  Sometimes suggestions made to improve patient outcomes were merely heard than forgotten."
good,"Working at HealthSouth gave me the exprerience to work with a lot of differfent kind of people with mant type off illness,broken bones,limted body movement people."
good,I was an OT student and learned a lot about the medical model. The staff was encouraging and gave plenty of opportunities. The facility was always clean.
good,"Always felt that Corporate was more supportive than the local office I worked in. Home Health is a beast of it's own, but loved the patients. On call schedules were never shared responsibilities, always got dumped on."
good,"Ok place to start but after a year it’s best to move on."
good,"Perform nursing care, IV insertion and management, providing home monitors and other special equipment when needed, oxygen support per nasal cannula, monitoring per cardiac/pulse oximeter, etc."
good,"I worked here from May of 2017 to September of 2017. I loved this job at first. It was absolutely amazing. I'm a CNA, so being an HHA was a step down to what I am used to, which I didn't particularly like, especially with the nurse's referred to me as a bath aide, which I pretty much was. I had no real interaction with the patients except to give them a shower. Most of the patients refused, and if you had too many refusals, you got in trouble with management. They don't respect patient rights in that way either, as if the patient says no, they want you to try anyway and I didn't appreciate that."
good,Health South is a great facility. The PT's are wonderful to work with and truly care for the patients and focused on improving their mobility. Health South is a very fast paste environment but still manageable. Typical day varied on what shift you worked.
good,Not a bad place to work but not a lot of support from management and often unrealistic goals and out dated hardware.  The patient care was good and I worked with some truly fine people
good,"In this position, needed to be aware that long hours, to get job duties done and go above and beyond. Travel and mileage to be flexible to meet the needs of the patient."
good,"The employer is supportive, informative and the company is well organized. I learned a lot about wound care and found I enjoyed doing that type of nursing. That being said it was one of the hardest jobs I ever had. The charting is tedious and takes a long time to complete.  The drive times are too long. I found myself using my own time trying to keep up with the job, planning my schedule, phone calls, problem solve. My fellow coworkers were awesome,very supportive team."
good,"Fun Place to work, Providing good customer service to the visitor as well as the patient's."
good,"Great teamwork, patient care is awesome with most caregivers, nurses are very personable w patients, clean environment, really focus on helping the patients be more independent."
good,this was my first job as a licensed can. Although the work was faced paced and overwhelming at times the reward was the feedback form the patient and families. It really made the job worth it.
good,Colleagues and supervisor were good. It was a small facilty and it seemed that everyone knew one another. I worked there a long time ago and don't remember many details.
good,"I have no comments about HealthSouth working atmosphere. This is the first place I worked as a full time employee. Basically, HealthSouth Arlington Hospital is almost limited capacity below 80 patient beds."
good,If the working hours were better or if prns got pto or at least raises they would be okay. Prns start out at 10.25 and never get a raise. They never have full time positions open so the prns never get a raise
good,"HealthSouth is a good place to work. The atmosphere was professional and serious. Time sensitive and accuracy is a must."
good,"A typical work day includes marketing to the case managers, Np, physicians of PCP offices, Home health agency as well as skilled nursing facilities. With the goal of admitting the patient."
good,"Lots of Director of Marketing, high pressure, very micromanged.  Fast work environment.  Corporate people have high expectations. Too many reports, less time out in the field."
good,I was able to work primarily on ortho cases. I was the preceptor so if we had a new tech they would have to train on most all of the cases. I enjoyed helping the young techs get started on the right foot.
good,Fair scheduling. Friendly staff. Poor patinet to nurse ratio. Room for improvement of patient services. Room for improvement in administrative support .
good,"Busy schedule, Staffing sometimes are concerning. Lack of resources. Could be better if processes are managed effectively and efficiently. I loved working with my CNO."
good,Productive work environment. At times the employees could be a little bit clicky. The management was excellent. Definitely room to grow with this rehab hospital
good,Decent place to work id you are looking to be a physical therapist. Fast paced environment with generally sufficient staffing. Lots of weekend commitments.
good,"Very hectic place to work. There are amazing doctors, and the rehabilitation program is great. Management, no so much. They only care about the money."
good,"I enjoyed seeing my patients improve in health."
good,"When I first started working here, it was ok. It basically were REHAB patients. However, they tend to admit anybody now and it's tough on the aides.👎🏽"
good,this is a hard job team work is key your days can and will be very stressful at times. you will have up to 18-20 patients at a time your always on your feet that's the part that sucks and most of the nurses di not help you they feel like the work that the cna's does not concern them.
good,I loved working with HealthSouth because of their ability to train and their compassionate attitude toward their employees.  It has the ability for anyone to grow into another field.
good,"i was a student here, I haven't worked there in 8 years.  I don't know why indeed thinks my review would be useful at all to include in a description of the clinic"
good,"I was a student physical therapist here for a short period of time.  Welcoming group of PTs, OTs, SLPs.  VERY busy schedules. The documentation system is terrible."
good,"Worked more than 10 years there, in various capacities in the therapy gym as well as the nursing unit as a non-clinician. Increasingly, the case mix index has been skewed regarding staffing. It seems we are staffed only by the number of beds filled with little regard to acuity level of the patient. Each of us has seen a 50-75% increase in workload over the past 5 years, and with yearly raises only being 2-3% it has been harder for the managers to retain staff members."
good,The most enjoyable aspect of the job was planning the annual golf outing.  The position provided the foundation need to become a successful pharmaceutical agent.
good,"Good benefits. very rewarding work. working on the nursing floor was demanding physically and mentally."
good,"Learned to transcribe doctors orders wa sthe hardest part of my job, understanding the doctors hand writing. I enjoyed helping my patients on a daily."
good,"I worked in the kitchen, meal perp, cooking, cleaning. Make customers are happy. Food is cooked right. area is clean, order product, receive products."
good,Poorly managed and under staffed. Out patient is behind due to prior employees and no one has been able to get everything up to date. Needs better management.
good,"I worked for Encompass Home Health back when I was an LVN.  Since that time I have continued my education and am now an RN.  While I worked there I felt that I wasn't treated very well.  I drove about 500+ miles per week and saw about 14+ patients every day.  These patients were all over the place.  The scheduling was very bad.  By the time Friday came around, I was terribly exhausted.  This was a rough company to work for.  I earned every penny I made."
good,I was a student during my time here. The facility was very clean and it had everything that you needed to complete a therapy session. the staff was knowledgeable.
good,"Encompass in Bastrop has a very good reputation. Excellent, well trained nurses. Excellent training for employees. The hardest part of the job is being exposed to bad weather conditions and the conditions of some of the homes that you are required to go to."
good,Learned alot because if you dont the workload is so intense you will sink. Showed me that I can do something bigger than myself which I will always be thankful for!
good,not enough work - great boss until she left about a month ago - great coworkers - home care home base documentation is great
good,"There are some locations that are running absolutely fantastic and smoothly, and others that are falling apart and failing. I would advise candidates to ask about the current fiscal health of a given location before hopping onboard."
good,I liked working at HealthSouth because most of my co-workers were kind & worked as a team to get the job done. Whenever someone needed help the others did not hesitate to give a helping hand.
good,Few Patients and slow growing.  Training is on the job.  Communication is OK.  Ft worth office shares many of the back room needs of the Dallas office and sometimes communication errors happen.
good,"Loved the people I worked with, but the work itself became too stressful. A couple of folks on support staff would not show up and wouldn't call out but there was no discipline for them doing this. Not enough nurses scheduled at night for the number of patients so the floor nurses would have to take 8 patients on nights. "
good,"They do not care about their employees . People that have been there for 20yrs. Or more if they aren't of use to them anymore they will think of a reason for them to go!, or make things so difficult they are forced to quit!!"
good,"I have recently left. I worked full time nights. I worked with great Techs. Some of the nurses not so much. But most are wonderful. One of the night surpervisors was incredible. This one supervisor went above and beyond to help us tech and nurses. Pay was decent but not after benefits, of course that's optional. What little I was around the CNO she was good. The work load is a lot. At times 6 or more hard Max2 transfers that are incontinent all night long with only 2 techs. Some nurses tend to place blame. Blame is usually put on tech. If I had a major complaint it's that some employees aren't given the benefit of the doubt. If a patient complains, depending on management for the night, it's automatically the techs fault regardless of the situation or circumstances. But all in all, it's a decent place with mostly great people."
good,"making sure all supplies are inventory"
good,"During my employment with Healthsouth I was receptionist, I enjoyed meeting and interacting with the patients and families. I also gained office skills that I will be able to use for other employers."
good,I enjoyed my early morning work shift. A typical day at HealthSouth was pleasant. The time went by fast because I was always busy taking care of a patient.
good,"Post-acute care physical rehab facility, caring for 7-10 patients per shift depending on staffing. Co-workers are wonderful with those few exceptions that are found in any work environment. Management has areas that need improvement. There are disconnects in the interdisciplinary communications. Doctor in the facility during majority of day shift only, making night shift admissions entertaining."
good,Very good job in order to be able to see many different kinds of injuries/illness and was perfect job to allow me to go into Home Health due to being able to work with various people at one time.
good,"I was very impressed when I first started as the DOP for this company.  They were not paying me for being on call, which was promised to me, If you work here ensure everything is in writing."
good,Pleasant workplace with team members who worked hard to take care of the patients effectively and compassionately. A very rewarding  experience with this workplace.
good,I learned a lot at Braintree Rehab. I loved going to work every day and getting to see the nurses as well as seeing my patients progress and get better. The hardest part of the job was when the a new company took over in 2014 and no longer accepted the student position I was originally hired under and I would have to work four shifts a month to stay on payroll or be laid off. Unfortunately I was living in college and could not make the four shift quota therefore I was laid off. The most enjoyable part of my job was watching patients come in and not be able to walk and then watch them walk out the door on the day of their discharge.
good,"Stressful, bring patient charting home with me to work on. Its nice to see smiles on patients faces when you walk into their home."
good,"Working for this company allowed me to obtain very important medical-surgical skills that are needed in nursing. The Director of Nursing was one who was very hands on with the nursing staff, something you don't find often."
good,"I obtained medical records, prepared files to be sent to the doctors, did the bookkeeping for the office, ordered supplies."
good,I'd rather not say a whole lot.  I'll just say there are positive aspects and negative aspects to every job.  There are some very nice nurses that work in the facility.  I must say that.  They are some of the best team players I've ever seen.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phones, preparing orders for transit, filing progress notes and test results, and communicating with nursing staff and physicians as well as therapists and case workers."
good,Meeting with patients and physicians.  Being able to meet my goals in recruiting patients for our services.  Everyone helped each others.  Management would lend a helping hand in anything that was asked.
good,"First patient care position.  Learned a lot about physical therapy.  Enjoyed helping patients with mobility and reaching their goals."
good,"started to learn computer system,management need to consider nurse/pt ratio,love working with my co workers,taking care of 10:1 ratio."
good,Assist Patient with their everyday needs. Take vital sign and record intake and outtake. I have learn the proper way to address patients that may need a little more assist with than others. I have always work with management and co-workers. I truly believe that everyone should be their for the patient and only the patient. The hardest part of the job is not have the right equipment that we need to work with. The most enjoyable part of this job is know that I am helping to one to get back to where they can care for their self.
good,"I enjoyed my time at HealthSouth as a student, but I would not want to take a permanent position.  Many employees quit while I worked there because of issues with the CEO."
good,Pay is good and above average but you definitely earn it.  See a lot of patients and is stressful
good,good learning environment with plenty opportunities for advancment
good,The company seemed overall to be a good company. I wasn't there very long
good,I worked for this company a short period of time prior to it closing the facility.  It was a great learning experience.  Although I didn't have experience in PACU they were willing to train.
good,Great job stayed there for awhile  but budget cuts lead to a lot of people loosing there jobs.
good,It's not a bad place to work at honestly. I just always seemed belittled by other people in different departments. Made me feel like I didn't matter to anyone. You deal with a lot of sick and dying people and I just don't want to surround myself with that and have to heard sad stories about people getting old and how a lot of those sweet people can barely move or talk. It's depressing and I just don't want to be around it 20 years of my life.
good,"Reconcile daily inpatient census, verify benefits on patients coming in that day, enter all information in the mainframe, answer and direct calls to the appropriate person.  Schedule and room asignment on new admissions.  Upon arrival go over all inpatient paperwork.  Handle all aspect of the Admissions office."
good,I was proud of the accomplishment made by the nursing/rehab team but I did not like being responsible for 12-15  patients and constantly having to apologize to patients for a delay in not being able to assist them when they call because you have so many patients and you cant attend to them all at once
good,"Awesome people to work with. It is like a family. Unfortunately, management has changed and everything is strict now."
good,Great exposure to rehabilitation patients and experiences.
good,I love working with people and HealthSouth was an almost perfect environment for this.
good,A day at healthsouth is that your typically doing things your self. the Nurses don't help even if we're short and that's most of the time on weekends.
good,"A typical day involved a lot of physical activity. I learned a lot about the rehab process. I was able to get involved with all departments of the hospital. My communication skills improved significantly over the years in my leadership role. (with patients, family and co workers.) The hospital is rather small so myself and the co workers were able to develop strong working relationships. The hardest part of my job was when a patient was not successful in rehab and unable to go home. On a positive note, a patient coming to the hospital in terrible condition and walking out the door to go home, brought me great joy."
good,"Being a Clinical Liaison with this company, I had exactly the same responsibilities as with Cornerstone LTAC hospital."
good,I have lost my faith in our healthcare system and no longer feel comfortable marketing for and industry i no longer believe in.
good,"I like the type of work I am able to do through Encompass.  I enjoy the staff, they  are friendly.  I don't care for the hours that I work."
good,My typical day at work was meeting the needs of the doctors and the nurses. My co-workers were very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,"Extensive nursing duties, experience received with more labs and wound care."
good,"The atmosphere was therapeutic with patients engaged in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.  Expected length of stay was around 14 days.  Nursing was kept very busy making sure the patients were documented on accurately and assessing progress made from admission through to discharge."
good,"everyday unique in itself you have to be prepared to handle challenges worked as a staff nurse was able to develop and strenghten nursing skills.had the honor and privelege of working with the best doctors,and therapist.the work can be physcially and emotionally challenging,but you get to see the progress of your efforts."
good,Arrive at work and complete all the reschedules that field staff needed to have done. as well as restaff any that the field staff decline and can't see. Then work on staffing orders and visits as they come through during the day. During this also staff the start of care / admissions with the correct staff and communicate to the staff any information needed to make the admission easier on staff. Also make sure to watch the quota for the week and ensure that each staff member meets.
good,"They had a job fair on night shift an it was really fun , being that we sleep during the day they made sure we had the same opportunity the other shifts had an thats what great about Healthsouth the make it fun for us ."
good,Pleasant work environment and constant changes to adjust to.
good,setting appoints for patients
good,"Good crew at Valley View, very happy place to work. Everyone treated with respect and happy patients. Unfortunately Jeffreys Street is not the same. Micro management, high staff turnover and many unhappy people. Hard to believe both facilities are run by the same company."
good,This was a growing company that had difficulties with identity within the Massachusetts healthcare arena
good,"Same as Carestone, but did not pay well. Lot of Drama which I do not participate in."
good,The company offers flexible scheduling it is competitive in their pay and benefits. Advancement is not always available but management does try and help you learn and grow within the position you are in. The location is easy to navigate and the building is new and offers amenities to the employees such as the gym and the cafeteria.
good,"Great working experience ."
good,Short staffed in nursing department.No breaks on nights. UNDER STAFFED!!!! Too many patients per nurse. Unable to spend time with each patient and family because of nurse to patient ratio.
good,"One nurse: 9-12 patients! I was constantly afraid for the patients and my license. Great staff (overall), but the work load was heavy! You do have the opportunity to sharpen your skills, though!"
good,"Registered Nurse who was covering Montgomery County /Rockville,Maryland Office resigned so I was forced to travel from Owings Mills Maryland Office to  Rockville,Maryland Office  4-5 days per week to perform SNVs & Admissions on the weekend also , inclusive of On Call assignment every other weekend.Manager was discovered as guilty for Medicate Fraud ,then was terminated but prior to that she made it very difficult to work with her on a daily basis."
good,When I work here it was called Health South. Now its called Encompass. So not sure on the details of the new place or the employees. Great location though.
good,"I give it 3.5 to 4 stars.  As a liaison, there's plenty of enjoyable person to person interaction, whether patients, families, case managers, MDs, referral sources.  But there's constant tension between building the relationships and beating the clock.  Get it done  (faster!) and move on. You're graded on numbers and times, which leaves little time to take an actual lunch without having work back up.  Expectations of how much will be done and when, as well as regularly working late/over if referrals come in last minute.  I enjoy and appreciate my direct report and our CEO, but constant scrutiny of them leads to constant scrutiny of you."
good,very strenuous work. I really believe they should hire a lifting team that way they can lesson chances of people getting hurt. Patients here arrive at the facility because they just came from surgery and most can not walk so its your job to toilet lift and transfer all weight bearing patient the amount of lifting here is awful and not worth hurting yourself over .. well then again nothing really is..
good,"Encompass is a good place to start if you are just starting in healthcare. After you come accustomed to the job, it come become too much and overwhelming. Patients are demanding, some coworkers are not helpful. Supervisors can even give you 14 patients to take care of. Coworkers are always calling out, making the day's work harder for everyone else. Just too much work, for too little pay as a tech. Management not helpful at all. Some supervisors and nurses will help out with patients. Good place to start off, but I would not stay more than a year. But to each is own."
good,Hired with 3 days orientation and total of 12hrs floor nurse orientation. Always short staffed so ratio would change daily. Management not supported of nursing staff. Pay average for area and lots of OT if wanted.
good,I enjoy working here. However I would love to see more support and chances for advancement! Some days are hard others are a breeze. Teamwork is a must!
good,"This job was challenging and very rewarding. Corporate was fixed on numbers Vs patient care, and left us understaffed most days. I have no problem helping other departments, but there was always something lacking in one area or another. Developed life long relationships with coworkers, and bonded over stressful times."
good,"It was a great work culture all departments worked as a team!! I worked at the Montgomery , Alabama. Once I had my second child I wanted to increase my hours from part time to full time 32hr/week. Human Resources was not willing to do that change after I had great performance reviews. It was personal as she said to another person that I had too much autonomy ; to my knowledge that comes along with being a professional."
good,"Very busy. Not only did I manage the department I was also a working manager. Cleaning patient rooms, stripping and waxing floors, buffing and cleaning carpet. Making work schedules and documentation."
good,"More than likely you will work overtime, because the other shift had a call out.  Very fast pace must have good shoes and use to being on your feet. You maybe called off if there isn't enough patients in the building."
good,Learned CRP. Didn't work there long. worked with one client. I enjoyed her presence and having conversations with her and doing things for her. didn't have a vehicle at the time so I couldn't give her rides to places as she needed.
good,"Mixed reviews on the staff, but I liked the variety of areas to rotate through - outpatient, Neuro, aquatic therapy.  I enjoyed the location in Austin as well."
good,"Encompass Home Health and Hospice:"
good,Training was always up to date and provided by HealthSouth staff on a regular basis. There were also opportunities of advancement depending on one's interest in certain areas of the company.
good,"The facility is nice and small, but there are not enough hoyer lifts, mats, or tables for all patients and therapists. Some coworkers lack any detail in documentation, but the general culture is comfortable. Therapists are mostly friendly, but can be cliquey sometimes. However collaboration is good and patients are well treated!"
good,Overall good however itis a larger corporation and the reason we were laid off was financial business. The best outpatient rehab team was eliminated and it will ultimately be the companies loss for losing each of the therapy staff. I understabd corporate healthcare and accept it.
good,"Everything is constantly changing, good practice on obtaining diverse skills. Some managers are knowledgeable and give empowerment while others will act like employees are children. A good number of employee activities and quarterly bonuses."
good,"I was a rehab Nurse Tech, and the work load was extremely stressful and hard. I was extremely under paid and over worked. I was completely burnt out on the job because I only received one off day a week and every other weekend off, but they were always trying to call you in to work. It was very demanding, and tiring. I loved the type of work, and the people I worked with. My immediate supervisor was fantastic but Human Resources lacked in knowledge of what really goes on working the hospital floor, therefor they weren't hiring the right candidates for the position, making the job a lot more difficult."
good,"It has been several years since I worked at Health South. At the time, there were serious issues with infection control and patient safety, which contributed in part to my leaving"
good,The Hospital does amazing work with rehabilitating their patients to help them get back to living a normal life after their issue. I found the office politics to be abusive.
good,"Hospital culture is not good, low moral, not enough staff, to me it appears that persons had positions they were not trained to handle based on tenure not experience."
good,"Pretty consistent daily routine. Make sure patients come down for therapy, assist the therapists with treatments, and complete necessary paperwork. Hardest part is convincing patients to participate that have no desire. Most enjoyable part is seeing the patients get better."
good,"Busy day, but meeting with the patients is wonderful.  Co-workers are great.  I have learned so much since I have been here."
good,Overall this place will give you a med/surge type working experience. Typical 12 hour shifts. Seeing results from patients going through therapy and their progress was the most rewarding element of this job and the experience I obtained was priceless. Only negative thing about this place was the fact that it ran in primary care style with one rn and one nurse aid working together. The RN is essentially responsible for all meds/ assessments/ treatsments etc on a client. Typical nurse to patient ratio was 1:8.
good,Good place to work for as a beginner but definitely not as a career. Allot of things to do and keep yourself busy throughout the day.
good,Great place to work if you like 12 hour shifts mostly 4 days a week. I like the work available however the pay and time off can be even better.
good,"I enjoyed working at HealthSouth, we stayed busy but that didn't bother me at all because there were so many different learning experiences. When the work load would become overwhelming,  the nurses worked side by side with the rehab techs and it really made all the difference. The hardest part of the job was having patients that were use to doing things on there own who  now had to depend on others, trying to help them break out of that depression proved to be difficult at times, other times they just needed someone to listen and I was always all ears. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing patients get better and go home to there families knowing that I had something to do  with there rehabilitation, the thank you letters, the kind words mentioned to my boss, knowing you've touched the life of a complete stranger makes it all worth it."
good,"•A typical day at work was task oriented. The tasks would populate in the work queue according to your position."
good,I love the therapists I work with.  Job is based on number of patients so I may be called off for weeks at a time.  No room for advancement but a good opportunity to earn clinical experience.
good,"I worked in the cash processing center near the corporate office in Birmingham, AL (before/during the Scrushy incident).  We sat in cubicles and posted payments from EOBs to the diagnostic and outpatient systems.  After the training period, we were allowed to wear headphones.  Outpatient had a quota (which wasn't that difficult to hit), diagnostic did not.  I enjoyed most of my coworkers and we had freedom to get up and use the bathroom or get a drink (you could drink and snack at your desk).  We got our breaks and lunches and could take them whenever we wanted as long as they weren't too close to the beginning or end of our shift.  The pay and benefits were quite good, especially if you worked nights/evenings.  The biggest issue was the life/work balance.  Overtime was mandatory and was most of the time.  I worked 10 hour shifts five days a week for six months straight.  A lot of the time a 10 hour Saturday shift would be thrown in there as well.  I heard two of the managers talking to each other once - one wanted to let us leave, the other said ""make them stay another couple of hours until it's done.""  But of course she got to leave when she wanted.  I don't know if it's changed at all since my time there.  It wasn't an awful place to work, but I wouldn't want to do it again."
good,"Working as a Occupational Therapist specialist with patient in a Rehabilitation setting ( In patient and out patient). Working in interdisciplinary team  with nurses, doctors, physical ,therapist, speech pathologist, Psychologist, case management staff, administrative staff.  The hardest part of the job working with different medical conditions that change the  type of life style of different family and try that the different patient situations would not affect emotionally. "
good,presently hired new leaders and I think once again this will become a great place to work and grow at a professional.
good,"Came in and got report for patients I would be taking care of, and did round of blood pressures on 16 patients, Blood glucose. then pass out meals to patients, collect trays, showered patients. Documentation on patients. Enjoyable part of my job was taking care of and talking to patients everything about patient care."
good,"Although I was employed here for a very short time,  I was able to reapply and sharpen my clerical skills. Identify what skills were needed to excel in the Administrative sector of the Health Field. Working in this enviornment was so exciting it motivated me to enroll in school to pursue a BA in Health Administration with a concentration in Health Management."
good,"Start of shift is typically busy, as usual hospital setting would, the work itself is fulfilling yet demanding. Entails a lot of hard work, we provide direct patient, total care, pt range from being modified independent to totally dependent with various medical condition, We train and educate patient to regain independence to their fullest capacity if not total. Basically it is ""rehabilitation"" in its sense."
good,Minimal work-life balance. Stressful environment. Lack of management and promotion for deserving staff members. Competitive benefits package. More than a full-time job.
good,This environment is very high stress. Patient ratios are not optimal. It is very difficult to care for the patients in the manor I would have liked to. The staff is very friendly and for the most part work together well as a team. Some of the management team can be difficult to work with while others are stellar. They do provide and encourage many different educational opportunities. Pay is appropriate. I loved the patients. I think the place has great potential if they could just tap into better staffing ratios considering the types of patients that are there and their unique needs.
good,I could say it's the employees that make this company great. Great teamwork! Management wise needs some work. Schedule needs to be work on and be more flexible with school.
good,"It is a great career for anyone who doesn't want to advance. They will work you like a dog with no recognition or basic thank you. You can ask for ways to advance and your voice with get lost in the crowd. The patients and the care will be the reason to stay, but the lack of recognition and leadership will make you leave. This is not only on a branch level, but a company level."
good,Do not require techs to have CNA and do not thoroughly drug test. Many chances for dangerous behavior. I do love a lot of the people that work there.  Hardest part are seeing patient come in that are not appropriate and only there to fill a bed.
good,I enjoyed being able to help patients and staff alike.  I enjoyed being able to help figure out what was wrong with patients through drawing labs or collecting samples.  Then seeing them after they received the correct treatment and were feeling better.  My fellow back office coworkers would always feel comfortable coming to me to ask for help with anything and in exchange I felt like I could ask them questions.
good,"Not bad place to work enjoyed the work "
good,"Management was focused on profit margins more than anything else, & encouraged competition between workers to strive for the best financial outcomes. This bothered me working in the healthcare system, I thought the patient should have been the focus. I still enjoyed the gains my patients made, big or small, & always had good patient satisfaction. Management also had certain favorite employees that were rewarded financially on a consistant basis. Despite all this, I was always able to exceed managements expectations for the year. Over all, I really enjoyed the setting, & loved working with the patients."
good,"Not having enough staff, when needed. A heavy work load on the pt care tech, which can be over whelming when there are a lot of total pt. As a prn employee  was not given the opportunity to be a full time when needed. They-continue  my position as a prn staff without any medical benefit."
good,Terre Haute Healthsouth has closed their doors.   That hospital struggled to keep quality staff nurses and aides to provide quality care for their patients.  Healthsouth of Terre Haute had wonderful therapist and ancillary staff.
good,I have learned a variety of skills at Encompass Health. There are many opportunities of advancement and growth at Encompass. The salary is competitive.
good,Time management is considered a priority!  You learn how to follow written and verbal orders given by physicians. Hardest part is getting through twelve hour work days.
good,"HArd hard hard work.  Hard on your body. Pay was no where near enough for the hard work and the destroying of your body it causes. This is a rehabilitation hospital, I didn't understand how someone paralyzed was able for rehab."
good,"Great teamwork, great location, good paid time off. Pay is good. Overworked at times. Flexible schedule. Place keeps you mostly busy. Night shift drew most of the blood work, did wound care"
good,I believe the company's mission and approach are the best in the industry.  My personal experience in the Revenue Cycle group was unusual.  Communication and feedback were non-existant.  Doors were always closed and rather than open communication to solve a problem or concern the culture is to be talked about rather than talked with to collectively solve a problem.
good,It is a very flexible place to work. You get to make your own schedule but that is if you get enough patients. You get good benefits and PDO. There needs to be better communication between staff memebers.
good,There are people that do not care for one another in daily life and talk down to their team. Two faced supervisors and unprofessional work ethics until it comes to other employees and not the work friends.
good,"Great place to start working  as a new graduate nurse. Learn a lot of skills and taking different role responsibilities. "
good,"Very interesting position. I learned so much about working with patients with neurological deficits and traumatic injuries. Seeing how strong some patients were to accept their new limitations. I liked meeting new patients and helping them achieve the most they can. Management was ok. The co-workers would ignore you many times. There were clicks within the staff. That was the toughest part, working with people like that. Pay was comparable with decent benefits."
good,Poor supervision of the OT students. Left on own a lot of the time. Unapproachable to ask questions to. Felt very unappreciated as a student. I did not enjoy my time here.
good,"Management was wonderful, great benefits and incentives, team atmosphere dependent on team, nurse to patient ratio was insane and unsafe for the high acuity of the patients."
good,"My typical day was to round 6-8 accounts ( my territory was all of Broward-  IL/ALF ,Doctors offices and SNF.) I maintained the relationships,brought in referrals,and admitted my referrals I received.As well attended marketing events,ran health fair tables, educating senior centers,doctors,EMS and fire department education on home referral direct admission process/ Healthsouth what we do for the community and what products we have available."
good,"Strong financially nationwide home care and hospice. Very poor orientation process, limited precepting, imbalance with management at local level with poor communication or support/ Field Clinicians provided limited support with high level of expectation and productivity"
good,"·	Worked daily with patients and assisted in running/controlling rehabilitation groups"
good,"A typical day at the job is working in the cafeteria. Setting up trays and taking them to the patient rooms was my responsibility. I learned to greet people with a smile and attend to them with good care. Management was good and their pays was fair. The employees were cooperative, and they were also hard workers. The most difficult part of the job was walking. The reason is because of the excessive walking due to the room to room services."
good,"Everyday is a learning experience. combined acute and community health nursing encloses this homehealth experience. Co-workers are indeed helpful in different ways but the hardest part of this job is you have to flexible as much as you can in different aspect such as time, and patience. THe most enjoyable part of this job is you have the autonomy."
good,"Co workers are NOT team players when it comes to assiting me, but are quick to ask me to help them when they're short staffed"
good,"Good job security, great people to work with, willing to help new nurses learn"
good,"Though the pay could have been better, I could not have met better people to work with."
good,"From a nursing perspective, a typical day includes care for approximately 9-11 physical rehab patients with chronic and acute illnesses. Staff teamwork is a must for the quality care provided. When necessary, management is closely involved with patient care. The most difficult part of the job is the inability to give one-on-one attention often needed by some patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is patient progress and the ability to achieve individual goals to perform the activities of daily living."
good,Asked to do many things besides patient care. Unable to complete all work before needing to punch out. Not as much about patient but bottom line.
good,"Very fast paced, stressful, enjoy meeting people, believe in excellent customer service for success"
good,"I only worked at Healthsouth for 10 months while we lived in Texas.  It was doing very well and was continuing to grow while I was employed there.  We moved back to Chicago a year after we relocated to Texas, because I was lucky to have my previous employer (IPG) offer my job back to me."
good,"Make any changes to employee's time card, check for missed punches, post info to excel spreadsheet, enter payables, scan invoices into system, approve expense reports as they come across my computer. "
good,I really loved my position here. Working with the elderly was a fantastic experience for me. I was wound care certified at this time. And assisted the wound care Dr. I was Nurse Manager from time to time. Please refer to my resume.
good,"The start of a typical day for me was to first check my phone messages, check my email, pick up my mail from the mail room.  I also repaired my patient charts that were scheduled to check in for the day.  It consist of visiting the patient's room, verifying accurate information, collecting insurance cards etc. "
good,Leaving others out not fun too be there knitt picking on people all the time ma’s Acting like rns too many chiefs and poor managers .!!! Nurse practitioners are nice
good,I would come to work dressed and ready to be enjoy my day. The woman I was in charge of we plan the day and then started the maintenance jobs that were to be completed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with 6 different personalities. The most enjoyable were the completion of a task. I learned that you need to keep the Supervisors above you happiest of all.
good,Working with my patients in an Assisted Living Facility was a great experience. I provided all Home Health services to patients in the community at Assisted Living Facilities.
good,It was a good place to start my career. I learned alot and used it to move on to a bigger hospital setting.  I loved the neuro-trauma unit and when they removed the ventilators from the picture the job was no longer challenging.
good,"HealthSouth is a great place to work at for newer nurses! HealthSouth gives the nurse the opportunity to orient at their own pace! The management is understanding of the need to learn, and helps staff whenever needed. A typical day is busy, however, management is there for the staff. I learned a lot in my career at HealthSouth."
good,"The nurses and other staff were great to work with and supported each other when needed.  I came from an emergency department to work in an outpatient recovery room.  The job was not a match for me although it is a great place to work if you enjoy surgery, recovery, or OR."
good,"I liked having the freedom to plan my own day. I enjoyed my residents and being out in the community, not confined indoors all day. The hourly pay for LPN's is average and the vacation time was excellent."
good,"Daily home visits with start of cares, and rountine health care. Phone calls to physcians offices, and family to ensure proper care of patients."
good,I enjoy working here.  I work 12 hour shifts in the evening. have max of 7-8 pts per shift.  Very strenuous work and some heavy lifting involved. self scheduling
good,"I worked here for almost 15 years, and was pretty happy.  Good environment, management was generally speaking pretty good.  I really enjoyed working there."
good,"great staff, newer facility. Everyone greets you.  You feel like a close family.  Located off of the 215. Very compliant. Great company to work for"
good,Good experience. Learned alot about a company going public. 
good,"Very busy. Learned a lot about wounds, lab  values and rehab process."
good,"First hospital that I have worked at where you don't have the confidence that someone has your back. The people you work with are good, patient care is good, you just can't trust direct to upper management. You have to scrounge around for office supplies. The work is not the problem, the stress that supervisors bring, the constant nagging. I have never worked somewhere that is so confining."
good,I love the people I work with but this position doesn't work and play well with school or family.
good,Chart review
good,"I didnt work for Encompass, I worked for Healthsouth. Healthsouth was an okay company to work for. I really enjoyed the work environment, my coworkers before the merge. When we were known as a small rehabilitation called Reliant Rehab. That was a great environment. Filled with leaders and goal driven individuals."
good,"Encompass Health is a great company to work for.  Flex schedules, engaged workers, friendly and caring staff members.  Caring and kind to the patients, the entire staff work together as a team."
good,"I really enjoyed the associate personnel and the other directors, I worked with."
good,"I started out as a nursing tech and worked my way through LPN and RN school. I worked here for a few years and the place was very rarely adequately staffed. When it is staffed it's wonderful. I love pretty much all of my coworkers and managers. Their pay rate is competitive and they offer large bonuses when short staffed. The nurse to patient ratio during night shift is usually too large which can be stressful and the patient acuity has increased within the past couple years. The staff members work together well and help things get done, especially in emergency situations. All together it is a great place to work. It takes a long time to get hired here but it's worth the wait."
good,They we're a good company to work for. I had many opportunities with them was promoted 3 times. I learned almost every department whil working there. Which set me up for good advancement in my career. They had a lot of extra things for the employees.
good,Busy short term rehab specializing in orthopedic and spinal injuries.  Also specialized with stroke and neurological injuries.  Worked on one unit to consistently see and treat same patients.  Continuity promotes wellness for patients.
good,HealthSouth Hospital is highly competitive. They are always focused on attracting as many patients to their hospital as possible.. The patients are top priority.
good,"I normally would come in put up schedules for the day and help with the transfer, therapy, care of patients.  also help out in case management, PBX, and central supply"
good,Huddle that was nice talking about what happended shift to shift.... Your manager was always on had ppl are caring an listen.the hardest part was getting attached to residents an they leave but proud cause you helped them accomplish that
good,"Nice facility, good location, convenient to bus lines and shopping , food was pretty good, a few great coworkers, good health,vision and dental benefits"
good,"greet therapy team, cant say the same for nursing or people above worried more about meeting quota than the patients.pay is fair. they accept patients they know therapy will not help."
good,"Great crew to work with. Everyone is very personable but the problem was always short staffed. "
good,It's a slower pace than acute care of course but it teaches you a lot of basic nursing care. You get to learn to work as a team and there is opportunity for moving up. Our HRD knows all of our names. It's a very friendly and accommodating facility to work at.
good,"Learned many things about health care, working with patients, and organizing treatment areas.it was fun and enjoyable being exposed to many different physical and occupational therapists."
good,Large company. working home health. Far to travel. Pay is average. Hand wrote paperwork. Had interview for manager position and that was joke. Interview was 5 minutes as director yawned through it.
good,"i enjoy working there with the patients and my co-workers, i just which we had better breaks and had more input to help with the patients since we are so personal with them"
good,Fair place to work and gain nursing experience for a new grad. Offer competitive benefits with great pay. Great place to work for new RN. I would recommend it for a starting point.
good,Review is based on past management before selling off outpatient facility. CEO went to prison....'nuff said. Co-workers were enjoyable.
good,Busy days with phones ringing asking for further info about our facility. Mastered ins verifications and submitting prior auths. Loved visiting patients.
good,"5am to 5:30pm 3 days a week"
good,Its enjoyable. The people here are awesome! Everyone here knows each other so it's like working with your family.
good,"You are told when interviewed that the nurse to patient ratio is 6-8 and you are paired up with a LPN. When the reality of it is 10 patients if you work alone and 12-18 if RN/LPN paired. There may be 1-2 techs for the entire building of 56 patients. The techs may or may not answer call bells, check vital signs or BP's. Management does nothing about the few that come late and leave early.....if they don't call out!  The nurses are expected to chart every 2hrs, answer call bells (even if they are trying to get report from previous shift), toilet/perform personal care. The medications are scheduled every few hours, everybody has daily wound care (despite using products that are designed to stay in place 5-7 days. It's a HUGE waste of money and time). They have a ""wound care nurse"" who does not perform any wound care and emails the supervisor and CC's the both the CNO and CEO all the names of nurses who didnt do the wound care on the day shift. Day shift RNs are expected to do all assessments (they decided that LPN's aren't educated enough to assess. Did I mention that the  wound care nurse is a LPN, who doesn't seem to even know about how the wound care products are designed to work?)"
good,Great place to work with hard working people who are willing to go the distance for patients.
good,flexible team oriented atmosphere. Good therapist and DTO
good,Nice facility. Staffing was short. Management wasn't professional.
good,"Ive worked at Walton rehab for ten years of my  nursing career.  I have been taught and grown throughtout the time I spent at Walton. For me, Walton wasn't a workplace. Walton ""  Rehabilitation"" was my Therapy, but at the same time i was able to help other in need. The years I spent at  Walton Rehabilitation Hospital/ Healthsouth Walton Rehab was one of my missions here on earth that, I was chosen to do. Which I enjoyed every moment of  working short staff, working double shift so that the patient would have proper staffing, all the tears I have shed where happy tears, because at the end of each day; I made a difference in someone life."
good,in a salary position it is very hard to balance work life and home life. The pay start pay is great but getting a raise is nothing short of impossible
good,I recommend this job. They keep employees involved and up to date with new changes. they make it easy to advance and staff works together to ensure proper patient safety.
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  I wanted to advance my career, so I left.  I was sorry that I left.  They took care of you there and all employees seemed happy"
good,This is a great company with great benefits. The management is well in tune with the staff. The administration takes care of the staff needs. The patients receive great care.
good,would bath the patients and help them get dressed clean their rooms along with charting the inputs and outputs. transferring from  bed to wheelchairs and taking them to therapy as well.
good,"Great Job Culture, the staff there makes it a fun place to work. Disappointed with Upper Management and non-existent training program."
good,Very well place to work management was good most times everybody work together very good u go n to work ready to work
good,"Combined 3 jobs: infection control nurse, employee health nurse and worker's compensation nurse. Able to manipulate time frame required for each one. Was able to meet and assist every emplyee at the hospital from time of their employment to yearly health follow-ups"
good,"Flexible schedule"
good,"I worked with a variety of patients and put my degree to the test with the severity levels of the various patients and needs for therapy. I loved the flexibility of the schedule, management, and trainings I received. This job was invigorating and gave me as an SLP an overall sense of satisfaction after my day full of sessions was finished. Some of the therapy staff that I worked with were poor team players and overall poor therapists."
good,"As an aide, you are on your feet for 12 hrs most of time. There is also a great nurse manager over the nursing staff that is great."
good,"Worked as a Charge Nurse and staff Nurse. Worked both day and night shifts as needed"
good,Flexible schedule to work around my school hours. Position was held while I was called on active duty orders.
good,"I really enjoy working for Healthsouth the time I was employed there I really enjoyed the different benefits like purchasing power and the life ,dental,and medical and don't let me forget the 401k. very good benefits."
good,"The hardest part of the job was lifting and transferring patients."
good,"* busy most days"
good,it a very good place to work they work together as a team the environment clean and able to use all health care skill giving you chance to grow as a nursing assistant.
good,Was bought out by Encompass.  Understandable that positions were crossed trained but was basically let go due to restructuring. High turn over rate. misleading management.
good,"Its ok place to work but staffing is not enough, and very hard to maintain equipment and infrastructure. Very hard to retain employees with low pay and constant flexing."
good,Overall good working culture. Work life to home life challenges. Heavy work load and home care home based charting. Long days and long nights charting.
good,Learned very much and all co workers become like family. Enjoy coming to work. Over time is always available. Communication is great at times. Meet tons of patients that become family. Seeimg patients rehabilitating in the most hardest times and seeing them accomplish
good,Fun working in 2 south with the staffs.even the staffing is stressful sometimes but we manage with patience and love compassion to make the best of it.
good,"Well paid."
good,"I wouldn't recommend working at this particular facility."
good,The place would be great for a teenager or someone who just graduated who needs a quick/easy job. The pay isn’t the best but you do get 40 hrs a week.
good,do not apply....stressful and uneducated . they do not promote anyone over 40..I was there almost 10 years and no one left for retirement...they were fired or left due to stress
good,Local Management does not promote Encompass corporate ways. Lots of turnover in local and regional management. Leadership works less than they ask their employees too.
good,"Great facility to learn, fast paced, always work to be done, new patient caseload every 2-3 weeks. Awesome therapy team and we work together. Fair benefits. Low pay for the work load and expectations. Therapy department not given enough praise for the work well done from upper management. No chance to advance in management for most. TOO much documentation barely time to get lunch breaks lately."
good,"People were nice teamwork and friendly."
good,"Love my co-workers. I hate that I have to find another job. I need Full-Time work (Nights) and I am only per diem, and I attend school in the daytime."
good,Work was demanding but worth it. I enjoyed working here. The management was poor in most departments. I continuously looked at my managers knowing fully that I could do a better job and produce a  more effective result.
good,I absolutely loved my job and the people I worked with in my department. The hospital was small enough that we all got to know each other. There was no room for advancement anywhere.
good,Very hard but meaningful work. Enjoyed group of co-workers employed at the time. Management concerned for workers. Most diagnosis were trauma and longterm.
good,"office work, billing, scheduling, payroll, filing, phone, track orders and lab, build and tear down patient charts, order medical and office supplies. and everything else the RN/Branch manager wanted"
good,management is not great but overall its a good place to work.
good,The staff is great. Management kills the spunk of all the employees. They don't stand by their staff. Hopefully all this has changed since a new company has taken over.
good,Night shift staff all work well together.  We all pull together and help each other out when someone is in need of help on their assignment for the evening.  With that being said we often work short and nurses are required to have primary care for 5 to 6 patients.
good,"A thriving rehab hospital where you were able to follow the patient from start of rehab to discharge.  You have direct impact in pt. care and teaching, which can involve family, for best discharge to home.  "
good,"Patient care is the easiest part of the job, good job security. It is a good company all in all, but the culture and micromanagement of office staff is toxic."
good,the new CEO is not equiped for the job.the job itself is ok but management is not good.jhavdsjkhbckahjsbdcjksdbckasbcashjgcbaskhjdbakhsjdbcjhasbdcjhksdbcksjhbdvasdchgasdx
good,"Great autonomy, but the office was poorly run. The nurse scheduling was not done in a timely manner, therefore patient care could not be performed when needed. Very disorganized. Instead of increasing their client base, they would constantly suppress it due to staff turnover. Growth was limited due to division of clinical and sales."
good,"Work often took you past your time to get off in order to finish"
good,The starting Pay is good. There is Weekend pay. Everyone is friendly and easy to work with. No benifits until one year with company. There are a few perks for a job well done.
good,This is a good place to work and have good coworkers beside you to help you out. Although it does have some negative aspects such as the poor management. They will get employees in trouble over simple things.
good,Had an enjoyable time working with the company and the staff. however the hours were not working with my family. i was constantly sleeping due to overnight shift.
good,"As a nurse student, I like the HealthSouth Rehab location, the layout of the facility, the nurse staff and cafeteria. The day is a fast pace which make the day goes fast. Most of the patients are nice and willing to cooperate with their treatments."
good,"my typical day was submitting payroll, editing transcription, putting those on charts, key charges to patient accounts. Do medicare audits. Take charts to doctors for signature and dictation. Fax any documents to doctors office."
good,"Every morning techs get there patients therapy schedule for the day and helped them get prepared for therapy for that day. Assist patients to bathroom, bathing, eating, dressing etc. The work days stays very busy with the different times of therapy. At the end of 3 hours of therapy I obtain vitals. The hardest part of the day is the morning session getting the patients up for the day. the thing I enjoy the most is meeting the different people. Manage for the most part is pretty reliable."
good,Hours were ok needs more team work not fair when having to work overtime and not get paid for it.
good,This was a 60-bed facility that was rarely filled to capacity.  I was responsible for ordering everything but food for dietary and medication for pharmacy.  I was responsible for ensuring the units were staffed with whatever they might need to care for the patients.
good,7p-7a
good,"The field staff is over worked and we have nurses in the office who don't help out. Too much staff turn a round, no one wants to help train and if they do get trained, the new person is on their own within a week of shadowing. Some people like to push their authority around and make mean and hurtful comments."
good,Love the job. I’m thankful for the opportunity to work. There are some really supportive coworkers and physicians who are willing to help you succeed.
good,"The company as a whole is great.  However, they will retaliate if you speak up about behaviors by leadership.  So, my advice is to keep your mouth shut and do your job"
good,I like to work for what I want in life.. but with my years of being a CNA I fill that I deserve more pay for all the work they want me to do. This job was very stressful. Lots of responsibilities with low pay. if they paid me more for what all I do then it would have been worth it. Otherwise the staff was great to work with. This is back breaking work with low pay.
good,"The receptionist job can be slow with spurts of activity. Overall, I have been happy with the job and with Healthsouth itself. Early on, I was given the opportunity supplement my front desk hours with work for various departments. This has since been cut down drastically and I am currenty looking at a serious additional cut in hours which I cannot afford. I don't like the tremendous disappointment of working someplace for several years and taking such a turn backwards. But the people there are terrific and I am proud to work where the patient care is excellent."
good,"Overall EHH is a good company, dynamic CEO. Management is stressful, field work is rewarding. I personally prefer patient interaction over management.  EHH is data driven, and has a great EMR system which improves Medicare compliance, although it is sometimes tedious. Many opportunities for advancement if you are willing to work very hard. Long hours for management. Each branch culture varies depending on the Branch Director and Administrator"
good,"Would have loved to stay. Contract..Never work in the medical field, but really enjoyed it. My manager was very good at training and being patient with me as I trained"
good,"An excellent place to develop critical thinking skills and to learn entire process of nursing such as collaboration among therapy staff and physicians, admission and discharges"
good,"Coworkers pretty much make the job enjoyable. However, most of the good things about working here have been on the decline since being acquired by Health South. My pharmacist, nurses, and HR are great but administration is the complete opposite. Pretty much the classic blue collar vs. white collar story. We work in a practical way and they work in a theoretical way."
good,"A typical day at HealthSouth was very busy. You are on your toes all the time. However, it provides good leaning experience. Company encourages for professional development. Compensation wasnt that great."
good,If you have a family member in need of excellent rehab care this is the place to take them. They have an excellent therapy and medical staff of doctors to meet your needs and get you back on your feet
good,"Good benefits. Challenges vary.Good location. good reputation. Enjoy my coworkers. Salary is fair ratio to job description. Great therapy department , good outcomes for patients"
good,In the beginning with a recent acquired property of one of its competitors the daily hustle was stressful. It is the colleges and peers of this facility that made me stick around. This company has a clear goal and intent to be the best and it shows!
good,"Unit secretary, enjoyable job. Always on the go stays busy. Management is good, scheduling can be an issue sometimes. "
good,The hardest part of the job is you are always on your own. There is a lot to say about working in teams. You get very little training before you are thrown out on your own. The coworkers are very nice and helpful. The computer charting is the hardest thing to master.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the patients. I have learned a lot in the short time I have worked there.
good,I learned a lot during my tenure.  I will take what I've learned and grow from it.  Moving onward to share my knowledge and hopefully grow even more at my next place of employment. I wish the very best to my coworkers and the company. I will miss the daily routine and the satisfaction I received from helping our hospital staff nationwide.
good,"I love my coworkers, but management from the top has poor communication and sometimes raises are nonexistent. There is no career ladders unless you are in nursing. You can advance into senior management if you go get your degree. But there is almost no incentive to perform well."
good,I loved my job as a hha and enjoyed my pateints but dealing with the ever changing management issues were to much to deal with
good,I have worked for the company for a few years nice employees but management needs to be better and wish the pay was higher.
good,"I enjoyed providing patient care by meeting their needs. I also enjoyed the Staff that I supported. This position was very demanding, requiring me to be on call 24x7. I was the only maintenance person for all the facilities at this campus with no back up, other than contractors."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are a clinician or support staff.  I would stay away from the marketing side.  Marketing is only interested in you meeting your quota.  They do not care about patient satisfaction or what quality of work you do.  It is highly micro managed.  "
good,"I worked perDiem for this office/Fredericksburg,  they were a GREAT group to work with, helpful with answering questions.  I helped the Richmond office and they were anything but helpful, will not work for that office.  Definitely would work for this office again"
good,hiring new staff and making a lot of changes....i have been with this company 3yrs prn we have more than one location nation wide there not alot of growth within this company depending on your position
good,"Enjoy treating patients in this setting but can be stressful at times due to caseload, distance between patients and productivity expectations but this is a typical expectation in this industry."
good,"Great company to work for. Very ethical and compliant. The culture is great, Encompass really strives on promoting the most ethical, compliant, and promotes a lot of self development a"
good,"As a whole, Encompass Health is a good company. Albuquerque Hospital lacks proper leadership and could be better. High turnover in certain positions. Compensation for employment is good. Hospital has a lot of potential."
good,Census dropped on a regular bases. When that happened your hrs got cut back or you would get canceled from work and then have no pay. As far as employers I worked for at that time was great and good team. To bad they all have left right after I did. Now they have problems keeping staff from what I was told from a employer that still works for them that I still talk to.
good,Pay recently increased to a much better place considering living costs. Management often not around and staffing is becoming an issue. Overall belong pts get back to everyday tasks is very rewarding! 12 hour shifts are killer but only 3 per week for full time.
good,I like how the people there are all nice. They are willing to help you whenever I need help. People there makes you feel that you are not at a workplace but instead you feel like your home with your family that is always there with you
good,Patient centered.  Continued support from your local and regional teams.  Great growth opportunity.  Several hospitals in multiple locations as well as a Long Term component.
good,"The company itself is good with great values and an excellent benefits package. My job was the review and approval of 485 and OASIS documentation. The Regional Director is absolutely fabulous to work for, but she too has to fill many roles and is overstretched."
good,"friendly staff and management. Typical home health duties. The most difficult part of the job is the tablet use (very time consuming). The distance is sometimes difficult. "
good,High turn over. Low pay. High turnover. Didn't inform employees of company being sold until it was sold. lack of communication no advancement for growth
good,Typical day at work is busy during start of shift. I learned to have time management and provide excellent patient care. Workplace is very busy during day time. Hardest part of the job is to be able to meet patients healthcare demands. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendship that you build with your workmates.
good,"Encompass Health is a Fast-pace and collaborative place to work. The other therapists are wonderful to work with, and the team work and communication is great."
good,Get the work done and it’s a great place to be especially if you’re a social butterfly and enjoy communicating with other coworkers. There is room for advancement
good,The pay I would say is good. You get a lot of PDO from day 1. Schedule is very flexible. Great with family.  It seemed like there was a lot of shuffling of management.  From week to week new people were hired and fired randomly. Very little explanation was ever given.
good,"Working for this Agency has been great, the staff is very supportive of one another. This company really goes above and beyond for hire employees. There is a lot of educational opportunities that can be found within."
good,A reality check is in order.  Senior management is trying to combine two facilites with total beds of 144 into a 60 bed mother facility and a 20 bed overflow facility.   the staffing is all messed up with people on payroll of the 'runoff facility' being allocated to the mother facility.   the market expectations have not been met by any CEO'.s
good,"The company is great to work for and they do care about their employees. The office I work in, in my opinion, does not follow or show the company's motto. I love what I do but the management sucks. Favoritism has been shown and there is no unity."
good,I really enjoy home health care so this company was a good fit for me. HR and some of the office staff were not always on the same page and seeing patients and schedules were often miscommunicated.
good,"Lots of hours but great team, pay, and benefits. The CEO was very supportive. The bonus structure is very comprehensive and fair. The work they do is very fullfilling"
good,"Typical day is very busy, hardest part was having so many patients and not being able to spend more time with them especially when nurses call out. Culture fast paced and very cordial.  I enjoy working with patients and providing healthcare."
good,No two days are the same. Patient confidentiality is a must. Adapting to whatever situation is before you is a requirement. Accuracy/attn to detail is a definite bonus. There is no room for errors.
good,"none, it was a great job. opportunities for advancement,,, Friendly team. Manager was difficult to communicate with. I don't know what else to say at this point."
good,The work i did i enjoyed and i liked the staff and employees in my department that i worked with.  My manager was very good  and helped us when we needed it.
good,"It's a busy, productive workplace. Nurses and PCAs work together as a team to provide a better working environment. The standard working hours similar to other hospitals are from 630 Am to 7 PM for day shifts, and 630 PM to 7 AM for night shifts. We work 3 shifts per week."
good,"Advanced my nursing knowledge in regards to rehabilitation of stroke patients, brain injury patients, spinal cord injury patients & nontraditional diagnoses. Collaborated w/ physicians, nursing staff, therapists & insurance carriers w/ the goal of getting appropriate patients into an in-patient rehab setting."
good,"No work life balance, plenty of PTO but can’t get the time off to take it. Great benefits but can’t get the time off to use them. No work for 1/2 of the week and 3+ admits on a Friday. Work load not equal among nurses. Some worked WAY more than others. Six days preapproved time off with phone calls, expectations of seeing patients and time off not honored. Talk to management and it falls on deaf ears. Was much better when I started. It is not headed in a good direction. Lots of recent turnover.  Also, frequently expected to see patients without a visit loaded on tablet and then get written up for being behind on paperwork. Pay varies greatly among staff. I had 6 years of home health experience and was $5500 per year below a new to home care nurse."
good,"I love my Administrator and enjoy working with her. My fellow team OT and PT are amazing to work with as well. We have been bought many times and are now owned by Healthsouth. There are some things I am unhappy with. The new branch director can be condescending and rude, we have a case manager that pushed people out the door and places in our home health services inappropriately. All in all - it will take the right job to leave."
good,"High patient load.  Rehab-centered patient care. Environment of compassion, professionalism, and respect. Ability to see the patient's quality of life improve."
good,"Working at HealthSouth, you get incredible benefits, awesome people to work with and the chance to watch patients meet their goals. Management here is the only downfall."
good,"Worked as maintenance/ security in Erie, PA. Performed routine electrical, plumbing, and mechanical maintenance. Also performed lawn care and snow plowing."
good,"Not so much room for advancement but work atmosphere was great, best teamwork ever except for one or two, management is not that great but benefits is."
good,"I had an overal positive experience and appreciated the opportunity presented to me for all the experience I've received while being employed. Some departments look down on others which causes unecessary problems. I was lucky enough to meet my husband while working in the kitchen"
good,HEALTHSOUTH SPINE AND REHABILITATION CENTER  has a unique workplace culture with a strong emphasis on quality care and service excellence. A great depth of corporate expertise is available to support you in your work.
good,"Good company with lots of growth potential. Seasoned management, pleasant company culture, work/life balance..............................................."
good,"Encompass was a great place to work.  The culture is amazing and focused on patient care.    I worked a minimum of 50 hours in a week.  Month end process could be upgraded but very simple, you just plug numbers in.  I loved my direct report but felt a bit lonely at times.  The paid time off was wonderful. 30 days"
good,The best part of HealthSouth is your co-workers and the patients you get to help. Every day is a new experience. .Continuous changing of staff and constant pressure of training new employees with no support from management
good,HealthSouth Rehab is a dynamic and challenging place to work. The care team is generally positive and works towards providing quality care to all patients.
good,Great experience gained in MBSS assessments and treatment/evaluation of adults with varying neurogenic disorders. Lacks strong workplace culture but was great helping others with my specific skill set in speech therapy
good,Out patient Rehab Facility. There is some great work done within the walls of HealthSouth. A lot of lives have been changed for the better and in some cases lives have been redeemed.
good,"Overall Healthsouth is a great place to work. They truly care about your life outside of work and they want you as an employee to advance. Some managers need to take more time to spend with their employees and make sure all areas are supported. I enjoy my coworkers, they are helpful and supportive and help make a stressful day better. I wish their were more advancement opportunities at Healthsouth but this is difficult with such a small hospital."
good,"It is so stressful but if you work on certain days like sunday, you will get a lot of slack. The people around you are helpful, though, like the nurses and the other unit secretaries. It just requires a lot of patience and the shifts can feel really long."
good,"Can be very fast over whelming, I've learned a lot how to cook for patients special diets I've learned a lot about certain diets. How to order for the hospital the hardest part of my job would be when we get a lot admits  the enjoyable part is meeting new people and what they have been through and seeing them get better."
good,"the co-workers are great and help each other but both nursing supervisors are really bad, they do not answer lights, have poor attitude towards employees, etc."
good,"Workplace environment has changed over the past several years to one of secret agendas and low employee morale.  Very little thought to keeping the employees happy but a huge push to conform to the corporate standard without regard to local differences.  Very secretive and lack of open communication with employees, even ignoring policy to do so."
good,I very much enjoyed working at this facility. Wonderful staff. Great therapy department. Supportive staff and nursing. Up to date equipment and therapeutic media
good,"Awesome place to learn! The therapists are very passionate and really care about the patients! I would recommend this place to anyone. It is can be very fast paced at times. Typical work day start around 7:30 and would see last patient around 2:00 pm. The most enjoyable part of course is seeing the patients progress, and getting to work with wonderful people."
good,"Great staff and team work"
good,"Braintree Rehabilitation Hospital has a dedicated and talented workforce of therapists, nurses and physicians. Multiple ownership changes resulted in difficult patient ratios and challenging transitions however under the current ownership things are getting back on the right track."
good,"very busy fast paced, must be able to work independently. "
good,"Wonderful Management"

good,"Caring hardworking therapists giving their best to assure a return to home environment thru physical!occupational,and mental therapy."
good,Love the company. Been there for 6 years but it is time for me to move on. i feel I have done all I can do there. The management is great. It is a small hospital but has a friendly environment.
good,This company went out of business years ago.  They were great to work for though!  I loved my co-workers and working with patients.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job is the day to day interaction and relationships I form with my patients. My co-workers are so supportive and have a strong work ethic as myself that makes the environment that much more amazing.
good,I enjoyed the facility as well as the individuals I worked with.  Was a loving and caring atmosphere.  Change in management posed some difficulties and overall lead to the end of my career there.  Would recommend them as an employer any day.
good,"I didn't work here too long, but I definitely learned a lot working here. Since I mainly work with the geriatric community, this acute setting was different for me, which I liked. Charting every 2 hours, doing daily head to toe assessments on all of your patients and working from a pyxis definitely taught me better time management skills"
good,Spent seventeen years working here and enjoyed the staff and the job. Staff became close and the Doctors were wonderful
good,Great place to work with wonderful people who become like family. Large corporation with the usual amount of politics involved do to the nature of the business.

good,"HealthSouth is a very great place to work, we work together as a team to provide comfort, professionalism and respect to our patients."
good,"Healthsouth was a great place to work. a typical day work was checking vital, blood sugars, and weights. also giving/helping patients with showers, dinner, and sometimes therapy. I learned how to take blood sugars for the first time when i started working at Healthsouth. My co-workers were very nice, hands on, and very helpful. I think that management could have been a llittle better when it came down to how many patients a aide should have a night. Some aides would have more patients than other aides would. There was never a hard part in my job because everyone worked together when possible. But the most enjoyable part of my job was geeting to know the patients for who they were before and after  their visit."
good,its great to go to a work place where you know you can find team work. It is a great satisfaction to hear patients and family members to give such a good review of the place you work at.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Best part of my job was everyone knew me by name. I greeted everyone and everyone came to me about the hospital. My coworkers were awesome to me everyday. My patients coming back remembering me taking care of them, or helping with recovery was most rewarding of all."
good,"RN home health position, lots of flexibility- decent pay. Good management team. Lots of help from other RNs, don't have to report to the office daily"
good,Enriching and education work experience.  Friendly co-workers and easy to get along with.  Great communication skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the elderly population.  They were very talkative and told stories from their past.

good,Very energetic and helpful staff. All of the staff takes pride in the work they do with the patients and their family.
good,I enjoy interacting with the patients and helping them reach their rehabilitation goals.
good,It was an interesting work setting and I got to learn a great deal about rehabilitation.
good,"Take vital signs, direct patient care, EKG, take patients to physical therapy."
good,"I worked there too long ago, but have very fond memories of my time on staff."
good,"I worked day-shift on the 3rd floor.  I was surrounded with very caring and hard-working co-workers.  I miss them all, greatly!"
good,"typical day consists of at least 10 assigned patients with LVN and rehab tech partner. I do patient assessment, do nursing procedures, medication administration,  simple physical therapy, care coordination with physiatrists, MD, consultants, psych dept, PT and case management, evaluation of progress through careplan updates."
good,Good Management. Willing to support professional growth. Fast pace.
good,Great skill. Tight knit group of employee. Very well ran. Enjoying going in every day even on days where you knew it would be slightly more hectic. :) It was all worth it.
good,Very structured. Amazing staff. Close knit group of hard working individuals.
good,"Great Place to work, great co-workers.  Focused on patient care!"

good,"I enjoyed working at RIOSA, was disappointed when outpatient services were discontinued,"
good,Organized Therapy staff with great management with a focus on patient care and employee satisfaction.
good,"I am the staff pharmacist and director. Each day I review previous admissions for accuracy. I contact the physician and nurse when needed for clarification. I monitor labs and make dosage and medication adjustments based on renal function, INRs, and therapeutic substitutions. I counsel patients on medication therapy prior to discharge. I teach both the pulmonary and cardiac recovery class to patients. I attend the leadership, pharmacy and therapeutics meetings and the medical executive meetings. I develop policies, therapeutic substitution guidelines, and management of drug expenditure strategies. I train nursing staff on automated dispensing machine and conduct in-services whenever necessary."
good,"I work 12 hr shifts. A typical day is I come in take report from off going nurse. Pass medication, assist my CNA with answering call lights, and assisting patients with ADL's. I do any dressings that need changed and assess each and every one of my patients head to toe. My co-workers are great! we work together to get the job done. The hardest part of my job is some of my patients are unable to stand or move without total assistance. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching people get better and go home."
good,"Employees came to work in a good mood ready to help all patients, was a very nice place to work and everyone was a team player. Hardest part was when patients went home or gave up on therapy"
good,I enjoyed this job overall. I loved meeting all the patients and their families. I liked a majority of my coworkers.
good,I enjoyed interracting with different patients. Very busy office
good,"Productive work place, great pay, good employees and excellent work schedule"
good,I would take doctors orders and place them with companies and make copies for nurses and fax info for doctors when needed i would take inventory once a week of supplies in the office and order when necessary and when orders came in i would stock the office and supply the doctors with their orders
good,"When I had a cx in outpatient, I was always flexible to head over to the inpatient side of the hospital to work with the patients in a sub-acute phase of their rehab. Exp. includes, but not limited to amputees, TBI, SCI, Stroke, Orthopedics"
good,I came in and checked vital signs and charted them. When breakfast came around I passed out their trays then helped them get dressed for a day of therapy. Management could have been a little more tolerable. I loved working with the people around and the best part of my day was seeing the patients smile and be happy with my services.
good,A typical workday starts by planning your day and what area you will be going to . You start with reviewing pt. medical record and following you r care plan that has been established. The management is a very caring and helpful group. The hardest part of the job is the traveling. The most enjoyable part of the job is the patients.
good,I really like working with my co-workers. They are supportive and helpful.
good,"Healthsouth was a positive place for someone to work. My loads were never too heavy, which I know wasn't the case for every facility. It is a great environment for students as I was one while I was there. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with the patients. Whether it was one on one or group therapy, it was nice to not only treat but to learn about each unique individual. My co-workers were helpful in every way to make me comfortable and we all worked as a team."
good,Great hospital to start out once you graduate. Staff enjoys furthering your education with hands-on experience.
good,"I am a LPN , and actually worked at (2) different facilities in Memphis, Tn. I went through an nursing agency, and worked quite a bit between the two . I overall enjoyed my time there, no work place is perfect . I did notice friction among nurses to nurses., and the tech's rarely had any help . And at times the patient load per nurse, as well as the tech's was a little much. Also at times it seemed as if there was more agency nurses working than actual staff. I didn't like the way they charted at the time (2004). My overall feel of both facilities , is good. Maybe improve on team work. As a former admission director/SS , of other health care companies , (1) person cannot do it alone! I takes the entire staff , From housekeeping , tech, therapist , cna's , maint, nurses, dietary , CEO , etc , all focusing on one thing , Our patients who are under our care. Would work there again if the opportunity every comes around ."
good,"Very faced pace and busy workplace. Most enjoyable part is the fast pace. All hospitals go through slow periods, then your not quite as busy and that is the one part that is difficult. My co-worker are great,n always willing to go the extra mile as well as I. It makes things run smoother."
good,A typical day can be challening. I learned to be a better listener. Management here was A1. Co-workers had a team effort spirit. The hardest part of this job was making sure everyone was happy at supper time! The most enjoyable part of this job is I had an impact on lives in transition from not being able to the for themselves to reaching a goal of doing for themselves again.
good,"a day at work waz nice goitn food shopen picken up prescruption, cleanin cooking"
good,I was able to immerse myself in the hospital. I interacted with staff from all departments as well as the patients and I loved it.
good,Busy and fast paste in the moring giving showers and getting patient ready for therapy.
good,"Good work environment. The interview process was what I expected.  The back office staff worked well together however management needed to focus on holding the entire work staff accountable for their actions."
good,Work load was a little heavy but the pay and benefits balanced it out.  Having a supportive manager and wonderful office staff also helped make this a fun place to work and their benefits were amazing.
good,"New office facility to work at. Some remote work from home allowed."
good,Typical day is seeing patients over a large geographical area. Some areas difficult to get to in a standard car. Wear and tear on personal car is extensive. Company car is available if you qualify.
good,great place. some of the other aides never really did their job which sucked because everyone else had to go behind them and complete their work. also a lot of the RNS didnt really assist with anything even though they were supposed to.
good,"In the 9+ years I worked there.."
good,"Excellent place to work under the right manager, too much turn over in management for consistency."
good,Great nursing staff.  Provides many training courses and opportunities to receive education.  Well kept clean facility that provides the best quality patient care. Room for growth within the company.
good,My mission was to gain experience and network benefits toward my mission attending grad school and ultimately becoming a Physical Therapist.  That was accomplished.
good,HealthSouth would occasionally have cookouts for the staff. Typical day at work was checking on assigned pt.'s Meeting with management for a daily huddle. Culture was challenging since some of the management spoke poor english
good,"this is a good place to work.  The management is professional and caring. coworkers are experienced, caring, supportive, and knowledgeable. it is a good atmosphere to work"
good,"I love my unit and my patient population.  I have been here for 4.5 years and have seen the ups and downs and turn overs.  Overall I would recommend this company and the job to anyone who isn't afraid to work hard, have patience, and compassion for people."
good,Facility provides health care services in the area that is needed.  A good quality team and purpose.  Patients see improvement and have goo discharge plans.
good,I worked at HealthSouth for 27 plus years.  It felt like all the fellow employees were family.  I enjoyed my job and I enjoyed my coworkers.  After 27 years I was devastated when my job was abolished after months and months of low census.
good,"Fast paced, ongoing admissions and discharges, room for advancement if your interested in nursing. The culture there is very diversed. The hardest part of the job is getting use to different faces as this company hires new employees on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at health south starts with taking vital signs and helping  patients with activities of daily living of which patient that I am assigned. In a busy day I will be assigned up to 12 patients, in slow day I will have 8 patients for entire shift."
good,Encompass is a good place to work. I am just trying to find a office job instead of a traveling home health job. I would like to advance in a company and work in an office setting so I can go back to school and advance up in a company.
good,Nice working with others that care for individuals with disabilities. That was the most enjoyable part of the job. The workplace culture was great. The hardest part was seeing the patients in pain.
good,Management and HR are to close you do not fell like you have anyone to turn to. but the most enjoyable part of my Job is the patients. the hardest part of my job the patients.
good,"Productive place to work, very competitive.  I had to relocate to another state, due to getting married and husband relocated jobs to another state.   Nice place to work."
good,My first venture into for-profit.  Stressful but not over the top.  Management was supportive but expectations were very high.  I learned a great deal about hospital operations and management and managment metrics
good,Medium paced environment. Focus is on reaching as many patients as possible and providing quality care as well. Great group of people to work with and work for.
good,If you can handle the stress that is natural with Hospice care this is a wonderfully rewarding position. The company has great pay and decent benefits available.
good,"Healthsouth Rehab hospital is busy work.  Begins with Patient assessments and medication admin, you very quickly learn to prioritze in order to complete duties before patients are wisk away to thearpy. Managers were generallly helpful and available. Co workers were friendly and helpful. the hardest part of job was time management. The most enjoyable part were the patients"
good,The people I work with really care about each other and helping each other out. Makes for a good work environment. I enjoy how much I have learned since starting work there. The other people I work with have all different types of nursing background and I feel like that has made me a better nurse learning from them. The director of nursing and the nurse managers and supervisors really care about the well being of their nurses.
good,Timings and flexibility is great and can manage home and work.  It has been a good journey with this company since the kids were little but now I need more hours.
good,Healthsouth is a good place to work the only problem is that the rehab technician and nurses are not properly paid for the major job that its done there and the company is not willing to give employees a raise..so constanly they are short of staff and looking for more employees..
good,I didn't work there very long but the time I was there it was a good experience and from working with the staff I learned a lot.They work good as team. The facility was always clean and odor free and the cafeteria food was really good.
good,I am happy that I've had this experience. It was a nice change of pace from my previous employers. Everyone was friendly.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at HealthSouth.  The management teams is very good, hard working and down to Earth.  I found the employees to be generous, hard working and excellent at patient care.  The facility is an older building but the maintenance department and housekeeping department did a good job keeping the building functioning and clean."
good,"My day consists of many different things from marketing physician and medical groups attending conferences locally and out of the state and meeting with health plans case managers and medical directors on a regular basis. "
good,Enjoyed working with home health patients.  Spent many hours documenting.
good,"I arrive at work at 7:30 A.M.  I'm responsible for opening the front PBX. Through out my day I answer the phones, do the charges, audit charges, fax, etc.  I work with a great team of Employee's here at Healthsouth. I love what I do, but am looking for something with room for advancement.  I want more of a career than just a job.  I am always up for learning new things and expanding my education if my job calls for it.  I just need the right door to open so I can reach my goals."
good,"Loved working with patients,co workers were also good to work with"
good,"A typical day is full of appointments and seeking out new opportunities. I work on a team but cover my own territory and accounts and hold the responsibility for contacts and tracking outcomes in CRM. I meet with physicians, NPs, Pas and Clinical Managers presenting Rehab services Healthsouth has to offer.  Conversations are geared towards overcoming objections for that they don't have a patient that will benefit from IPR, elaborating on diagnosis we treat, utilizing charts, graphs and summaries of outcomes and results.  As well as a consistent effort to build deep long term relationships with physicians, office staff, clinical managers, NPs, Pas and Speciality Drs."
good,"I worked for a short period during the restatement period of this company, in a new department created just to prepare financial statements for use in security offerings.  There were many time constraints resulting in excessive overtime work."
good,HealthSouth was a very good company until the layoffs started.
good,had great coworkers & good turnover of pt's with rehab diagnoses
good,"I currently work 2nd shift....Receive report from outgoing staff "
good,Get report from techs/nurses that were on first shift
good,worked there many years ago and no one I know works there anymore.
good,"Worked with different patient populations, and close with other therapists. Worked with patients completing morning ADL's and transferring to and from therapy gym. Under the supervision of an OT and ran small group therapy sessions."
good,"During my employment with HEALTHSOUTH, I was instrumental in helping the hospital with staff training, and preparation for Joint Commission."
good,"I worked in the Orthopedic unit and loved it. Bute, I lived 53 miles one way and only part time. I needed full time and it was not available at the time."
good,I really enjoyed my job i had a lot of wonderfull patients that i will always remember. The co-workers tried to help as much as they could but working in a hospital is pretty busy but it was good.
good,Good people to work with. Nice to be able to make up your own schedule. Flexible with personal appointments. Decent benefits if you don’t go to doctor very often.
good,"Great team to work with everyone usually tries to help each other out, good support from management, the only complaint is that the benefits could be better and the health insurance is very expensive."
good,"I loved my job here, unfortunately I was dropped down to PRN after Medicare had a few cut backs, which ultimately caused me to have to find a new job. Get ready to use your own vehicle to drives hundreds of miles every week to and from patients homes."
good,"full-time staff over worked, difficult to cover visits in home health if there are not enough per diem employees to cover when people go on vacation. good amount of days off."
good,"Great team and management at this branch. Pay could be higher, but it is good for the area. Encompass is the most fair home health company I have worked for in regards to pay and job expectations."
good,A typical day at work is working with patients and managing their care. Working closely with your assigned nurse is daily and they give instruction for me to follow with the patients as well. The work culture was good at Encompass Health.
good,The best parts of working there is the employees and the patients. Everyone at Encompass are like my family! And I love getting to know all the patients. We are a very friendly team!
good,"Fantastic overall company, only frustration is management at the local/regional level. Regional director is not knowledgeable in medicare regulations or the ins and outs of home care, is very close minded  and unapproachable, and does not look out for the greater good of our branch."
good,"Enjoyed many great coworkers & ability to chat on case conference day. Fast paced job, enjoyed clients. Many days difficult to plan when told you are going out of town to see other clients. Difficult to get all charting done in the home... Upper most mgmt with many favorites..."
good,"Human Resources was a one person department. Prior to working for HealthSouth, I had worked in the Human Resource environment but not one in healthcare. I experienced a lot of ""firsts"" working at HealthSouth, ie the Joint Commission. Working at HealthSouth opened the door to healthcare for me."
good,Great place to gain rehab experience. Make a difference in the lives of patients every day.  Coworkers are very supportive.  Management is not well trained
good,"I'm only a PRN employee so I cant speak on benefits or anything I can only tell you about my personal experience. My supervisor is amazing, she is always helping me get hours anyway I can. I like working there but I'm a single mom and I just need something more permanent and much better pay."
good,"Fast-paced rehabilitation setting, catering primarily to older adults. A wide variety of diagnosis keep things interesting and challenging as well. Very supportive management within a welcoming and friendly atmosphere."
good,"I was hired to work in medical records, which I did for about a year.  The receptionist left and I was then moved to that position and an older employee took my place in medical records.  Good company with good people who care about each other and the patient that they took care of."
good,Pharmacists work autonomously.  Good opportunity for patient contact spent at admission and discharge.  Good staff in pharmacy and work well as a team.
good,It takes time and consideration to care for our patients.  I think more advancement should be involved but it's a great company to work for. I have some great experience and I have learned a lot of things to advancement me to a higher position.
good,"A typical day of work entails lots of driving, coordinating schedules, calling and informing patients of scheduled time. "
good,"due to heavy patient load and massive charting requirements, teamwork is essential to compleating the job.  Nurse and cna work closely together to promote high satisfaction scores and above average outcomes."
good,Best part of the job is working with the patients and setting my own schedule. Worst part was so much driving and not having a set area to which we would be driving less
good,"Encompass is a great team-based company to work for, and I have been there for 4 years.  They recently changed office managers which was completely appropriate.  I love my colleagues."
good,"I was able to provide Athletic Training to many different venues which was a great learning experience, from semi-pro to high school sports coverage. There was also a lot of opportunity for continuing education units through the company."
good,"Encompass is a very innovative work place.  it is a medical clinic as well as a behavioral clinic.  We have medical providers  as well as behavioral staff on hand at all times."
good,"Comfortable working environment. This company allowed their employees various opportunities to grow their skill set and enhance their knowledge. In addition, there are opportunities for promotions."
good,"HealthSouth is a busy therapy atmosphere. There are several Medicare guidelines required for inpatient rehab and it does keep you busy evaluating and treating patients all day. An average caseload is usually about 6 patients that you treat for an hour and a half to two hours each day. Some weekend shifts are required, usually one Saturday or Sunday a month which is based on your availability. HealthSouth inpatient rehab is a great place to advance your skills as a therapist and keep you on your toes. You will see a variety of patients and will see them progress in their recovery over a period of 1-2 weeks which is rewarding. You will work with an interdisciplinary team to provided the best care and recommendations for the patients."
good,Out in the field was great the ADON was very helpful he was always willing to help his Nurses!!  I learned a lot from the ADON and my co-workers. The most enjoyable part was taking care of the patients!
good,"Top healthcare on the Places to Work list. 30 paid days off and paid training. Speacialty programming for area manager, fast paced and changing with the demands of a very busy healthcare sector home health."
good,"excellant experience "
good,"HealthSouth always felt personal. Each hospital is a stand alone and not necessarily affiliated with any of the local hospitals, so we were able to establish relations with all of the major healthcare organizations but maintain a non-biased feel. We also were a small family at the local level but had the support of the entire company behind us. Our reputation has been second to none and really foster the growth of the employees."
good,I was located at this school system as part of a Level II fieldwork placement for Occupational therapy. It was a good opportunity to learn how to provide OT services in an inpatient setting. I worked with the staff and patients in the brain injury unit and really enjoyed the environment and people quite a lot. It was a very collaborative approach to treatments that ensured the best care for our patients.
good,"On a typical day I'd have 6-8 patients. Morning shift is very busy at the beginning of the shift because you are trying to give medications before therapy sessions begin. Although a rehabilitation hospital, feels like a med-surg floor with good experience opportunities."
good,Loved the work I did here but the pay was low. Director of Therapy dept. has favorites/ friends since some tech's have been there the same amount of time as him(decades). Patient care and hands on experience was great but fast paced and stressful if you have lazy partner(which I did). For the most part though I was happy there.
good,was a nice place to work. People were great.  It was a good feeling helping people. Worked with disabled and handicapped. Worked in the inpatient and outpatient hospitals.
good,"I enjoyed my time with HealthSouth and grew tremendously. Mt CEO, Margaret Futch, was excellent and was always will to mentor me. I do see a trend where volume versus quality culture is beginning to show in the organization as a whole but some of it is not within the control of the post acute facilities."
good,Frequently under staffed which leaves none to very little support staff. Office staff and management spread way too thin for all the tasks they are required to do which leaves field staff with little support. Otherwise a professional organization.
good,"I chose to  return to Advanced Home Care due to  location, Encompass bought out Care South and the transition has been difficult also but the majority of employees stayed and are doing well"
good,I was a patient care tech. It was a great job to get my foot in the door for my future in health care. They worked around my school schedule and the employees were fun to work with
good,"Overall a good company, great orientation and initial training. Great if you enjoy being out on your own more, though don't expect much free time or flexibility in your schedule. And expect 1-2 hours of work every evening during the week. My social life has been drastically reduced. But if you like home health, it's  one of the best, and most ethical, companies out there."
good,"A typical day was fast-paced, demanding, but very rewarding. I worked for 3 different departments, kitchen, housekeeping, maintenance. All 3 were high standard and kept me busy which I really liked. Management for the most part was very good, and ran a tight ship. The culture and environment was stimulating, busy, and friendly. The best part of the job was the patients and the social skills required, the worst was the red tape that comes with the territory when working in health care."
good,"Individual branches may not run as fluidly as the company intends.  However, the compensation and benefits package makes it worth sticking it out.  The company truly supports it's staff."
good,"Health South Rehab Hospital is a great  company to work for but the management and CEO is not fair to certain employees. ""Some can, some can't, some will and some want""!"
good,"The company has a positive culture, fair, open and transparent, and sought the highest quality care for patients and employees. They provide thorough orientation with field preceptors and office preceptors. Education at the company based learning center."
good,Loved working with Healthsouth. I had to make a emergency move out of state and Healthsouth is not in Ct. At this time so I had to leave the company... Bummer!!
good,"Fair supervision. Balanced work week. Fair pay with bonus, similar goals of all employees, occasional overtime needed due to staffing or being extremely busy."
good,this company taught me many things about healthcare.  I loved the people I worked with.  It had  a strong family way about themselves.    great place.
good,Enjoyed working with staff and helping patients improve their lives and health. Variety of patients and staff working as one to achieve the goal of being the best facility as possible.
good,Overall good place to work. Great benefits. co workers work well as a team. I have learned a great deal about working in a rehab hospital. I have achieved new skills.
good,I have been at Braintree Rehabilitation Hospital for almost 20 years.  Healthcare is changing drastically and not for the better.  I love working with the team of professionals here.  Most difficult part of my job is dealing with the lack of reimbursement by insurers therefore jeopardizing my current position.
good,"I enjoyed interning at Health South.  There were many times when the caseload got a little overwhelming but the staff is very helpful and make the days easier to get through.  No a bad place to work at all, I would recommend it!"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, pay was good, facilities were excellent. The people were very helpful, and professional, over all an excellent place to work."
good,"Totally like my job but would like to be a little closer to home so that I may be more available to my teenage sons. I like what I am doing now, although at times there are some downsides to being specialized in this field."
good,a Typical work day is about 10 hours of work for 8 hours pay. The patient base is working so hard on returning to their lives that the day keeps you busy and you just want to do the best for them.
good,HealthSouth is an incredible place to work to learn solid nursing technique while caring for a very diverse population. Management works hard to create a culture of teamwork. Nurses and therapists can grow in their craft with opportunity to advance.
good,"This company has a great employee compensation package including PDO, Health Benefits for qualifying employees, chances for advancement, and wonderful technology to have patient information available at your fingertips via tablet."
good,"- Evaluate, create treatment plan, and participate in interventions. "
good,The nurses here are very nice and easy to work with. Most of them are new grads and their lack of experience can be overwhelming for a seasoned nurse. Management can be good at helping on the floor.
good,Fun therapy department overall.  Highly experienced clinicians.  Difficult to meet expectations at times due to conflicting demands.
good,"it was an intense pace and intense challenge working with in patients that where in tough condition, but the staff and patients made it worth while after a long day"
good,"I started out as a medical transcriptionist and after a few years moved to the physiatrists office located within HSRH.  I was the only employee in that office of up to three physiatrist for the majority of time I worked there.  I was responsible for all scheduling, medical transcription, filing, incoming and outgoing mail, patient work up in the office and in the clinic.  This was a challenging position however very rewarding.  I also work at the switchboard when needed and I wasn't busy in the medical office."
good,I really loved working for this company.  The staff was like a family home away from home.  Everyone works together and services are really about bettering the patient.
good,"Working at HealthSouth has taught me a lot. While working at Healthsouth I have learned how to work with PT,OT, Physicians and RN's."
good,"-A typical day at the hospital was checking supplies before floor-to-floor morning rounds.  Aproximately 30-40 patients each morning."
good,Immediate staff worked very well together.  HealthSouth had a good environment for balancing work and life.  Good insurance package and overall good place to work.
good,Patient ratio is up to 10 patients for a 6a-6p shift.  The days are fast paced.  My coworkers are very helpful and make the hard days easier to deal with.  Management helps out when available.  The hardest part of my job is the patient ratio and the most enjoyable part is seeing my patients leave stronger and healthier than when they arrived.
good,Very hard working staff that strives towards excellence in the field of Inpatient rehab.
good,"HealthSouth was a physical rehabilitation hospital for those patients who were post MVA, post CVA, post operative, etc.  It was a bustling scenario behind the HUC desk.  There was always a charge nurse and although the atmosphere was busy, it was orderly and productive.    Newer changes to management which occurred in the latter half of 1997 heralded disorganization and inexperience, in my opinion.  My co-workers all worked together and were very passionate about their duties toward their patients.  The hardest part of the job may have been accepting the new management with their changes that were forced with little explanation.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the patients progress and become discharged."
good,"When I did  my extern at HealthaSouth I was very excited because I enjoyed what I was doing and the information that was being introduced was not hard to understand. A typical day at work was making my first rounds and letting the patients know that i was there and to let me know if they needed anything. Also checking on the supplies that i also will need in order to help the patients. The hardest part of the job was waking the patients up out of their sleep to take their vital signs. Because I knew that they wanted to sleep from a long day. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the patients, talking with them and asking if there anything I can do to help them while I was there. The people that i worked with made sure that I knew the information and the proper way to do the tasks that I was assigned."
good,I love working at Encompass and co-workers are very friendly.
good,All employees work well as a cohesive team to ensure the patients received proper care for full comprehensive recovery.
good,"A place I truly enjoyed working and have spent most of my time as a Nurse under their employment. The management, DON, changed frequently and new changes made for some small challenges."
good,This was not the type of nursing I wanted to do.  And I also had some personal issues going on.  This is why I did not stay here for a long period of time.
good,"Check patient schedules, make calls to confirm schedules, coordinate with field staff to insure patients are seen. Make sure to cover any staff that has called in sick or unable to work. The hardest part of the job was working in stressful situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you've made someones day better."
good,"Use Strategies and Options for problems solving"
good,"I enjoyed rehab. work however, no one could cover my weekends that I worked. For 5 1/2 years, I worked every weekend. Family suffered."
good,"I go in at 7a and review any staffing issues, daily charge work, all pay roll & scheduling for both Nursing Units, adjust staffing with census changes, attend meetings for variety of committees, supervise secretary staff."
good,"if you are freshly out of a healthcare school, this is the place to learn! Depending on what your credentials are, depends on how you are treated..A lot of good staff for patient care there though!"
good,the day is busy. walk a lot.co workers got a lone. the hardest part of this job patientfelt like the were in the hospital. they didnt want to do therapy.
good,"This was a collections department for Workers Compensation payments for services rendered by physicians, hospitals, labs, etc We had a good record but this division of HealthSouth Corporation sold it laying off management."
good,Good orientation and on-going education program.  The cafeteria is also very good and the layout is excellent.  Better employee recognition and unbiased reward system would be helpful
good,I love encompasshealth but at times I used to sense alot of conflict of interest. Sometimes the work load was unfair just like other places. They work the good workers to death and the lazy ones get by with not applying themselves constantly. That broke me and made me stand up for my self respect. But for the most part I love everyone there staff and patients. I would go back but they dont do rehires
good,"It’s good company to work for, the people make it good. The pay is fair the atmosphere is relaxed body is fast paced because it’s payroll. The people make the biggest difference because we work together to ensure that each and everyone of us are in formed on changes that deal with payroll topics. The benefits are very comparable and if not exceed that of other jobs I’ve had."
good,"Driving an average of 90 to 100 miles per day, very wide area coverage, this is why i'm looking for another company, closer to home so i would not be driving far."
good,"I worked as a therapist with the home health side for five years in San Antonio initially and then I transferred to the Allen office. It is a hectic job and if you aren’t good at setting boundaries and saying “No”, the office will give you more and more visits. The therapists with the most longevity at the offices are good at managing their schedules effectively in order to maximize their time and can be firm with schedulers about declining visits rather than routinely going was over productivity requirements."
good,"A typical day at work was stressful. I was part of the acquisition process and it was exhausting. The management was fair, but unstable. The best part of the work was working with my surgical patients at their home places."
good,Its a job. Pays the bills. Love my patients. I set my own work schedule as long as I work every other weekend. The offer bonuses for extra shifts. Nice experience for someone who's willing to work.
good,"If your numbers are low, management will get involved. Great compensation. You must be flexible in your territory & willingness to help other co-workers if they become busy. Overall, great place to work."
good,"I work 24 hours a day as long as we have patients. I am the only one running an office of 36 team members, but my team trust me and know that I will do what is best for our patients and for them"
good,Encompass is a fine company to work for. They offer an excellent benefit package with paid time off but if you're not a member of the nursing department there's little lack for growth.
good,As I always tell anybody it’s not the job it’s the people we put in positions to make the job hard. Without staffing and driven minded people we will always fail the patient. Understaffed is the problem here for the most part and let’s not forget the favoritism. My whole mindset daily is to care for my patients as if they’re my own mother or father.
good,"Encompass Health has provided me with a wonderful opportunity to grow my sales experience within the hospital and clinic settings. The mission and structure are adhered to 75-95% of the time. Management within the individual branch has a huge impact on team success and outcomes, with an experienced manager your personal and professional growth will develop. Without it, learn who else in the organization has the experience and tenure to support your growth."
good,"I worked as a Marketing Liaison & spent majority of my work day out in the field, based out of my car. If you are self motivated, disciplined, & dependable, job was very fulfilling. Management will get involved if not meeting your numbers."
good,"Good place to work, very friendly staff, supportive management, self scheduling however you have to work 1 weekend out of the month which puts you at 12 days of work in a row, ugh!"
good,12 hour shifts are long. Good working crew. State of the art equipment. Great pay. Not enough PTO for LNAs they earn less time off than the nurses for the same amount of stress.
good,The hospital is a great place to work . The rehab department work very hard to make sure the patients are well taking care of. they help them achieve their goals while they short visit at the hospital.
good,"Communicated with doctors registered nurses and patients, answered patient calls, took patients vitals, clean/sanitized patient areas, collected urinalysis and stool samples, bathe and dress patients, lifted patients into beds, wheelchairs and toilets, provided help feeding patients, provided emergency care such as CPR and abdominal thrust."
good,"Great team of therapists; however, as a PRN employee, hours are very inconsistent. Variety of technologies available as well as large treatment spaces."
good,"Good company to work for. Good work culture. Everyone is helpful."
good,"Health south is a fun place to work lots of experience you will gain on a daily basis. The nurses are friendly willing to work as a team. There are great and professional cna to work with, some of the supervisors are very nice some can adopt a little more helpful attitude,"
good,Everything was great until they overstaffed the Speech team and then I was unable to be productive consistently. Now I feel my job is in jeopardy on a daily basis
good,Great place to work when i was there. Its been about 3 yrs so i cant speak for now it has expanded from my understanding. All i can say is give it a try for yourself
good,Healthsouth provides its employees an opportunity to grow. They always conduct on site trainings. Employees are very much willing to help each other especially the new employees.
good,Overall worked with my schedule as a per diem employee.  Good company to work for.  Flexible scheduling and company offers tuition reimbursement for its employees.
good,"I was the original Director of Healthsouth Home Health.  I returned to the agency, now under the management of Encompass Home Health, in October, 2016.  When my Branch Director retired, a new Branch Director was brought in who did not expemplify the Encompass work culture (he was eventually removed from his position) but not before his unrealistic expectations forced me to leave.  I would still recommend Encompass Home Health to nurses wanting to practice in the homecare environment."
good,Busy Hospital.  Definitely NOT a nursing home.  Patients are medically acute.  Great success in discharging patients to home.  Great therapy.  Some wonderful nursing staff.
good,It is a great place to work with a multitude of diagnoses that will sharpen your clinical skills and strengthen your overall experience. It offers a team effort and collaborative work environment.
good,Healthsouth accommodated me from working full-time to part-time to allow me to raise my child. Co-workers were very friendly and hard-working. I did not leave on bad terms. It was very slow at the time when I was laid off.
good,"Great collaborative group of therapists and nurses.  Fantastic manager.  Some nursing turnover which resulted in instability of team at times.    Otherwise it was a great experience.  Lots of continueing education opportunities.  Some traveling was required.   A very ethical company that always puts the patients first.    Would definitely work for them again.  ""A Better Way To Care"""
good,I've had the same job for approximately 23 years under several different company names.  I'm only considering leaving secondary to what appears to be a paradigm shift re: the utilization of social workers.  Sad to be thinking of leaving a job I love but I don't work well while tethered.
good,"I absolutely loved working here. All my co-workers and the patients were awesome to work with everyday. Some things I didn't agree with but that can be anywhere. Communication lacked a little bit between departments, but overall  a great place to work."
good,"The company has a good foundation, and the people are friendly and helpful. The preceptors are amazing, the field staff is always willing to help, and the HR rep is wonderful."
good,"The days were long and stressful, especially if a co-worker didn't show up and we had to cover their patients, but all in all, everyone worked together and the people were nice, the patients amazing."
good,"Coworkers were great, physicians are easy to work with and care about the staff and patients, short staffed at times.  Great therapy with the goal of returning patients to their most independent state."
good,Started as a new grad in 1993. Was able to make my way up the carrier ladder from staff PT to a clincal supervisor. This job allowed me to learn many things which I have taken with me to my current job. Excellent supervisors and mentors
good,"I also scheduled patient appointments for the prosthetic/orthotic clinic and ordered necessary medical equipment for discharging patients.  I enjoyed working at HealthSouth, and intended to continue working there, but my position was eliminated."
good,I have enjoyed working for Encompass Home Health because the standard is to offer a better way to care for our patients. The sales team was all brand new when I started and the clinicians have had a lot of turnover as well.  It is a difficult sale to only offer care to Medicare producing accounts which is why I am pursuing a career elsewhere.
good,"Great supportive staff; however, the holiday and PTO policy does make work-life balance a challenge.The Benefits are also pretty good and so are the Employee discounts."
good,Good place to work but can be demanding on staff at times.  Patient load can vary for staff nurses.  Often times nurses have insufficient time to balance patient care with required documentation.  Nurse Manager and Nurse Supervisors are excellent and skilled nurses but can be unrealistic in comprehending daily staff nurse work-load
good,"Healthsouth, while not perfect, provided a great work environment while providing decent pay and great benefits. My reason for leaving was simply that I could not advance in the company with my chosen career field."
good,This job was great until you get sick or have a injury and can not work. At first they work with you but if the doctor does not want you to come back to work the management team will not hold your position.
good,"This was a fast paced job, that I enjoyed. I worked evening shift so, I was getting dinner to the patients and assisting them to eat. I assisted patients to get ready for bed; changing clothes brushing teeth (real and dentures) and daily bedtime needs. I really enjoy working directly with patients, elderly or young. It is definitely what I am supposed to do in life."
good,Fair and competitive salary.  Company has gone through a change in ownership since I was employed.  While I was there there was a great sense of pride and teamwork.
good,"I was only there for a few days for clinicals, but the nurses were very willing to educate and were very patient. Also the nurse to patient ratios were very reasonable."
good,Typical work day is maintaining building operations.  The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making the patients happy.  Workplace culture is excellent.
good,"This particular HealthSouth's management was awesome. They scheduled time to listen and found solutions, if a problem arose."
good,"It's a relatively good company to work for. I think sometimes the acuity of the patients aren't really appropriate for completing 3 hours of therapy, but other than that it's a pretty good company to work for."
good,"Most of the staff are nice and helpful. Although, like many facilities you have some ""teacher's pet"" that never have to do any work. If you can ignore this, this is a great place to work.  Understanding management but not enough staff to accomplish job. Poor communication and orientation of new staff."
good,"Great learning opportunities for new grads. Numerous/ORTHO learning experiences. Cultural diversity, limited opportunities for advancement No additional comments"
good,"Very rewarding work, seeing patients improve and increase strength to go home and continue with their life. Staff worked well together.  Very clean facility."
good,"Excellent rehab center, and wonderful team. A new director of rehab was coming in as I was leaving, the changes she was creating seemed to be positive."
good,HEALTHSOUTH was a good place to work. the benefits and wages were very competitive. they always provided opportunities for overtime work. the patients loves it there.
good,"Typical day at work was making sure patients were bathed and ready for any therapy scheduled for that day. Made sure all the needs for patients were met during your shift. It was enjoyable meeting all types of people,  I learned how to care for many types of injuries/health/rehab situations. Hardest part of the job was making sure all the patients on my schedule were cared for completely in the time allotted to me. Some patients are challenging and require more time and patience that others. I found the computer the most challenging. I did enjoy the challenge of learning new medical procedures, caring for different types of patients. Truly a learning experience for me. The one problem I did have with working there was when the bed census was down they called to tell you they did not need you for the shift you worked. You could pick up some extra time if someone called off sick or their were fellow workers on vacation. Overall the work at Health South was challenging at times but very rewarding. I would recommend Health South for employment."
good,"A good place to work, in Modesto, CA.  HealthSouth-Modesto is new to Modesto, CA and is a new Rehabilitation Center serving the community of Modesto, CA."
good,"It is a fast paced environment. Time management skills are a  must. Candidates will get a lot of IV experience. Patients receive 3 hours of therapy a day, so completing nursing tasks around therapy and meals can be tasking. The best part of this job is seeing the progress the patients make in therapy."
good,"HealthSouth in Glendale AZ is an amazing facility with state of the art equipment, clean and plenty of space.  You have the opportunity to work with a variety of diagnosis with great support from nursing, clinical and physicians.  "
good,A great place to gain experience and knowledge of many vast disease processes. Co-workers a pleasure to work on the floor with. Also a great place to learn time management and priority of care.
good,Love the people that I work with and the enivirment. The management is very helpful and willing to answer any questions. The nursing staff is great and the therapist do an awesome job
good,Environment that challenges your clinical reasoning skills. Great team approach and technologies available to promote better outcomes which are the basis for this setting.
good,HealthSouth is a fast paced in patient rehabilitation facility.  It is an institution that will engage you and provide with a higher skill set than when you started.  Working in the HealthSouth environment requires strong organizational and critical thinking skills
good,"The pharmacy was the most delightful pharmacy i have ever worked in. I am very sorry i left. I worked with truly amazing pharmacist who help you out of a jam in a heartbeat.  The technicians were just as knowledgeable as the pharmacist  The pharmacy worked like a well oiled machine.  the management was awesome. they would step in to help any time we were short handed. The nursing staff were always ready to answer our questions about doctors orders even when we bugged all day. HealthSouth is an amazing place to work for,"
good,"Nice place to work with team focused atmosphere.  Provided and encouraged staff to continue education and training.  Very productive environment and must be able to multi-task.  If you love a place that is patient care centered and like working as a team, this is the place for you."
good,"I was the biller, collector, appeals, and cash poster for six hospitals. Also, responding to all correspondence. Completing adjustments when needed."
good,"Great Company. Home Health is a difficult field for sales since Medicare is the only insurance that is commissioned. However, Encompass provides the best patient care than most other home health providers."
good,It was initially a great opportunity as a starter job but there is little to none room for opportunity to grow professionally.
good,"Tough, but good supervision. I have not worked there in many years but learned good solid skills that I still use today. Physical, occupational therapy were great at that time."
good,"Working for Health South was an enjoyable time for me in many aspects but, not all. My typical day at work was most of the time a busy day filled with reports, audits, meeting, and assisting the nurses with their overload of tasks. I enjoyed the ability to do patient care and meet with the families. The nurses worked to achieve excellence with patient satisfaction being a key indicator for the past several years.; "
good,"Encompass purchased the small town home health agency I was working for. So far, Encompass has great ideas to move forward. Its hard to give a review when we are still in the transition phase. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency of patients. This could be due living in a smaller town."
good,I enjoy working in HealthSouth. The people there are very friendly and easy going.  Very good team moral. The hardest part of the job would have to be the constant heavy lifting. What I enjoyed most about my position was conversations with the patients
good,"Working at Cancer Center of Guam was an experience. The patients and staff was wonderful. We all worked together as a team and everyone was very compassionate with their job and with the company.  We all had our job to do and I enjoyed being able to help patient and family members with information needed to process their care. "
good,"Management was somewhat unapproachable, company prides itself on promoting from within but hires from outside of company a lot. Most coworkers were hard workers and committed to performing job well."
good,"The job was great, but as PRN was not eligible for raises.  PRN reception jobs were eliminated and replaced by security guards."
good,"Productive and friendly workplace. very patient oriented. cooperative, knowledgeable staff . beautiful campus. cafeteria staff very friendly and the food is reasonable in cost and taste."
good,I always enjoyed working with the other therapist at Health South everyone is so friendly! Have to work one weekend a month.
good,It's A Great Company To Work For and I enjoy the people that I work with...that is why I plan to stay there PRN but looking for other opportunities.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and chance for advancement. Typical day at work consists of seeing 7-10 patients a day. Not much support from Branch Manager or clinical field staff supervisor in our office. Co-workers made this job work. They are excellent! The worst part of the job was having to spend hrs charting at night and having to be on-call nightly.
good,"Excellent therapists who work hard at getting patients back to their activities of daily living."
good,I see anywhere from 5-7  homecare pts. per day .I drive in my own vehicle in alotted zip code regions.I enjoy the independence and making my own schedule per day.
good,"I worked evenings here for a few years. I enjoyed my coworkers. We were allowed to listen to headphones during work, so that made the evening go by faster. We also had flexible hours during a certain shift."
good,"A typical rehabilitation environment.  The focus is on rehabilitation , not nursing.  There are many different types of patients and a knowledgeable staff."
good,"The remote scheduling program trial company was trying to implement became overwhelming.  There were not sufficient workers to make program successful in the actual location, much less when scheduling remotely from Amarillo."
good,A typical day at work for me would be arriving at work for a 7am- 7pm shift receiving my report on patients from the prior shift. I plan out my day with how many showers/baths are on the agenda. I make my rounds introducing myself as their CNA for that shift right along with the nurses by my side. I will perform all the vital signs before each meal and record them in the system for the nurses to access them. I start on my showers/baths and make up their beds with clean sheets and covers. My experience in learning the computer system which is fast and easy. The glucometer machine is just as easy to manage. The coworkers I have come to enjoy is their great teamwork for which in this business is a necessity as well as a plus for making your day go a little bit smoother which I and the patients come to appreciate at the end of day. The hardest part of the job in my experience is when I find myself attached to the patients as I see them go. The most enjoyable moments I have is when I see smiles on the patients and their families faces as I see them walk out the door as I know they have received the best care a team of nurses could ever give to a patient.
good,"I have worked for Health South for almost two years and I am really grateful to have started my nursing career here because Health South offers hands on teaching in a fun and energetic environment and the nurse educator is great. I never feel like I am alone because anytime that I have a question there is always someone available to answer it. Great work family environment. Great company to work for. Great benefits package including 401K, and up to 10K in tuition assistance or loan repayment."
good,"I do not have much to say, I was hired on a contract that ran out of funds. The medical staff are some of the best in Topeka, hours were wonderful, bonuses when we made them truly helped out on gas."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the travel.  A typical day is going out to meet clients in the home.  I learned much about what doctor expect from their clients and how they want us to deliver on-going care in the home and keep the client safe."
good,Work environment allows for optimal growth and continuous challenges that allow for continued education. Various resources(education and tools) support best practice.
good,"working daily as charge nures, made rounds with dr.s and made out discharge instructions, assigned lunches, and removed dr. orders and made sure mars up to date, reviewed labs and called dr.s with changes, made appointments, arranged outside services such as ct, blood transfusions and follow up dr. appointments."
good,"Everyday is an adventure. Enjoy very much the fast paced, busy, energetic nonstop atmosphere. Co-workers are great. Wonderful team players."
good,"A typical day on eve shift was passing meds, giving treatments,supervising care by nurses assistants,putting out fires, and making sure patients followed their precautions as they related to the surgeries they had. I learned that physical rehab and nursing care can bring a weakened pt back from a shell of a person to being whole again! Management was not as hands on as I would have liked. My co workers were great and we worked together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job were the dialysis pts we took care of there. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the patients get better and stronger and able to go home again!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Select Specialty Hospital. I was the only admissions coordinator and felt comfortable and confident in completing my work with little to no supervision. "
good,On a typical day I made anywhere from 50 - 60 collection calls. I learned (then) people do not like being called regarding monies owed. Management with HealthSouth was workable. My co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job was speaking with patients and providers regarding past due bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning it.
good,"Daily management of Nursing, Pharmacy, Respiratory Therapy, Education Department and all outside clinical contracts."
good,Great place to start as a COTA and get free CEUs and increase knowledge for treatments.
good,I enjoyed this environment. Fun staff and different patients everyday. I always had to come up with new fun exercises and loved doing so. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing improvement in the patients. The hardest part of the job was being creative with exercises and ways to make treatment time work. I would have loved to be able to perform more manual treatments. 
good,"12, 10, or 8hr shifts available"
good,"Very challenging and hard work"
good,Excellent starter job for recent graduate
good,"HealthSouth is an enjoyable place to work. The staff are usually willing to work together in a friendly and productive manner. I have learned so much in the little time that I have been with the company and am given a great deal of autonomy in client-care and decision making. I love the client base and age range in which we work with (mostly 55+) and enjoy my daily interactions. Management and Nursing do not always see eye-to-eye, and I would have to say that is the worst part about working with the company. The employee turnover is quite high, but when it comes down to it- I really enjoy my fellow employees and work environment despite the less-than-stellar management."
good,"Many of the co workers are snippy, however when you really get to know them, they are very friendly."
good,"Encompass is very flexible with hours. It's home health so I love the responsiblity of being able to take care of a patient on my own. I have learned how to administer medications via G-Tube. Management is good, they are always available to communicate with. The hardest part of my job is maintaining full responsiblity for the agency's patient. The most enjoyable part of this job is the independence."
good,"A typical day at Health South consists of reviewing admissions, billing, calling insurance companies for payments, and helping patients on the phone. While working at this job I have refreshed old skills. I enjoy working with my management and co-workers at Health South. The hardest part about working at Health South is seeing the elderly that are sent to our hospital knowing they are not going to get any better. The most satisfying part of the job is healping patients to make arrangements on their co-payments."
good,Encompass Health is a family oriented company that allows a great work-life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the atmosphere.
good,I have been at current job for 5 years. I work in med surg/rehab and I am ready to venture into something else. I love the flexibility and PRN pay. I love seeing patients recover and learn to adopt with new disabilities.
good,"I only worked for at the In-patient rehab PRN for a few months but I really enjoyed my time there. I often picked up weekend shifts and the team that I worked with was positive, fun, and focused. It is a clean environment with good management. The EMR is easy to work with and does not take long to learn."
good,"new hires that  start   gets pdo immediatley,you can  work there for 5 months and get a 1 week vacation ,so thats good for some.... you work at your own pace"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was patient satisfaction.  Watching a patient coming into the hospital unable to walk and leaving walking out.  This was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Watching a patient with all of the employees help doing their job helping the patient with all aspects of therapy, insurance verification, discharge planning, house keeping and dietary help the patient while in the hospital to get  better and to be able to go home."
good,"The managers are helpful, will give you the opportunity to grow in areas that you would like to be trained in. You can learn a lot about medical billing and gain useful admin-type experience, but the pay isn’t great for the level of specialized skills you’ll need to learn, compared to similar jobs it’s on the low end. Culture is great, coworkers are friendly and helpful, lots of catering and fun events."
good,"When I came to Encompass Health, it was on the rise to where it is now. Management has gone through three administrations since I was there. However, the family culture of Encompass is impeccable. Although they are very short in staff, many of the workers will step in to help. Overall, everyone is genuinely nice. Love the ppl at Encompass Health.  But change is necessary for others to stay."
good,company cares about employees and patients. many locations make transferring easy. company is communicative and pays fairly well. Staff seems knowledgeable and willing to work as a team.
good,Overall everybody in patient care focuses all their energy on their patients. Those who are required to care about numbers are more concerned about filling those hospital beds than if the patient is suited for rehabilitation.
good,"Encompass has a huge print media budget.  They have great programs and a lot of materials."
good,Good generally this is a good company to work for. I would work here again.they value employee education and career advancement. Many branches so if you like it is possible to move

good,"Directors effectively communicate and try to keep staff in the loop, and well taken care of during high census. Overall good environment and processes."
good,"I loved my job at HealthSouth. Unfortunately, my hours were based on census and were not consistent. My facility was new and was plagued by a high turnover in upper management."
good,"Great company culture- down side - no advancement opportunities."
good,Great leadership and training. Staff worked well together as a team. Patient care was always most important to all medical staff. Someone was always willing to help if you had a question.
good,"A typical day at HealthSouth is fast paced, I learned to prioritize while paying attention to many details, management could use some improvement but where available when needed. The culture varied making it a diverse place to work. The hardest part of the job was working understaffed, the most enjoyable part of the job, outside of financial benefits was leaving work feeling like I had a purpose. I loved working within HealthSouth's team."
good,My boss is wonderful. Most of the people are great. I enjoy talking with patients and their families. I think that HealthSouth wants to grow and improve however they can
good,"Great place to learn for new people to the field.   Staff are friendly, and there is family sense of unity.   It is healthcare so has a tendency to be stressful."
good,"High paced"
good,"I did not leave because of Encompass issues.  I retired to spend time with my family. "

good,Overall the hospital has very good outcomes for its patients.  Staff is good to work with. Always striving for patient satisfaction.

good,"Great environment for a new graduate nurse. Nursing staff very willing to help eachother out, and my preceptor was very helpful. Great pay, and benefits package for nurses."
good,"I enjoy working at Health South, if I could go full time I would! The staff is friendly. The patients are happy with their private rooms and feel like guests versus patients."
good,"when I first started working at Healthsouth, i had the proper training, and when new employees were hired, I was able to train them. I would prep food for breakfast, cut up fruits, prep salads,meal on wheels,check tray line, serve lunch to patient, guest, and employees. after about 2 years working in the kitchen, i asked the dietitian, Susie, at that time, if i could work in the office with her, and learn more about patient diets, I was so excited when i was offered the position, typical day greeting new patients, learning about them and their diet, assisting patient with menu selection, calorie counts, answered phone, tray set up for breakfast, lunch, sometimes dinner, try line for breakfast, lunch, sometimes dinner, talked with doctors and therapists regarding patient upgrade or downgrade of patient diets, i have learned about patient rights and different diets there are that i did not know about, i was able to work with management on many occasions with catering, there was no hard part of the job, everyday was a new experience, getting to meet new patients, family members, and talking with co workers, when I first started working at Healthsouth,"
good,Great place to work and learn new skills from the Registered Nurses and Therapists. Pleasant and polite working environment.  Great benefits and discounts.
good,"Encompass is a great company that really cares about its patients and it's employees. They give lots of paid vacation days a year to give employees a chance to relax. However, they will work you hard and a person has to be self motivated and organized to do well there. Communication skills are also important because there are usually several different people providing different cares for one patient. For example, a patient may be seen by an RN, an LPN, a PT and a CNA. All in all, if an individual is willing to work hard and enjoys caring for people in a company with a great culture they'll do well at Encompass."
good,Great benefits but you will definitely have high stress. Demanding work environment and expectations. Good opportunity to learn and lead with this company.
good,"its a well maintained hospital just not enough hours and prn does not get benefits nor raises."
good,"High standards and expectations with difficult  job work/ life balance."
good,"Moved to this Small Accounting office because my previous job was eliminated."

good,"I really enjoyed being at HealthSouth. I do Feel it needs to be updated and ""grow"". But over all , people are amazing and I would go back there in a heartbeat (It was just a temporary job at this the time."
good,"I loved working at Health South, unfortunately there were a lot of ""Nursing Clicks."""
good,"The environment of the job was wonderful. I love everyone I work with. No one is rude, and I always get assistance when I was having trouble with something. Everyone seems to work as a team to get our objective done efficiently."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of making a difference in people's lives! Hardest part of the job is making referral goal to bonus in ramp up period.
good,"Come in early, count the cash drawer, perform all money transactions with customers, usher customers to tables, perform togo orders. other tasks are done throughout the day such as bussing tables, sweeping floors, and occasionally waiting on tables."
good,Your day goes very fast because you are constantly moving!! The place is very clean & is well stocked with supplies. Staff is helpful & work well together. Need to work as a time or your day can be terrible. Patients are on a tight therapy schedule! Physicians are very nice & easy to talk to.

good,"Team concept is excellent.  High stress at times, busy offices."
good,As a CTC I meet the patients at bedside to be sure they are transitioned home properly.  I also market our agency to case managers and other referral sources.
good,Therapy excellent with patient outcomes. Nursing staff knowledgeable and caring. Employees work as a team to help pts accomplish goals to go home. Rewarding career.
good,Everyone was very helpful when I had a question or needed help to do my job.  It was a family atmosphere with a great group of people to work with. I would work for them again.
good,"I loved working here for the most part, especially with my original crew at night. We were very in sync & always had one another's back in regards to patient care & giving a hand to one another. Day people can be a bit clicky but overall they care about their patients. Work was usually fast paced with some downtime at times but that's all workplaces. I had a car accident and had not been there long enough for FMLA, so I had to take personal leave. Of course I had no choice but I also knew my job could be filled & indeed it was, a big disappoint!"
good,great place to work and great learning experience to gain knowledge of how administration comes together to solve issues and create plans to better the company
good,This is a great company to work for. They thrive on patient care and will provide any additional education for their workers to assure it. They are a faith based company .
good,"Walking on the floor seeing smiling faces; they would say that they was happy to see their relief come in but it was more then that. The employees are really great people and we did all we could and then some for our patients. My managers, including charge nurses and DON was really interested in what's going on in your life and would always give encouraging words of advice and support if they could. The hardest part was leaving my co-workers and patients when I moved to another state because I know I would never find people like them."
good,It was rewarding to see patients' improvements. The most challanging part was the admission process.  I looked forward to seeing almost all of the staff.
good,I drove a handicap van and picked up patients and brought them in for therapy and returned them either to the hospital or to their homes I was a on call driver when needed and never failed to respond on any day they called me in.
good,"HealthSouth is an enjoyable place where nurses,PT technicians,rehab technicians work day in day out to make patients and family members have their best experience in healthcare."
good,"Overall, fantastic company.  Level of intensity is elevated on monitoring and IT capabilities.  Everything can be monitored and analyzed.  Benefits are awesome!  The only negative is that they sold my hospital and gave us six weeks notice, then two weeks prior to sale was completed they advised that my position wouldn't transition to the new company.  Would think that a senior director level position would warrant more advanced notice than that.  That having been said, the severance was adequate."
good,"A typical day at work varies from day to day.  The hardest part of the job, is seeing the patients in pain. Most enjoyable part of the job, is seeing the patients return home."
good,Great place to work for if you are okay with working long hours with documentation and scheduling. Great ethics and patient care-focused.
good,"Healthsouth Rehabilitation Hospital is a great place to work and hone your skills as a nurse with focus on rehab patients. Most patients are post operative, stroke, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries patients. Patients stay roughly 1-2 weeks and are rehabilitated to a higher functioning level. Your role as a nurse is to care for them medically and most importantly educate patients to adapt to their new lifestyle."
good,"An ethical company that is quite current in technology and culture. High expectations for organization, electronic communication and extrapolation of instruction. San Antonio office is very pleasant, efficient in its staff. Hardest and most enjoyable part of job are the same: inconsistent work load: days of 4 hours of work followed by days of 14 hours of work."
good,"Big facility with enough space for group rehabilitation. My colleagues were definitely a team, and were awesome to work with. The immediate management was great and allowed us to flexibility to be innovative in our treatment plans. They offered on site seminars for CEUs and online ones as well."
good,The benefits package was exceptional! Especially being offered benefits for part time employment! However housekeeping was frequently under staffed.
good,"The work flow is steady and, for the most part, consistent. Everyone is always willing to help or answer questions. This company has changed from when I first started. They are striving to work as a team and really bring out costumer service to their patients. The environment can be very stressful at times but the managers try to keep the energy positive and they always jump in and are willing to help.   "
good,Excellent therapists who care for their patients.  They learn new techniques and use quality equipment.  The patients really want to rehabilitate and work hard to regain health.
good,Management is respectful & simply have standards for employees which is wonderful when ensuring clients needs are met. Only down side is on call requirements for someone who is a single parent with children. Not a lot of room to advance.
good,This organization was an awesome place to work and thrive.  The staff was like extended family and our focus was customer service to ensure that the clients were satisfied with their stay.
good,"Encompass Home Health is a very good company to work for,  Just like any other company, there are its advantages and disadvantages. We provide skilled services such as skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to patients that are being discharged from a skilled facility or that may have recently visited their physician.  I call on Dr's offices and skilled facilities marketing our services and such as nursing, therapy and disease specific program showing how we are able to have a positive impact on their patients health and also how we can keep out of the hospital and at home which is more conducive to healing.  As a part of marketing, we are responsible for educating on Medicare and various insurance regulations.  This position also consists of cold calling, relationship building, account maintenance, and problem solving. The  home health industry is currently going through challenges due to the managed Medicare insurances, but continues education to our referral sources help to overcome these challenges. The thing that I enjoy about my job is seeing patients progress in there health."
good,"I found working in a hospital environment great. Great people and great hours and excellent benefits. Although I found a higher paying job, sometimes I look back and think I should have stayed at this job."
good,Great place for rehabilitation. Benefits and pay are awesome.
good,"Enjoyed being part of team who worked together to get things done.  Worked in three areas of the hospital as a purchasing assistant, data entry clerk, and medical records clerk.  The jobs were very straightforward as you learned your required duties.  I enjoyed the fact that you were always busy which allowed your day to pass quickly."
good,"Very talented therapists, very cohesive teams. Productive and good outcomes for our patients."
good,I was able to gain so much experience here but it was a difficult job working in an environment with many obstacles when management was changing so much
good,"Worked from 7:00am -3:30pm Monday- Friday with some weekend coverage. Dressing programs 7am-8:30 am with documentation time. Treatment in the clinic started at 9am-11am. Documentation time from 11 am-11:30 with half hour lunch. 12pm - 1pm lunch group . The afternoon treatments in the clinic start at 1pm and go until 3pm. Documentation from 3pm until 3:30pm."
good,Staff is friendly and helpful. Nurse patient ratio is fair.
good,I loved helping the patients recover and get back on there feet after a surgery or accident.  I learned a lot about nursing and bed side manner.  My co-workers did not always pull there weight but I still looked forward to going to work every day.  The staff and the patients made that happen.
good,"Every place has it ups and downs, but I truly enjoy working at Healthsouth. Acute rehabilitation is such an amazing area of nursing we care for so many types of diagnosis, watching patients recover and head home is very rewarding."
good,"Solidified my knowledge, understanding and utilization of modalities learned in school.  Always a fun environment working with other therapists and meeting hundreds of new people all the time."
good,To be able to be part of rehabbing a stroke to wallking out the door... priceless
good,"looking for full time employment, i left encompass home health as a PRN case manager which was to spartic."
good,"Liaison job was fun, stressful at times. too much driving execessive texting, emails from the director."
good,"testing patients,verified workers comp ins,schedules, sent out "
good,A mangement team that works exceptionally well together to meet the overall goals of the hospital. Inviting and patient centered care. I gained a great deal of understanding of the financial aspects of a hospitital from the most incredible CFO.  The hardest part of my job there is balancing staff with ever changing census.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with patients and seeing them progress until they can go home.  The other most enjoyable part of my job is being a part of a wonderful group of CNO's in the SouthWest Region.
good,"As a unit clerk, there isn't much typical about any day but the variety of tasks I may be asked to complete. I am always learning new terminology and medications. My co-workers are great, I wish I could bring them with me! The hardest part of the job is trying to do everything for everyone at the same time, but the best part is the sense of accomplishment when I do just that."
good,Good place to work. Flexibility in my schedule. Specialized in stroke rehab.
good,Very hard yet very rewarding place to work. Good place to get in and get your feet wet in the rehabilitation industry.
good,"A very fastpaced working invironment, but friendly co-workers makes invironment managable. working for Encompass I have learned that business is business and you cannot take it personally. Upper management very intuned to employees needs and try very hard to make working here enjoyable. Hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone else happy with their own job satisfaction. Most enjoyable part of this job was my coworkers!"
good,Ok place to work if working conditions were improved for everyone.
good,Culture is positive to work in. Pay could be a little more competitive compared to others. The work life balance is dependent on which role you are currently involved in with the company.
good,"This was my far my favorite company to work for. I would stay if we didnt move 500 miles away. Staff felt like family, CEO would work the floor as well as marketing and making you feel like you were valued and mattered. The job itself was rewarding for the care of those in need.. There was potential for advancement."
good,Productivity demands and driving are not fairly weighted at times.  I put in more hours driving and demands to do all paperwork in the home is not best for the patient a lot of times.
good,"Able to work with a varied population, multi-diagnosis. Good exposure to socio-economic challenging situations. Relaxed environment, never worked off the clock."
good,The overall staff are focused on the patient and the care to get the patient back on track is the goal of rehabilitation center. A 70 bed facility working with both the family and patient to be able to leave the hospital stronger and on the road to a better life.
good,"Was interesting working with the therapist, did alot of blood work"
good,"WELL ESTABLISHED COMPANY, tuition reimbursement, great managers. Retirement program , teamwork  and education is always available. HR is available for any concerns."
good,"A typical work day starts with meetings as hurdle."
good,A team environment that promotes learning and growth. A innovative company that is huge on patient satisfaction. Dedicated staff who love what they do!
good,"Clean friendly environment. Extensive work load. Not balanced. The overall position was not hard, the management changed without clear understanding of staff needs versus client needs."
good,I choose to work here in my 3rd semester of nursing school and that was one of the best choices I could've made. I had never worked in a rehab setting and that was something I had to get use to. For the most part though I really like it and would recommend others to work for them.
good,Enjoyed working here. Flexible with school schedule. Management was helpful. Turnover was high at times. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Overall not a bad place to work
good,"I am currently a rehab liaison in the admissions office. I love what I do and I have the best coworkers, manager and director."
good,"A typical work day starts by cleaning the physical therapy gym and placing blankets on tables for therapy use. Followed by working a section of the hospital to transport patient from their room to the gym and vice versa. This includes break periods of helping the Physical Therapists in certain exercises. The day goes by fast because you're always busy. All my co workers are friendly and willing to work together to help a patient. The hardest part of my job is providing the highest of quality time with patients, due to face paced daily schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people recover from their injuries."
good,I had a very short history with this company.  I did seem like it was a nice place to work.  The staff was cohesive.  I don;t know what a hard day was like.
good,its was a good company to work for. i learn a lot of thing working there. the mangers worked with you a lot and everybody helped out if you needed it help on some.
good,"Pay could definitely be better in comparison to the workload.                                    "
good,"I like my job and benefits, just looking to relocate. Above average pay for clinical positions. Good benefits with multiple tiers for your choice. can buy stock but no discount for employee purchase."
good,"I enjoyed the challenge. I preferred being a liaison instead of a staff nurse position. Nurse patient ratio is ridiculous, however, it's within regulations."
good,There is an opportunity to learn from different patient populations as well as working with nurses of all levels.  The physicians in general support the nurses ideas for improvement in care.
good,"I worked PRN on Tuesday nights and on the weekends, so there wasnt really a whole lot for me to do aside from the med run. I ultimately decided that being a pharmacy technician wasnt for me, so I left."
good,"Both offices were very busy. Loved all the staff and the management. As prqi, in the fw office, the downside was having to take call so often. Education provided."
good,I worked in a very fast paced environment as a case manager and I did all the discharge planning for my two units and all the utilization reviews for the insurance company and I also took call. I worked long hours but enjoyed the work. I had a wonderful boss
good,Working in Health South San Juan PR for more than 13 years was a great experience. Health South cares about being at the forefront in benefit of the rehabilitation of its patients
good,HealthSouth was my first place of employment after graduating as a Physical Therapist Assistant.  The facility was top of the line.  My co-workers were excellent clinicians and mentors.
good,"good rehab departments , clean, efficient, friendly staff, modern equipment available to therapist for treatments.  good pt to therapist ratio, good benefits, computer charting"
good,"A good place to work with a supportive environment. "
good,"My time at Healthsouth Lakeview Rehab Hospital was one of much learning. It was a very high-paced, sometimes stressful position. But, it did teach me many valuable lessons that I will take with me for the rest of my life."
good,A typical day is very busy. Time is spent with patients ensuring that they are stable and safe. The interaction is amazingly fulfilling. Patient care is really what nursing is all about.
good,healthsouth was a great company to work for I met some great nurses and physicians. It was my first job in the healthcare area and I learned a lot about assisting patients with strokes and other health issues. I found great pleasure in assisting the patients there.
good,"Great job, honest people, good working environment. Management is tremendous with stability that you don't find at many places. This is a team working environment that holds absolute structure."
good,As in all companies there are good managers and great managers.  There is also a moderate amount of activities during the year to show employee appreciation.
good,"Encompass has a good education program.  "
good,"just an incredible location to work. excellent environment to grow your skill set with all types of diagnoses ranging from, traumatic brain injury to hip replacement."
good,Enjoyed my work as well as my co-workers. Was able to obtain my Billing and Coding certification paid. Learned many valuable skills for furthering my opportunities.
good,"I really enjoyed working with my coworkers,  most of the employees there are great people.  great benefits and manager was flexible with schedule if needed."
good,"customer service oriented, good transitional position for professional growth in medical field, good source of learning techniques when  done corretly"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of caring for 8 to 13 patients with varied health issues and needs."
good,"The work level is very high in terms of accounts to be worked on, which leads to somewhat high stress levels. There are many wonderful people employed at Encompass Health. I do feel that management cares about their employees."
good,"good place to learn, every case is there. from simple wound dressing to wound vacuum, simple breathing treatment to trach pt. it is up to you  how you get the most of it."
good,I worked at the Healthsouth installation of cityview and believed it to be a great opportunity for learning an establishing working competence. I would suggest this facility to others.
good,I was a student here and the environment was pretty fast paced but I enjoyed it.  I learned a lot from every person who worked there.  All staff were friendly and worked together.
good,I enjoyed working with this inpatient rehabilitation team. I worked with patients of all pages from 18-thru 105. It was a inpatient rehab facility with a great rehab team.
good,"I've worked at two locations: the first was fantastic therefore I am rating that one with the stars (Spring Hill, FL). The second was the polar opposite and I will refrain from elaborating (Tallahassee); however, my worst decision of my entire life was transferring to that facility. Benefits: I was PRN so no benefits; otherwise, they're not too shabby. Good company but again location varies -- if you go in and there is a low census, don't bother accepting the job as they will just destaff you repeatedly and flip around and try to call you in on your days off. Hardest part of the job is trying to answer multiple call lights at once and providing showers while those call lights are going off. Another hard part of the job is receiving report from people that just want to go home so they half butt it. The best part of the job is the patients for the most part. Good breaks, nice facility, great coworkers, outstanding management."
good,Really enjoyed working here.I was given the chance to enhance families lives at their most vulnerable.  I really appreciated the freedom and choices I was given.
good,Love the people and the environment.  Great benefits and management.  They really do believe in educating their sales team on the programs the company utilizes.
good,"I enjoyed working at health south rehabilitation hospital since it was "
good,"As a Rehab Tech at HealthSouth, I had a good experience.  It is always face-paced which I preferred in a job environment.  The therapy team worked well together."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. It was a team effort for the most part. The patients are great. I felt that I could stand behind the company and that we were truly helping people, which unfortunately is difficult to find in healthcare."
good,"Great place to work prior to entering PT school for the experience, variety of diagnoses and ability to work with a variety of disciplines.  Enjoyed the challenges"
good,nice place to work. staff teamwork. flexible hours. management willing to work with your personal life schedule. I don't have anything else to say in my review.
good,"good communication among therapist and departments  always looking for ways to incorporate community and the other medical facilities "
good,Direct care of patients as well as contact with physicians as needed to update patient condition changes.  Assign duties to oncoming staff. Update concoming shift of changes. Monitor building security and equipment.
good,I loved working at Encompass Health Care It was a very good Job. when I sold my interest in the company to start another company. great staff good place to work
good,"Worked for Healthsouth both Scottsdale and Mesa location for 5 years. It had it's good days and bad days. Some staff are harder to work with than others but for the most part staff is extremely nice to work with. Management is more concerned with numbers than pleasing staff. But pretty good team work, especially on night shift. Pay was not enough for me but they did offer a lot of overtime due to high turn over and great benefits 401k, paid holidays etc. Working as a rehab tech I did not make over $14 an hour and that is the reason for leaving, otherwise I probably would be there still. If you go to work to work and stay focused then you'll have a great day, but if you go with a negative attitude or just no motivation then you'll definitely have a hard time. rehab techs usually get 6-8 patients during the day and 8-10 at night. The same goes for nurses unless you're a primary nurse then you'll end up having 4-5 patients with no tech. 12 hour shifts, 3 shifts a week."
good,"IF you love a place that is fast pass but love new rehab things this is your place. Typical day varied on what shifted you worked, 12 hour shifts make your own schedule"
good,It was a wonderful feeling to help patients rehab and recover from tragic events; I learned a lot of new skills and gained more experience in routine skills.
good,"manager of rehab showed genuine concern for being an effective leader, always let staff know where they stand, what to expect from the company and the direction of the rehab setting at that facility;  provided point of service documentation and treatment in the acute rehab setting"
good,"Nice atmosphere and friendly coworkers.  Never a dull moment."
good,"Excellent facility, competitive yet supportive co-workers with room for advancement.  Supportive of continued education and certification to further career."
good,Wonderful place to work. I really enjoy my coworkers and supervisors. There is a positive and caring atmosphere. I will certainly miss working here when I go back to school.
good,"take care of patients,liaison between patients families and physicians,new admits,discharges,and working with case workers and other staff at Healthsouth."
good,"My manager was very nice, days at the office were slow but relaxed, I learned a lot about filing and rehabilitation services. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers."
good,"Healthsouth is a great place to work"
good,This was a per-diem job in Radiology working for a Rehabilitation facility.  I learned to help with feeding people that was one of their therapies.  I also helped nursing with patients
good,"I love the patients and the people i work for and with.  Excellent environment.   They are always willing to work with you on life situations.  Management is excellent, you present them with a problem and they all get together with you to help resolve the issue."

good,this is a place where coworker are good at team work and i love helping patients become betterMany employers do not provide health insurance but healthsouth does provide.
good,Great company! They offered a good balance between work and leisure time. The benefits were competitive with other hospitals in the region. I would recommend them for employment.
good,Operates above the bar when many HH companies do not. Outcomes driven. They genuinely care about the patients they serve. Lots of turnover which is typical in this industry.
good,"Repetitious but very gratifying, I first learned how to floor tech there. The management was great with job structure and leadership but could have been more fair to others. This job came easy for me, and my most enjoyable was making sure my job was done right. I pride myself on my work and meeting the patients, their stories we great to listen to I learned a lot from them."
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. Great education with a few bad apples that have since chose other jobs. Hard to balance work life and personal life.
good,Nice and team player. Always smile and remember patient is number 1. You are quick to move up as long as you a good worker with excellent customer service
good,"Wherever you go, there will always be something to complain about, but I thoroughly enjoy working at HealthSouth Broken Arrow.  It is a fast-paced and friendly environment, workload is not that bad at all, and there is some excellent team work and support coming form our nurse techs!"
good,"I work with amazing people and am lucky to have one of the best bosses around. With that being said, the family dynamic and patient population make it both physically and mentally fatiguing. I do feel limited in my ability to advance through the company and feel the pay compensation could be higher."
good,"i now work in the kitchen because they are not hiring pt technicians"
good,"Workplace culture is great. "
good,"Health south is a great place to work. I enjoy working with the rehabilitation patients, they are kind and you can learn a lot from talking with them."
good,"I worked for HS in Tyler and Texarkana, and I really enjoyed the this type of nursing as well.  Each company had very great directors and HR that were very professional and competent.  Of all my jobs, especially staring off my career as an LVN, I learned the most at this company.  My knowledge and skills improved immensely.  I had complete trust in the team I worked with on the floor.  We had to work understaffed a fair number of times, and it required very good communication and delegation skills."
good,HealthSouth was a typical inpatient rehab hospital. The medical director was very supportive of the rehab staff and valued our opinions during meeting about the patient's.
good,"love the people that I worked with, they work as a team and are very knowledgeable of their roles. It is a small setting and very educational, the nurses are wonderful and I am delighted to have been in their presents."
good,"Healthsouth has a great team that strives to work together throughout your shift. They give you a lot of chances for growth within the facility, which is great!"
good,A typical day at work was kind of stressful but also worth it. The best part for me would deffinately be interacting with the patients and knowing that they had everything they need.
good,My experience there at HealthSouth was a good one you were always busy. Everyday was a different experience you would meet new people every shift some were amazing with amazing stories some just wanted to be left alone you always were on your feet. The nurses were so nice and were willing to help you if you didn't understand.

good,"Depending on your role, the day to day can be hectic simply because of the amount of admissions/discharges. The company is very active in taking over other businesses within the same field and growing it portfolio. The investment in their employees is awesome, they truly believe in development and provide many opportunities, if you are willing to take advantage of them. The benefits are better than any other hospitals I have worked for, truly night and day difference."

good,I received a lot of experience at this facility. FIM scoring and second shift work just didn't work out for me. Others seem to love their job and have no issues.
good,Your day begins with your assigned patients. You make your own schedule. I learned a great deal while working with my Patients. Management was very helpful and pleasant. Hardest part of the job was the travel and losing a patient. The most enjoyable part was having the time to actually take good care of and teach the patient and family.
good,The only complaints that I have about this company is that the pay is not adequate for the job that is performed and that the company will over work its employees for not much compensation.
good,"A typical day starts with getting reports and assessing your assigned patients,  It is a nice environment to utilize your nursing skills."
good,Learned tom work as a team with the nurses and physical therapist. The nursing staff was well knowledgeable and worked well with the respiratory department to help patients.

good,seeing the elderly patients smile and me knowing I did a good job taking care of them. management is good. the hardest part is when they die.
good,Health South is a great hospital. The service and everything they did for the patients was at a very high professional level if I had to volunteer there again I would.
good,"Great place to work! Don't prefer a salary position....too many hours for same pay...turns into less pay, if you do your job thoroughly."
good,Working in a hospital is different than a restaurant but it has many of the same features.  I learned how to budget and portion and had to learn everyone's different dietary needs.  Management and co-workers were good.  The hardest part was learning the different dietary needs but it was also the most enjoyable putting a smile on their face.
good,I have worked at HealthSouth for almost 5 years.  I began as a per-diem pharmacist and worked my way up to Director of Pharmacy.  I love my team mates in the pharmacy.  We are like a family.  We work well  with the nursing staff  and provide a great service to staff and also to our patients.

I got really sick, and they were very accommodating to help me where they could."
good,"HealthSouth Provided a great inpatient experience for me. I was able to manage patients with CVA, multitrauma, Parkinsons, and much more."
good,This is one of the final jobs I held while completing undergraduate school. This job was much more relaxed as I dealt more with customers and was able to provide them with fun/creative way to prepare fruits and vegetables.
good,"Typical day at HealthSouth is caring for the patients getting vitals. blood sugars and helping patients with activity of daily living. I learned working alone can be stressful but can deal with the stress."
good,There was not really a hard part to the job because I enjoy helping others. Everyone worked together as a team. Management listened if there was any issues.
good,Encompass Home Health is a great place to work at. They offer the best training and working tools to aid you in your profession. Great benefits and great people/employees.

good,"While I was employed at Health South Rehabilitation Center of Macomb, it was a very busy clinic. I enjoyed working with the staff there and truly enjoyed my job."
good,Great place to work but the pay isn't that good. The people you work with are amazing but the hospital scene came before upsetting at times.
good,I like always learning new things. Everyday was different. Sometimes very stressful because customers were rude !!!
good,"Currently working as a Respiratory therapist prn, usually the weekends. Coworkers are easy to work with and try to be helpful. The nursing staff are easy to get along with and try to help RT with their job when possible. Manager tries to work with employees and scheduling. Hardest part of the job is pushing a 200+ pound computer on wheels around to chart at bedside. The best part of the job is seeing the patients improve enough to go home."

I have learned that our patients are number one and we supply their needs much as possible. The company have an outstanding management team they are there to listen to us also any ideas we have we may share it with them.  My co- workers are team players we help each other out where needed the company highly stress this to have good satisfaction to our patients. I really don't have anything to say hard about my job but sometimes the patients cant do certain things for them self's so I will help much as possible.  My most enjoyable part is seeing the patients improve from there stay such as walking, speaking correctly and been able to return home and getting back to their normal life."
good,"I love working with patients and making a difference in peoples lives. I want to relocate back home to Ga. This is where my family lives. I love Health South Rehab Hospital and would stay with this company, if I was not relocating. I take care of seven to nine patients daily.

You coordinate with the nursing staff and the patient/family to go over discharge issues and solutions. Depending on the day, there will be a staffing among the interdisciplinary team to discuss patients barriers to discharge. The rest of the day is spent updating patients and families on their status and also finalizing plans for tomorrow discharges."
good,A fun and exciting place to work. its has its busy times but that is what makes the job so interesting. With each day you never know what you're going to encounter.
good,My work experience was pleasant at Healthsouth and other staff members were easy to get along with. I was not getting enough hours to financially support myself
good,I worked for this company nearly 5 years and would have worked there longer.  I left no b/c I was disatisfied but to help start-up another dept at a different company.  I worked some of the greatest people and had the best supervisors.

Management was excellent in delegating and mentoring.  Hardest part of job was redirecting nurses for patient care once in field hard to contact them, however the use of PDA helped to contact them.  Most enjoyable part of job satisfaction of healing of resident and discharging to become functional part of community."
good,Always an upbeat atmosphere. Learn a lot about other departments besides just your own. Management is awesome. Co workers are friendly. The hardest thing about my job is going home.

good,Providing patient care under the supervision of Registered Nurses. 
good,"very busy and well organized.  I was able to develop new treatment strategies from the complex cases I worked with, management was pleasant, PT's were good to work with but the PTA's were difficult.  The hardest part of the job was the breakdown of of (L) ankle and injury to R required I take a leave for multiple surgeries.  The most enjoyable was the patient care and the doctors I worked with."
good,"too much driving, had to drive over 150 per day typically and had too many schedule changes"
good,worked there many years ago and no one I know is there anymore.
good,Excellent facility with physicians from Mayo Clinic who supervise team and patients. Close relationship with nursing and excellent cooperation within.
good,"tough job, long hours, lots of on call, money can be made if you want to give up your life... Totally unrealistic scheduleing."
good,Large office which a lot of people to get to know. Phone call from patients that needs information on the care they received. Calls to insurance companies to get payment or to get pre-auth. Management is fair. Co-workers were friendly and easy to talk to and to solve any issues that come up. The hardest part of the job I would say some of the patients that do not understand their insurance coverage. Working with different types of systems.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. Good enviroment,really nice people. Ideal location for me at that time."
good,"Satisfying job, good people to work with, and see people progress towards their goal and go back home."
good,"Typical day at work is admitting new patients to the floor and evaluating current patients with collaboration of doctors to see if the patients are independent enough to be discharged to their place of living. I have learned many things from this career opportunity because I have the flexibility of being a charge nurse and learning management problems and strategies. I also have the opportunity of being a floor nurse at times to interact with the patients and family on a continuous basis. The most difficult part of the job has to be the shortage of staff. At times, a shortage a staff may cause a stressful environment and put more pressure on the staff. The most rewarding part of the this job has to be observing patients progress from being completely dependent on staff to perform actives of daily living to becoming completely independent."
good,I assisted billers with their daily responsibilities. Organized patient charts. Filed patient charts. Helped with claim follow up.Took calls from patients and insurance companies.

good,It was a decent job. The other therapists were committed to providing quality patient care. I made $60/hour as a PRN PT. It is 8 hour days. The nurses are overworked and stressed.
good,"If you are wanting to work in an environment that is centered around PT, OT, and SLP rehabilitation, this is a great place. There are issues within the hospital, but nothing out of the ordinary for a corporation/hospital."
good,"Busy, growing into their name change, and great management and co-workers. They were willing to train, and critique work/tasks, and very friendly on every level of profession in facility."

good,Great place to work and plenty of opportunities for advancement and they have hospitals all over if you need to relocate. The benefits packages are great.
good,Great company.  Office Moved from Buckhead to Sandy Spring and the distance is length. You would have to hold down alot positions since the company is new and growing.
good,A place where you focus on rehabilitation so you learn a lot and at the same time you are helping patients to have a rapid recovery is fascinating when a patient despite his pain tries to do the therapy
good,"Very good work atmosphere, staff really cares about their patients. I would definitely work at another Healthsouth due to my experience here. Really good teamwork among the staff."
good,I started off as a floor nurse then moved into the middle management role. I learned the importance of each departments role in the hospital. It was amazing to see how the entire company operated as one entity. The workplace culture can vary from one hospital to the other; even though it's all the same company. The work load is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and perks.
good,"Pleasant place to work. Face pace most of the time, made many keepsake friends. Enjoy my job, advancement available. Learned a lot, good benefit, employee had a voice."
good,Encompass is rated on the Forbes list as top places to work in America. It is a great overall company. The Jacksonville branch is fairly new and there is great room for improvement. It has the potential to be the top home health provider.

good,Balanced place to work. Everyone works together. Great rehabilitation hospital. Patients come in with alot of issues and leave ninty eight percent improved.
good,"Although the pay at HealthSouth is not the highest in the industry, the benefits are good. PTO, CEU monies of 1000 per year for us therapists, and a great work environment are all reasons why I work here."
good,"Therapy staff all work very well together; a cohesive unit which benefits the patients. There is longevity of therapy staff however a much higher turnover within the nursing department. It's a very fast paced Rehab setting The hospital is a free standing hospital so there are none of the typical departments that are usually seen in a hospital (ICU, ER)"
good,"Great place to work, Co-workers were like family.  Patients were there for Rehabilitation.  It was a pleasure to watch their progress from admission to been discharged to their homes and knowing I was a part of it."
good,"This was a great place to work and I learned a great deal about the world of therapy in my time there. It is a stroke certified hospital so that is a large majority of the population that you see, but every diagnosis imaginable comes through this hospital. The staff is great and works well together to provide great patient care."
good,"not what I expected when I took the job.  I was shocked when I got finished with orientation and started on the floor.  WOW... busy!!  My med/surg experience is put to use every day.  Not a nursing home!! which is good. "
good,I love the family environment at Healthsouth.  Everyone knows you and appreciate the hard work you put in at Healthsouth.
good,"I loved working for this company.  I had to resign my position as a result of my move to Oklahoma.   In my position, I maintained all office management and provided support for the Case Managers.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the closeness of the staff and management. It was truly a family feel."
good,"Work along side other therapy disciplines, nursing, case management and doctors to develop comprehensive and effective therapy plans to rehabilitate patients with serious medical and physical barriers. The goal is to get our patients home and taking care of themselves again while decreasing caregiver burden as much as possible."
good,"Great place to help people and watch them improve. We worked three  twelve hour shifts, which is good because you have four days off."
good,"Great co-workers, positive atmosphere, amazing administration! I go to work happy and come home happy, win-win! There is always room to learn more and grow as a therapist. I love how encouraging and helpful everyone is!"
good,"Management is creative, employees seemed happy, Staff is educated and enthusiastic, further education is encouraged,  staff input welcomed and encouraged, staff works well together. Rehabilitation well done and able to care for all ages.  They have pool therapy which they utilize often. Centrally located. HealthSouth has a good reputation overall and in many locations. Company is comitted to community served. I really enjoyed serving on community safety board which was requested by supervisor for company outreach."
good,This is an excellent place to work. Very diverse culture. Hard working team members willing to help each other out. The only downfall is being short staffed at times.
good,"I have worked for HealthSouth for 12 years. The coworkers are team players. The management could pay attention to staffing a little closer, but overall not terrible. It is very rewarding to see patient progress and work with such fantastic PT, OT, ST, Nursing and housekeeping staff. RT's were the best team you could work with."
good,"answer call lights, med pass, do prescribed treatments, if a patient is being sent out to Hospital help Rn with  necessary paperwork, clerical work, strive to keep patient satisfaction scores high"
good,The best part of the job was the team work and how well the employee worked together for the well being of the entire floor of patients all were assigned to on 3rd shift. Hardest part was getting enough sleep since it was 3rd shift only 3 days a week. Hard to get on a schedule working nights.
good,"Of course too much paper work and not enough time with patients, but that is to be expected anywhere in healthcare.  The Albuquerque facility is phasing out LPNs.  Which is ashamed since I helped orient some of the new grad nurses they are hiring.  They are replacing LPNs that quit with Newly licensed RNs."
good,My overall experience has been positive in all aspects. I started as a staff nurse and advanced to Nurse Manager. I loved my coworkers and enjoyed out daily interactions. The physicians were approachable and more than willing to teach.
good,"Healthsouth is a great place to work -- great managment and team work. Healthsouth is corporate company that looks out for their employees' well-being. I would recommend, to anyone, to come work for this hospital if given the chance!"
good,"This is an interesting place which is in transition.  It is an emerging butterfly that is still growing."
good,"Wonderful workplace.  Fellow employees professional, pleasant and a true joy to work alongside.  Management was fantastic - compassionate about the residents care and concerned with the employees satisfaction.  Hardest part of my job was the uncertainty of the stability of the company.  I truly enjoyed every part of my job."
good,I enjoy my work at Braintree Hospital. I love all my co-workers and find that we work well alongside each other. Everyone their is willing to lend a hand at all times.
good,I loved working there. Unfortunately the division that I worked for closed.
good,"Van Matre HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital is a fast pace, routine work setting. I have learned time management techniques, what chemicals to use on certain rooms and equipment, and gained knowledge on how to quickly and efficiently restock the linen storage rooms. Management will help solve any difficult obstacle that is challenging, and will help work around employee schedules if needed. Co-workers are very friendly, and are more than willing to help when necessary. The most difficult part of the job is learning how to cope with time management. Associating with co-workers and patients is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I work full time, usually as a CFSS (clinical field staff supervisor). Arrive at 0800 -- approve and write orders from MD, Utilization review of all patients charts as needed. Also in charge of weekly case conference, and discussing patients needs with MD and home health case manager. When needed due to staffing shortage worked in field as RN seeing patients in home for skilled nurse visits scheduled, and any SOC, RECERT, OR RESUMPTION, needed.

good,healthsouth is a really a life changing hospital for the patients.
good,"Encompass has been a breath of fresh air as an employer. I am paid fairly, given the training and time to get my work done and everyone has been very friendly and supportive."
good,Working at Encompass you really learn al lot when it comes to transfers of patients and the correct way to do it...a lot of hands on with patients.Its a great learning enviroment.
good,One of the best places I've worked but still needs major improvement. Lots of turn over. Scheduling is the hardest part about this place. Never the area your suppose to be in and several times bout the correct amount of patients. There are some parts of the jib that you are expected to do without pay.
good,Great place to learn and grow as a nurse. This fast paced acute care rehabilitation hospital taught me so much and has given me the education needed to further my nursing career.
good,"This is a rapidly growing organization, with a solid focus on what they do. The best part of my job is communicating with families about what we can do for their loved one. The toughest part of the job is limited territory to grow. Therefore, you see the same physicians every other day. I have more energy than that. "
good,"I loved being independent, with the freedom and ability to make my own schedule. I enjoyed working as a team with fellow employees and with hospice patients."
good,Braintree Rehab is under the Encompass umbrella  Braintree Rehab is horrible to work for. HR at Encompass is wonderful. They care and the benefits are over the top!
good,"Workplace culture was good.  I loved my job and would recommend anyone to apply to work at this facility.  I learned a lot in my job and was happy with the mentorship and guidance.  The best thing was the caliber of workforce.  The worst thing was my commute, which was not associated with the job."
good,Great people to work with as a PRN. They appreciate my time and professional input/communication about caseload.They are as accommodating as possible.
good,Healthsouth Petersburg has a great team with excellent leadership committed to patient care. The rehabilitation team puts patients needs above their own and is collaborative with the nursing staff in addition to the rehabilitation team.
good,This was a great team environment. High stress job but the people make it great. Salary and benefits were great. I would recommend to anyone who is looking
good,this job was pretty laid back and the management was amazing. i learned a lot working there. the other workers where helpful and very willing to teach me.
good,Loved my job until I was promoted to Administrator and relocated just to find out they had no staff and I had to work the position of 5 people at 20 plus hour days and got no sleep.
good,Health South helped mold me into the COTA I am today as I was only there for 8 weeks as a level II fieldwork student. I believe that if I would have applied there I would have been happy and satisfied
good,"discharge planning, family advocacy, team building and medical team collaboration. Great staff, small environment promotes teamwork. Overall nice place to work."
good,Great place to develop skills without actually being in the hospital setting. Team work and support by management. It is fast paced and busy but you will learn and help clients in the process.
good,"In my opinion, HealthSouth is a respectable for-profit, national healthcare company. I enjoyed working for HealthSouth in KY, OH, TX. I highly recommend working here if you enjoy rehabilitation."
good,"HealthSouth hires employees to keep them there. The company offers good benefits and incentives to further your education. All in all, this has been one of my favorite places to work."
good,I have been PRN there for about 6 months and have had nothing but good experiences with the staff and management. They are willing are to answer questions without making you feel like you are bothering them. The nurses and techs help each other. I gave it 4 stars because occasionally their is shortage of staff but they offer bonuses to get help. I have seen the CEO several times.
good,HealthSouth was a great company to work for.  They care about the staff and management was very on top of it.  PTO time and schedule flexibility was the best you will find.  Benefits package was the best I have ever had.
good,"On a typical day I usually take on 12-16 Patients. With the help of the nurses I take on the responsibility of taking vitals, making sure the patients needs are tended to, and charting on the patients. I work 12 hour night shifts from 7 pm to 7 am"
good,"A typical night at work consists of starting the shift by meeting with the staff to update them of new developments, ie: patient complaints, new policies, upcoming meetings and events.  Narcotic counts with the off going supervisor and report.  Reviewing admissions and calling physicians when admissions arrive to obtain admission orders.  In the course of the evening I speak to every nurse on duty about their patients and any problems that are developing.  Review staffing for the next shift and make patient assignments.  Update reports and reconcile patient counts.  During the course of my employment I have learned that every employee counts.  "
good,"HealthSouth NKY Rehab in Edgewood Ky is a 40 bed facility, everyone knows everyone in the facility, all department employees are friendly to each other and help each other. Everyone from Doctors, Nurses, Physical Therapists, to the CEO, all contribute to the day to day functions and know everything about the New patient that is being Admitted before the they arrive. The CEO is very ""Hands On"" everyday, he makes sure to stop in every department to check if there is any problems or concerns about the days Admissions, checks on why a verification is taking to long to reply to us, etc. He is Great! When your Director is out of the building at a meeting, you can go to any other Department Directors to get questions or concerns addressed. The company in a whole is a Great Company to work for. Our CEO and Department Directors, HR were always giving us special days, lunches, fun game days, ice cream parties, cookouts (where the CEO grilled), they really cared about their employees."
good,There was a lot of physical activity as that pertains to the job.Good management .Coperative and team oriented coworkers .
good,"Everyday starts with a good report from fellow nurses. Then off to an exciting day of teaching patients how to cope with their pain and still get motivated to get well and back on the road to recovery."
good,"Very independent, staff meeting every Monday morning to discuss our week. After that all day in the field calling on Dr's offices."
good,"A typical work day for me would be helping people with activities of daily living like dressing, grooming and showers. Assisting people with therapy and with food trays and charting as well as doing vitals. I learned that when taking care of patients you must work as a team from the doctors to housekeeping. I had a great group of team members to help me. The hardest part of my job is maintaining your cool while taking care of sick patients. With proper time management it will be better to handle anything that comes your way. The best part of the job is knowing you helped someone in there most vulnerable time in there lives."
good,"Work starts from 8 am to 4:30 pm. I went in and got my paperwork and started my rounds. I learned how to be on time with the patients and got them where they needed to be in the hospital. The place was well organized. I was a team player. Whenever someone new joined our team I would help them grasp everything and told them that everything would come natural. The hardest part of the job was when I learned that one of my dearest patients died. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and when we had incentives. Overall, HealthSouth was a great place to work."
good,"I transcribed physicians orders, consults, admissions and discharges. I also was assigned tasks as the day went on by the clinical nurse in charge that shift. I added rehabilitation practices to my resume, which expanded my knowledge even further into the medical field. I enjoyed going to work each day, but I came into the department when the census was not the best and therefore, was sent home mid shift or even called off for the day prior to my start. This was the part of the job I did not like, as my finances started to grow and my paycheck did not."
good,Typical day preparing patients for surgery.
good,"Nice place to work so far, but I haven't been there long. The management is so sweet and respectful. There are some days that are overwhelming, but I usually can handle it because the managers and supervisers usually understand. The techs offer help when they know your struggling. I would and have encouraged people to work there."

good,Great communication skills among co-workers. A very friendly place for employment.

good,"HealthSouth is a stellar place of employment!  They are a first class acute care rehabilitation hospital with 50 inpatient beds and an outpatient staff that are wonderful.  I learned a lot working for HealthSouth, specifically the ins and outs of health insurance.  I am well versed in patient privacy and also learned a lot of medical diagnoses of patients and medical terminology as well as scheduling patients for therapy. The hardest part of the job was the ongoing tracking of our medicare patients therapy units manually. I had a lot of help from my manager and therapists, so it was definitely a teamwork culture. I definitely enjoyed meeting new people and helping them with their difficult issues that brought them to therapy.  A typical day at work included, answering phone, returning calls, insurance verification, obtaining Dr. orders, insurance authorizations and referrals in a timely manner to ensure coverage for therapy patients. I also admitted patients for their therapy evaluations.  Also, I maintained patient files."
good,A typical day would be awesome everyday. We'd have classes on if there's something new to do that day or week. management work with making sure you're doing your job right. the hardest part was lifting the heavy residents. I've gotten along with my co-workers and family residents.
good,"I learned how to use the all equipment and materials needed. My Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. They're always there to lend a helping hand. The staff is very well organized,"
good,"Great job, good experience in a new nursing field; Close unit in own department, but kind of disconnected from other departments"

good,"Met with instructor, given directives as to which clients we would see that day. Gave medications, regarding the 5 rights, did alot of wound care. (This hospital is where people came after surgery for their PT,OT, and ST.) Management was very busy so we really didn't get a chance to get to know them. The LVN's / RN's we worked under still did their paper work in the clients chart (we weren't allowed), but as far as work, the SVN's, we did the work! I enjoyed it. I was able to change my first colostomy bag, different, but very interesting and I learned alot! The hardest part of the job was to see how much pain the clients were in and there was only so much we could do. The most enjoyable was to see how after therapy and seeing how they approve and are able to be discharged home!"
good,Dallas TX has the prime example of what Encompass should be like. The Roswell office needs a lot of work. The management needs to be stronger in helping out the nurses.
good,"Great company but the sales team is given goals that are unreachable. If you do hit goal, there's no real incentive anyways. You could easily work 24/7 if you are a heavy hitter, so dont make plans for anything outside of work. High turnover here, but as a whole, the company has wonderful things happening."
good,Being the only HHA for a company is very hard and very stressful...… A lot of traveling and the mileage is not worth the wear and tear on your vehicles.
good,The team work was exceptional. It was the management that drove most people away from this facility. PRN pay was also exceptional for both nurses and nursing assistants. Bonuses are offered when you're called in for work during your day off.
good,HealthSouth now Encompass Health has the most incredible PT team in the region. However some of their leadership needs to go back to the drawing board and learn how to be a manager. Taking about how you stalk your current boyfriend and catch him cheating on you is not a best practice or as a member of the Leadership Team talking about how many jello shooters you did with your neighbor is a good quality. Not sure how this helps been team spirit and morale.
good,I am glad to work at Healthsouth! I accepted a PRN position to gain hands on experience for a graduate program I am applying to. It is a perfect opportunity for me and I enjoy the culture of the workplace as well as the interactions with the patients. Everyone is very helpful.
good,Exempt Employees are taken advantage of as far as number of hours expected to be available. The patient care component is very good as is the Therapy.

good,This was a work training program that lasted no more than a year. Since it was a training program it only paid minimum wage and did not have advancement opportunities.
good,"The RN case manager position is salary and 8am to 5pm, many times it was a challenge to complete the required visits and documentation by the end of the shift, many days I resumed documenting afterhours from home to stay on schedule working 14hrs a day to complete the work. No additional compensations was offered due to the position being a salary position. I stayed in that position in hopes I work get faster and more efficient, although I resigned due to the overwhelming workload. Co-workers and patients, including the management was not the issue. The workload was the main complaint."

good,"This is a good company to work for I was prn but I got called in a lot,  the staff works very close together and help each other the get the job done miss working here."
good,"A fun location for working inpatient rehab. Although it can be stressful at times, the overall flow of patients made days go quickly. Management was fun and typically fair. Workplace culture was somewhat nosy and focused on drama. Possibly varies location to location. It was occasionally difficult to work with unwilling patients, but for the most part they checked themselves in for help and were there to receive it."

They never made me feel that I am just an intern but as a person who seeks knowledge and experience. I have learn many things that I would be able to use in the future and did justified what I learn from school. My co-workers are very kind and supportive. They are always there and ready to help me understand things that I am confused with. The hardest part of the job is the inability to actually manage to use their software in order for me to really familiarize with the software they are currently using. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job is when I started to understand the workflow of medical records inside the facility."

The hardest part was when I got attached to the patients and it was time for their discharges."

good,"Well I learned a lot in the 9.5 years that I worked at this facility that I could have been basically handed the Registered Nurse degree. It stared out as an Orthopedic Rehab facility and then became Long Term Acute. Not only did I deal with all the ventilator and heart monitor alarms, there were call lights constantly because the system was hooked up to the alarms and an alert person never could tell if it was an alarm or if they needed somethings. "

I had hardworking coworkers that were very friendly and knowledgeable and cared about the patients. The hardest part of the job was scheduling with patients. Every so often, one would cancel last minute or a patient would require extra time to fill a new need. I learned how to better manage my time so that all of my patients had the time they needed."
good,"Welcoming coworkers, good benefits plan and room for advancement.  The pay isn't horrible but could be better especially when weighing experience and education on a whole."
good,Started awesome environment was friendly and staff was extremely helpful with each other. Support was awesome and everyone was a team player. It turned bad when workload increased to the point it was too much for nurses and it trickled down to everyone else
good,"I was in a leadership position with this company. However, the compensation did not add up with the work that I performed. I was responsible for training new hires to self schedule. I was also responsible for scheduling the staffing. If an employee called out, I had to find a replacement. I could also provide incentives and bonuses with employees pick up additional shifts."
good,Regional level management was one spot. In my time of employment though I went through 4 local level managers and worked for six months without even a local manager.
good,"When I worked there, I really enjoyed the staff and my management.  They really gave me the opportunities that I was looking for in this job.  They let me pretty much do my own thing since I was the first person who was hired there for  that branch. I was not the supervisor because the supervisor had to be an RN but the supervisor always asked me for my opinion and I helped her a lot around the office with concerns and problems.  I loved the staff we hired and I loved my position there.  "
good,I have been working at HealthSouth for 5 years and I am very pleased. We have built an awesome family and team approach to our day to day activity which allows us to work closely together especially during times of stress.

good,"Wonderful environment for patients willing to go the extra step in rehabilitation care. Fast paced environment, some shifts more laid back than others. Continuing education allowed progress and education readiness. The only negative would be facility seemed understaffed at times."
good,"I really liked working there. Great people, great staff. They were more than willing to work with my schedule, which was great because i didn't have a car at the time. My only problem was they didn't have benefits because I was per diem."

good,"This is a wonderful company to work for. There is plenty of room for advancement and senior team see's the potential in people and helps get them to the next level. I have had an extremely successful time here and would recommend this company to anyone who was considering it as a potential employer. My days are consistently busy but that is the plus, my days are never the same or boring. I feel like I am appreciated by the whole team and they see that we are all here for the same reason, the patient and giving them the best possible experience in their recovery. The hospital has a team/family feel to it considering it's fairly small in comparison to surrounding healthcare facilities. You always get greeted with a smile, hello, and even small talk conversations to just catch up."
good,"Answer phones, direct calls answer questions. Assemble Charts Audit Charts for Medicare.  I enjoy my Patients,Families and my co-workers."
good,This was a small rehab facility. Every body knew you.  It was a friendly work place.  My supervisor was great.  The only reason I left was because I felt like I did not have enough work and wanted a change.

good,"high pace, people and customer skills needed constantly."
good,"Assessment, treatment and med administration to patients with various chronic and acute illness recieving rehabilitation services, such as physical therapy, occupational and speech therapy. I worked with a well trained, dedicated staff. Team work is a standard at Health South. Management strives to meet the needs of the staff, setting strict standards, while maintaining flexibility. The hardest part of the Job is the intense pace in order to complete proper patient care while coordinating with the therapy schedules. This became much easier once establishing a routine. I enjoyed this challange.."
good,I enjoy working with people. I have been with Encompass for 41/2 yrs it is a great place to work the managment is great to work with. they have good teamwork.
good,"Wonderfull caring staff and management, great place to work with small friendly enviorment"
good,I loved working there with many people and learned so much in the medical field. They initially gave me a chance due to my backround had nothing to do in the medical field. All the outpatient facilities closed which made me look elsewhere. I would have stayed there otherwise
good,As a manager total work days could be long and very busy.  Hospice Care is a passion for me and I felt that I was very rewarded working at Encompass.  I was very involved in the quality of care that was provided to our patients.
good,I love the people I worked for the PT load can get high but it's been improved by leaps and bounds. There is a warm family atmosphere about the hospital.
good,"The overall atmosphere and coworkers makes the fast-paced and what can be a stressful environment extremely manageable. The privilege of assisting both my team and the patients in successful outcomes to the best of our ability, is an absolute satisfaction for me. Everyday is a learning experience and a better understanding!"
good,"Great work environment with wonderful staff! I love the environment that the work day holds. There are lots of activities where upper management engage with other employees. Higher ups often spoil employees with snacks, candy, drinks, etc."
good,"I am a current employee here and I love it.  The only thing I have a problem with is the pay.  I do not make near enough for the work I put in.  I am underpaid by 4% for the average salary.  We are paid off of a pay scale so there isn't much room for raises or promotions.  I think more employees would stay longer if we were paid for the hard work we put in.  The people are amazing, and the education is top of the line."
good,You had to work on point many had issues but you have to stay focused or you'll fall into many pitfalls work and stay focused on you and your job don't go inventorying in others life style
good,This was a great place to do my internship as I learned alot from my clinical instructor and the team. The workplace culture was positive and enjoyable. The physical therapy management was great and they listened to feedback from all of the therapists.
good,"If you can manage to get hired on full time, it would be a most extremely enjoyable work place with opportunity to grow if you are a direct hire. I loved the training and experience scripting i learned there."
good,"Worked here for 4 years, FT and PRN. Good company to work for. 6 wk vacation, good benefits, new employee referral bonuses, annual raises (un heard of). Mgt is fair, they hire the best people, expectations are high. On call is once every quarter. Lots of staff, which is good!"
good,"Great people make a fabulous environment to work at and is always a delight, when management says ""Good morning, how's your day going? "" With a true genuine gesture that if you have an issue within the work environment they will help solve the issue, to prevent it from continuing. When you have this type of management and great co-workers it is always a pleasure to clock in to work and start your day."
good,"Working at TRISL can be very challenging, yet it is rewarding.  I work 12 hour shifts and I am busy all 12 hours and constantly on my feet.  Initially, when I started there, I didn't know if I would stay, but after giving it a reasonable amount of time, I found that TRISL is very big on educating the staff and keeping you up on your duties and skills.  I've witnessed so many wonderful outcomes with patients and over my four year period there, I have developed a fond relationship with many of the patients that come back for recurrent treatment."
good,Se trabaja demaciado para $9 dolares la hora debe ser mejor pagado el trabajo
good,I worked at HealthSouth for 6 years. The only reason I left was because of census issues which affected by hours and pay. Had it not been for that I would still be there. I learned so much and was given many opportunities to move around and learn as much as I could and was always treated with respect. They were very flexible when I  needed to take care of personal matters as long as you didn't abuse those privileges. Some days could be stressful but that comes with any place  you work. Management was always nice and they are all about patient satisfaction. I had the pleasure of being apart of committees they developed to ensure that patients were being treated properly and receiving what they needed to get back out into the community and live the life they were use to living only better.  It was a great experience and I am thankful to have been able to be apart of such a great company.

good,"Overall excellent company to work for. Great facility, with modern equipment to use on the patients. Great learning experience with many skilled professionals."
good,"Encompass is a great place to work for RNs, LPNs, PTs,OTs. MSWs are paid per visit and so MSW is dependent on referrals. Territory covered is large and potential for long travel times between visits is great when there are only 2-3 potential visits in a day. Compensation for MSWs does not cover office time, completing case conference notes, emailing. "
good,good company to work for. pay can be better. co-worker are easy to get along with. work is consistent. give perks to employees. benefits can be better.
good,"I work home health side and it’s great team environment. Very understanding boss."
good,"Encompass is a great place to work the only thing I didn't like was the prn position you wouldn't get enough hours and the ones you get they would flex you and give to the full and part-time people and when you prn no benefit they give full and part-time to the ones they want to but you work your butt off and still prn so I had to let it go for only that reason, not enough hours"

good,"I absolutely LOVED my clinical rotation at Encompass Health-Petersburg! My Clinical Instructor was amazing, supportive, and gave me the perfect amount of constructive criticism and at the same time gave me the space to use my own clinical judgement to improve my confidence as a clinician. The Therapy team was incredible as well. They were all very supportive of each other and were always willing to give a helping hand to anyone that needed assistance, both patient and employees alike. The Therapy team were always there to offer me and the other students guidance and help whenever we asked for it. The other medical staff were also very friendly and willing to help whomever asked and always with a smile on their faces. These included MDs, RT, Nursing Staff, Custodial Staff, and Dietary Staff, etc."

good,HealthSouth Rehab Hospital is part of a large company based in Alabama. They provided training at the tome of hire and ammual conferences. We had the freedom to create our own Middletown culture rather than a corporate culture. Benefits and salary were fair and appropriate for the region. We were able to be competitive in the hiring market. The CEO is professional and well liked.

good,"This was my first job working in the health industry.  I truly enjoyed working there and being part of a large staff who took good care of injured people.  I learned a lot of new things when working here. How interact with ill people and making their day as bright as possible in the midst of their illnesses. Challenging like any other job, always trying to fit patients in the therapists schedules, answering a large amount of incoming calls, this made it challenging for sure. but thought me how to multitask."
good,"Healthsouth is a great place to work in a very competitive market. The culture is a family based community, with very low employee turnover. Every place has its pro's and con's, but Healthsouth provides a work atmosphere."
good,This is a rehab facility.  My first time working in this type of environment coming from an acute health care setting.  Very much enjoyed seeing first hand the complete circle of care.
good,Working at HealthSouth was a very rewarding experience. I was a transporter tech for them for about two years. I worked on the weekends when I was in school and met many people that I would want to continue a professional and personal relationship with.
good,It was a great experience to be part of a organization  that genuinely cares about the rehabilitation of a patient and their families.  It is most unfortunate I am no longer part of this organization.
good,Very nice place to work. If you truly care about taking care of people then this is the place you want to be. Positive outcomes happen here and it is rewarding to be part of it.
good,"I don't have that much to say at this time because i just started for this hospital and i am only per-diem. as perdiem status, i am obligated to give a minimum of 4 days a month."
good,a good company to work for. flexibility on schedules. good pto hours. fast work environment. sometimes high census and short of staff.
good,"Daily duties very from direct contact with providers, to for room presentations, as well as preparation/ organization for each interaction throughout the day. Being an area manager will help you learn that everyone has an interaction with the patient's care throughout each facility. Management is laid-back and allows you to work your territory, given that you show productivity and initiative. The workplace culture is none like have ever experienced, with a focus on individual improvement, Family, and committed to teamwork. They really encourage their staff to become better In every field they work in. The most difficult part of job is the competitors in a new market, and work staff disagreements in executing specific tasks. The most enjoyable part of job, is the amount relationship you build, the love and teamwork, any interactions with your superiors. Overall, Encompass has been one of the greatest companies -to date- I've worked for."
good,This HealthSouth is one of the top in the industry. The care and staff are amazing and a great company to work for. They need to review their salary amounts but other than this they are truly a superb facility and company. My rehab director is awesome.

good,".I started at Rehab as a temporary employee through an agency. They needed a night shift charge nurse due to sudden illness. I stepped in and did the job without problem and within three weeks, they asked me to go full time permanent as an employee. I accepted."
good,HealthSouth is a nice place to work if you have just received your certification its a good beginner place for healthcare if you have never worked in the field before.

good,"Enjoying an eventful greeting at the start of your shift, while receiving a thorough report on each patient. Ensuring that each patient had supplies needed, such as; HME, oral and trach care, medications orfered, etc., on hand and ready for use in the designated are. "
good,Management is very involved and helpful while creating independence of employees
good,"HealthSouth was a wonderful place to work.  Management was extremely concerned with patient care and progress.  It was their first concern and the staff that I worked with felt the same way.  The job had it's challenges because working with the public one must always keep in mind that there are many different personalities in the world but each one must be treated with respect.  "
good,"During my eight hour day I made sure my area was very clean and tidy for patients, visitors, and staff.  "
good,An 8 hour work day goes by really fast! Staff are attentive and respectful to patients. Upper management is available to patients and staff. Team approach.
good,fun loving and healing atmosphere. always room for improvement. great place to help people with all types of problems
good,Very Strenous / stressful 13 hour shifts with  meetings or educational  times scheduled  on days off .  Enjoyed my coworkers and am still in contact with them.  Hospital very clean and organized.  Made good salary  ( but will work for less ).  The hardest part of the job was getting everything done  (tasks wise ) and maintaining good patient care. The most enjoyable part was patient care & my coworkers.
good,My typical day at work was traveling to patient's homes and assessing them. Contacting physicians when needed. Educating patients on main health concerns. Learned a lot about different health problems that most people do not deal with on a daily basis. Management was great and approachable and helpful. Co-workers were great and also easy to communicate with. Hardest part of the job was not being able to make all the patients better. Most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with the patients and the families.
good,Was a great place to work. Met a lot of new people an people that i worked with before. And also met someone that new my family.
good,"worked schedule was Th, Fr, and Sa, with Su off, back to work Mo, Tu , We, and then 7 days off. 12 hour shift 2 patient max, score study during collection and had report done and printed in the AM."
good,Really enjoyed my time with them. Very sad when company moved offices to PA
good,"With my years of experience, I have worked with divers of (both clients and staff) from all races and genders. I have learned differences in cultural diversity and I have been able to work with different personalities. It is such fun learning new thing or things everyday, and that is exactly what nursing has blessed me with"
good,"Working at healthsouth has been a great experience for me. I have learned a lot. Working as a respiratory therapist at healthsouth has been one of the best things that has happened to me.. I have learned so much, first and for most there is only 1 rrt on a day here in our 60 bed acute rehab so it does get pretty busy. We do have trach patients as well but no ventilated patients. Administering breathing treatments and general respiratory care here. We do get some codes as well.. Healthsouth is a very interesting place to work. Best part is everyone there makes you feel like family."
good,Great company with plenty of job security when you look at the market share the company possesses. All of my co-workers are very friendly and create an environment of trust.
good,I have worked here for 5+ years and with all jobs it has it’s ups and downs. However the company continues to grow with opportunities to move up or move locations. Management for the most part is helpful and wants to see you succeed. I have no intentions of looking for anything different any tone soon. Always helping in the community.
good,Best job I have had so far as an RN! ! I am Per-Diem and usually work two days per week...but do more if needed. Management is great and seasoned nurses will help you when you need it! Patient care comes first!
good,I am a current employee of 6 years. A few times a year we get gifts and fun days or food trucks. The current staff is great. I enjoy going to work. Would recommend.
good,Quality-driven company.  Would work for them again.  Regional leadership can be tough but respectful with clear expectations regarding performance and quality.
good,"I have worked here for 3 years, the management is easy to get along with , the work is fun. Compensation is a little less than other places in this area"
good,"Great place to work. Usually within your first 3-6 months you're sent to Dallas to the home office for Foundations Training which allows you to see how operations are ran from there as well as learning company history and team building exercises which is a paid trip by the company. Employees are selected once a year to go to Las Vegas and once you reach so many years you get nice glass sculpted awards for years of service. The EHR is easy and user friendly. Company policy is to always call every patient the evening before to let them know when you will be arriving. If you exceed productivity you get more money in your check. Benefits package was great. Hours are 8a-5p generally but there is some flexibility for example if you have an appointment you can see patients around the appointment within limits. Productivity is still expected to be met by weeks end but new employees productivity is set lower as the company doesn't expect new employees to be at target productivity immediately, they ramp you up slowly. On call schedule is a lot easier no days than it used to be when I worked there. I always heard great things about the company from current and former patients as well as doctor's offices and communities that I visited.I would recommend them to anyone."
good,"Busy medical rehab hospital, feels like an acute Med-surg unit. RN to pt ratio is 5-1; Or RN/LVN to 10 pts. Overall the staff seems to be pretty happy to work here. I’m still fairly new to the hospital but have received a ton of orientation and the other nurses are always willing to help out! Management appears to be genuinely invested in making sure patients are happy and staff do well."
good,Really appreciate the training provided. (It was HealthSouth when I worked there.) I would work there again if the right position opened up... At the right salary.
good,"Love it here!  Great company, that does great things, with a great mission that is clear and concise.  I enjoy this company and am honored to get this opportunity to work with them all!"
good,Great place to work. Flexible scheduling and worked independently. Worked as Registered Psychiatric Nurse/Case Management. Plenty of PTO accrued throughout the year
good,"As a patient at HealthSouth you are number one. The quality of care is top notch and the overall satisfaction rates from patients are very high. The therapist are always well qualified and create an environment of continual growth in your professional development as a therapist. It is very fast-paced so it requires a standard of passion and drive. Much is required and as it should be, you typically are the last hope for a patients gain of independence after a life altering event. Overall great place to work if you love what you do and want to work hard."
good,The employees are friendly and there was a sense of comradery. It wasn't always easy working with the patients. They are feeling their worse and sometimes can take it out on the staff. Management cares for the employees and treats fairly.
good,"i enjoy very much working at health south hospital, staff is nice to work with ,we all help each other when an emergency comes up.the doctors and therapist are all very friendly, we get many different kinds of patients , more than just a rehab hospital, the ceo and allthe managers are very nice to work for, we have good team work at this hospital."
good,I enjoy working at this company. Job required long hours and was somewhat stressful. The management team is very supportive and has an open door policy. I enjoyed the patients I had the opportunity to serve.
good,They were upfront that there was a discussion that the position needed a nurse instead on non-clinical.  I was hired as  non-clinical and over time it was apparent they were growing and needed to add additional responsibilities onto one.
good,Great company to work for and they do show they care about their employees. I do think that the could offer Better Health Care cost coverage and 401k matching.
good,"Everyone is really nice and helpful at Encompass Health. I am a receptionist here on the weekends, 7-7 Saturday and Sunday with Monday through Friday off. It's 12.00 an hour for the receptionist on the weekend, definitely really good pay! The atmosphere is welcoming and I always look forward to coming to work."
good,"This is high pace, collaborative job. The physical demand is high. Emotionally stressful as well as gratifying knowing you are part of helping people get better. If you can handle the above, great place to work for."
good,I enjoyed the experience of working home health. The culture of this company is very positive. The on-boarding process is informative and you are well trained before working with patients.
good,In my current management position there is very little work/ home balance. The culture is great and they continue to educate the employees and benefits/compensation are fair. The hardest part of the job is the lack of balance with home and work. The most enjoyable is working with such a great team and patients.
good,"Our CNO was amazing, she really cared about where you were and where you wanted to be. Even working night shift, she would pop in and check in- let us know she's around.

good,Truly an amazing company who fully backs their field staff with enormous opportunities for further education. Very ethical and goal driven to provide great care to every patient.
good,This company has changed a lot in me. They are really good but there are times it gets stressful as you know it is home health and you need to drive to patient's houses. everyone is supportive and are very helpful.

good,"When I joined this company several years ago , everything was good but recently the company is facing a lot of challenges from competitor around most especially the new companies that just sprang up."
good,"A typical day at work would be assessing Patients, passing all medication on time answering any concerns that patients have. communicating with doctors helping my fellow co worker out. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing patients smile making them feel better encouraging them. The hardest part of the job is watching patients pass away knowing you did everything your power to keep them alive. Nursing is an evolving door so I'm learning something new everyday rather its a doctor teaching me nurse or even a patient."
good,I loved my job at healthsouth even though I was on call a lot. My supervisor was outstanding and very supportive and help me direct my department accordingly. I was very multi tasked because of a lot of lay off and had to work in different departments to help out but didn't mind at all.

I experience new things on a daily basis about patient care and different skills into the nursing field. I am in the nursing field so I see more and more everyday that I work.
good,The work environment is very warm and friendly.  The atmosphere is very full of support and so forth.  There is adequate training and on boarding is excellent.

good,"I was pregnant, desperate to find a job. I applied to many places, fast food, etc. Where they turned me down because they thought I was unable to do a good job while pregnant. Healthsouth gave me the chance to work for them and I must say this is a wonderful place to work for. They show you appreciation and treat their employees with so much respect. I worked as a rehab nurse tech and while the job can be physically demanding, it has much room for you to advance and move up with the company."
good,I work as a nurse liaison in the admissions/marketing department for HealthSouth. I have worked here a little over 3 years and love it. The environment is very positive and the management is great. The only downside would be the salary- my position needs a market adjustment to be competitive. It pays about 10k + less than others for the same title.
good,"HealthSouth is where I got my first hands-on experience with transferring patients, and treating a variety of surgical and generally deconditioned patients. I enjoy working with the geriatric population and have a real passion to educate the patients and their families to help empower them and see them return to doing what makes them happiest. My co-workers at HealthSouth are wonderful, many of them have been on staff for 10+ years and have a wealth of knowledge. They are friendly and show genuine concern in times of struggle and management demonstrates their understanding of how important family time is by no-guilt non-availability. I enjoy working hard for the patients and have a sense of loyalty to this facility because of the way they treat their patients and their staff. We are a great team and the only reason I am considering other opportunities at this time is that I haven't been able to get enough hours lately."
good,"With many therapists and patients with many diagnoses, there is an opportunity to develop and grow.  The company is generous with educational reimbursement."

good,"Good Company to work with, Very little time off and after 17 years decided to explore other options, However I learned to Direct not only Plant Management but also Purchasing Department and Cafeteria Services, The staff I managed were great to work and performed their duties satisfactory.

If a cna couldn't get to another patient because of helping someone in another room a nurse would go and help that patient .  Everyone looked out for one another.  My co-workers were the best, we always laughed, joked it made the night go by fast."
good,They do a good job at building morale and taking care of their employees.
good,"Greeted by a friendly smile from all staff, ability to coordinate and bounce ideas off of all medical disciplines.  Everyone had the patient's best interest at heart.  The care there was unique and wonderful."
good,"Receive referrals (1-10/day) and review chart clinical data for appropriate criteria. Complete detailed evaluations for facility MD review prior to transfer. Communicate with discharge planners, physicians, patient and families regarding the acute rehab process, patient acceptance and or reason for denials. Initiate insurance precertification process if required.

The management there is great a fair with employees who wants to advance in their career. The work place culture is diversified of many different cultures. The hardest part of my job is just being on feet for 12 hours a day, moving beds when transferring patients to rooms and times when dealing with difficult patients, but my passion for taking care of others helps me surpass any challenges that I have to face on a daily basics.

good,"I have worked for Encompass Health (formerly Healthsouth) for >3 years. I actually drive over an hour to work due to the fact that it is such a good place to work. Management actually listens to concerns. I can only speak for day shift as I do not work nights. Most of the employees work great as a team and get the job done. Pay is very competitive. Further education offered if you are interested. If you work hard, are interested in learning, and care about seeing your patients improve you will love working here.

good,"We have a great team in Enterprise!"

good,"I've enjoyed working at Encompass Health through a rebrand and lots of growth! Our department is small so there is plenty of work to keep our group busy, over 40 hours a week, but it's been so rewarding to work on my team and with my manager. The culture of Encompass Health extends past the home office to each hospital location."
good,Working at Healthsouth is an awesome place the staff from the Nurses to the Therapy department is hands down the best place I’ve ever worked . Everyone is always willing to help and that’s a real plus.

good,I really enjoy the work environment at HealthSouth I have been here for about four months the supervisors are great to work with. And with all jobs you always have your good and bad days however even the bad days aren't horrible.
good,"This job pays very well compared to most culinary jobs.  The kitchen is run as a tight ship.  There are procedures in place for everything. The manager has many years of experience supervising high volume kitchens. There are high expectations for job performance given the great rate of pay.  People here do work as a team.  There is not the nonsense, drama, drug usage, etc., that one encounters at other culinary positions.  Such things simply wouldn't be tolerated.  The hardest part of the job is that there is little room for creativity in cooking.  There is a set menu with calories, carbs, etc., calculated out for hospital patients and you must follow it exactly.  I miss being able to experiment and try new things."
good,I enjoy patient care and knowing I made a difference for them.  The hardest part is physically transferring heavy patients.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having appreciative patients and seeing smiles from other staff members.  I learned how very challenging hospital work can be and how important it is to have teamwork and support of coworkers.

good,Encompass Home Health and Hospice is a fine company and comprised of people who genuinely care about helping others.  It has been a genuine pleasure working in leadership at this organization.
good,"Productive and fun and sad work environment. The hardest part is watching someone pass and seeing their family sad, and the most enjoyable is making your patient happy and making sure they are comfortable making sure their in a healthy environment keeping it clean. I enjoy taking care of people and helping with their everyday needs, keeping their homes clean . Its a hard job but i love helping others and making things easier. I learned that life is precious and there's nothing more precious than family and stick together no matter what and treat people how u would want to be treated , Its ok to go out your way for others ,sometimes that makes a big difference in peoples lives, and i've learned that pain is very difficult in these stages and it is very hard to watch someone suffer in pain all day long and our nurses do a very good job of helping others with their pain and getting them comfortable . Its sad how many people suffer with terrible pain and hospice is ok to join, a lot of people dont want to here that word but its a very good help source to be with ,they pay for meds and respite care ,they have all kind of resources that will help the best way they can and they have social workers, community educators that will educate anyone about hospice,and explain anything u don't understand about hospice .We have a volunteer program that helps patients with different things they might need help with taking walks etc. They have chaplains that come and pray and read the bible to u . Hospice is a great thing to be in if u really need it because it has so many people and so many aides"

good,I enjoyed my time there as a Respiratory Therapist and Manager. It was wonderful to see the rehabilitation side of Respiratory Care. I would love to work there again.
good,Therapy is completed on hourly basis. No time in between patients to write notes. Notes are written usually during lunch period. Late days are to be expected to catch up on notes and create next day's schedule. Co-workers are very helpful and so is PRN staff. Therapy techs are helpful as well. Most difficult part of the job is time management. The most enjoyable part is always the patients.
good,I only worked for this company for a short period of time and I enjoyed it. The only reason I left was because I couldn't accommodate them because I had another job and my hours were conflicting with the times they wanted me to ride out with other nurses. Other than this the staff were nice and really look out for their employees. Hated to make the decision to leave. If I could have gotten more hours. I would have stayed and probably retire from this company.
good,"Working at healthsouth has been a pleasure the management are on site or able to be reached. It is hard work but enjoyable. My coworkers are like family. The hardest part of my job would have to be the bathing or trying to let the patient no that we are not going to "

Realizaba horarios y dirigía un área del departamento. Aprendí mucho acerca de la terapia física y ocupacional, me capacite de gran manera. Mis compañeros eran excelentes profesionales. La parte mas difícil para mi era ver un paciente no llegar alcanzar sus metas. Pero la parte mas alegre y divertida era ser parte de su recuperación y ver como iban mejorando en el día a día."

good,"I haven't been an RN for very long, and HealthSouth at Drake has been a great place for me. My preceptors have been wonderful, and I love seeing the patients progress to a more independent level. I'm very surprised about some of the comments here. Our patient outcomes are really good, and our doctors are very caring. The administration is always making rounds on the floor, and they are always asking for our input. The new CEO is great--he is very visible and accessible. He clearly wants the hospital to be the best it can possibly be. I would recommend being a rehab nurse to anyone."
good,My experience at Healthsouth was my most profession job yet. I was able to work with nurses and doctors as well as do patient filing and some lab work. I enjoyed working there because i had a variety of a job description.

good,"I enjoyed working at Health South Rehabilitation Hospital. I took the job as nursing supervisor thinking that I was ready for that role. I came from Intensive Care Nursing and found it hard to suddenly change my nursing role. I had just moved to Anderson and took on too many life and career changes at one time. I stepped down from the nurse supervisor role because I wanted to be a ""friend"" to all the staff and did not like direct confortation. I was offered a position as a staff nurse and I declined. I felt that the conflict of change would hinder me and my nursing obligations. I have grown a lot in the past four years and see how my misjudgement costed an opportunity at advancing in my career. It was just the wrong time and place for me to be at that time."

I love my job, I am paid well with weekly opportunities to bonus, great benefits and 30 days time off each year! The best thing about my job is caring for the patients.

After 2 years, I was asked to pilot an Admissions and Discharge position, which I continued to participate in until my last day.
