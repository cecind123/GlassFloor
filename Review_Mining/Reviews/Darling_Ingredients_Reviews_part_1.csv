bad,I quit this job because the office manager was highly unprofessional and like to gossip about people's personal lives. In addition clerks are only supposed to get 30 minute lunches but favorites get over and hour and overtime for chit chatting and being on the phone.
bad,The smell they rush you on everything the Mgr don’t know anything there is butt kissing crew no space for advancement the parking sucks hot cold raining it don’t matter and very dangerous
bad,"Position was neglected when I joined on. Accounting manager questioned why position was so backed up and when I informeded them of “problem areas” and ways to help correct them... nothing was done. Uneven work load and if you value family or being at home, this is NOT the right company for you. Company does offer free meals and has good benefits but it’s not worth it when the accounting manager sees you as a “number” and not as a person. I strongly, do not recommend working here!"
bad,Lack of loyalty to dedicated employees.  Hire from outside versus promote from within.  Utilize employees as long as needed and then turn them out when done.
bad,A nightshift  job only.worked out of the chandlersville ohio plant.no raises.no opportunity for advancement.dirty nasty job where you are always forced to hurry.very hard and strstressful job.junk equipment. Very low pay.
bad,Very poor management. Management was very poor and has no idea on how to run a plant. Both head managers have never been in this type of industry and will eventually run it into the ground.
bad,"A lot of work and extremely understaffed. "
bad,"Don't even think about accepting interview invite! Seriously this job is not for everyone. If you are willing to bury yourself in grease and guts they process, you may want to join."
bad,"Upper management has NO concern for there employee's family or personnel life plan on doing nothing else with your life but being at Darling, They will not hesitate to tell you what you want to hear just to keep you working unfortunately this includes straight out lying to you"
bad,"I've been here for 7 years and management has no clue what they are doing or what's going on, they make and break the rules as they see fit as long as it benefits them, long hours, 6 to 7 days or nights a week at least half the year, night shift gets screwed over on holidays, will be off one day but has to make it up on another so you really don't get time off, very stressful and mentally draining, management has their favorites that cruise through the company when they don't deserve it. They have made it where everyone does as little as possible and no one thinks about the next guy, no one cares anymore, this place looks run down and management is making it that way, very very poor,"
bad,"Darling isn't bad for a short term job.  The pay is decent and the job is easily gained.  However, management does not communicate in a meaningful fashion, making it very difficult to fix problems.  For example, small things stay broken for long periods of time as long they don't actually stop production.  This might present itself as a button that doesn't communicate for a piece of equipment causing the operator to walk the length of the property to engage a motor.  This sort of thing might go on a year and these type of problems add up.  "
bad,don't treat everyone the same way. good benefits.  not much more to state wish I could say it was a good experience for me but it really wasn't.  liked most workers but very tight knit in office.
bad,"money is great.. management preaches safety... but doesn't follow through... and when it goes wrong.. management puts all blame on the Driver.the plant in which I worked for.. could not keep GM,s... so there for nothing would run right... my fleet manager was racist.. He would play people against one another causing alot of unnecessary problems among employees.."
bad,"I honestly would NOT recommend going to Darling Ingredients for a main choice in work. The lack of respect for employees from upper management is pathetic. As is the communication of things of importance such as, changes in load schedules, what loads should and should not be ran, and much more. The working conditions are horrible because the plant is far from being maintained like it should be. Many OSHA violations are throughout the plant but are always covered up at the last minute for audits or corporate visits. Maintenance is another huge issue. Nothing is ever fixed properly and is rigged to last just a little bit longer, causing issues with equipment and run times. Over all the plant itself is one a one way track to being shut down and running out of money to keep it afloat."
bad,"They have great benifits, ie medical and dental is what i personally elected, i have heard vision is great, i also started a 401k through this company, it seems to be going ok"
bad,"They want you to work 7 days a week and get mad when you want a day off acting like you should be grateful you get to your life away. poor communication, nothing every gets fixed properly because the run everyday of the week, under staffed, over worked"
bad,If you have a family member in upper management you will succeed in this company.  This is a good old boy company if you’re not one of them you will not succeed.
good,Management will lie to you and overtime is not an option you ha e to work it or they will look for a reason to fire you had several problems management didn’t want to listen to me about it and they never told me I had vacation days I could use
good,"need help, not a bad place to work when the staffing is correct. Currently looking for a general manger, plant manager. safety has to be first. day shift and night positions."
good,Only work here if u are single or in a debt hole can't trust anybody it stinks and makes it skin stink its complete lack of communication u have to figure out what ur gonna do for the shift on ur own nobody tells u can't rely on nobody
good,Very poor communication. Will work you to death. Not competitive pay. They have decent trucks but maintenance on equipment isn’t the greatest.  It’s not a job you look forward to going to. Poor raises.
good,"It’s ok. I think it’s great for upper management but it doesn’t really have a lot of support and training for middle"
good,Loved my co-workers couldnt ask for better. When it came to the managers it varied by the day. I always wanted to get on their good side and see the best in everyone! Sometimes they liked me and sometimes they didnt...but I would go back in a heartbeat :)
good,A little unorganized. Procrastination and lack of or just plain slow communication about sums it up. Its not a bad job if you can withstand the smell. Sometimes... Wow
good,Its a good place to work but there is no disaplent.  Workers run company.  Not good....lot of employees still time and I don't like that. You dont steal from your work place or at all.
good,"Overall good company just need better structure."
good,The company is a decent one to work for. They used to promote from within but seem to have changed last few years. Too many new bosses with little real experience. Used to be more of a family now too Corporate.
good,"Darling was a great company.  I hear it's a difficult company to get hired on and when people are hired, they don't leave.  I learned a lot working at Darling."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Your job requirements could change at anytime without notice.  90% of the job is what you expect.  The other 10% was pure crazy.  Money is just ok, but for the amount of jobs they have you do, it should be higher.  Benefits were great!!"
good,"A typical day at work insisted of me cleaning up messes. I started out as a Utility guy, which most people do. That is the nastiest position but it's good money, and if you stick with them, you will move up quickly."
good,Coming into the company from the outside one of the hardest things to overcome is the culture due to not having worked at a plant and moving up through the organization does have you looking from the outside. The corporate environment is good but the culture is one of the hardest to break through. Advancement isn't very good within the corporate side. Niche industry that does well for itself.
good,Fun to work here. The people are amazing. The only bad Thang is that it's cold. The pay was amazing and the hours are great. 10 to 12 hour shift Monday through Friday.
good,"Driving an seeing different parts of Mississippi & Louisiana. It was a pleasure working with the company, as well as interacting with different drivers from different background ethnic & Customers on my route."
good,"Hired to open a brand new further processing protein conversion plant/ facility in Winesburg, Ohio. Responsible for hiring a full management staff & two shifts of employees to train for operations & safety. We were processing 4.5 million lbs. of raw material weekly. This raw chicken raw material was processed in to chicken meal and grease by-product. Four CDL truck drivers pulled raw & finished products for sales & procurement."
good,Was a good steady job were you had to be willing to put in the time and effort to get things done but everyone was treated well paid decent and had a good boss
good,"The typical work day starts at 6 or 7 am, with certain plants running 24 hours a day. There is opportunity to learn many skills and my experience with the people and management was pleasant and professional."
good,Good place to start. Relaxed environment. Casual dress environment. Free daily lunches. Small office. Could be a bit stressful at times. Wear multiple hats.
good,"This company provides a secure financial future.  They compensate you well for your actions, and provide a compensation package that is second to none in the industry."
good,"Typical day of work varies from day to day. Very fast paced atmosphere, must have to ability to make quick decisions and be a self-starter.  I have learned how to better manage personnel along and also time. Management is very helpful in training and making sure you have the proper tools to preform you day to day activities. Hardest part of the job is the lack of communication that can happen between co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of work is the family like atmosphere and the freedom you can earn."
good,I’ll be an acid to the company because I’ll be able to work with good employers and be able to work full time and I’m able to help when needed and able to complete all my tasks..
good,Darling ingredients is a fast paced business. If you are lazy don’t go  looking to work their. It’s plenty of room for a person to grow. But that takes time and loyalty. This job is perfect for the single male....
good,"great place to work at and the pay is really good."
good,Je wordt als collega zeer vriendelijk en respectvol behandeld en op je gemak gesteld. Mochten er fouten gemaakt worden dan wordt dit op een normale manier aangekaart en wordt hier op een opbouwende en ondersteunende manier op gereageerd. Verder zijn de werkmethode duidelijk en is veiligheid een hoge prioriteit.
good,"Despite being a huge company with thousands of employees, there is a lot of opportunity if you want it. You will get noticed,  trained and advanced. The company is hungry for administrative and management folks. They are fair and supportive. Can’t see ever leaving."
good,Great job the OTJ was very good and hands on good routes and great hours. Supervisor was awesome and fair. Just do your best and they did not micro manage you. Very compassionate and understanding.
good,I really enjoyed working at this location. I was only there as a contract employee and part time hours but I really enjoyed the staff and what my role required of me.
good,"Great place to work"
