bad,No work home balance they expect you to live at your job no sense of communication the general manager will cuss you like a dog and steals from the company it's a horrible  place to work would not recomend it to any one they dont care about you
bad,The worst company to work for ever senior management is a joke especially the vp of the company this is just in the Baltimore area the vp for that region is definitely the biggest joke that company has he sucks up to the senior vp so bad you don’t know where he stops and she begins
bad,Work Load is Ok. But the Compony is Cheap! I wish that the CEO notice that Because the cost of living and Way of living are different now.. not Like before
bad,My thoughts about clean are split. I worked with some great hourly guys who are unappreciated by management and are constantly mistreated in everything from wages to workplace safety. With a knowledge management structure that had care and concern for there employees this would be a good job.
bad,When we were hired we were told there was a lot of work coming up and we will be trained and signed off on vehicles within a month or so of being hired it is now it's January and its really slow we are not signed off on vehicles thinking that they would give the time now since it is so this is all Sun Trine sign everything but that hasn't happened at the office is very disorganized and never know what's going on you're always firing and hiring people also It's January and it's really slow we are not signed off on vehicles thinking that they would give the time now since it is slow to sign soft and train us on everything but that hasn't happened at the office is very disorganized they never know what's going on you're always firing and hiring people also with us not having work it dries it in a room and stare at each other and then management walks through and sees us all there and is aggravated at where sitting there even though it's there fault that they hard so many of us trained us and do not have work for us and they're looking to hire 30 more people in less than a month there philosophy is higher 30 or 40 people just to get for 5 out of that patch not a good business model at
bad,The people that work there wasn't supportive they lie on you they stopped one guy from getting a promotion with their lies the Romanians they want to rule everything they cheat on their hours they want you to do all the dirty work while they sit in the truck and smoke cigarettes
bad,"Horrible people, pis poor management, employees have no respect for the supervisors because there is no discipline for drug use or other infractions.."
bad,Treat their employees terribly.  Overworked and underpaid for the industry.  Management only concerned about getting their bonuses.  Management constantly lies to employees.
bad,It was a potential opportunity that lead to nowhere. You are literally just a number and with 0 support. There is never a way for you to be able to contact management when you need them and your literally left on your own demise. P&V sector has no growth and you will always remain in the same position.
bad,Do as your told no matter why. All they want are lap dogs and yes men. Management only care about their bonuses horrible place. If you raise any concerns you are shown a stack of resumes and told you are easily replaced. Hr only looks after management not the workers wh work hard to make their pay cheques.
bad,"If I could leave 0 stars I would.  In fact, if there were red flags I would leave ten or more.  I want to warn you about this place.  These people are the worst bunch of backstabbers I've ever met and I've worked in some bad places.  "
bad,"There is not enough work to keep employees busy. You are lucky if you work 20 hours a week. The hardest part of the job is not getting sent home before clocking 8 hours. Also, insurance benefits are taken out of your check weekly even when there is no work."
bad,Poor management  poor pay management doesn't communicate with employees. Safety is not the main priority for the company they only care about saving money for investors.
bad,"It’s a cut throat environment, the Eldorado facility is poorly managed, the Saftey leader doesn’t do their job. The rules change at the drop of a hat, and job security doesn’t exist."
bad,"The management is terrible, you will be sold a dream of a raise and never receive it. You will be on a inconsistent schedule and never have organization. You will be treated as your expendable"
bad,"As everyone is very negative and morale is poor - the company needs a complete culture change starting at the top with the CEO and his VP's down to the field offices. Employees want to do a great job and be respected, compensated and stay. However, Clean Harbors management is only concerned about their stock price and public image, so this has led to the massive employee turnover issue. The company needs to start thinking and operating differently - take care of your employees - they are your most valuable asset!"
bad,"Poor management! They discriminate and they are racist. There is a lot of favoritism. A lot of work during the summer but no work during the winter, you have to collect unemployment or use your vacation time."
bad,Yes you need a class b cdl but you will be working your butt off and doing paper work .than will be told you did a bad job and lied to your face like its ok
bad,"unions unions and more unions...and if you're not in one then you are screwed. you will receive zero overtime, zero salary increases, and are essentially the outcast of the company.  that about sums it up."
bad,"It's not the picture that they paint they are nothing but bullies and among everything else. They help each other out from their mistakes but run and criticize, demeanor other human beings. The entire facility needs some improvement. HR is just as worse they feel that everyone needs to see therapist. I use to like the job "
bad,Clean harbors promises you this and that. Never follows through with anything. They expect you to do safety training on your own time with no reward for doing so. They put me in the position to do supervision but still no talk about raise or even if I’m in training. Managers push off everything you tell them and ignore you like you don’t exist. Equipment is mainly old and rigged together and they bill there customers for equipment they don’t even use. If you’re looking for a career stay far away from here. Top supervisor pay right now is 22$ per hour. People here been here 30 years still making 21$ per hour. That’s how they treat there employees here. Then ask for a raise and they laugh and say I can’t even get myself a raise?!?!?! That’s Clean Harbors Management for you
bad,"Horrible management, lots of Favoritism, you’ll be busy one minute and be off for a very long time… I left for Greener pastures. Would not waste my time with this particular company ever again"
bad,Not a good culture to be a part of at all. Management is insane and somehow gets away with cussing people out all the time. The more experienced you are the more likely you will go away soon. Supervisors are all extremely inexperienced and will likely get someone killed in that line of work.
bad,You don't have to imagine. You found it. Imagine walking down the road and everything seems bright and cheery. Good training good pay. The sky is sunny. Birds are singing. And suddenly from out of nowhere you are ambushed by management. At least in Vietnam you knew who the enemy was. Here you will never know. They will attack you from the Shadows constantly. They will pile on work and never hire anyone new.  You will be expected to do the impossible. Don't waste your time. There is so much bitterness anger and resentment are you will never Escape it with your sanity. You will get lots of safety training in the classroom. Then when you get to your job you will find out everyone considers that a huge joke.  They are acquiring companies so quickly it creates an extremely hostile atmosphere and work environment that you want no part of.
bad,"1) Was Hired with No training after being told I would be "
bad,"poor teaching of new employees, some bad experiences with people, might go back if a few if the guys grew up there, they dont pay the greatest but its not bad"
bad,"All I can say is run, You do not want to work here. They will lie to you about how much you will make, management flat out sucks.  High turnover rate especially in management."
bad,"Horrible Management, Don`t care about employees, Not enough hours or work to go around. Not professional at all. Unless you know some one,your pretty much a number. No stable income and not enough pay for putting your life on the line with this company. Hydroblasting is a dying breed, might want to find a different profession."
bad,"The Field Services group within Clean Harbors is a complete joke. Management does not care about the employees whatsoever. Plan to never be home. Also, plan to be on cal 24-7 and only get paid while you are responding. There is absolutely no compensation for the time you are on call and not working. On top of this you are expected to drop everything in your personal life and be at your shop within 30 minutes of your ""call."" I would say that it's an okay place to work if: you are single, don't have kids, and are in no way interested in having a life outside of work. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. I am only speaking for the field services group. Remember, once you have accepted an offer letter.... You can officially kiss your personal life goodbye."
bad,"Way too many bosses who know absolutely nothing about logistics, D.O.T. rules and regs. Severely micro-managed. The vehicles are extremely old and will break down on you. You will never be promoted. You could be out all week and may have to be in the office on Saturday morning for a meeting. They care nothing for your personal time. They're mentality is that you either sink or swim. I was told that by the manager of the Dallas branch. They will train you for maybe two weeks and expect you to know waste codes and packaging. After that you are on your own to deal with dangerous chemicals and the embarrassment of limited knowledge to customers who deserve to be serviced properly and appropriately. You have been warned!"
bad,Poor equipment and management. No room for advancement. No raise since 2005. Your penalized for others poor performance. You not valued your just a number
bad,Racism is very bad at this place. The pay is not good and they will tell you they will not give you a raise unless you complete certain things. They would send you on a job and you have no info about it because they are ro lazy to go scope the job out. Short notice for sending you out of town.
bad,"This company hated its employees.  I never got a raise, even though I won a company award.  My VP told me I was already overpaid.  I was on call around the clock every day and often was refused vacation time as I needed to be on call."
bad,Hate it the managers talks behind employees backs 2 fac3d all the way and the person in charge is the one who causes all the problem in the work place
bad,"threaten to loose job"
bad,"Believe me guys, i was the best employee EVER, i was 3 times employee of the month, all boss know me,i was working in that company almost 3 year street exactly like a robot, i never have a holiday or any benefice, i was the strong worker man in cleanharbors, they send me to the harder job that no body accept it ! before i return to Tunisia, the big boss give me a job offer that i can be back to the company at any time. so now no body want speck with me, because i need an official job offer to can be back to alberta with my kids, very very very BEEEED company, Never scarified for her NEVER. You are just a number in cleanharbors Edmonton.  Ray Chahed"
bad,"Will take a normal person , brain wash him to a level where he drives the company pick up  truck to the liquor store to buy booze and won’t back up because he doesn’t have a spotter and then he will preach himself in next morning safety meeting, how Safe he was. "
bad,Absolutely the worst place I can imagine to work. Dept. managers trying to stab each other i the back. Coworker going to management lieing about people to keep them off her back and of course management does not do their own investigation just harasses and tries to intimidate or bully people. No surprise that morale and give a hoot  are In the toilet. Safety  has fallen way off. 8 recordable injuries this year so far. I don’t blame the safety people I blame managements get it done no matter what attitude. Safety first till it interferes with production attitude . People that care are getting fewer. Either retiring or quitting.  The person doing the hiering is filling the plant with people like himself.  The I’m entitled generation. They are useless like him. Good luck to you if your desperate enough to work there
bad,The management will not take the time to help you through issues. You are pushed to work long hours and if not them you are flagged as a non-team player. HR protects the management and will not help with issues. Management treats the employees like children. This company is toxic!
bad,I didn't like clean harbors because it was very stressful and poor management. They didn't pay enough for the job. I couldn't see myself advancing at clean harbors.
bad,The only good thing about this organization is that you will be given plenty of training and an opportunity to learn about environmental regulations.  Unsafe working environment.  Management is completely untrustworthy.  Don't let them know anything about your personal life.  Learn what you can in a year and than quit.
bad,"if this is the same company that bought Eveready in Edmonton, AB, you do not want to work here or for companies like this. CEDA, etc will just use and abuse you. You are expendable to these types of companies and the culture and workplace reflect that. I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,great place to work.  the office staff are always there to help you if you have a problem. they have your back. learned a lot with them in the management area. they will help you and guide yo threw it. worked with them for about 10 years.
bad,"No work, sales people do not find jobs.  Upper management lets discrimination happen.  Only worked 20 hours a week as a full time employee.  Received text messages with insults."
bad,Was a great place to work before Clean Harbors took over. Went straight down hill after that. Never have I felt so unwanted. I guess I was because they got rid of me.
bad,"no  job security, new workers get more work than workers who have been with them for years. no travel pay to get there.  no permanent camps. location changes constantly."
bad,The lead material handler is a psycho and shouldn't manage anything. You will be treated like a prisoner. Its dirty horrible conditions and a 4am start time
bad,"Worst job I ever had unless you don't like to be home most of the time and you don't have any bills to pay then this job is for you. only got good hours during the warm parts of the year but could never use vacation because you would use it all up trying to get a pay check when you sit at home, management would say they are working hard to get jobs but pretty sure they didn't care cause they were on salary so they got paid no matter what they would just tell you that so you wouldn't be looking for another job, thought our office sucked but went to other places to work and would hear the same problems so it was all over clean harbors the common question when working with other offices is ""You guys staying busy?"" then after the first of the year(2016) clean harbors stopped matching 401k's and there are no bonus's what so ever so no wonder they are a billion dollar company, hardly had any jobs where you could be home with your family or make any plans to be home its was basically when they would call you need to show up for work, then I put in my two weeks they wouldn't even put me on the schedule after I did, I tried talking to higher up management to see if any thing could be done about it and nope I was told I could talk to him about stuff but when it came down to it no help at all, if they ever messed up on your paycheck it took them forever to fix it I'm sure they were hoping that after so long you would forget about it and its so hard to get ahold of anyone to get it fixed, been on many jobs were we don't have the right tools for the job or we would just have to make something"
bad,This is one of the worse companies that I have ever worked for.  Stay away it may seem like a great place but it is not.  Operations Manager has entire family working for her.
bad,"They sell you a dream and that's about it, they say they are about safety and then pm will make fun of you if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, management is a joke all they care about is how they look in the eyes of the corporate office, the insite supervisor on my crew bullies other employees to get his way and then when you stand up to him he calls the gm and has you reprimanded. taking a job here was the worst mistake i ever made. If you try and use a sick day or vacation day they tell you they dont have coverage for your shift and that if you dont come in they will write you up. LOW PAY, zero room for advancement, and garbage benefits.  I am actively looking for a new job"
bad,"Clean Harbors is not a place to work if you are hoping for advancement or long term employment.  Promotions are made by favoritism and raises aren't enough.  The hourly wage is barely above poverty.  If you have medical issues and  you can't do all what your job description says (even if you never did all that is listed in your job description) they use that excuse to let you go.  When you go out of your way to go above and beyond you are not noticed for what you do.  When you do something that another employee told you not to do,, All of a sudden that employee is a supervisor and you disobeyed a directive and you get a 3 day suspension."
bad,"Do not work for this company. It's the worst company that I have work for ,  low pay , to many to no hours , they claim safety is their first priority, but it's not as a matter of fact it's their least concern. I've seen employees in very dangerous positions and they just made fun of them if they didn't want to do it if they didn't feel safe. No bonuses or raises. Absolutely no qualified leadership or management. Cheapest company ever. Bad equipment and tools. I would not recommend this company to my very worst enemy."
bad,"We are a company who works with hazardous waste, our goal is saftey while maintianing production and a clean evironment."
bad,"Difficult and filthy work for low pay. Bad management, moral is terrible.Work place is like a run down mini storage. Very sorry I wasted my time at this place."
bad,"I would suggest staying very far away from this place. Management only cares about numbers and safety is dead last. The leads will throw you under the bus at the drop of a hat to make themselves look good. The average work week is 50-72 hours but hey at least management gets every weekend off. I'm incredibly surprised that this place hasn't burned to the ground with how they shuffle the hazardous waste or how the state even continues to let them operate. I have never experienced to this level such dishonest, disrespectful, careless, and two faced behavior at work."
bad,"This company has a major disconnect between management and employees.  I worked at the head office in Edm and it is ridiculous, the staff in AP are scared of their boss; the billing and transportation depts are kept in the back because they are too loud (but the best group there); management all went to school together and are best buds - but are not friendly with other staff; purchasing manager is a complete joke -  most arrogant boss ever, works half days and even then he bluffs his way through conference calls and lies through his teeth about his ""busy"" work schedule - a complete joke!! If Norwell had any clue they would have someone there for him to report to - extremely unprofessional, awful work environment!!  Half the people are looking for other employment - no job stability, they don't tell you there are no sick days, they deduct a vacation day as sick days, no raises - yes no raises!!  WTH is that!!  Cancelled their stock program, cancelled their gym membership reimbursement - OH AND don't even think about training...you are left on your own!!  No moral and everyone in the field hates head office and visa versa...all you hear is complaining; the job description is not the actual job you do either; My biggest mistake ever was accepting this job!!  Do yourself a favor and save a headache....don't bother with Clean Harbors, they pretend to talk a good talk but are far from it and are not what they advertise at all."
bad,"I was hired as a specialist but treated like a low-life.  Why bother? - to put a monkey in a position to fool everyone about being legal.  This company nurtures a culture of non-compliance.  When you want to do your job and abide by the law, you are ordered by senior executives to shut up and keep quiet.  This is a large American company doing business on Canadian soil with total disregard to laws, health and safety in reality.  In theory, they talk a mean fight, say whatever they want but put in writing something that makes you think it came from a REAL company that wants to do the right thing.  I agree with the vast majority of reviews - run screaming in the opposite direction and don't believe a word they say - cover your butt and get everything in writing.  I will have my day in court.  For proof, see what the Teamsters have to say and do to keep this company in line once and for all."
bad,"Look at the requirements in thier job posting for Thorold, Ontario.  DOT, EPA.......These are American regulatory bodies.  They have no standing in Canada. Clean Harbor's has always been oblivious to this.  They are grossly incompetant and this is just the tip of the iceberg."
bad,"This company blew up one of their facilities near Buffalo, New York."
bad,"On call 24/7 but sit around days or weeks waiting for the phone to ring....but when it finally does, you better not be busy or have prior engagements or you're getting written up.   Either you're working 80 plus hours a week or none.  Cant support a family with such unstable work.  "
bad,You win the work and management does not respond to getting it done. Apparently the resources do not exist as management dishonestly proclaims that they can do any jobs brought to them...yeah right.
bad,This place is like a prison. you have no family life your there 12-14 hrs a day and nothing but drama. there is no job security at all. The gm does nothing but try to fire people and no-one there really knows what is going on and your life is in your own hands I do not recommend any one work here.... Worst job I have ever had in my life
bad,You where so much P.P.E. you sweat to death. Worst company i ever worked for.You cant work fast enouph for them. If you go their you will be sorry. worked their for only 7 months.when i gave them my 2 week notice they let me go that day.
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for as a driver..the pay is extremely low the work is dirty the equipment TV is old and the management here sucks.. no incentives at all... anx you may
bad,Clean Harbors’ management style is heavy handed from the top. This is due to the toxic nature of the company and the promote the last person standing mentality. They do not promote or recruit talent as they feel upper management have all the ideas. Stand in line and do what you’re told.
bad,"This company is not for truck drivers. You will have heavy labor, and the manager, are all related and very stupid when it comes to CDL drivers and DOT rules."
bad,Join this company if you like to be thrown to the wolf’s no training management has to go out every day to find jobs trucks sucks and are poorly equipped
bad,"Very low pay, no structure, bad management, old equipment, unsafe and dangerous conditions, low morale/culture, no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"I worked at this company at the Ryley landfill division for nearly 5 years. Every week going back the thought wasn’t about what to do all it was is how are we getting in trouble today. The management here is absolutely terrible. They have no clue what they are doing and have no clue how to manage themselves let alone anyone else. The pay is even worse for the hazards you work in and even if you are the longest lasting employee new hires can be paid more than you. I knew the place inside and out and that still wasn’t good enough. The management promotes bullying and even adds in to get things more heated. If you like being treated like absolute garbage then by all means work here. But take my advice and avoid it at all cost. Even now I hear how everything is my fault or how the managers are going to treat me next time they see me. When I started there we had full crews of new hires at the same time as me. When I left I was the last of those hires there. This facility itself is trash and unless management changes there’s no way I’d even advise my worst enemy to work there. "
bad,"Avoid if possible. There isn’t much respect from management or from co-workers. There’s a revolving door of employees and nobody’s likes each other. "
bad,All our jobs are going to India.   Really at Christmas time.  How cold and the owner doesn’t even face us.   He tells us how he appreciates us in an email but next day we are told we are out of work. Cruel unfeeling executive team.  We little people did the work to make you multi millions.  How do we get thanked.    Your jobs going to India.    We are human with families.  This is USA. Support your country and employees.
bad,"Good company to work for experience. Sad aspect is as a tech don't expect up to 40 hours a week Sometimes, very slow you Couldn't afford enough 40 hours"
bad,"Management plays favorites and you will not drive a truck for several months. If you plan on working full time,good luck !! You will be sat down multiple days of the week and they will only use you for emergency responses at all times of the day and night. The stress begins the minute you show up for work until the last minute of the day. This was by far the worst work experience of my life and wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. The turn over rate at Clean Harbors is by far the most insane I’ve ever seen. Have fun being on call every other week including weekends. The Seymour CT shop is by far the most poorly managed facility of them all !! Good luck if you dare work there !!!! This is not a joke,this is reality!!!"
bad,The bigger this company gets the worse they treat their employees.  There is no loyalty.  Management cares only about the bottom line.  Beware before accepting a job here. It is a sweatshop.
bad,Senior management from the district manager on up are disingaged from daily operations and fail to engage with employees. Don't report HR issues if you want to keep your job. Pay is decent from managers on up but drivers and chemist are underpaid to the point that there is a 50% turnover.
bad,"I was hired to be a truck driver. I have had my CDL for over 20 yrs, Management never had me drive, just labor. SO I was forced to quit. I'm a team player however I felt my Supervisor was extremely unfair, was in the short time employed for CH several other employees I worded with either quit or was actively looking for other employment."
bad,There are no great software people working at HQ. They buy all Microsoft products which should tell you something right there. It's a low-knowledge staff as bright people will not work there. You'll find typical suburbanites toiling away working nights and weekends because they have nowhere else to go. It's sad.
bad,"Day 1 - my position was changed to a whole new department and position that was NOT mentioned in the interview! My entire team was in the states and was very difficult to.work with. Unorganized, low pay, poor management and a horrible stuffy culture. Highly suggest to look the other way!!! Upper management gets paid a fortune meanwhile everyone else is compensated poorly. Can't begun yo explain how awful this experience was."
bad,"I would be told to do the job this way then be forced to do it another, I just went with the flow. Made all sides happy in the long run and learn and taught as I went along. Everyone liked and respected me, but the best part is that I earned every ones trust."
bad,Horrible company to work for wasn’t properly trained they throw you to the wolves I’m on my third day and I hate it then they are talking about in a few weeks leaving me to work by myself definite regret taking a job with clean harbors plus the management doesn’t know anything
bad,The manager is a two faced know it all hydro vac operator who talks behind all his guys back and feeds us lies to keep us happy. The office staff is to good to go out and do any actual work unless it has to do with a plant that's 10 min away. The trucks are rundown and will fail any MVI and the driver would be blamed for any ticket associated with the unit. Poor management and supervision unless your family or best buddies with the dispatcher.
bad,"The actual job would be enjoyable if it wasn't for the way the business operates. There is this underlying backstabbing culture at this branch and having read others accounts it is a reoccurance nationwide."
bad,"This is not a good company to work for.  General manager will not have your back, racism is rampant from all sides no matter what your race.  And god forbid if you are looking for another job.  Also everyone will try to stab you in the back.  AVOID."
bad,The only types of jobs that could be decent within this company would be office jobs maybe. I say maybe cause if you like sucking d/€k you might get head or give it your choice! When the head office tells supervisors and management there's a wage freeze on because they need to cut costs by 90 million dollars you might think ok because of our current recession. But then they turn around 3 months later and buy Safety Kleen another company bought on the backs of their field personnel. The company is full of backstabbers and bad management with the exception of one person and his hands are tied. I spent 2 1/2 years there as an operator. They rule with an iron fist and will screw you over any chance they get. They're under a directive from head office not to turn down any work so there's no time for family life. The lack of communication is horrible it's all last minute and they rarely get a pat cheque right!
bad,"I worked in fort Saint John division for a couple years, very unprofessional atmosphere, management speaks about hourly employees negatively in front if other workers. They profess to have standards, yet the equipment which is old n beat up is full of garbage and missing fittings and hoses etc on a daily basis. Again with training they claim to have a 160 hour process per type of equipment till your signed off on it, this doesn't happen due to them wanting to use all available operators for jobs at hand, best case will see a swamper able to run the equipment sent to train. Favouritism abounds there, if an employee who is an otherwise good hands peaks to a problem they have with something, often that employee is sat for a long period of time till they either quit or smarten up. This place for the above mentioned reasons has the good hands leaving when they have had enough and attracts the kind if nightmare employee you wouldn't want to work with, they lose customers on a steady basis for this reason, but are large enough with equipment and resources that they seem to survive in fort Saint John"
bad,"Definitely the worse job I've ever had! Would not recommend to my worst enemy. They treat you like they own you. You have no life. All work, no time to play. They text you at midnight telling you, you are going out of town the next day. Management ifs horrible too"
bad,No help when needed .... micromanager .. know it all  .... manager has all the answers despite being at the company less than a year... can’t take constructive feedback or advice from people who have a lot of tenure .
bad,Managers shows favoritism based on relations outside of work.  Also they are cliquish and give easier work to their friends and members of their clique
bad,Horrible management and no career advancement unless you are friends with upper management. They favor the ones they like and push out the people they don’t like. Especially if you catch management doing things they don’t want you to know they will push you out the door quicker.
bad,I was hired there as a second cook and I have experience cooking actual food. When someone is hired as a second cook with this company they are either making sandwiches for 11 hours straight or cutting fruit and vegetables for 11 hours straight. You obviously get your brakes the only good thing about this company is that you were paid every week.  The management Sucks and there is absolutely no confidentiality it’s one big gossip circle and no support
bad,They dont train people right way. Management only out for themselves. They dont help out when you need it. They dont listen to their employees. I wouldnt work there again.
bad,"Clean Harbors does not have any loyalty to their employees, and most upper management are bullies."
bad,"Company stresses safety is first and foremost but will turn a blind eye towards getting the job done . Co worker hired a year ago as a chemist and has yet to receive a respirator . Leader ship is lack luster and at best incompetent. Communication is a befuddled mess between higher ups and their team . Syracuse , Cohoes and Glenmont offices is a three ring circus of misfits and miscreants. Keeping track of hours and pay is archaic and antiquated. Good luck trying to keep track of it all. "
bad,"They do not train you long enough to actually know what you are doing. You are literally expected to learn everything and anything you need to know in 4 days max. It is not a great learning environment. The training is not sufficient or adequate enough to get you to understand how the company works."
bad,"Equipment is junk, Mangers believe the job trumps home life, so don't expect balance."
bad,People in management positions are negative and use others as scape goats. No accountability and Many Osha Violations. Very Negative Work Environment.
bad,"For the work I did the company made $35 an hour off of me.  I earned $15 per hour with no opportunities to advance.  I was the kind of employee stepping into this position with the willingness to do more than I needed to and pick up more responsibilities.  The company/management just took advantage of me.  I left the company having the worst experience I've ever had in the work force.  Management was terrible, they worked in an unsafe manner regardless of being in a refinery environment with hazardous materials and equipment, and I was left feeling like a dry husk-lifeless."
bad,The job title is misleading. The work is primarily Industrial Services. High-Pressure Water Jetting and industrial vacuum work. I have cleaned up only a handful of legitimate spills in almost two years.
bad,horrible place to work. I find that management has a reactive safety philosophy. They should be on their game before incidents occur. They also will scold you for any lottle thing and blame the worker. They lie and have no remorse. I've been there 10 years and this is whats become. save the trouble and find another company.
bad,Unstructured corporate management; most jobs sink or swim as little to no training; yet most co-workers are very helpful when requested.  Corporate office can feel like South Shore High School.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Worked for 2 different divisions and it was the same lies. You work hard after being promised promotions that never come. Raises every 2-3 years and the new guys get paid the same if not more than you do. Boom and bust cycle of work. HR is a nightmare to deal with. Sub standard equipment. If you like just being a number then this is the place for you! Guys on the crew were good though. Clean Harbors claims to care about their employees but they really don't. It's all about money, took away RRSP matching and benefits cost you more and more every year as they take away more benefits. Management has perfected the art of telling you what you want to hear at the moment. Its a dead end job, profits over people everyday of the week. The Clean Harbors way!"
bad,No quality of life. Too much travel and not enough personal time. There are no enjoyable parts of this job. No balance of life!!!
bad,I worked for this company and found out quickly that they do not have their act together. It is not a good working atmosphere. Racisim is very much present in this company. I witnessed how they treat blacks differently.......i myself am white....but at the end of the day...what i saw made me look for another job.....
bad,"This company was terrible to work for. Management was poor and always took advantage of people. They lied on my starting wage, bonuses, etc. They also lied on the hours you will work and the possibilities of advancement. It was not a safe place to work and managers made people do unsafe things, then made an example out of those who didn't follow. This company is basically a revolving door. The benefits were really good, but everything else was terrible."
bad,"Managers are on buddy system and are not adequately educated. Training was online only and had no other training specific to my job. Most of the people I worked with were miserable and made it even more unpleasant to work there. Manager had very questionable ethics and was very unprofessional, dislike by staff. Seemed to get off on discipline, reading his linkedin he actually puts 'discipline' as if it was a qualification LOL, would not recommend them to anyone, it is an awful atmosphere!"
bad,"Clean Harbors is a frustrating and difficult company to work for. There is so much disconnect and poor communication between the various divisions and within upper management. I worked as a customer service representative for a year. My co-workers were really great and the only reason I stayed at the company for as long as I did. There was a lot of difficulty with our managers, as they were completely absent most of the time and non communicative and not available when they were needed. The computer system is really slow and outdated. Invoices, quotes, profiles all had to be approved by the corporate office in Boston and it was really difficult to complete anything easily. The pay was pretty good but the benefits were just average and there were no paid sick days. Really high turnover, it seems like there were constantly new people being hired within the company but very few people actually stayed long term. Overall I would not recommend this company, it was not a good experience."
bad,"Worst company ever,  point system, long hours,  mandatory on call. Constantly at work so if you have a family or life don't work here!"
bad,"Not real good.  Stressful environment to work in. Co working were great.  Management was very ""male"" oriented and the hazardous waste events made for a pile of stressful situations"
bad,On call and they use it all the time. Lack of safety even though it is heavily spoke about. Will tell you what you want to hear to keep you there. Favoritisms of certain workers.
bad,"Highly dangerous environment you do not get paid enough for. Unlimited OT but MANDATORY 50-60 hours per week. No raises, little advancement, no union. Boss openly told us multiple times that everyone is replaceable and did not matter. Turnover was very high."
bad,"Pay is descent for hazmat. Vacation time is good. Saftey first atmosphere until a job dosen't get done."
bad,"Not a good place to work as a “vehicle maintenance mechanic”. Under paid, no over time. Management on site makes their own rules. Mainly do pms, therefore not a good place to learn if thats the route you’re trying to take. Management not good at all."
bad,"This was a job I took to relocate back to Washington State. I left a big refinery to come to this joke. They claim safety first but this place is so unsafe. You have to open up systems that have hazardous gasses and they give you a respirator with cartridges for protection, when you need to be on supplied air. The training is a joke along with the benefits."
bad,"This is a VERY shady company. There over 2 yrs. No raise. Drove a class b hazmat truck.made the same $15/hr as new employees. Benefits were horrible, with a large cap that you have to pay for them to kick in. They want new people with zero experience to brainwash into their way of thinking."
bad,"The management and corporate culture here are the worst I've ever encountered.  They treat all their employees except mangement like they're thieves. The ""benefits"" are in name only.  Your medical insurance deductible is so high no one can afford to use it. "
bad,"It's ridiculous "
bad,Never in my life have experienced such disrespect to the individual and such moronic management. Bct is a joke. Worst job I ever had. I was forced to fire good employees for no reason.  Put up with constant threats to myself and coworkers of termination. Blame game for every issue. You will be thrown under the bus.
bad,"-Hard back breaking work, "
bad,it was a great experince working in the enviromental feild. lots of new skills were gained with the work here. must be willing to travel away from family for long peroids of time.
bad,"The company was Eveready before being bought out by Clean Harbors.  When Eveready was running, the company would get a five star rating.  As for Clean Harbors, Sorry."
bad,Very negative atmosphere employees are bullied and hate their life. Management does not take criticism and is verbally abusive. Work is a joke and there's no thought to reduce strain on employees or generate quality product. Its like working in 1911 very low tech get used to paying hot potato and throwing people under the bus
bad,"Was there for 2 months - job posting initially promised a rewarding career with lots of learning potential. None of that was true - not even the job description matches what I did on a daily basis. Instead was hired on as a paper pusher that had been left by previous person for me to follow up, which I had no idea of. "
bad,its not a good place two work! if your new they treat you very bad! when they hire me and five other new people and we all move on! there seems two be a very big turn over there at this company all the time!
bad,"Management sucks ! HR helps them out to get away with things there not supposed too . The lack of raise is even worse “don’t let money motivate you “ is what they always say . 67WI is a joke "
bad,"The only positive about working here is coffee."
bad,"I worked for clean harbors for 13 years , your a number and will get treated as such. You should be lucky to have a job and will have to kiss butt to say thankyou."
bad,"The managers are terrible with checking up on new employees, they let a non manager train me, not a hire up so I was getting different tips from different people and I don’t know who to believe. It confused me which let to my performance."
bad,The pay is great as well as the benefits. Lots of hours. Managment is terriable as well as tools for the job. If something happens you will he blamed and excuses made so Branch mangers can keep their spots. Over heard managers laughing about running crews so hard they dont know which way is up. Daily conference calls where you will be berated if Bm is in a mood.
bad,"Job was not really Local 150. They put you on an M card, which only works at that company. Clean Harbors has a third party company that decided they randomly wanted to mandate that I take a sleep apnea test and pay out of pocket for it, even though I passed a DOT physical and was cleared for 2 years. The company was harassing me. Due to this I am employed because they can't fire me since it is a medical issue (on their end) and the union will not do anything for me. It is now Mid May and I have been out of work since February or March."
bad,"Clean Harbors has potential to carry out productive, organized environmental assistance throughout the globe, however the company festers with bad management. VP's protect BM's when they mistreat employees. The company would rather put up with bad work ethic from an employee than fire them because they do not want to pay unemployment. Instead of writing up or firing someone, they opt to allow the employees disrupt the work environment while going behind their back to do things that make that employee want to quit. The Peter Principle runs rampant in this company and it creates a lot of toxicity and unhappiness."
bad,"It was a lotta issues with management, Schedule was never made in time they will always have to text your call you and tell you will you have to go and sometimes that in pay traveling 10"
bad,"FSJ management is terrible."
bad,"Management is always pushing for more. Mandatoried for extra work days, with little warning. Hard to plan time with family and friends. Months without weekends off and many missed Church events."
bad,"Steady work, hours are there if you want them but management lacks proper communication and employees dedication is rarely recognized or awarded. On call is not mandatory but there is reprocussions if you are unable to answer."
bad,"Their culture is that managers are allowed to treat you and speak to you as they see fit, without consequence.  HR will openly tell you they cannot do anything to protect your rights as an employee.  They only look out for managers.  "
bad,A typical day at work would be where I would come in and converse with my co-workers and plan out my day.  To prepare and get ready to go out and perform my daily responsibilities.  Get any direction from my supervisor and then begin my day.
bad,"This company is more concerned about buying up other companies before it gives current employees a better wage, raises don't happen"
bad,the workers are good people but management is a joke. drilling division is a joke management will lie to your face and when ya confront them at the shop they will act like it never happened. terrible place to work  if you want to waste years of your life go to this division that is going nowhere.
bad,"they do not train anyone, throw them in camps and expect they will learn. They hire horrible managers who have no clue how to train or coach employees just sit in the office all day and yak on the cell phone.. The managment have no care for any of the employees or thier concerns at all you tell them your concerns till your blue in the face they just dont care... the most ignorant people in the world. If you want to work in camps stay away from Clean Harbors in Acheson.."
bad,"Worked there for 7 years, on entry you receive promises of opportunity to advance, yearly pay increase. .. never happens. Need to constantly bug supervision for training and performance review in order to receive merit increase. Unless you suck up you will not receive anything."
bad,"It all starts with management which sucks, no room for advancement, favoritism, not enough work, it’s not intended for a career..,  I’ve been here a year too long. It’s all about who u clicked with."
bad,Be ready to work more than you'll ever want at times and other times you'll be sittin at the house for months. They'll work you just enough with BS work to keep you from gettin umeployment during down time. I was literally told that if I wanted a raise I'd be better off quitting and getting rehired. I worked there for 5.5 years. Management is making it a worse place to work by cutting things that benefit the workers. Such as rooming by yourself and being able to choose your own hotel to live at.
bad,The made it there private hunting grounds that's why so many deer get killed on hwy certain rules for certain people. Some things are looked the other way. The management dont apply to the rules the try to enforce.
bad,"If you’re a buddy lots of hours. If you’re not a buddy then expect to be treated poorly."
bad,"Don't go to work Here! They will pay you commission and it will vary every month. Commission keeps getting worse every month, lower and lower. They will promise you a raise and lead you on but it the raise never happens. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"This company was a big disappointment, they sell you a dream then give you a nightmare they sent me all the way across the country to train for 9 days after that that's where the nightmare began I am a truck driver not a field hand..I mean field  tech all I did was run around like a chicken with my head off lifting carrying pushing pulling cleaning and breaking my back I did not go to CDL school to be a field hand I mean field tech I'm an equipment operator that's what I should be doing because that's what I was hired to do this company moves slow as molasses to get drivers signed off on the equipment I can drive every truck they have in the yard but not until they sign me off after I get the training to operate it which they never gave me. In my first 2 months two drivers quit one Forman quit and one field tech transferred management at this shop is horrible and running the operation into the ground two years ago they had 30 guys now they are down to 8 guys in the field and two in the office that can come in the field this operation needs an enema."
bad,"This job held a lot of promise for me and checked all the boxes that I had set for myself when I was looking to change companies and grow professionally.  I was led to believe that their was no issue with the salary that they were offering me and that they were healthy financially.  Within two months I could see that somethings were not adding up right nor did it seem that they even wanted me to do what I was hired for, they used me as an administrator.  I have no issue with administrative duties but I wanted more than that and I was promised more than that.   Management is all friends and if you don't fit in with what they are looking for or do not agree with their horrible business practices then you were seen as on the way out."
bad,"Clean Harbors does not treat their employees very well"
bad,The pay is not enough for the type of work you do. They don’t want to give raises. If you don’t suck up to the supervisor he won’t help you advance or get many hours. If you are a hard worker you get treated like trash and if you don’t work hard your royalty.
bad,"Some of the people are awesome "
bad,"I started at clean harbors as super b truck driver. In 2 months they let me drive super b only twice or three times. The rest of times they sent me on a vac truck for almost 2 weeks as a swamper and also covered wash bay. They also made me do jobs other than driving such as cleaning tank tops in another company. "
bad,The job was enjoyable and the co-workers were great. A great group of hard working people. Direct Management thinks a bit high of themselves. But overall not too bad.
bad,"Great company to work for until they decided to move our jobs to India to pay cheaper labor  "
bad,Equipment is tired and worn out. Needs to be updated. They talk the talk but don’t walk the walk when it comes to compliance. Company is top heavy with layers of management going through the motions day in and day out. Out of touch with front line workers dealing with their customers on a daily bases. Not given proper equipment to do required job task because of shoe string department budgets.
bad,"Poor management, very uncoordinated.  Was sent to work out of town indefinitely. Supervisors unresponsive to calls. Schedules were not kept. No work was available in the town I reside in, due to lost contracts at refineries. We were given vehicles that were not maintenanced or kept up with as far as fluids, and mechanical issues. People at the company were well to work with, but shared the same grievances."
bad,"I love to stay busy and this job really allowed me to fulfill that.  I like to work alone or with others, this job ,"
bad,They have no clear strategy for managing the business. It is always a reactive environment. They will lay off people at any time with reasons that make no business sense. This company is horribly managed with no processes and controls in place. Stay away from them if you can.
bad,"the management is lost and clueless, no future , management  rude to workers to many people walking around doing nothing journeymen getting paid for doing nothing , Forced overtime , lousy  work environment"
bad,"Management does not communicate very well. This is not a FT job it's a PT job.  Payroll every week is a disaster because the system is ""BROKEN""  The company cares more about their exectutive big wigs then the hourly employees.  Information is given or told to us late."
bad,Company has more interest in production than safety and management would rather over look safety issues then make sure employees are happy and safe. bottom line
bad,"The coworkers were ok, management is terrible. They have favorites and Lord help you if you upset the favorites. They are ok with bullying other based off their spouses. And if you stand up for your self or others they will make you pay for it."
bad,Temp dirty job .after couple of days will layoff . if you looking for temporaryly make some bucks you can tray but never think that you will make long-term
bad,"Very little pay for very dangerous work.  Culture of nepotism, sexism and racism.  HR and management work hard to coverup and sweep incidents under the rug.  Very glad to not work there any more."
bad,They talk about safety and employee retention in their town halls .... but do nothing about it but complain when someone wants to advance.   Wage increases are nonexistent.
bad,horrible working there. there was no room for advancement and the team work was never part of the enviroment at job. i would never tell anyone to work there
bad,"If you enjoy being bullied, micro managed and constantly being told how easily you can be replaced then this is the place for you!"
bad,"Need New management team for sure. Out with the old, In with the New."
bad,"The management is so backwards, there are constant seniority issues no matter what position you have. "
bad,I would not recommend working here. The atmosphere is very toxic. You work long hours for a low hourly wage. you have no life to work balance. they play favorites.
bad,"Managers delegate everything"
bad,"Clean Harbors offer services that are non-glamorous and specialty providers to a wide variety of clientele. Its fast paced and diverse. The cost however is that Clean Harbors is bottom line oriented without much consideration for employee development or progression.  "
bad,Since being hired for one location & unable to supply a FULL crew to perform a service it was then shifted to relocate to another branch. Unable to commit to promises provided during interview. Expect senior personnel to perform duties for inexperienced hired people. Unable to retain experience due to misleading & false promises. Retaining persons with addiction problems thus putting strain on the current crew existing in area. Pay is on the power end of the scale. Have all eggs in 1 basket not wanting to broaden additional areas of business. Poor work moral.
bad,"Accelerating Business results through Human Capital Innovation. Highly effective passionate change agent with a history of building strong relationships, consolidating disparate teams, turning around problematic situations, and deploying creative solutions within fiscal and organization capital constraints. Demonstrated experience initiating cost optimization strategies, resulting in significant savings. Excellent team leader, skilled at motivating individuals and teams to perform at peak levels."
bad,"Being on call 24/7 with no oncall schedule or pay is less than idea. The starting wage is low but good for a first job out of high school. Otherwise the work you do as a hydrovac swamp we is quite fun, there's health benefits and most of the employees are great ppl to work with"
bad,"The supervisor had his pecking order and the same guys went out in the same order every day no respect for full time employees part time winter warriors often made a higher wage "
bad,Within the last 3 years the Company had seen many changes that have negatively impacted diligent employees.  They do not take care of diligent performing employees.  Our Sales Manager has no clue how to manage people.  He lacks knowledge of Sales tactics and mainly focuses on operational control through micromanagement.
bad,"they don't!"
bad,"I was unable to perform to the best of my ability, because I felt bullied, harassed and treated unfairly."
bad,"They breached their agreement with me as soon as I stepped on site for my second season with the Peak Energy Services/Clean Harbors Wastewater dept. They agreed to camp only work when we negotiated then had me languish in a motel doing local work, not even making 40 hrs for two months. I left there for another equally lame company. Seair Septic."
bad,"It paid well could of been great to much ego in office, It was a good place until they got to big and hired them management from the broke companies they bought to run it"
bad,Management doesn’t abide by the rules and  everyone gets away with anything you want .......Very severe Favoritism  toward certain employees .........
bad,Management is worst of the worst. Cannot work together and only worry about themselves and profits. my advice get in and leave on your terms and short term goals. Work is not hard. do not need a degree( although I had one). do not settle in term of salary/wages you want.
bad,"Worked there for many years as a chemical driver.Very cliquey mgmt.No advancement,certain drivers are favored and the management are extremely incompetant.Overall C.H. is a good company.But this terminal operates in an extremely hazardous fashion with no concern for the employees or the enviroment."
bad,"The senior citizen management is completely out of touch with reality and society in general. Wages are depressed and noncompetitive compared to other industries. There is no system in place for promotions or advancement so make sure you negotiate a good salary for yourself initially if you choose to work at clean harbors. The location is awful and will cost you an additional two hours of commute time every day (do the math) without compensation. However, they do provide a shuttle (weekdays only). Also, prepare to do the work of 5-6 people and not just in your department (also without any incentive or pay)."
bad,"Work is not based on skill level, only how long you have been with them. Be prepared to sit in camp unpaid waiting for work. Coworkers whine a lot if you do get a chance to work because in their mind you have taken the job away from them. No one wants to help train you on different trucks because you are the competition for jobs then then. Terrible work culture, nobody takes pride in their work, just do enough to not get kicked off of site."
bad,If you are looking for a job that will get you through then this company is for you. If you are seeking a job to retire from this is not the company you want to work for..
bad,"My current workplace is an atmosphere of tension and fear of management. Numbers are important, but not for all employees. I am currently the only employee that is demanded to work in other areas outside of my hired job. There is absolutely no chance for advancement for me in my present employment. I am a hard working individual, highly self motivated, and very open to learning new jobs and hunger for the chance of building a great working relationship with management and my coworkers. I am currently experienced and trained in several areas in the chemical industry. I am also trained to drive the yard truck and make trailer moves for the entire campus. I am also trained to use the railcar shuttle, that enables us to move railcars without the help of the rail road company."
bad,"If you are looking at moving ...don't bother, if you are not a buddy of family member of upper management.  You can bust your butt, but no matter what you can never move up or even receive recognition for your acheivments."
bad,"Could be a great company if they were more loyal to their hardworking employees.  Pay increases are few and far between even though upper management is always announcing aquisitions of new facilities.  "
bad,"Tired of low pay for being covered in toxic chemicals. Alot of empty promises. Promised options for advancement and turn out to be lies. Poorly, managed and a small click feel about it. Living conditions were horrendous."
bad,To much work for one person to do and management is not supportive. Having a lot of responsibility with a non user friendly database. I've learned a lot on my own on how the hazardous waste industry is.
bad,DOnt waste yOur Time please listen to Me saftey this safety that lol wat a joke after a week they throw you to wolves and either sink or swim lol some dont come back after there boots are bought by clean harbors that should tell you something lol
bad,"If you want to dump 5 gallon containers of needles into a drum, then work for Clean Harbors! A decent job, minimal room for advancement.  Co-workers are what makes the job bearable.  They pay for you to get your CDL and Hazwoper training as well."
bad,"Typical day at work - Overloaded due to lay off's and over-expectations on the remaining employees to pick up slack."
bad,"Asked to do more than your job And when you do if they don’t not like you they will say you’re not a team player isolate in  terminate "
bad,"No raises,No place for advancement, need better management ,Management dont back drivers, no raises or advancement, benefits aren't the best ithe best"
bad,"The turn over rate is extremely high. People are unhappy with the large amount of work loads we get, and some of us are not compensated fairly for the extra work we do. We cannot get or keep enough good people who want to work. Management is completely out of touch with the regular employees that work the hardest and has a hard time keeping control and reprimanding employees who are slackers and do nothing but cause extra work for the ones that come into work and give 100% everyday.  When you are in a lead position management does nothing to make your work easy and more rewarding, especially if you are understaffed. They do not offer adequate support, with the false expectation that you can do it all, and over work you to the bone. At times I find myself doing a job that takes 3 people to do, this in my opinion is modern day slavery. The level of stress can be very overwhelimng. The false expectation of meeting compliance deadlines and offering your support to everyone when you do not have all the resourses is completely unrealistic and ridiculous. All they care about is numbers $$ and contribute nothing to the success of the hardest working employees. There is no opportunity for advancement, or higher learning, just useless conference calls, and power point presentations. If you are in a lead position you are basically stuck, until someone leaves the company. The company continues to make aquistions and doesn't have one clear strategy of doing things, to the point that it causes too much confusion and disorganization. There is no univeral game plan. There are always unexpected"
bad,the middle management at the plant was abrasive and abusive to staff and upper management did not intercede at all allowing them to abuse those who worked for them.
bad,"The management in Denver was amazing - promoted a team atmosphere - rewarded me for going the extra miles for our customers.  The San Antonio manager was racist, harassed me since the moment I arrived, played favorites and it was not a great place for someone with a family.  Enjoyed the customers.  Also when I transferred they took $5/hour from my pay."
bad,I traveled a lot. When management had their stuff together work went well. There was confusion about jobs and where we were supposed to go and do most of the time. The benefits were great but it was hard to get the days or weeks of vacation desired sometimes. The hardest part of my job was being away from my small children for months at a time.
bad,At Clean Harbors you will always have job security.  But you work 12 hour days and they will increase your hours with very little notice.  the managers do not have a clue on what is going on around the plant and they don't listen to the employees.  But the pay is decent and you are always guaranteed work.
bad,"If you want to be underpaid, and not get raises for 3-4 years at a time, this is the place for you.  The people who work there are good, but compensation and benefits are SEVERELY lacking."
bad,great accommodations is about the only positive comment I can make. very poorly mananged skills and work ettics mean nothing to them its who you know. very sad....
bad,"Co-workers and immediate supervisors were great people. Unfortunately the presidency, vice presidency, HR all went to school together so if you are not part of the ""team"" you pretty much are on your own. Safety and any business sense are are not on the agenda only what makes the ""team"" look good to the mother ship in Boston."
bad,"Corporate office does not pay well. Not liveable wages. No room for advancement. No reviews. No raises. No recognition. Morale is low. Day-to-day isnt too bad. A lot of paper pushing but thats expected. Decent benefits including PTO and 401K match. Coworkers of mine who had been there 7 years only received two 2% raises in their time with the company. "
bad,"I would pull the job orders and work through as many as I could and performed well"
bad,"Not sad to leave the company, but will miss my Safety-Kleen team. A lot of good people here strive for excellence, but are not recognized by Clean Harbors."
bad,"Schedule changed constantly, did not allow much time for life outside of work. Safety was consistently compromised for production numbers. Management was not impartial and played favorites."
bad,"This is a very good job for someone who wants to commit totally to the company.  If you don't want that, look elsewhere.  You can learn a lot, but, unfortunately, with great cost.  Juggling the personalities of the team you'll be sent out on jobs with can be as much work as the job itself.  High drama, always.  Truly exhausting.  That said, you can make some good money with the overtime, but it being an emergency response company, this overtime will almost always be unanticipated–you'll lay down your head to sleep and the phone will ring, you'll be on your scheduled day off, not on call, and the phone will ring, etc. etc. etc.  Go in understanding you're not going to change anything, but that you can still learn quite a bit while you're there if you want.  Most importantly: Work safe!"
bad,"clean harbors was great to work at,i would like to keep working here if only they would raise my wage ,i would like to help another company grow with my experience"
bad,"Clean Harbors consistently makes changes to its structure.  In 2 years I have had 4 bosses, 2 title changes and the bonus structure was cut to 1/3 of the original bonus plan.  There are no annual increases at the company and the 401K match was reinstituted in 2017 to a maximum of $750/yr.  The company has great potential, however promotions go to ""yes men"".  Programs are designed to spur customer interest, however managers and service lines fight for revenue, not what is best for the client.  The organization is operationally driven and the customer becomes secondary. "
bad,"Duratherm Inc,was acquired by Clean Harbors, during my time at Duratherm was a great experience I enjoyed my position as Human Resource Manager I was able to increase the employee moral and maintain an excellent employee management relationship. I worked very hard during the acquisition. "
bad,Company takes advantage of you. If you are a hard worker they dont care. No communication with anyone. They will not pay you what you are worth. One minute they may put into your 401k then the next they take it away. They dont supply the tools and equipment that you need to get the job done right and in a safe manner. This company only cares about expansion rather then the people who work hard for them each and every day.
bad,"No Overtime, no bonuses, no safety incentives, no perdiem for out of town, no advancement, not even a Christmas dinner. I’ve worked for other oilfield companies and was treated a lot better. The weekends here were good, lots of time off, but it’s a lot of time off to be broke and do nothing except stress over unpaid bills. The commissions check barely makes a difference. Not recommended if you have a house, vehicles, children etc. Management expects the most out of you, and threatens you to sell oil, if no sale, than your termination will be near. Other coworkers were the best to work around and very helpful. Wish to have stayed longer, but have bills to pay."
bad,"stressful work, hours always vary management not  competent on scope of work some days you might have work some days you dont raises are very hard to get"
bad,"day at work working"
bad,"I worked here for 2 months. Didnt receive the proper training but was expected after 2 weeks to be working on my own. I was told i would be working 50 or more hours a week when in reality i was barely working 1 day a week. The rest of the week i had to try to get hours in on the computer for training which stopped getting approved.   "
bad,I would recommend using clean harbors only as a last resort for work when all other options have been exhausted then apply here. You do work outside a little in this job opportunity so be aware.
bad,"Clean Harbors touts itself as a leader in the environmental field, but after working in the UMO = Used Oil Division. Don't expect much in the way of pay or advancement. The company is currently under financial pressures, and is struggling. Competitors in the used oil business is eating their lunch."
bad,lots of travel and hit or miss work.  not bad if you like 90 hours 1 week and only 20 the next.  very dirty work and smelly at times.  lots of hotel time.
bad,"Have all equipment started and ready to go. At the end of the day clean tracks, etc.... Hazwoper jobs. Weekly meetings. Always on top of being safe!!"
bad,good people to work with on a daily basis but management is hard to work with. promise you the world and get nothing in return.
bad,"A typical work day working out of the Clean Harbors Sulphur, LA Office is unpredictable. The General Manager is Two-Faced and lies about everything. Example: We didn't have work gloves many times so we brought it to his attention and he replied; (Oh yeah there's some out in the shop). which was a lie. Also, I Had worn out tires on my Tractor Truck and I told the Supervisor about the issue and he told me that; (The Tires Are okay enough to Continue hauling loads). The Bottom line is because of the Manager's carelessness I could have been pulled over by D.O.T. and fined personally if I would have continued driving the truck with those worn out tires missing tread down the highway. This manager is deliberately hiring people to do jobs without giving them the proper PPE and training they need so that when the company loses a job, the manager blames the workers for the loss of  jobs/work to the customer and to corporate to cover himself.  I predict this company will disappear from this area if the Corporate Office doesn't remove the Manager soon."
bad,Hire people with no experience...Employees bringing their girlfriends to work while on duty..cheating on their wife..rampid drug use...Kindergarten atmosphere..
bad,"Clean harbors is all about clean harbors and not about the employee. I learned a lot from this company. The management at clean harbors in Glenmont, NY do whatever they want, they come in whenever the want and leave whenever they want. The co-workers will bust your stones over the littlest things so you better have thick skin. The hardest part about this job is the on-call 24/7/365. No matter what you are always on call and even if you can't go out to a emergency call due to family issues, the management will be very upset and they will keep calling you. I had personal issues where I had to take off 2 days a week due to doctors appointments and the management got very upset cause they thought I was using them for the money. DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY IN GLENMONT,NY"
bad,"The job seemed fun at first (cylinder chemist) but the job has literally no need for a graduate in chemistry. I spent the 6 months working there as a janitor. Manager straight said to my face that they didn't trust me and it would be years before I would do the job I was hired to do. That and they didn't have time to properly train me so I had to pick it up via OJT. Very unprofessional."
bad,they change the schedule at least 2-4 times a week with no regard to your personal life. they preach saftey but when it makes them lose money if its the first thing to go. the hardest part of the job is just learning the job you get one week of training then they throw you to the curb but they tell you it will take six mounths to realy no what is going on.
bad,"They will work you to death if you let them. Benifits are marginal for the work and risk involved. Management and workers are poorly trained. The database sysyem is agrivating, ancient and poorly intigrated across the company."
bad,Clean Harbors makes its workers suffer with menial wages.  Then acts surprised when everyone leaves on them.  They seem to have a strategy to suffer high turn over to actually paying their workers.     They ask for the sky but won't pay you for hard work.  Not a high end company.
bad,Many truly skilled and talented individuals working to support a strong company with a solid future beneath ever-changing direction and conflicts between leadership.
bad,"The hours are inconsistent, training is terrible. There is no work/ life balance here at all. You're always on call and management is highly unprofessional. Do yourself a favour do not apply here. The worst most unorganized branch of Clean Harbors I've ever seen."
bad,Same work every day. To much bureaucratic. Management tries to make it a good place to work for but stalls often. Lots of promises that never come true.
bad,"Love what the company does for the environment, people are really a team. But billing department is very hard and working until Midnight during the month end is too much."
bad,"This used to be a great place."
bad,"Rushed out of safety meetings and they try to make you skip safety steps just to start the job sooner. Supervision and management bully anyone they can look down at, will tell you to your face that you are simply an expendable bill to them."
bad,"Money was decent, management style is another story...high turn over rate."
bad,As a technician you will start out around 13 if you are lucky. Pay raises are very slow in coming! If there is work you will work if there is no work you will set at home waiting for them to call. If you do not respond when they call then you will not work the next time. They own your time off as well. Some travel if you are one of the in crowd. they claim safety but they have  incompetent managers trying to lead you. The bottom line is the buck. Definitely a good ol boy network combined with nepotism.
bad,"Interesting job that keeps you busy but almost too busy. Everyone you work with in the field is great but when you get back to the shop you are on the defense just waiting for someone with a meaningless or made up title to make you feel small.  Unusually high hostility between divisions.  Equipment it's not bad depending on division lol.  Wage seems low but when you compare it to the amount of work you actually do it's pretty decent.  Bottom line is you're never home,  and if that is the kind of life you want to live then it's not s bad place to work."
bad,"Asked to do confined space without proper permits / protective equipment, infrequent hours, favoritism regarding who received hours and poor management."
bad,"I'm going to separate my review in a positives and negatives section;"
bad,"Used to be good working there before ( Eveready) but since it's clean harbors it is getting worse, they put the wrong people in management and they want you to be like a dealership, there is a lack of personnel, too much on mechanics plate for the salary they pay them."
bad,"I'm very disappointed with this company. The pay is good but we are fighting for hours, there is lots of drama and pettiness between coworkers. Management seems very unorganized. I left a good job to come here and I regret it everyday! Looking for something else."
bad,Pay is good management is poor and they don't take in whats best for the workers. And wen we have planed schedules they didn't care about what we got going on with our families
bad,"One of the most unorganized companies I’ve ever worked for. "
bad,"Great place to gain some experience. However I there was a lack of advancement as well as a lack of interest to help me with advancement from management. New employees were making more hourly then myself after 6.5 years of loyalty."
bad,they will cut your neck if it keeps there big bonus's coming in.
bad,Long hours with people who were miserable was what I encountered during my short time here. Management did not communicate well and feed back on work was non-existent. Most of the co-workers were unable or chose not to train and teach new employees the ropes.
bad,Good money but no advancement opportunities and no raises in YEARS literally. Very hazardous to once health (hazmat exposure) physical and mental health as well as destructive to a healthy family life.
bad,Lots of internal bickering in upper management. Poor communication at the top. Good money and accommodations when traveling. Little to no OT with local in refinery work. Tight knit crew. Senior crew members watch out for the new guys. Long on boarding process takes 2-3 months to complete and strict on safety. It’s a slugfest with management and VP that gets ugly.
bad,missing money from paycheck for over a month. They act like they dont know whats going on. They also say they pay for what your signed off on but they hire people with way less experience with more money than those that are competent have more experience.
bad,Well fort mac is union and be prepared to sit and not 1 or 2 days if you're under a yr seniority  you could sit 4-9 days outta your 21 . That's really the only bad part I found besides the typical useless union crybabies
bad,the work place bulling from foremen will happen if you dont have a skirt.you also get called out of your name if he feels like it.and nothing gets done even if you go to the higher ups
bad,"Need to be here longer for accurate review. There is very poor communication at Clean Harbors. Benefits need be much better especially for type of dangerous work performed; high deductible before they pay for anything, no match on 401K."
bad,do all the work so the supervisor can sit in the truck then crack jokes an act like the man when your the one in the scba mask doing all the work risking your life
bad,"Tools and equipment broke right and left, and had a very hard time getting new ones, The work environment was also not the best. no chance to move up but the hours were good and you got as much overtime as you wanted"
bad,"Can be a good place to work but the promises never come through, management is less that desirable since they micro manage everything, co-worker were great to work with, the hardest part of the job was waiting on the estimates that were taking to long, fabricating and repairing"
bad,"Employees and managers are hard working and dedicated. Equipment issues (old, beat up) are constant due to the aging of assets. Corporate is heading in the complete wrong direction, focused on acquisitions instead of retaining talent. The result is a talent drain company-wide. Job security is non-existent if you are a manager. Corporate HR has created an environment where employees run the show- managers are guilty until they prove their innocence in nearly every scenario. Advancement opportunities abound here if you can behave as though you are being recorded every second of the day. The experience you can gain here prepares you greatly to work for other companies who still value their workforce. Also- the company has a nearly impossible to achieve bonus plan which they refuse to pay out nearly every year with one excuse or another if by the grace of God you can meet the goals-usually they make acquisitions in order to drive down EBITDA so they won’t have to pay them. With all this negative, it is still a good place to work for the right person, because coworkers and most managers are great people."
good,One too many lies. On my interview was told what my pay was and it was held back three weeks and to get the job had to settle for less money. One of the trucks that was assigned to me I said to my supervisor that there is a transmission problem. He said to me don't worry about it. And when the truck went down with a transmission issue I got a time telling me how much it will cost
good,Was very unstructured company to work with. Very mismanaged and a number of issues happened regularly. Poor grocery for clients. Equipment Breakdowns and lack of trained staff to work with. Unsafe
good,The review of JII is best communicated through a thorough discussion of my experience while employed at JII.  I am available for discussions upon request.
good,"Working with hospitals on waste program long sales cycle. Calling on pharmacy c units and floors. Education, material managment dept"
good,"Terrible management making terrible corporate decisions, Burns you out real fast!!! Changing corporate direction to line there pockets, driven by greed!!!"
good,"Good Steady Job"
good,I work with some nice people. The management is horrible!!! They change your work shift all the time. You can never get adjusted and neither can your family.
good,"I would not recommend this company."
good,"This company suffers in people management.  They have some terrible managers in key positions unable to be moved so employee retention is hard.  It was a culture where no-one spoke to each-other unless you had to speak to each-other... not pleasant at all, within 2 weeks i knew this was not the environment for me.  Management literally instructed to not screen anyone you see that has worked for Clean Harbors in the past.  They don’t even want past employees back, how crazy is that of a mentality in a company?"
good,My manager constantly forgot who I was and which Job I was on. The only way to get a raise is to threaten to quit. They under pay compared to similar companies and frequently run low on enough work for everybody.
good,"This place is a good place to learn about almost everything,  because we do almost everything. But management lacks due to favoritism. Instead of dealing with problems they get into their feelings and put cast certain individuals while uplifting other individuals.. all you need to do is be tattle tale and you are assured to be promoted even if you dont know what tou are doing.."
good,"This company is NOT diverse at all!!! ALL the upper management is white and the plan to keep it that way by allowing management to pick their successors. If you are hurt on the job, they would rather pay high priced lawyers than to settle with the injured employee. This is a multi-billion company with a CEO who pays himself a salary of $16M a year, owns a $40M yacht and millions of dollars in property in Dallas, yet refuses to pay injured workers or have affordable insurance."
good,"While Clean Harbors does give you hourly based pay and plenty of hours (average 50 hours a week), management does not care about you. New systems are implemented every week and you are expected to comply with zero training. If you need a job, you can make money at Clean Harbors. If you want a career, look somewhere else."
good,the work is not the issue it is the people that you have to work for.  Top down the idea is to work hard and not be given a chance to move up in that area you have to move around in the company.
good,"Clean Harbors is not a bad place to work.  You work long hours depending on the days work load.  Pay is good to slightly above average however, corporate decided to stop contributing to 401k's to save money for the stock holders.  One of the reasons I left."
good,Good experience with the environmental industry. A lot of pressure to bring in the bucks but that's to be said with most companies. All in all a good group of people and enjoyable work experience
good,"Two faced owner. Cared about his own pocket. If it wasn't for us back brackets, he wouldn't have a company. That's to bad. Losing accounts and still hiering people, stupid."
good,Very specialized work with a very demanding work schedule.
good,"Some great people work at Clean Harbors but management still runs the company as if they a small company. Employees are constantly laid off and work in fear of the fact that they may be next. constantly doing more with less. Company makes acquisitions, but goes years without employee raises."
good,"Low wages with little to no career advancement. Long hours, weekend work expected with no additional pay. Very stressful work environment............."
good,just a fair company we had a work shortage in fort saint john and fort nelson and instead of laying us off they kept us there not making any money not fair happy
good,This place cemented my ideas of unions. They are nothing but lazy thugs that break the back of companies. These groups need to be treated as cartels and disbanded.
good,This job seemed great until the management refused to support the things THEY said and let you the worker take the fall. Don't worry they will also make sure that you are unable to get things you need after you are fired
good,"CLean Harbors was a stepping stone for any entry level employee. Lots of promises were made. Once hired there was a lack of training and i was essentially a truck drive without the truck driver pay. I enjoyed my coworkers, but the hours were long and i was never home."
good,"Lack of training and low pay. long hours most days and some days hardly any hours. horrible Per diem Friendly staff, but that's about it. Hope you like to drive a truck because that what you are, a truck driver"
good,load and unload contaminated materials /soil learned different types hazardous materials .co-workers are friendly
good,"Lots of good people work here, but none of them seem happy. Management is mostly the issue. Really toxic workplace because everyone feels trapped. They overwork people because the management doesn't feel like doing any work."
good,"Depending on location all employees are not treated the same . The office I work the bigger screw up you are the better they treat you by giving you plenty of hours and the easiest jobs. The health insurance is expensive with high deductibles. Other than that the other benefits 401k, Dental and vision are ok. The performance based pay system is good the problem is managers chose not to learn how to use it."
good,"You make good money, but the work is dangerous. Great people, supervisors are great, but management was out of touch with the workers. Hard on family."
good,"I worked here for four years as a technician for 3 years and as a chemist for 1. "
good,My commute was a 140 mile round trip. From Fairfield to San Jose every day. The commute was too far and was very fatiguing being that I was driving as my position required me too.
good,Could be a terrific place to work if management would pay closer attention to their employees. there is no incentives at clean harbors. you are asked to do do do but you get nothing in return.
good,It is a hostile work environment . It messes with your sleep you work crazy hours and they call you in a even on your days off as reserved. Some people you work with are cool and the rest can be annoying.
good,Senior management needs an overhaul. Senior Management treats mid level and below personnel as if they were imprisoned in their role. Employees are REQUIRED to work 12+ hour days 6 days a week minimum. No life balance.
good,"Newly purchased Lube Oil site for innovative re-refined blending of finished products.  Blending, packaging, drumming, bulk loading and unloading, logistics, and warehousing."
good,"But the management drops the ball hard on its employees, falling short on well being, scheduling and concerns. Lets the benchwarmers and the d*ckblowers get away with bloodshed while the honest people working hard and keeping their noses out of the bosses rear ends, getting reprimanded and silently punished with hollow promises and constant budget cuts.."
good,"The job security is pretty good and the benefits are okay. The pay isn't very good. The management is the worst part. The GM is petty, vindictive and talks behind people's backs."
good,no team work environment no team work pulling together division going separate ways pulling against the company.the company took 401(k) match away incentives raises and morale fell
good,A typical day would consist of doing daily contacting of plants and clients and making sure they have what they need and or its on its way.
good,Over all my experience was terrible and at the same time the organization didn't know what they were doing.
good,"Required to "
good,"people are great to work with.DAy is full of PM schedules. do daily inspections,"
good,"I started out in the wash bay and then slowly started working on the equipment. Somewhat understaffed shop wise, one employee was practically useless, yet still continued to be employed when should have been let go long ago. Shop foreman was useless, management was pretty much non existent. Shop is unorganized, ideas were thrown out to help out the shop cleanliness and organization issues but seemed to have been ignored."
good,"Typically I would test samples, work with my lab partner to solve problems, order the supplies, work the water plant"
good,"The corporate office micro manages the entire company and does not compensate hard working, qualified employees. Most days are spent sifting through the emails, text messages and phones calls all while time could be spent managing accounts and providing a better service and employee wellness."
good,"I was hired for predictive modeling. Management was not very enthusiastic about it and there is no room for growth.  Not a good place for predictive modelers, they don’t have passion for such quantitative rigor."
good,"Clean Harbors is an In Site Hazardous waste, General purpose waste and recycling processing company. We are located in Harley Davidson vehicle operations center. Over see all pre and post chemicals coming in and out of the facility. Manage staff in the water treatment plant, manage technicians who service all containers inside and outside of building. Heavy labor environment, morale needs to be kept up. Safety also needs to be maintained continuously!"
good,"I enjoyed working there only because of the people i worked with. Other employers taught me allot i didnt know. The pay was not at all good, very under paid."
good,Company is ok. Very hard to advance within. Raise freezes for over 5 years when the company continues to succeed. I have worked here for a very long time but feel that I have to leave to keep up with today's cost of living.
good,Everyone hated working for clean harbors.they have a very high turn over rate. They don't pay what you do and how much your from your family. They only give you 3% match on your 401k.
good,"If local Branch Management is any indication of how upper management works in this company then look else where Clean Harbors puts the worst people in Management totally not involved with what happens in a refinery on a day to day basis, make jobs up for people who are not really qualified to be a crossing guard let alone management"
good,"The supervisors will tell you what you want to hear to get you hired but as soon as you go through training and sign the papers, they are going to try and send you to California for three straight months."
good,"Clean Harbors does appear to appreciate it's employees. Nor does it seek to improve their employee's skills or compensation through employee development. Not a good company to build a career,"
good,"Running unit , great co- workers, learned to troubleshoot and fix small problems. being able to work with procedures, and  safety  manner. learn to work with vacuum."
good,In my experience the company was very unorganized or at least the division i was at in High River A.B. I found that the dispatcher lacked knowledge of being a dispatcher. We were never given appropriate job details and show up on a job without the appropriate tools etc
good,"Clean Harbors has grown by acquiring many small companies in Western Canada.  This stratgey has brough on considerable debt, and the fleet is aging in most of it's lines of business."
good,"Busy is great. Always work to be done at a pace of 90 mph with your hair on fire. Loved most aspects of the job as far as work tasks are concerned. The amount of work for one person is that of 2-3 people. Hours average 70-85 hour work weeks including days, nights, weekends and holidays. Non-accommodating to understanding family and work life balance."
good,"CHES is an unusual place to work, quite military-oriented in the treatment of staff and a bit too litigation-focused in it's treatment of common workplace events. The pay is low, but this is to encourage employees to put in extra time in an overtime scenario, routinely, to boost take-home pay and alleviate the need to hire more employees."
good,"good people, extremly hot during the day. i would have to say the best part of the day is the morning due to the low cool tempertures outside."
good,"-Most departments lack technical skills (excluding IS)"
good,Company used to be better about taking care of it's employees. Now they give training based on company needs and does not compensate accordingly. Does not guarantee 40 hour weeks or compensate for being on call on weekends and holidays.
good,Typical industrial job worked with & met great people. They provided everything needed to safely and effectively complete jobs. I would recommend this company.
good,This company changed names several times and was a good place to work until new management came in and wanted their own people in positions that had been held by long time employees.
good,"Benefits are nice, supervisor isn't in one particular branch. Pay sucks and long hours just to make ends meet. Higher ups are close so no matter what the employee says nothing gets done"
good,"For some reason they fail to mention that you aren't guaranteed 40 hours every week, and you can go weeks without work.  They are also usually understaffed."
good,"I became disillusioned by the company's changes and emphasis solely on productivity.  However this job requires sorting and packing hazardous materials into containers labeling and manifesting it according to all Federal, State, and local regulations."
good,Work and  all is well no raises  no promotion  employees are cool people some managers   qork do get slow winter rime always qorking outside a lot of supervision from upper management hard work pays low good work Experience
good,i was young at the time and didnt have th exsperience but they made me feel comforable by me being a young man in this type if buisiness.i worked here for a while but later found a new job
good,CSR- Answer 30-40 phone calls. Fix everyone else's compliance paperwork. Answer between 100-180 emails a day. Pay is terrible. Company supposedly doesn't have money for pay raises. Unfulifilled promises. Hard work does not matter.
good,"okay place to work, long hours, no annual raises, good people, lots of overtime, facilities could use upgrading, equipment could use upgrading, benefits not the best"
good,"If you want to work overtime there is a lot during summer months then it gets slow "
good,I really enjoy the organization and my peers. The leadership is average at best. Lacks consistency in leading and managing; the communication is average at best. Lack of trust from leadership.
good,"There is a lot going on right now with a lot of changes to management and not enough people to work out in the field. There seems to be a disconnect between what is going on in the office and what is going on outside of the office. I've worked here for a month and feel very unprepared for my day to day jobs. I spent an entire day trying to get a computer to work and not a single person offered to help me, including management. They paid me to do nothing for an entire day. Needless to say, I'm looking for a new job. I was also told I'd have uniforms and I still don't have them."
good,"A typical day in my position requires going over paperwork to make sure we have the correct equipment and PPE for the job ahead of the crew. "
good,"Learn a lot about dealing with Hazardous materials and how to label and ship it properly."
good,"Chances are you are going to work on a site with the likes of the TV show Dirty Jobs. You must be able to work in extreme temperatures and bad smell. You must be able to work on very elevates surfaces and small, dark spaces. You will be liftining, pushing, bending, crawling, and using power tools. Be prepared to sweet perfusely. You must be able to work as part of a team and that is very key."
good,"very long hours, hard work. not much of a social life,"
good,Exceptional place of employment. Busy environment that will test your skills and talents. Open line of communication between managers and staff.
good,"Work was not consistant and unstable. Not a 9-5 type of job. Start and end times varied. 24 hour emergecy response. Learned many different ways to complete hazardous and non-hazardous remediation/decontamination. "
good,No enforcement of attendance and punctuality. Work was easy there.Pretty hot at the warehouse though.
good,"There is a lot of travel. Sometimes for weeks at a time. When in the yard, it can be hard to keep busy."
good,"This MIS staff is great.  They are smart, dedicated professionals who work tirelessly to keep the systems updated and running."
good,I have a good job and it's a good place to work. Good benifits.
good,"Clean Harbors as a whole is a great company to work for. Their values and standards appear to be of good quality however, local management lacks the common sense and the initiative to follow those policies to better serve the company. In addition, local management uses micro-management techniques and lacks the respect of those working underneath. Everybody else works diligently to always achieve success, but is constantly interrupted by the insecurity of the local GM."
good,"You'll work with a lot of good people with great knowledge. Upper management is out of touch and ignores the little people, Spends to much time catering to Wall Street."
good,"And great industry to be in unfortunately the pay does not match the workload. "
good,Good place to work. Hours are long and have to work weekends a lot. Benefits are pricey and cover some no raises or  bonuses. Most the people are easy to get a long with.
good,"Clean harbors did not pay me union wage hours when sent on union jobs"
good,"•	Operate forklifts as needed, such as Hyster -Yale."
good,"This is difficult work. You stand around a lot outside in any weather. You will do exceedingly difficult things on a moment's notice. You work 93 hours a week."
good,Working out of state and doing carbon change outs building systems to run for the clean up supervision of the systems being ran or maintenance on systems with defaults
good,"Long days when working, occasional incentive bonus, received a lot of training, great co-workers, physically difficult work, too much time between jobs"
good,"The company has great potential. But the local management seems to be keeping things stuck in a Rut.  Management needs to get a grip. And if your gonna claim an open door policy, maintain it. Which they dont."
good,"Fundamental business focus of protecting the environment.  Very focused on stockholder value.  Strong safety expectation, but equally strong performance expectation coupled with shorter range transnational labor compensation."
good,"Never stop leaning the safety aspect in the oil refinery in dustier,the hardest part of the job is training the younger kids the important ness to listen and ask question if they are not sure of a task because we are working in oil refineries one mistake cloud cost your life or others,"
good,"Sometimes its easy job and  sometimes not so easy, learned a verity of running of equipment, most are good guys to work for. Hardest part is being gone months at a time, see different places."
good,"Unfortunately since this is an American company, there were a lot of times that they didn't understand that we are a rural community and that the office in Provost (which dealt with 4 other locations other than Provost) does not have easy access to some information from other locations.  They also didn't get the fact that the employees in Provost areas multitask in their positions.  In other words each office employee does a number of different duties. (e.g.: data entry doesn't do just that, they may also do accounts payable, accounts receivable, investigations, etc).  I found that and sometime the lack of access to information very frustrating.  I also found there wasn't a lot of support from local management."
good,"I worked for Safety-Kleen (Clean Harbors Co) for almost 2 years and the Branch Manager has the worse attitude towards his employees even though they make that location one of the best. He doesn't ever show appreciation when someone or should I say everyone goes above and beyond in there everyday work life to make the branch run smoother. I did gain a lot of experience in the environmental world from the Service Manager as he took the time to show his employees the ropes and was very patient. The job was about 12-14 hours a day on average with lots of overtime pay but, sometimes it got old and the OT pay wasn't even worth it after working long hours week in and week out. Clean Harbors in general is an a great company to work for with decent benefits and good pay."
good,This company cares nothing for the lives of its employees. They also don't care how much their employees give to them.
good,Have been with Clean Harbors for just about 4 years.  Not the most rewarding environment.   Lack of job security as well as lack of career advancement
good,You feel great after a days work at Clean Harbors because it is like going to the gym. But it is hard work and sometimes lasts through the night and into the morning depending on the job.
good,Good Place to work. Fun people to work with. Pay is about average.  high turn over in staff.
good,I haved learned a lot from this location. Been here since 1996. Meet alot of great people and learned from them.
good,"My primary concern is that the company does not pay for your CDL even though one is required within 90 days of hire."
good,Long days and extended travel required with this position.
good,"Clean harbors is a good company. But there is no room for growth in the company . I would like to work for a company that has room for growth and u could talk to ur manager about any problem that u have on a job. I’m a very good work I’m reliable, responsible and on time for every job"
good,"Very laid back job for most part, lots of sitting around waiting for permits, lots of jobs will be done in a couple hours and you sit rest of the shift. Its a good job if the hours are there, but they are not there at all. Management has there favorites and gives them the 12 hour gigs. Hours are not divided equally. One week you'll work 24 then 40 next then 60 . not consistent at all. Dont join during the winter you're gonna be working 2 days a week. This is a stepoing stone job."
good,"I've learned a lot about safety, and worse case scenarios involving hazardous waste. As well as commutation is vital when it comes to safety and getting a task completed."
good,Cleanharbors is a good job but I'm looking for a even better job with better pay to retire from! Need a very steady job.At clean harbors the work gets slow with hrs  at the end of the year nov and Dec.
good,"Was a great place to work, workplace culture was very good, the people were like family working there for 13 years never thought I would leave, admin positions were moved to the Red Deer office."
good,"stay positive and contribute daily with a positive attitude focused on being your personal  best in order to be prepared."
good,"great place to work if you don't like to be challenged.hours long and dull, no room for growth or challenge for change. The application process was tedious and computers outdated. a lot of horseplay and kid like management."
good,"Good place to work most of the people are friendly, wages are decent, lots of room to further a career if that is what you want. feels like a small company"
good,Learned a lot on the job. I travled a lot. I missed a lot of time with my family. Travel all over the U.S. hard work and Long days. Eating out and hotels get old really fast.
good,"Workin at this company was a great experience for me to learn how to do environmental cleanups. We were on call 24 hrs so, I had to be ready at anytime it was a call. Discipline and safety were the most important things on the job."
good,"On one day wasted 2 hours on wrong training module presented by management."
good,Great competitive company that works you hard but worth it love to work for the company would love to go back and work for this company again it's such a great learning experience
good,"Loads wastes properly and segregates for compatibility on transport vehicle."
good,Good company with poor management and work culture. Good job security. A stepping stone to a better position. lack of competitive salary due to exploitation of good experience
good,Clean Harbors has different types of jobs for anybody that wants to get into the Hazardous Waste business. It is a growing company and they always looking for new people to help them grow.
good,company did not provide proper ppe necessary to do the the job task at hand. poorly managed with no room for advancement. low wages for the job duties required.
good,Very large company with complicated organizational structure. A lot of opportunities as there are 55 lines of business. National presence in addition to Canada.
good,"Clean Harbors has both pros and cons of working for. The pros would be that there is room for advancement within the organization and the  ability to learn the ins and outs of a unique industry. I have learned a lot over the past few years that has made me grow and advance. "
good,"no set hours (16 hours one day, 10 the next), on call 24 hours a day; seven days a week (no on call compensation). Hard to plan personal life because of work life. Normal Pay and Benefits (Pay increases are not yearly and a battle to receive).  Wouldn't be leaving if I had set hours, wasn't on call all the time, and pay increases were yearly."
good,"Let me start by saying that all facilities seem to run differently, all have a different culture within the Clean Harbors culture (like comparing New York and Texas, same country but very different places). "
good,"Can be hot or cold depending on where you work in field. Safety is a big thing around there. Always look after yourself, because no one else will. Become friends with your manager show up too work on time."
good,This company does not care about their employees. The pay is very unfair and everyone is replaceable to them. More concerned about the higher up's bonuses then about their own workers making a fair wage.
good,"Love the daily job of sales, prospecting, account management. But the lack of Support from management and operations is tough.Staffing shortages from operations makes the increase of sales very hard to keep customers.."
good,a typical day would be 10/12 hours a day.  I learnt how to deal with sales people and the tricks they used.  I know know how to negotiate a contract for the benefit of the company I work for.  Management  could be better.   The culture is very fast paced and demanding which i find as a challenge in a positive way.  The hardest part of this job was was dealing with the Corporate Account Managers.
good,It's a good place to work for but what expected or responsibility on the job posting is not exactly what you will be doing.  The people in the office are great people to work with.
good,"Had some good years there until change in upper managment ,since this moral is very poor other managers are looking for work elsewhere four key people left within three months."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at clean harbors but was turned off eventually by the constant payroll errors,corruption in management(embezzlement and wage theft) and the rampant drug use thats overlooked by management,also rampant drug and alcohol abuse by management."
good,"Managers do very little to help employees excel. Little to no advancement opportunities. Work, however, is steady and benefits aren't bad."
good,"I like to work with that small team, team members love to share their valuable ideas and skills, also good coffee.this company is pretty good."
good,"I learned how to operate large forklifts while hauling dumpsters in the plant. Weed eating in steel toe boots, overalls that were to big and a hard hat in the heat of the summer."
good,well the money was good but no benefits and seeing your family such as your daughters sons grow up away from you and seeing them on a phone was hard also it wasn't a guarantee they had cut the position before i quit
good,Great family ran company in the north west. Very good quality and relieable work. Always on time and always impressed on what they can deliever.
good,"Better pay scale needed for non- management.Needs more Structure,Management - employee communication need improvement. Not a bad place to work , but not a lot of room for advancement."
good,This company was okay to work for. It's just really far out and doesn't pay well. The people are nice though. They give incentives and raises for good work.
good,"its ok over all, hard work but good pay. no work life balance, good for a single guy, not a family man. good to travel, see the world"
good,"typically 40 to 50hrs a week"
good,"na/"
good,power vac truck work/high pressure hydoblasting.Crews were good to work with for the most part
good,"The Environmental job is a very cool job ....... you can advance too a higher level in this Company. It is a Good Company Too but money into your 401K plan, you can get a lot of training working here."
good,needed to make sure to review every paperwork that would come in with waste and make sure they have all state code.
good,Worked there 6 years for little wages under hazardous conditions and was promised job at another facility when the one i worked at closed and everyone that worked there got let go. Other facility job never appeared.
good,cleaned up hazmat spills and purified tap water on Super Funds for the Government
good,Clean harbors is vary active in training their employees. I had the opportunity  site and travel around the North East.
good,"They are a great company, never worked that long for em . Cause I we got shut down and were all sent home. B ut I would go work for them again."
good,"transport transformers,load and unload oil from transformers, learned how to operate electrical pump tanks, worked efficenitly with co-workers and overall enjoyed the job."
good,For the most part the company is a good place to work for.  I enjoy the guys who work for me and we do our best to make the workplace enjoyable.  Our job changes almost everyday so we learn new things.  The hardest part of my job is the lack of communication between the field and the office.  Our office has come a long way in growth and growing together.
good,They are a company that is aggressive but have some bad management. This will be there undoing they need to do better at training the management staff.
good,Very good pay but very dangerous. The management tries to cover up all the wrong ways they handle hazardous waste.  Without disposing of it properly and employees can get hurt.
good,"Required to switch departments to obtain raises.  Unfair management policies with no backing from Human Resources."
good,"Wonderful pay, environment, perks, and benefits AWFUL LEADERSHIP! They are very predjudice and do not hire based off of accents and appearance. They are also very unorganized."
good,"I worked in four different states while working for them. Hard work deserves good pay, always got forty hours a week, basically always had the weekend off"
good,"I believe that with a company this size it is hard to review it, Some states are better than others. Some shops are run better or worse."
good,Company focused on tribal growth and often missed the mark for individual business units that resulted in retarding the growth required to be successful.
good,Job security is great. A good place to get your feet wet in the environmental industry. Tons of opportunities all over the globe.
good,"answers for important questions are hard to come by, you really are just a number. Offer lots of training and the ability to transfer is good."
good,Since working for a large company there are many different jobs you can get into to suit your needs and wants. Working at a camp job your co-workers become your second family. Harderst part of the job would be the fact their isn't many female employees. I am one out of three working with approximately 75 guys.
good,"The pay was good, but the morale was very low.  The constant whining and complaining from everyone became unbearable.  It's hard to maintain a positive attitude when they have so many ""lifers"" that are putting down the company and ridicule any efforts you make to improve the work environment."
good,"It was a good company, people are okay the pay was okay, is requires a lot of travel which was not for me, other than that I would go back to the company if it dint have extensive travel"
good,Everything is great but the hours could be better. I’m lucky if I get 30 hours a week when I was told I would get at least 40 hours. Never sure if I will work a full week or not.
good,"No opportunity for advancement. Benefits were not great, no matching 401k. My job is pretty easy going. I stay busy, but the work is not challenging. The company expects you to give them your all, but they aren't willing to give you anything. Received a 30 cent pay raise once in 3 years."
good,"-Extremely fast paced. You will jump right in. They will give you all instruction and information you need but expect to hit the ground running after the first few weeks.Workplace culture varies, some are very supportive, others just want your spot and will try to undermind your work. Management is great!"
good,"Clean Harbors is a good company to work for. "
good,"Communication break down , with in front office. Much needed information either omitted or forgotten to be expressed , to the project  managers"
good,"Learned about environmental compliance here. "
good,Worked a lot of hours spent a lot of time away from home some of the people were good to work with and others not so
good,"If you take initiative and desire to move up in the world both financially and socially, this job can provide an excellent opportunity. Hours are not guaranteed how ever when there is  work, the money can be very good. Seems to be a high turnover rate winch leaves room for quick advancement and management is quick to move you up if you show initiative."
good,"Clean Harbors is fun and challenging place to work. There are always new things to learn. Most Co-works are friendly and helpful, always will to help and everybody works as a team."
good,Work days change from day to day.  People are great to work with.  Not a lot of room for growth.  Management was very involved in the success of our office.
good,good place to work not enough room in the yard supervision could treat employees a little better  like people and not about getting revenue  trucks are old  amd break down often
good,A typical day at work was dealing with many people on a personnel scale and a business level.The management at this company amongest the best I have been associated with. Most everyone were great to work with. I worked there for 26 years so I can't say there were any hard parts to my job. I love the job but had to move due to other issues.I learn new things about our system on a weekly bases. How to get things done in an easier fashion and a more timely manner.
good,"The management team is a lot of push but with no give, and during my time there was no one in HR department which made it feel like no one was on the employees side."
good,It was ok weekends off. HR don't know how to full out paperwork. i would not work here the pay is not good at all. you do get a lot of time to spend with family
good,"This job was so long ago it is hard to remember what a typical day was."
good,"this company preaches safety but are not concerned when safety issuse are brought to their attention main focus is the work being completed equipment is in unsatisfactory condition to say the least. i have learned alot with this company though over the last 7 years in safety D.O.T. regulations, osha, R.C.R.A, and many other aspects of the haz waste industry. the hardest part of the job can be loading overweight drums by yourself"
good,In the begin they were a great company to work for but as time passes felt pressured by management for certain things including Signing documents and other non Applicable matters
good,Good coworkers management not so much supervisiors only cared about productivity not safety you’re just a number out there. Decent benefits and PTO was great
good,Good company at the lower level management.  Upper management was more worried about the bottom line and pretended to care about safety.  Everyday was something different.
good,"Have not  had a raise in 3 years, local branch management is very poor. equipment is good, training is very good. Most of the people at my branch are good people"
good,you may always be working but you are still just a number camps where nice but you where not allowed to have a single drink on a 24 day rotation. now im not  a boozer but when you are in a wet camp everyone is enjoying a nice cold one day on day out and you just watch i felt like ei was under a microscope and in public school again.
good,"I enjoy working with my team as we are all professionals in our fields. The work place is very big on safety culture which is great, and we get great opportunity for hours. The pay is moderate but we work 21/7 rotations which gives us lots of overtime."
good,It was closer to home for me and I met a lot of nice people here. Nice perks to get your own cell phone and laptop. Good experience and will to train the right candidates. Systems need to be updated though.
good,Clean Harbors is a good environmental company to work for the will purchase your work boots and safety glasses. Other than managment Clean Harbors was one of the best companies I've ever worked for
good,"Daily tasks changed by project, always centered around disposing hazardous chemicals. Generally ten hour days or greater also depending on the project."
good,Great folks that I enjoyed working with. Typical day at work consumed with preparation and execution of two week scheduled work with FCC Raytheon Radar Upgrade multiple locations.
good,there is no typical day at work. jobs can change in an instant.
good,This company taught me alot to add to my experience as an operator.
good,It was a great place to work I had wonderful managers and employees to work with.
good,"Being a Field Services Representative is a busy job. It is being a Bookkeeper/Accountant, Administrative Assistant, Biller, Project Manager and Executive Assistant all in one day. You are the Jill of all trades for the office. I enjoy every minute of it."
good,"Sometimes didnt get paid all the hours worked as other people wouldn't work past their shift time, even though its expected, so you have to pick up the slack. Union job would be more secure"
good,A typical day was to manage camp and staff with budget always in mind.  A lot of teamwork to make it a fun day away from home.  Your camp is your home so your employees are you family
good,Clean Harbors has provided me the opportunity to get considerable knowledge in the Environmental field. The work we are doing is both Environmental and industrial cleaning.
good,"Clean Harbors is a good working experience for people who haven't yet started a family, as many job classifications involve frequent travel away from home.  The wages are slightly less than competing companies, but benefits are good, and paid time off is above average."
good,Just time to move on love the people but crazy scheduling. You have to ready to work at the drop of a hat. Take away from a lot of your family time. Sometimes forced to go out of town when it doesn’t work with situation
good,Clean Harbors is a very strong organization that offers a large quantity of hours to its' staff. This company is ideal for a single individual that is willing to work large quantities of hours. Salary staff are expected to work a large quantity of hours without much compensation.
good,Company was great to work for while I was learning my trade and honing my craft. Offered me a wide variety of experiences. I would suggest working for them to anyone.
good,"A lot of room for personal career improvement, and growth with in the company. You are able to start at an entry level position and move up through the company."
good,"I found Clean Harbors to have a good work environment. The relationship between employees was cordial and friendly. The work itself could be challenging at times, but overall it was not difficult."
good,Was a great place to work. Learned lots of things about the waist water recycling busines but wasn't the job for me I've always wanted to be in the truck driving industry.
good,Safety is first and for most. Excellent safety program. Many on line learning courses and certifications available for personal and business growth. Management willing to teach and help you grow in the environmental industry and many more areas. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with emergency spill response and clean up in a safe and timely manner to keep everyone safe.
good,Company has some hard times a head of it with their oil services line of business affecting the company economically.  The company has a goal of reducing cost by $100 million in 2016.
good,"I started with doing payroll and moved into Accounts Receivable. I enjoy doing both and when the other girl is on holidays I handle the entire workload of A/R, A/P, Payroll, and I also do training for the guys, as well as make sure that the company credit cards are reconciled on a weekly basis. I also make sure that the guys oil field tickets are up to date and if they aren't I make sure that they are booked in to retake the course."
good,Ensure all aspects to the project are in compliance with regulatory guidelines. Review Health and safety procedures with the project crew.
good,"its another job, some times its busy ( three months no day off) and some sometimes its slow (two weeks off) co-worl are close like a family"
good,"Ran Semi Vac, Water Tanker. Lots learned. Management was decent. Co Workers were good guys to work with. Winter highway driving was the hardest part, the most enjoyable part the people I worked with."
good,Overall a good company to work for.  Good support from supervisors.  Schedule could be better but isn't terrible.  Pay is pretty fair.
good,"I'm on call 24/7, I enjoy the people that I work with, but would like the pay to be a little higher. There is a significant amount of travel as I cover a fairly large area.  The hardest part is sharing my time equally among my groups, it can be difficult with scheduling deadlines, or demands from specific groups.  I've learned that time management and prioritization are the keys to stress reduction to the job.  It's a good place to work, however the opportunities for advancement are very limited, thus career growth is stagnant."
good,Only seasonal work. Would love if it was year round. i love what I do and gives me a chance to learn new skills and equipment.
good,This was a temporary position. I didn't get enough time to form an opinion. I would have liked the job to go on longer. It is a very large company that seems to have the same problems most large companies have. Management doesn't understand production.
good,"Most days consisted of conference calls with account managers and general managers to discuss bid opportunities and pricing strategies. For each bid I would review the waste stream constituents, coding, disposal method, destination and cost to dispose of the material. I would compare requested pricing and our costs, and advise any adjustments to the initial pricing as necessary to insure company profitability."
good,"As a field chemist you so the same thing day in and out. The only other position for advancement is management and that position is not going to become available for years to come so your stuck in the same position unless your willing to relocate to another state where they have a managerial spot open. Pay is great overtime is available you can make $40,000 your first year , great vacation package, medical insurance 401k etc."
good,Check with the supervisor for what is on the schedule for the day.Work off batch sheet for reactor specs.Change filter press to roll-off. Off load trcks with hazardous waste. Job can be hard on the body.
good,"Clean Harbors is a good company with great benefits, but due to the Maine economy work hours are hard to come by. You must be prepared to sit at home for weeks at a time, and also on the flipside be ready to go out of town for weeks at a time also. The work is extreme and if you have a problem with getting dirty then you will not last. I am attempting to start a famly and need more managable hours in order to do so. I enjoyed working hard and the commradery with fellow co workers. The job scope is so left to right that I cannot begin to explain a ""typical"" day."
good,Worked for them for a short time after they bought the company I worked for. The transition was sudden and very difficult. They hated that we were Union and immediately deployed tactics to bust the union. I left shortly after the takeover
good,"quiet work atmosphere, management gave space for employees to work alone, as well as job performance greatly exceeded."
good,"I loved my job at Clean Harbors but the management was very inexperienced and only cared about their bonuses. Their equipment is by far the worst I have ever driven in my 10+ years of driving trucks for a living. They are really bad about giving you a low wage and promising you raises that you will never see. Although the overtime does give you a good income for the year but would be much better if they would pay what you are suppose to be getting. Benefits have been the best I've seen in my employment thus far. You will work a lot with this company, don't expect too much time at home with family. Many times you will be out of town, and up to 3 months at a time. They think on call means you have to answer your phone all the time but the competitors don't work like that. Probably needs a good union to go in and show them how to operate properly!"
good,"A typical day at work is a 12 hour work day, sometimes more. I learned a great deal. C.H. is the one of the most technically advanced companies in the industry and the biggest!! I had the most supportive co-workers you could ask for!! Everyone helps out the other.!! Upper Management probably could have been better. The toughest part of the job was meeting contract deadlines. The most enjoyable part was passing on what I learned in the industry to benefit others !! Mentoring, teaching, coaching ! That was very gratifying!!"
good,"Loved my job with Clean Harbors, However the management system was very poor. Made great money, the benefits were great and inexpensive, had much opportunity with the company. Local office management kept the advancement opportunities to those who they were friends with and not to the ones who earned and deserved it."
good,"Unroutine hours, on call 24/7.  No overtime compensation.  Bonuses are low, not guaranteed.  No incentive to excel at current position.  Whether you make the bonus requirements or exceed by 300% become the same pay.  Available positions not always posted, still given in a roundabout ""good ole boy""  style"
good,"Good Place to Work, interesting people and experiences.  Good on the job training available. Nice variety of daily tasks. Reimbursement available for costs in getting CDL"
good,"Huge company, you are just another asset. Overall, very solid company to work for. Lot's of different equipment to operate. Learned a lot of good things during my employment with them."
good,"as a starter in the lodging services its a great company to work for, you can see if that kind of work is for you. very positive work environment and the Management works with you to get you going"
good,"Please contact for additional information. This experience was great! Within the first month of being employed, the CIO was forced to resign. From that point on, major layoffs took place due to the rapidly-declining price of oil. Since our primary revenue generator was from refining oil, this caused Clean Harbors to make serious cuts(Especially to the IT team) given this had a major impact on our profit margins."
good,"Layoff of critical personnel has significantly increased the workload for remaining staff; extra, unpaid work hours are necessary to keep up with required work."
good,Productive workplace. Its a huge company that litterally started from a garage. Great place to work other than the fact that some divisions management can improve.
good,i was a field tech. We went out to different refineries all over texas and cleaned up hazardous wastes from storage tanks ect. We disposed the waste properly to meet EPA standards.
good,"Nice company to know great systems.  The information is not very hard to find due to the great systems, it is all there at your fingertips.  The training is top notch."
good,"a good place to learn and a great place to work"
good,"hardest part of my job is working the night shift that i work."
good,"Clerical duties, Learned Orissa and Camp manager software, experienced Management had a hands on attitude. Staff was willing to go the extra mile for clients. Having to work long days in a office setting with out frequent breaks. Helping clients and staff."
good,"My most enjoyable thing about the company were new challenges, my work varied from day to day."
good,"Clean Harbors is the leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services throughout North America. The Company serves over 60,000 customers, including a majority of the Fortune 500 companies, thousands of smaller private entities and numerous federal, state, provincial and local governmental agencies."
good,"If your not about hard work long hours this isn't the job for you. Overall this job is what you make it. You are a dependable person and want something new everyday then you can make good money , you can have a good work life here. Other than that this is a job you have to take seriously."
good,"I liked  my  job i plan to retire  from this job at clean Harbors work every day,worked over time after  work,helping over people  do they work,I did manage  work inside inout-sid,I did parking I olay a roll in paint ing"
good,"Worked a lot of hours and traveled about 50% of the time. Very safety oriented. Provided all PPE and an extensive training program. Got to operate a lot of different machines including bobcat, hydroblaster, mini excavator, jet rodder, hydro excavator and hotsy pressure washers."
good,"annual cost of living raises and better match on 401k are needed."
good,Very demanding hours but the pay and benefits are good. The work environment is difficult to operate but the work there is rewarding. My jobs responsible would often change
good,It was a good experience. I would recommend. Job advancement is slow if you want to be a driver. Great place to learn to be a field tech. I am thankful
good,"I learned so much at this job. from being a good technician and tips on how to be the best welder from two very experienced welders all the way down to shoveling out bins without destroying my back. A lot of knowledge at the shop. learned electrical, some chemistry, a little bit of everything"
good,"Clean Harbors has been a good place to work so far. I like my schedule, and the people I work with are great for the most part. The pay is ok and the benefits are good. My only complaint is the lack of upward mobility. It is easy to max out within a few years of working at Clean Harbors."
good,I only worked three days out of the week and I was off for the remaining four days.  My employer provided transportation to and from work and this saved my a ton of gas money.
good,"was a great place to work when out  of town lots of hours great people to work with other then management "
good,"-Shift work"
good,"Good place to learn a variety of skills.  Not enough to move up."
good,I learn a great deal of self reliance in this job. You have to be quick to think and solve problem on your feet in this job. Because the operation rely on you to make sure your equipment is operational and you will know how to trouble shoot any problem if it occur.
good,What I like most about my job was learning how to use on different product to complete job task. Management was nice to work with but need to be more proactive on legal issues for workers.
good,It was fun to work with the field group and the workers had good workers
good,"My manager is fair with a flexible schedule in the event something comes up and I need to tweak my schedule.  I can also work from home sometimes, which is helpful when juggling various demands."
good,"I worked at Various Refineries  surrounding  Edmonton or Fort Saskatchewan  .i preformed many different duties And Many Different  roles"
good,"Good company to work for, ER's can be challenging at times that make for a long day that tend to go into the evening houres. Management team is avaialble to help if you need it but at times you must figure things out on your own,"
good,"I was reviewed every year as an accurate, detail oriented, hard worker, excellent in dealing with the vendors , good communication with inter department via email and over phone."
good,"Clean Harbors pays really well and can pretty much work a lot of overtime whenever. I really appreciate the 8 years that I was there, good or bad. I hate that I didn't get the chance to transfer before my notice was up. Clean Harbors is a great company to work for."
good,"I was formally a Safety-Kleen employee that has been on since the Clean Harbors acquisition. Things have changed a few times in my almost 8 years with both companies. I took a position with Clean Harbors on April 1, 2016"
good,Good enviorment. Good employees. The company is flexible. also is good at letting you off at a decent time if need to take care of business. Never had any problems out of management.
good,The hours are great when there is work. But due to the nature of the business There is not always work.Clean Harbors over all is a good company. Butonly for Seasonal are The Hours steady.
good,"clean harbor it a great job for people who can handle hard work"
good,The people you work with are great and will teach you well. However not A lot of support from uppermanagnent and the pay is below average. Good job to gain experience in the field for those needing to get their feet in the door.
good,Clean Harbors is a great company and will make Environmental Responsible decisions to manage hazardous waste needs for your company.  employees work hard which can be challenging to maintain a work life balance but all and all it is a rewarding company to work for.
good,This palce was an amazing place to work. Until the new government came and really started to push Carbon Taxes. Effecting Industrial jobs heavily. And our higher ups wouldn't listen to the department managers!!
good,"morning:saftey meeting then get truck ready walk around  get water then off to the job site. bosses  good helpful, management could look ahead more often ,good happy employees,working out in minus 52 is the hard part,most enjoyable is working with happy emploeess."
good,"The company is alright, but there's a lot of invoicing that need to be taken care of. The work culture is all family oriented. They only use inside system which can't be helpful anywhere else. The hardest part is each accounts have a different problems, therefore it's hard to get use with the work load. The coworkers are very helpful to help with any difficulties."
good,"Great place to work. Layed back work environment. Pay is pretty fair, but not many raises available. Most managers great to work with."
good,"Days at work were very long, Sometimes you get a good manager and sometimes you don't. Can get homesick very easily. I would do this again for 3,000 a month though."
good,Clean Harbors is a nice company to work for.  Current job requires being on the road 5 out of 5 days a week. Very nice people and culture.
good,"Good job, learn many stuff in heart and safety, enviromental, dot."
good,Down to earth people that I work with.  Enjoying what I do.  Look forward to coming into work each day. Love doing the data entry and speaking with regular guys in the field.  Great bunch to work with
good,"The worst thing about the job is the fact they are constantly buying other companies.    The people that I worked with were wonderful.   I miss working with them.   Sometimes we were stretched a little too thin.  I would often take work home and work on it at home, but if I could have done this more often, I would have.  I prefer to work from the house.   I seem to get more done.   But they management I worked with was very very nice.  They held family in high regards.   The pay rate was wonderful.  The atmosphere was casual unless corporate office was coming.    They do impliment change WAY too often.  In either the way they process things or the programs they use.  I do understand that change is required or else you will never progress, but it was CRAZY how often things changed.   My operations manager was very good to his employees.   I got laid off during a reduction in force, but I would go back in a heartbeat.   Benefits were good.  They had a retirement program that they matched payments on.   They offered company stock.   The healthcare plan was very good."
good,"I've been working for them since January 2013 and I have no major gripes. The management I work for treat me well, the company provides training and uniforms and the wages are more than fair. "
good,At work I assisted many people in disposing of their electronic and chemical recyclables.  I then sorted and packaged them for environmentally friendly recycling or disposal.  Management was very involved and wasn't afraid to work with the on site crew.  The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day.  I genuinely enjoyed the work that I did and the people that I got to work with everyday.
good,"Hardest part of the job was the a typical day and the travel. "
good,"Environmental department personnel are all friendly, and we all work well together as a team. A typical day can run from extremely busy, to slow and easy, depending on the work load that day. "

The most enjoyable part of the job was travelling, the freedom given to its workers, feeling apart of a close-knit team, and the physical work. The hardest part of the job is how much time is committed to work."
good,"Cleanharbors is a good company to work for, the biggest problem with the company is that they are too large and tend to get in there own way because of policys within the company"

I am using the degree I obtained in college and I am learning new things every day. I am fortunate to work at a branch with many knowledeable individuals that are willing to help me build a solid foundation here. I am looking forward to advancing with this company.
good,Clean Harbors was a farely good place to work.But it is a long drive.People out there are good to work with and willing to help out with any problems.Management personal would help also
good,The people and company seemed very well arranged and was a pleasure to work there.  Left because the bank said the mill was a better income to there eyes.
good,"Clean Harbors is a company filled with opportunities if willing to travel for work. Clean Harbors have decent compensation rates, and benefits. Slow paced working environment, and weather depends on the job wether inside of a manufacturing plant or Outside working an containment site."
good,"I learned to work on Inductive Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy."

good,organized and efficient at all task brought to the table. managment is very organized and well trained
good,"Great upper management, poor training, pay decent but benefits are too expensive.  Some of the employees are willing to help with training, however everyone seems too busy.  Other divisions, ex; approvals take to long to get back.  Can be a demanding job."
good,I really enjoyed working at the Clean Harbors office on the west end of Edmonton. I cannot confidently say that all of the locations are as good as this one. It also depends on the department or branch you work for.
good,"This was a good company to work for.  Work was hectic at times.  Learned several new computer applications and job-related activities.  Management was good and very helpful with an open-door policy, where you can go and get matters taken care of.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the chemicals and their uses.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers/vendors and working in concert with the technical staff."

good,Clean Harbors was a great company to work for.  The employees were all helpful and would reach out to give you a hand when you needed one.  Industry was growing.
good,98 percent of my jobs have been for clean harbors and I must say that the vast knowledge I have learned over this short experience has been much appreciated. My experience has grown and will continue to grow with future opportunities as they present themselves. I definitely recommend clean harbors you any personelle that is looking to get work accomplished safely and efficiently
good,Work culture is good. Co-workers are good. Work pressure depends on project you are working on. Management is kind of ok
good,"harzardous waste operation and emergency response, worked whit the field service coordinator in the allocation o manpower"
good,"Took calls for personnel that needed to dispose of their hazmat"
good,when   i  worked  there   we  were    all  ways    busy   worked   out  in  remote   camps  the  co-workers    were   good  to  work   with   for  the  most   part.
good,working on the drum dock . I learned the paper work I do every day I work. The co-worker I had there are really good guys they would help      anybody out if need. The hardest thing was doing being on the computer figuring out where things go where how to exposed the material we had. I have fun for the BBQ they did for the groups and co-workers
good,"Worked there for almost 9 years, learned a lot about hazardous waste, chemicals, and most of all safety! Very flexible family friendly workplace!"
good,The company is a great place to work but my job became very time consuming and I needed more time with the family. The traveling began to take to much away from my family
good,"Enjoyed working with this company, but they just didn't keep me busy enough."
good,"Lots of time spent at work, good pay though.  Management could be trained more, which they are working on.  Expected to get a lot accomplished with a lean production crew.  Flexible with time off, which is helpful when problems come up in personal life."
good,"A typical day would involve routine calibrations or maintenance of instrumentation or electrical systems under our control.  Any call on the radio might redirect us to a present problem or concern in the production process.  Frequent multi-disciplinary troubleshooting required."
good,"I started working for this company when there were only about 100 employees and now the company has grown and we now have 500 + employees working at the corporate location.  This is a good company to work for, easy commute, and ok benefits.  I've been with the company for over 15 years and looking for a change in my career.  I would love to grow old with this company but sometimes you just have to do what you have to do to survive."
good,"Clean Harbors; recently aquired R&R Truckin in Colorado and PEAK Energy in Wyoming and provided harmonization and Rules, policies, Standards to achieve the a Clean Harbors' requirements."
good,The company does try to provide the tools necessary to get the job done.
good,"A typical day at work would be 5am-8pm,and thats countiuely running a155 komtsa dozer from dark to dark.Ive been running heavy equipment for over 20years,so i enjoy my job a lot."
good,Clean Harbors is unique place to work it's anything but easy but the things you do each day make our environment just that much better from an environmental perspective. That to me is very fulfilling and something to be proud of. I can also tell you that having a high profile company like Clean Harbors on your resume in good standing will definitely keep you in the sought after file instead of the round file when searching for a job. In closing I just want to say Clean Harbors has a lot to offer and endless possibilities. In fact I really hope to work there again someday. I worked there from 2013 to 2017
good,"This company has promoted me through the ranks. I preach to everyone that hard work and dedication pays off. When you can prove yourself to be a competent and driven individual, willing to put in the time, you are rewarded. Many want reward for mediocre performance and that is not how it works. The work life balance is my main concern as well as the pay scale in my particular area. I do not feel like it lines up with the cost of owning a home in this area at least for salaried positions."
good,Good place to work if the hours are there. The biggest downside to working there is the lack of communication between management and employees. They also have some issues with keeping you updated on the union contract.
good,"A typical day is busy from beginning to end"
good,Came in to the office at 8 am to turn on phones and review the shipments for the week. I learned how to fill out labels for the hazardous waste containers.
good,it had its moments and days but overall my 28 years at that company was good.  just wished I had opportunities to move within the company locally.  the only way I was able to get a raise was to re-locate to another facility.
good,Fast Paced environment and hard to take days off. workplace culture is pretty good compare to the places I have worked before. The management is great and don't bother you if you finish your work on time.

good,"-Company does well due to its successful business plan and trustworthy people"
good,it was a nice environment to be around a lot of funny people the boss was a good person i like the work ethic it was a workout being there
good,"My experience at Clean Harbors was very polarizing. As a contractor, some days are very relaxed, but some days are very long and arduous. As a chemical cleaner, the emphasis was always on giving the customer the best service possible while maintaining a safe work environment for all."
good,"it's pretty good company, with good benefits, pay, 401k, healthcare, poor management skills. learned how to multitask and many more anther duties as assigned."
good,"A complete lack of micromanagement is the bane of this company and the boon of new workers.  Many areas are mismanaged, but that just means that anyone new can step in and overhaul their own department, treated as the pride of the company for doing so.  If you come in with a refined skillset, especially one that helps in logistics and organization, there is a load of opportunity for you."
good,Enjoyed working with the people that I did. It made it enjoyable and exciting about going out and doing a great service for the customer knowing what we were to do.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Clean Harbors but resigned as I was offered employment with Wachovia/Wells Fargo that offered better employee benefits, opportunity for advancement, and greater salary potential."
good,Have a meeting with team to go over how the previous shift ran. Get with manager to see what trailers are on dock and what needs to be loaded and unloaded. Management will get with each dock lead man to see if they need and supplies or chemicals delivered. The hardest part of the job would be if the other shift didn't have a productive day. The best part of the day is when it's been a productive day and your work shows for it.
good,"Fulfilling generated work orders and time sensitive repairs while troubleshooting and making recommendations. Compressors, pumps, motors, conveyors, cranes, welding, rebuilding, improving and communication with operators.  Excellent group of coworkers and partners as support for work and questions. Confined space entry permits, Hot work permits, and Hazardous Waste line opening permits used to accomplish a lot of the work."
good,Everyone works safe and look out for others in work facility. It is a very friendly environment. I have learned how to operate heavy equipment and deal with chemical waste.
good,Very busy fast pace job. Learned so much I can't begin to explain it all. My boss was very fair and considerate. Had some good co-workers and some that made everyone else's job harder but loved my job for the most part. The hardest part was the extreme truck load for one receiving person to handle. Best part was it was so busy my 12 hours went by really fast.
good,"Typical day is like any other supervisor role.  You drive to site and make sure that everyone arrived safely.  Build and host morning toolbox and address any concerns the crew would have.  You work very close to dispatch in making sure that all jobs are planned and that the customers demands are met.  You go out on site and make sure that all crews are doing the jobs to the company and clients expectations.  Perform site inspections and audits by yourself and also with the client.  Converse with the client in meetings and over the phone and plan upcoming jobs.  "
good,learned how to use chainsaw properly and work with co-workers and enjoy working outside and experiences lots of different places and conditions
good,On a typical day when not open to the public good place to work staying busy with work.Learned many things like sorting chemicals in their proper place.
good,"Depending on the time of the month, depended on how busy you were."
good,"very good salary, lots of divisions to choose from, great benefits and good management. ppe and equipment are always up to date and available, lots of company perks and a large company so you have tons of room to move and grow."
good,"The first huge benefit to working for Clean Harbors, is that their number one value is Safety.  It is integrated everywhere.  Secondly, there is nothing better than being so busy you forget what time it is everyday.  Rapidly growing through reputation and acquisition, one of Clean Harbor's motto's stands true: ""Hire to Retire"" - you truly can begin an entry level position and grow into succession here.  I also highly appreciate, as a corporate employee, all of the training and certification culture that is available, from field laborers all the way up to the C-Levels.  Everybody is valued at this company and it retains the ""Family"" feel (having been started in the early 1980's by a man with two trucks and three friends) which is evident everyday as you develop relationships throughout the organization."
good,"Transported hazardous materials on a daily basis,also picked up waste at Navel Base San Diego and brought it back to our facility to be segregated and drummed up to be shipped off for disposal."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, would love to go back if i could. The people was so open mind and just great people to work around..we always help each other when needed."
good,"Clean Harbors is a great company to work for, and it is at a fast pace, the job requires a class b license and air brake and a hazmat endorsemment,,and the staff and the co workers are very nice to work with,,"
good,have the best co-workers enjoy working with them we get along so well very funny guys makes work go by so quickly great company to work  for but management could use a little more training its all about the numbers
good,I think when interviewing and hiring someone they should enough work for the person they hired and not give them the run around and saying its going to pick up soon.
good,"Despite making record profits, there are still layoffs here. My department was downsized while I was out due to a job related injury and I was laid off. I really enjoyed working here but I was overworked, which lead to the injury. Being part of the few departments ""required"" to work six day weeks can do that to the human body. We weren't really given the credit for what we did to help make the record profits and half of my department tried to find other (safer) positions in the company or left within a few months."
good,"Just tell you to do the work without showing how to do it, and the people their have their own group and if you don't fit into the group the make you feel very unwelcome, I am vegan i felt so out of place when it came to having party for the workers they bought food for everyone else besides me,"
good,Great team environment where we work with brilliant and energetic professionals.
good,"Great place to work. Unfortunately corporate lay offs effected several plants. Great stock, 401-K and Health Care option. They were very good to employees and provided great training."
good,Great place to work.  Interesting / challenging work; learn something new everyday.  Time flies while working.  Many opportunities for advancement for everyone.
good,"Great people, good environment. The company is not reaching yearly financial goals making it difficult to advance within. Management is great to work with and easy to talk to."
good,it was a good place to work they had good equipment. they were understanding good hours flexible . they had proper procedures in place and a good crew of people working for them
good,Nice company to be a part of.They treat you like family However there is a point system so be on time and dnt miss work unless absolutely necessary. Other than that it was okay.
good,I am ready and motivated to work really good cleaning have experience I have been working for cleaning for a good long time I love to clean I really do hate cooking I love to clean
good,"My day is usual a pleasant one, I work with a great crew. The job is not a hard job, kind of repetitious, your aware of what needs to be done and get it done, sometimes with a few challenges but nothing that normally can't be tackled. Management is management, you have your pros and cons of any job but that comes along with the territory. I can definately say that my  good days definately outweigh my bad."
good,Each day was different .That i learned..Management is accecible and effective.The hardest part was preparing for next day. No matter how prepared i learned to become.
good,My experience in the PVOSB Mill was amazing. learned many skills and the knowhow of equipment that I couldn't imagine id learn anywhere else. was definitely a great experience

Every job i did was a team effort.had Great managment and and good pay and benefits.The hardest part was squeezing into a tiny space figuring im 6'0 feet tall. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was a different job everyday and lots of travel."
good,"starts with opening site in morning,taking tank readings,off loading and loading tankers safely,making washer fluid,and anti frezze         management sees that daily tasks needed are completed.co-workers work as a team to acomplish needed daily tasks. making anti frezze from written formulas. testing anti frezze blends for right specs"
good,No typical  day.    I learned all the aspects of my job. Management was great.
good,"Cleaned out hazardous tanks and piping. Some travel involved, There was also alot of standing when there is no work."
good,I like working here unfortunately Im always on call its more like a part time job for me but other than that love this job and what I do there.
good,"this is a great company for the company but not for the employees,    i did learn a lot and im greatful  for that, some co workers were good to work with while other seem to be spoiled from management, seems like they would do what they wanted ,"
good,"Love working here as a cdl driver,but you need to be self motivated the support is there but you have to be willing to ask for help and not be lazy...overall great place and great team"
good,"safety was number one,   if it was unsafe you did not do it with no questions asked.  My direct manager was a delight to work for and if it was not for the oil field crash at the time I would have stayed working there.  "
good,"madison and milwaukee wi extractintion from the ground, power washing, cleaninn tanks  and checking lel levels"

good,Awesome coworkers good equipment awesome housing. Enjoyed my time working with Clean Harbours would return in a heartbeat management needs more experience

good,"I loved working for them but was not happy living in ND that's the only reason im no longer there, they are a very big company and care about the employees and will do whatever it takes to help them when they need it."
good,"the management at the time I was there was very nice person to get along with.Always there to talk to and give advice as needed.The work days were long at times but always manageable,if worked a long day and if next day wasn't as busy could take sometime off to get some rest."
good,"lots of work"
good,"I learned how to run  a hydro vac truck and work in all different kinds of weather and environment , I also worked with all different kinds of nationalitys and in all different kinds of work places "
good,Good place to work for but limited advancements or benefits. Company doesn't spend enough to keep the Plant safe and Operational. Company needs to take better care of their employees
good,You have to find out on your own actually if you know people in this company you will survive really well and good to learn new trades I learned alot I was great worker
good,Fast paced from beginning till the end of each day. Usually very physical and demanding. Traveled to many places to do many jobs. Hardest part of the job was not being home very much do to a lot of traveling.
good,Opinions about clean Harbors are my own and will not be shared. Good Company to work for - Company went thru major move and acquisition during the time I worked there.
good,Opinions about clean Harbors are my own and will not be shared. Good Company to work for - Company went thru major move and acquisition during the time I worked there.
good,Clean Harbors pay well. The hours are long and the condition can be tough. Starting pay is about 14 a hour but you’re guaranteed to work 50 a week or more every week
good,fun low stress fun job with good people stay away from field services very unorganized with a group of people who do not follow procedures and lead with intimidation
good,"I start my day very early as most individuals do.  My co-workers are fun to be around and help pass the day.  The hardest part of my job is not staying busy, or being completely overwhelmed with work.   There's no ""in between.""  My boss does not communicate with me about anything which is tough since I think he'd be great to know.  But he's also very nice and has been very supportive as I've learned the role."

good,"I enjoyed working here, the workers were all knowledgeable and help me when I needed a hand.
