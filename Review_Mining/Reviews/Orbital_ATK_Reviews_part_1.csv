rating,review
bad,"They might as well of just took a cattle prod and burned your employee number into you because that is all you are to them, Cattle. In and out little piggies."
bad,"I would still be there if not for being forced out. Management had favorites that brought them food & flirted with them. But doesn't make them good employees, instead that makes slackers who get by with doing nothing while others pull their slack."
bad,"Orbital is the perfect place to work if you wanna get brow beat, talked down to and fired doing nothing wrong but defending attacks from other employees. Screw Orbital and the entire IT Dept."
bad,Orbital ATK is a very loosely managed company at the San Diego location that I worked.  This location is run by a click of managers who did not know how to manage and did not follow up on work that needed to done.  Managers spent more time looking after peers than about the company.  Too many cooks in the kitchen!
bad,ATK is a Very High pace and very demanding job with very high turnover rate I do not recommend the company for any collage/trade school/or off the street people that need a job
bad,"I worked at orbital office and would never recommend this place to anyone. Management style is very poor. It is horrible micro management so every single step is watched, judged and potentially criticised to put employees down. "
bad,"Typical day at work.....long, repetitive and stressful.  Very contradictory rules to follow.  Get hurt must immediately tell supervisor,  If not a point is given.  Tell supervisor you are hurt and suddenly you are not doing your job properly nor are you fast enough.  You violate the rules are insubordinate and various other things.  Basically don't get hurt at all.  Arm gets cut off work through it."
bad,"After a corporate takeover made by now owner LKQ, one of the worst employers to ever work for.  Management is non-supportive, with favoritism and nepotism being rampant."
bad,"The only reason I gave one star was because there wasn't one lower. The management sucks, and if you try to tell them you are out of a job. Management doesn't listen to their employees. Employees work 12- hour shifts, with only one 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks, but you better be back to work after 10 minutes. Management just cares about getting numbers by any means necessary."
bad,Very bureaucratic company with a lot of hirarchy. Very Mean people in the management levels cut the communication between you and upper management level.
bad,"People left here are hateful and full of rudeness. 30% of engineers should be retired because they are well over 60, and they are incompetent, and they are stuck mentally in 1980's. They do not use any software/produce development model. Not even waterfall. They always just say this is how we have always do things around here, and that's it. Over decades, the only thing that was accomplished here is, ATK created a small army of useless managers and engineers. What can be done in 2 days, they stretch over 3 weeks, and then they just keep talking about what they did and how smart they are for another 3 weeks."
bad,"No employee believes Orbital ATK Clearwater will survive after 2020. Their products will be discontinued. ATK Clearwater does not invest anything into R&D since 2 years ago. Even before, the management always considered R&D as cost rather than investment, and invested minimal into R&D. That is why they will close the business here soon. ATK Clearwater does not provide employees' training, conference trips, education, ATK employees here get zero from the company."
bad,"You learn nothing, and everything they do is so simple and can be done by technicians. But they talk and talk and talk forever about what they do. If they are loud they will remain longer around. Everyone who designed and solved real problems came from somewhere else but none of them is around by now. You cannot get even employee of month award if you have not been there for least 10 years; no matter how much you have contributed."
bad,The system made a mistake I have not ever worked for Orbital. This is a system problem as I said before I never worked for Orbital.
bad,"Did not know they made bombs and missiles, it was frightening to be in meetings and see them show their products."
bad,"They lure you in with their pretty half truths. Their retention bonus is bogus. Their management does nothing to sort out problems. If you look at someone wrong, your job could be in peril. Do not apply here unless you want to overwork yourself with little to no compensation or recognition. I averaged 55 hours a week and was never granted time off no matter how far ahead I asked for it."
bad,I took there buy out after 7 years then got hired back on 1 year later worst mistake ever.To many managers over managers nobody really knows what's going on all they want is numbers. Hiring more temps than regular employees they have all ready let go because of cheaper wages.
bad,The culture of the company has been in a downward spiral for the past two years due to the mishandling of crucial events to maintain plant operations.
bad,"Here is a classic example of the good ole boys' network at work. Productive and prolific workers are often eliminated, marginalized or laid off to protect and reward incompetents. morons and idiots...they regularly jettisoned high quality performers to make room for stiffs and buddies of big bosses....not recommended under any circumstances"
bad,"This place is bad; bad for your career, and it will have layoffs for next several years. In just 4 years, they let go about 50% of people."
bad,"This company is about themselves. They do not care for the people that make them profit. This was my second time working for Orbital. The first time was before the merger with ATK. I left the first time because they started laying people off, so I got out of there before they let me go. The second time around I was hoping with the merger and the new OrbitalATK would be better. Well, I was wrong. It is the same lay off hub. They still have that good ol' boy groups that run the place. It does not matter how knowledgable you are if you don't know anyone or brown nose you will not get any where. I have worked for larger aerospace & defense contractors and one thing I noticed here is the lack or diversity of upper management. This is not a place for minorities if you want career advancment find another place to work."
bad,"Orbital ATK in Clearwater will shut down in 2-3 years. If one small program survives, it will be transferred somewhere else. "
bad,"Hired in as a PLC tech Have not even seen a program for PLC,s yet that was a year ago. Management so far disconnected they have no clue nor appear to care . If you hire on with this company forget about seeing your family. 12 hour days with mandatory overtime. old out dated technology. Machines from 1940 that they have tried to retro fit with very little success. Engineering team with no skills and over worked. I would suggest to keep looking as there is no future here. I would like to see people get hired. They do need people as they are understaffed. and thats the way they like to run. But I hate to see people taken advantage of."
bad,"Poor Management, they put so many jobs on you that youcan hardly keep up. Get lay off notice only to find out there keeping us. Do not recommend."
bad,"monotonous work, felt like a lab rat, couldn't express my thoughts or ideas properly. Bad communication between upper management and supervision. Not fun"
bad,The coworkers were great to work with but the balance between work/life was non-existent. Management constantly had mandatory overtime of 60 hour weeks and if you had some emergency you were given reprimands every time.
bad,Favorites are a big issue if your not a favorite your overlooked for job advancements and with working 12hrs shifts all the days i have off is just trying to recover all the lost sleep.
bad,"Sr. Leader Management do not follow own business policy and practices.  This company fires ""at will"" without regard for lives impacted and unfortunately the company management operates by force of fear or threat of loosing their livelihood."
bad,When I started it was a great place to work. How ever it has become a very Stressful place to work and the company does Not care about there employees any more.All they care about is Management and getting there Bonus's and raises for management. They don't care about the workers any more. They under bid the new Contract so bad they want to make it up on the backs of the workers.
bad,"I was hired as 3 months, temp to perm.  Upon my 3 month review I was told that I was rude to people when in fact, I was never rude to anyone. Lies were spread and no defense allowed on my part."
bad,"Management is horrible, clueless and never checks in with employees. No advancement unless you want to move to Utah. Be careful, they tell you there are advancements and there are none. Always in the state of putting out a fire,. Engineering is king, do as they say and when you look for backup from your supervisor it won't be there."
bad,"Management is all about the blame game. Whose fault is it? If you are on vacation, it will be your fault regardless."
bad,"The management is clueless about the future progress. ATK in Clearwater does not have good core products. They rely on sustainment contracts for outdated technologies. They have only three products in Clearwater; two about to be replaced by the competitors and one in development but in serious mess. ATK tries to spread contract work across the entire country to the point when even small tasks become so complicated and hard to finish because somebody always did not get the memo. "
bad,I really like all the people at ATK but they need to work on their management skills.
bad,Working for ATK did not allow an employee to enjoy family time at home as we worked 60 hours a week and 20 of those hours were usually on a opposing shift to your normal schedule.  They also have very little care for their actual employees health and wellness.  Not a place I would ever recommend working for.
bad,great job for high school kids but not for wanting to have a career within a month I was as far as I could go in my work place with no upgrade in pay or job title
bad,I worked for over a year and they promised everyone that at 3 months they would hire us full time. Most quit because you can't get insurance or time off at all or bonuses or any type of benefits at all. At a year if you do not fight for a full time position (which most are filled as they only have a few in each area). They put you on a no pay temp leave for a month and then let you go.
bad,"The leadership is what makes this company difficult to work with. They do not hold the same rules and standards for all employees. It is up to each individual department and manager to decide how employees are treated or to what extent flexibility to balance work and life are afforded. I've seen people fail in their current position yet get promoted to positions to which they are not qualified for or even know, for that matter. Yet when they have good productive employees, they are overlooked and kept in place with no career advancement opportunities. I've also seen quite qualified individuals from within the company get overlooked for outside hires instead of promoting within first. I would not recommend this company with the current leadership at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. The corporation itself may be different at other locations. While the benefits and PTO are great, it is not enough at this location to keep a good employee...and they wonder why they have such a high voluntary turnover of good employees. Hmmmm..."
bad,"Just another large company ran by the ""Good old boy system "" If your are not related or neighbors of someone high up you are not advancing."
bad,"I was hired on as a temporary employee, they said they would hire me full time after a month. It has been three months since I started and I am still a temp. The management has a hard time communicating with production so I have had hardly any work to do for the past few weeks."
bad,"Hot in the summer, drafty sometimes in the winter. alot of co-workers are fun to work with and do a great job. management is non-existant, except maybe if they are out to get someone, they really are not sincere about safety or the welfare of their employees. typical corporate mentality, hire and forget about you and then fire you.the most enjoyable part of the job is going home from this place. there is still the good old boy system, I hope the union straightens management out for the sake of their employees. the policies there are whatever they feel like doing at the moment and changes without notifying employees. the hand book they give you is about worthless.the pay and benefits still are not bad. I know its a factory but the locker rooms and cafeterias are nasty. birds fly around in some of the cafeterias.A handful of the managers constantly want their buttocks  kissed, well lets not go there, you know where I am going with that, you always run into a few. Not as many opportunities as there used to be. The place has really went downhill since about 2010."
bad,"The job itself isn't all that bad. The pay is decent and my coworkers are all good people. The management, on the other hand, is driving the place into the ground.  This includes all levels of management. They obviously do not know what the words organization or proactive mean. They lie at the drop of a hat. They will tell you one thing and then in front of their superiors or peers, say the opposite and then deny ever talking to you about the subject."
bad,"Paid well, but wasn't worth the headache. Management doesn't value their employees and hard to plan a life outside of work because of mismanagement of workload."
bad,"The Culture there is kinda like a sweat shop, they are really too schedule driven in many ways and people fear for losing their job."
bad,ATK was a wonderful place work prior to its merger with Orbital Sciences Corporation in February 2015.  Poor communications to employees during and after the merger caused many employees to leave for other job opportunities.
bad,"This ATK office is a total disaster. The people who run the show here have been there for 30+ years and are stuck in 1985. There is no innovation and upper management is incompetent. In fact, incompetent is an understatement and doesn't do my description justice. Program Management is clueless and corrupt, these programs are profitable because of shady shell games and the only way to get promoted here is to be related to someone or know some political connection. The only developmental program was mismanaged and micromanaged to the point that no one was confident to make a decision. Plus if you have worked here for less than 20 years and you come up with an idea you will be squashed like a bug. Avoid this place like the plague."
bad,You are expected to put the company before your family. They want you there 12 hours a day 6 days a week. Management has communication issues. And there is a large gap between management and production.
bad,"Working for a defense contractor on a military base is challenging work and the environment can be inherently dangerous. Lots of government bureaucracy, but you can gain some good experience."
bad,"Managers avoided any type of conflict so there was a lot of tension in the air and employees were allowed to continue to make life awful for others.  "
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the immediate teams in the AP, Accounting, Subcontracts, Payroll and Treasury departments"
bad,"good comp and bennies, great job up until our very competent management team was replaced with the exact opposition if you are thinking of applying, just know the compensation package is not worth dealing with incompetent and immature managers, good people are leaving everyday, job seekers be wary!"
bad,There was no recognition for any work done and the company didn't really care about you.. you were only considered a number and not a person. I did not care for the company.
bad,"Almost everybody I knew there was either counting down to retirement or actively looking for another job.  I had a new supervisor every few months.  Upper management would regularly lie to the employees and can be quoted as saying things like ""If you want an good home life then you should get another job."""
bad,"Unqualified management , job security is very low and pressure is high, not friendly atmosphere, mostly pretending they are doing their Jobs."
bad,Merged with another company and went downhill from there.  benefits cut.  Position duties expanded with no additional compensation.  Benefits package average.
bad,"Extremely dedicated employees, unfortunately post merger no longer appreciated.  No life work balance, push employees until they are burnt out and leave."
bad,As they transition into there lean environment they stomp all over their employees.  The pay is good but be prepared to do more than your share.  Human resources take an active dislike towards their employees and take every opportunity to eliminate them from the Job pool
bad,Great coworker poor management Worked at ATK Independence plant six years. After 4 years my pay went down almost yearly. Quit before  layoff. Don't work at ATK  you will be sorry.
bad,"You come in as early as they tell you too. You work all day to make the daily quota, They set that to pretty much whatever they feel like. If the teams are doing to good on a certain unit, they break them up and pair them with someone else. You di the same thing everyday. It does not change. They didn't give the same opportunities to everyone. You have to know someone to get ahead in the job, and you could not voice your opinion on something without getting into trouble, Overtime was murder and a lot of us never really spent time with our families like we should have. If you were a single parent they did not try too work with you on anything, you just had to take a point or find away to be there on time. Always looking for a reason to fire you. I mean always.."
bad,"Can't speak for the whole company, but the ACCE building is poorly run by management. Short term gains were prioritized even if it meant big losses in the long term, Machines were not properly maintained due to this mentality as well."
bad,Poor Management. Good old boy mentality. Nobody is held accountable for their lack of actions. Quick to point the finger away from them to make them look good and put the blame on others.
bad,This place used to be a great place to work. I would recommend to anyone years ago when I was hired on. Not anymore. This place is a sinking ship. However the pay is very decent.
bad,not a bad place to work but no room for advancment. i have learened alot here at atk....as what to do and what not to do in my next ventures.......good luck
bad,"The people I interviewed with were ok. Didn't get the job. "
bad,"Orbital ATK Magna, space structures facility was a great place to work.  The team members at OATK Magna were the best in the industry.  It is unfortunate that the upper management team was duped by a select few that resulted in the closure of our building.  I have never worked with a more talented and professional team in all my years.  It is a sad sad day that all of the talent and knowledge that supported our national defense systems has been dismantled by a few of the most glacially stupid individuals I have ever known."
bad,Company lacks mature management and a great sense of distrust exists between the employees and management.  Poor culture of quality and accountable management.
bad,"management is generally focused on projects and have little to care about employees goals. "
bad,made me think i had a job. laying off now after less than a year
bad,Dealing with bullets can always be interesting because you never know when a pop is going happen. A pop off is when a bullet randomly goes off.
bad,"Overall a great company, but can be difficult to fit in. Get to work on important projects right away, but sometimes expectations are too high for ""fresh outs""."
bad,Buildings outdated and in dire need of modernizing. In order to get from area to next you must drive your own personal vehicle and roads in terrible condition. Sometimes you felt like you were in prison.
bad,"Workers are mad and hateful,no one seems to care about quality product the company is all about the money they can make employees are ignored by management not a positive place to be."
good,they think of the bottom line not the people that work for them.
good,"a typical day at work was going in and doing stretches and getting assignments , then some was like production needed to hit rate and timed breaks , good part was  i learned and took classes for certification in NDI level1"
good,"You go in and do your job."
good,I would not work here until Production VP is changed. Aerospace. much of the work is repetitive.  management wants numbers safety and personnel come second.
good,"Nepotism meets a new level when employees are kept in place to manage for non engaged managers and does not afford company growth, equity or success due to this lack of engagement regardless of intent."
good,It was an ok job. The management did not care for their employees. I was told that I was replaceable. They cut wages and took benefits away from their employees.
good,Not up to date with machining processes you don't have a voice towards management on changing the way they machine their processes due to longer team of employees controlling the way things are machined
good,"When i was hired they were starting negotiations with the government for the contract. Not long after, I'd say, a month or two, they started talking about a reduction in force. they wanted to let loose of 900 people approximately. Which meant, I was likely to be let go eventually. What they wanted was for people to quit before they laid them off. The pay was quite good, and the benefits were decent. Worked with a bunch of good people. Management was so so. The hardest part was staying awake."
good,"Start building, ran safety meeting, ran production. I learned how to b a better leader. Managment : I loved working for all of my bosses. They didn't make me feel that I was capable of doing my job. I worked hard every day but never felt appreciated. Not all managment was like this. Co workers: I enjoyed my job and my co workers. Like in all jobs there are differences but nothing that can't be solved. There was nothin.g hard about the job but the hardest thing was pleasing the managment. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that at the end of day I did my job and fulfilled customers orders. Also knowing that what I did is helping our military perform their duties safely."
good,"Sigortam duzenli yatiyor..guvenilir bir sirket."
good,a very fast paced work environment with a lot of stress.  Long hours and a lot of work.  I would go back but I would not work so much.  They are very fast paced and NO mistakes allowed.
good,"medium pay, poor benefits package and very high insurance rates!  Some operations work shift work and Holidays.  Leadership is good but not very flexible to new ideas and innovation in operations."
good,Decent place to work especially the salary. At one time a great place to retire from. New management has begun to create a wall between them and the wage roll employees making daily work activities not function as smoothly. Wish the company cared more about its employees than the parts per labor hour produced. Unfortunate for incoming employees.
good,"Your job is never secure.  Company regularly cuts locations after buying out smaller companies. If bought you ""will be the shiny new toy"" for awhile but MN management will meddle with things they don't know and will mess up what was working."
good,need better benefits an better management. long hours an they lay off a lot you work any shift an job they tell you to an it dont go by your shift you was told to be on i hated it
good,"Although I accepted this role without knowledge of the merger and understanding from the leadership of potential for lay offs, I was thankful I was provided the opportunity to take a class and learn while I was there.  I believe I would have been successful if government funding had not been cut along with projects."
good,"Performing detailed design, implementing software code, and building prototype test fixtures"
good,Learned new methods for building spacecraft. management needs work.
good,"The day begins with a departmental meeting. Then begin doing the same thing you did yesterday and all days before. This job is repetitious and boring. If for some reason your department is down, you can be sent anywhere in the plant that they need you. The managers play favorites, you could be sent to packing, while a favorite would be left in the department that is down to sweep the floor tor the entire shift. The hardest part of the job is breathing any number of vile explosive powders, chemicals, and caustic materials. The noise level is greater than the exhaust of a jet airplane. The most enjoyable part of this job is many great people to befriend."
good,"For technicians and manufacturing guys, there isn't much for advancement.  For engineering there was, however the company is under new management and may not be the same as when I worked there."
good,Not much of an internship program. Senior and upper management all seem miserable. Learned a lot about what I want and do not want in a career. Company keeps going though merges.
good,"Company is being bought by larger defense company.  Take into consideration whether your job will survive post-purchase. Your will learn a lot, but the culture and environment will suck the life out of you.  It is the least fun work environment I've every been in.  9/80 schedule  is nice for some; for me it was tiring."
good,pay is ok depending on where you work. poor benefits. hard to grow with in the company if you are not friends with the right higher ups. management is usually confused about day to day operations.
good,"Good place to work but lack of management interaction with employees.  Too much attention given to deviations from processes and little recognition provided.  In spite of constant attempts for process improvement, unable to get anything done efficiently."
good,Not the best place I worked at. There are better places to work as a technician. I would not recommend this job to technicians because you will not get hired in or have career advancement.
good,We worked hard to attain goals set forth by management and corporate. As an employee I felt under appreciated about the work that we were performing.
good,Management plays favorites in shipping dept. last minute notice on mandatory overtime and long stretches of mandatory overtime that reaches up to 72 hours per week.
good,"A decent place to work. Not a dream job. Adequate work was provided and employees are treated civilly. "
good,"Not enough people voted against the terrible union contract, so we're stuck with a somewhat toothless union.  If you incur the wrath of an upper-level manager, your buttocks are grass."
good,Infrastructure and product are good but present management can be improved. Promotion process needs improvement as it appears to be based on who you know and not in what you know.
good,Orbital ATK was a wonderful company to work for.  As a young engineer I learned a great deal from my more experienced coworkers and had may great experiences.
good,I would say it is a good overall company. No real bad except the blind eye. The company respects your personal time. There seems to be a lot of change in the perks. People that do the production seem happy to you and are long time employees.
good,Started in 2000 for Programmed Composites. Fine small company that was efficient and enjoyable work environment. Bought by ATK in 2004. Not a good company to work for but good benefits.
good,"Workers are cool, good people. It pays well (if you're not in packing). You work long hours (60 per week). New union contract is horrible."
good,"ATK was a cool place to work because the people below the management level were cool, but to be honest the moral is really low and there is at least one person leaving ATK a week out of only 250 people that work at this site. That is just to much overturn."
good,"I Absolutely loved my job there and would still be there if it wouldn't had been for all the changes. I was on days for 10 years, then moved to evenings, midnights, then permanently on weekends. I guess it would be okay if we didn't  have a life, but we had a place at the lake that we were paying for, that we could no longer go to and a boat payment on a boat that we could no longer use. We also raced on the weekends in the spring until fall. I made the decision to find a different job."
good,I enjoyed working with the personnel there. growth was slow for awhile. I was moved to a position I did not enjoy (export Control) had a hard time understanding the government requirements. Left for an opportunity to do what I most enjoyed. Purchasing.
good,"The job has 9/80 work schedule, early hours or 1st. shift so be ready for early mornings.  Work/Life balance depends on how much OT you want to work. Ethically, be warily to whom you file grievances to.  Follow the proper channels and you will be fine.  Lunch is 30 min, short if you have to run somewhere to eat, especially for a 9 hour day.  Each department has their own management styles, find the right department that fits your work style."
good,The culture at this location was decent. Working facilities were also good. Leadership was ok. Morale can be down at times because of unrealistic deadline demands.
good,I didn't work at ATK long. I had no benefits and worked strictly for an hourly wage. They were flexible with the work hours which I needed. There was no job security.
good,Did Program and Project management on large government contracts.  Layoffs were a constant threat. Management was unresponsive to employee needs.  Co-workers were good and all working towards the mutual purpose of impacting national security.
good,"Small company feel made the facility overall friendly.  In a short time I knew many of the 130 people there.  Could reach out to anybody as needed."
good,"Unfortunately, I could not give this company a positive review. Although I felt good about what we did to support our troops, the company underbid the existing contract by over 900 million dollars and now they are taking away benefits and have deeply cut wages in some areas, layed off many, and many more will lose their jobs in the near future. The employees recently voted in a union because of their frustration with various factors. As a result, the company has massively stepped up discipline and make every effort to condemn all employees due to the actions of a few. Not a good place to walk into when the morale is so thoroughly devastated."
good,Co-workers friendly and nice to work with.  Orbital was experiencing internal struggles and constant reorganization resulting in promises & commitments to employees not kept.  Benefits were very good but compensation was not keeping up with the current market.  Could use some process improvement.
good,"It was a very family oriented company with family picnics,bring your child to work day. However the demand for unplanned emergency over time was out of control."
good,"Knowledge needed for your job is kept contained and confidential, so you never get a clear picture of what you should be working on."
good,"Very busy place to work, but the politics get in the way of work at times.  Unfortunately, a lot of people I know that worked there when I did have moved on to better jobs."
good,Many interesting projects.  Good co-workers.  Lots of Self-Direction.  One problem is I didn't keep current one my skills.  Another Problem is the company has changed hands too many times
good,the people that i used work with it's nice.as a supervisor i had that person needed supervisor to go classes.he did not have the skills to be supervisor.
good,"Acquired a good deal of experience in the fields of Project Management, Database Administration and IT. Attended several internal and external training courses."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, great salary. Short work weeks, advancement is a possibility. Great management. Work is repetitive, and allows you to stay on task."
good,The company structure was great at that time and they were moving in leaps and bounds.  The pace was super fast ans we were pushed hard.  The pay was low and the hours were long.
good,Got me through for the life span I was there but it’s got a new company coming in so look for new organization I can’t speak on them I don’t know what’s to come
good,"Government contracting is a lot like the world of an attorney  - clocking time in 15 minute intervals.  Problem solving and doing the right thing is impeded by whether a valid time charge code is available."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but was looking something more. I have been an engineer for many years and Orbital ATK has not been chanagleing me very much. I need a job that"
good,I enjoy the fact that there is always plenty of work. However the mood of the place seems to usually be on the low side due to the high stress and fast pace pertaining to the job.
good,Very high paced atmosphere.  We had very sophisticated machinery that we had to keep running.  This was all in the process of aeronautical parts. Most machinery we built on site.
good,Staff was fun; culture was good and company valued its employees.  Lost contracts and deficient backlog caused local division to close.
good,"Good place to work, however with recent mergers the company makes changes very often. More direction is needed from management to set more concrete policies and guidelines."
good,"The company is going through administrative changes due to a merger that took place in 2/2015.  As a result the corporate culture and administrative functions are in flux.  They are headed in the right direction, it will just take time to work out all the bugs."
good,this facility needs help!!! poor management is the biggest problem. thehardest part of my job is dealing with ignorant co-workers. the best part of my job is hmmmmmmmmmm....
good,"i enjoy the people that i work with. The uper management does not comunicate very well. you work love 4-5 hours days, feel like you never get to do a thing outside of work."
good,I have been very fortunate to learn a lot of information from a seasoned machinist.  I could not ask for a better bunch of guys to work with.
good,I didn't have a problem with the work or the workers there but the constant harassment you would get from the higher ups was not right.
good,"Great culture, provides for life long friendships, interesting work, cutting edge technology, Leadership/Management unaware of the potential and capability of the workforce."
good,Overall the company was a good place to work the building was very messy with product laying around but other then that it was a good place to work with good people.
good,"Generally good work atmosphere with occasional work/life balance issues.  Supportive management.  "
good,"Nothing really positive to say.  An awful lot of good people have been layed off or quit due to mismanagement and/or poor treatment.  Like I said, nothing positive to say."
good,Orbital ATK has a wide range of capabilities and scientific technologies and with the recent merger is evolving into the space launch business it has been focused on for many years.  With management focused on the space business the evolving company has some instability within the not well aligned legacy division that is resulting in continuous layoff and employment uncertainty.
good,"It was good experience work with small team, everybody was friendly and nice and the manager was an angle, it was very hard for him to tell me to go, your project is finished."
good,"good pay ,good health, close to home , hard working people how to make ammo ."
good,"Day at work- "
good,"Safety brief, up coming events"
good,The packaging department is hard due to the amount of product required and the speed needed
good,Great place to get your self a new trade but lacks cohesive networking of technicians
good,"Business knowledge is great, good people, good working spaces, most leadership was good to great. co workers were eager to share knowledge with you, overall good place to work."
good,"I was given broad leeway in my work day.  I left the company almost 20 years ago, so I find it difficult to comment on the present day company. The most enjoyable part of the work was the freedom to manage my work. The least enjoyable part was my interactions with some individuals in management."
good,It's a good company to work for and you work in a very clean environment. The hardest part for me was the 12 hour shifts. I am a person that prefers swing shift and I was working a day shift. If it had been a night shift I would probably still be there.
good,I learned alot of different areas at ATK. I learned to drive a combi which is a much bigger size of a forklift. I drove a regular battery operated forklift that I already had that skill of. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for 12 hours a day on concrete. Took a tole on my body.
good,"As the secretary and human rescources at ATK, I answered phones, scheduled interviews for new employee inquiries, scheduled appointments for clients, and conducted all interviews and hired all new employees."
good,"Management was not the best, we struggled with management managing the team. I enjoyed working with all the employees."
good,I learn a lot at ATK. First it was rewarding experience and knowing that we sending the best ammunition to our Military Troops. Co-workers was like family. We laugh and cry but most of all we help each other.
good,"First, I loved working at ATK in San Diego. The people are easy going, collaborative and the majority are welcoming to your concerns. The downside is, being a lower level employee (technician) upper management did not recognize the importance of lower level employees. I have gone above and beyond the call of duty and was doing the work of a ""higher pay/grade"" employee for 4 years before I was compensated correctly. When I was finally compensated I received the appropriate title but was told I wouldn't see the financials till the end of the quarter. It also seems to me that this site is very cluiqey. There is more to the MY story but I do not want to bore. Bottom line, I WOULD suggest anyone to work at ATK San Diego and I was invited back."
good,"Orbital ATK is a propellant and pressurant tank manufacturing company. I served as a receptionist and administrative assistant. Workplace culture was pleasant, friendly, and respectful."
good,"Inventory of product coming into area.  Needed to decide what the needs were for the packing department and try to push that product though to acceptance.  When there was a quality issues, it needed to be investigated quickly so that it wouldn't effect the production flow."
good,"ATK hunted me down for this position. Due to lack of Government contracts, many layoffs occurred.  I was one of 51 people laid off on the same day. brutal!  Good people to work with but you cannot control the business cycles."
good,"always down do to lack of planning. frustrating place to work. need to get organized for day to day production. never want to fix, just assess fault. need to do better"
good,"Typical day at ATK consists of stopping at the gate for 5 seconds so the guards can verify your badge, parking, walking through the under pass, taking your things to the locker or breakroom, clocking in, going to the nightly meeting, doing stretches and starting work. "
good,Go along well with my co-workers and projects that were organic to our production area normally went along smoothly. A large amount of red tape and politics but that can be expected at a large contractor.
good,"Everyday would be a little different. The production areas would run differently. We would have our good and bad days. I learned that if something doesn't get done right, then that affects everyone. I got along great with my co-workers, we helped each other out. The hardest part about the job for me was getting used to the work schedules, going from night shift to day shift then had to go back to night shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work and people i worked with."
good,"At first I was very apprehensive when ATK acquired the company at which I had been working for 10 years as they were a much larger company.  After the dust settled with the merger, I found the management and team members were very supportive and trustworthy. I was able to grow my career with significant responsibilities and compensation over then next 8 years. Although I did not always appreciate the meeting-heavy management approach, I did see the effectiveness for better communication and collaboration"
good,"There are a larger amount of generally older employees here that are soon to retire in the next 5-10 years. However, if you don't mind being in a company that may lay you off because the government isn't buying product or contracts aren't coming in, then you would like it here. Lot's of different departments to go to and management seems to be good. The pay is structured and is tier based. Benefits are good. The hardest part about ATK is not having enough to do, then having so much to do that you think you need a secretary."
good,"I really enjoyed working for ATK.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  Team like environment, with good communication.  Consistent work hours.  We worked a 9/80 schedule with every other Friday off, which is awesome."
good,The pay was good and I was provided paid schooling in my career field
good,Guzel bı isyeriydi kapatılmasından dolayı çıktım onun için yoksa çok güzel gidiyordu tam 16 yıl calistim
good,This is a very good paying job with great benefits but the negativity and low morale made for really long days and an overall terrible work environment.
good,"Management is very poor. Nice people, but just dont know how to work or do their job. A few members of management disappear off of the work site. Sad to say i would not recommend this company to a friend."
good,"Excessive Forced Overtime, Feast or famine Mentality. Incompetent Management. Dangerous Working Environment. Minor injuries were common and empathy from employer regarding said injuries was non-existent."
good,The job it self was a good quality but the management seldom actually knew what your job was and what it entailed. They also jump to conclusions and cover there  own end and hurt the actual workers.
good,Most of the upper management has been there for years. You really need to get in with them in order to advance your career there or you will be stuck with the position that you currently work unless you are part of the union.
good,"I worked at the Beltsville location for 12 years give or take. I love the people but the management was intimidating and I didn't feel like I had any open doors to talk to my manager. It wasn't always like that. There was a time where I wouldn't want to work anywhere else then they merged with Orbital and things got real bad. They took all of the morale boosters and charged us taxes on them if you came, then they cancelled them all together (Holiday party and crab feasts etc...). Fired all the good management and put mean unapproachable people in their place. Every time I had to talk to my manager he got mad and made sure I knew I was wasting his time. So sad they used to be family. Also the only break is a 40 min lunch. Don't get caught taking another break...."
good,Make a system to notify the temp employees when there are changes in their shift hours. There is something in place for full time employees but nothing for the temp employees
good,"Allowed me to grow in many areas of my career."
good,Would have stayed if there was another manager that was more qualified running the department.  Culture was counter productive and was causing issues with other members of the team.
good,"If you know what you'r doing management will leave you alone and its ok to work there, advancement might be a bit harder unless you been there for a while and people know you already."
good,The company lost the contract to operate a government facility due to not listening to the customer.  The old ways of operating does not work for the changing world.
good,Excellent company to work for.  Lots of internal training.  Great pay and benefits.  Ability to move up in the company.  Management and peers were great to work with.
good,This was the best employee environment that I have ever worked at.  There has been no other like this and there will not be another one.  Those days are long gone.
good,"The company is above average all around,  However, some departments are a revolving door for contractors.  In those departments, managers are distant with contractors and have no intention of hiring full time.  It appears some managers hire contractors to do the less interesting jobs that the full time employee don't want to do.  Hence, new people coming and going every month.  Those that are asked to stay are offered lower than market salaries."
good,"Lay-up and vacuum bagging of composite parts"
good,"Great experience a job to be proud of, great people and work environment, almost union but not. would definitely recommend to a friend. would definitely go back."
good,Great company growing in aerospace and defense.  Diversified for both commercial and defense work.  Great mix of staff that offers innovation and stability.
good,"Professional, great training programs, team work is the culture, good hours and work/life balance is supported, open door policy, travel is encouraged to gain good working relationships in other states."
good,Good environment good people great work hours. Very flexible with taking pto and allowing great benefits for family including health dental and vision
good,"As a finance intern, my daily tasks consisted largly of data analysis and program upkeep. Good pay and experience into the career path of corporate finance."
good,I enjoy working with Orbital.  Overall it is a great community.  Management does not provide equal opportunity's for all within the certain fields. The hardest part of the job is lack of communication.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenges you face on a daily basis. OATK is a very flexible and family oriented company."
good,"Just fixed papers that needed repaired or put papers in order "
good,"I have found this company a good place to work so far. I was introduced to the work slowly at first, but was then giver more assignments."
good,Orbital is a nice place to work and the personnel are great.  The work/home balance is as good as it can possibly be. There is a lot of tribal knowledge here but it seems as though they are trying to remedy that.
good,"The hardest part of working at Federal Premium Ammunition, is being a female safety engineer in a male dominated industry.  I was able to learn more than I ever thought possible about guns, ammunition, and explosives"
good,Work hard and play hard is our motto. We act as problem solvers for the business units and help to meet our customers need but we have fun doing it.
good," A typical day at work starts with inspecting my machinery and work area for any safety or prodution issues. After making sure everything is set up and ready to go we turn the machines on and do quality checks to make sure the product is 100% correct. After documenting the quality and production regularly we do preventative maintenance to keep our areas safe and productive. "
good,ATK is a good place to work at and has many different types of jobs to choose from. The management is ok but could use some work like any other company.
good,"Meeting, Set up machines, bring in product, run product for the day."
good,A lot of really smart people. Solar Panel Arrays for space equipment.
good,"I worked there for about two years, on a night shift, the work was fast paced and stressful at times, but the team effort was definitely there. management supported those who went above and beyond, even on an off shift you were recognized and rewarded for your efforts, a great place for those trying to get started in the industry"
good,"Being an intern here has many perks, and I was lucky to be under some great engineers. Management needs to sort some things out, but the projects I got to work on were beneficial and I was able to see them through. I got some experience that I couldn't get anywhere else."
good,"Engineering work can be exciting and rewarding, however the hours can be very long with little additional compensation. Advancement is also limited to non-existent.  Overall the work environment is friendly and most engineers (junior to senior) are involved with problem solving."
good,"Unfortunately, I am not motivated and have not done any electrical engineering in 10 months.  Management is fine, and if you get into the right group, things are good.  Some groups are not as favorable."
good,"During the pre-merger days, ATK Space in Beltsville was a solid place of employment with future goals of transforming the company from a components supplier to a bus manufacturer of spacecraft.  To that end many strategic moves were made to develop new markets and capabilities.  My time there during this period was exciting and an excellent career move.  Much of the work I did lives on now at Orbital ATK in Dulles, VA.  I wish them well."
good,"ATK was moving from Rocket Motor Case MFG to making composite airplane parts. A big change and exciting and challenging work."
good,We worked long hours but the pay was good. My hard work and making sacrifices for the company was recognized and so it made me feel real good. We had good competent managers and supervisors to guide us through the rocket motor refurbishment process.
good,"Lots of interesting projects you get work on. Legal team is great and easy to work with. Various areas and some travel involved. Company works a 9/80 work schedule. This means you work 9 hrs a day M-Th, then have every other Friday off."
good,"Great company just not stable enough a lot of turnover, Job security was uncertain and unstable. Good benefits  and great people to work with. Fun atmosphere"
good,"poorly maintained equipment, no atmosphere control in buildings, poor supervision, no attempt to keep buildings clean including bathrooms, supply chain poorly maintained"
good,"hour+1/2  drive. didn't want to relocate. got low balled. other than that, great place to work. interesting work. team effort. no chance for dayshift."
good,"NA everyday emails follow up with CAMs, meetings about new missions that were awarded and need to be budget it. Financial reporting on a monthly basis"
good,"My time spent at ATK was a great experience. I had the chance to work on the line, with machine's and shipping and receiving. All my co workers as will as supervisors where both helpful and inspiring."
good,Daily challenges to maintain and improve quality and customer satisfaction.  Coworkers are loyal and dedicated and can be close knit.  Reasonable work life balance.
good,Great upper and lower management until merger with ATK.  Good pay; light in benefits (days off; no pension).  Nice environment.  Have your own office with door
good,"Daily 15 min start-up meeting with staff and mgmt. Positive work environment between staff and mgmt. The job provides employees an opportunity to develop autonomy and strong leadership qualities."
good,"People are nice to work with. Management always seem to be in react mode. Compared to other Aerospace companies, Orbital could be more innovative and think less about the bottom line."
good,"Typical day at work includes reviewing forecast, managing budgets, measuring profitability, submitting proposals for new and follow-on work. "
good,Great work schedule hardest part for me is standing for 12 hours. If you like doing the same work every day then it is for you.
good,Worked in a warehouse with no A/C or heat. Learned how to pack and weigh bullets. Work a fast paced production line. Learned how to use a manual forklift.
good,The ATK proving Grounds was a great place to work but you have to watch out for management you do something wrong and they hold it over your head forever and layoffs do come around even though they say it will never happen
good,More work than they know what to do with. Lots of pressure from Customers. Expanding rapidly. Left right as Northrop took over. Unsure of any changes since.
good,"An overall good place to work, good benefits with Medical and Dental and a very clean environment to work in. Plenty of over time on Saturday's and Sunday's."
good,"Weak process control"
good,"Nice environment and people to work with.  Fair pay and benefits.  9/80 schedule with flexible hour.  Free water, coffee, and chocolate daily.  Clean and nice building to work with a caferia in the building."
good,"established aerospace company, rules in place which makes your job easier. just follow the rules. has working conditions and benefits typical of large company. good company"
good,"I built space components. I really liked the people, It was a very clean environment, They had all the safety gear  Always had anything I needed to do the job. Moved in several areas. received very good bonuses."
good,This is a great job the only issue is communication from management. Along with communication you must watch out for layoffs. If the market for gun powder is bad then it's time to start looking for a new job.
good,"Never had to work overtime. Good work/life balance. Direct management was good, but upper management decision making was a mystery. Everyone was very dedicated to the customer (US Mil) and wore red on Friday. This created a positive work environment. Customer often visited and talked to everyone. This does not happen everywhere so it really was nice. "
good,"Love working here, wasn't what I expected but it's cool. Looking forward to be full-time employee. Really enjoy what I do here"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some of the most highly skilled, enterprising minds in the Aerospace Industry, who are not only supporting but developing exciting and new enhancements and ground-breaking technologies in the field. The environment is ever-changing, fast-paced, and no two days are ever the same. Since the merger, health benefits willl cost alot more; however, Corporate is has increased the percentaage of the Company-matching of the 401K."
good,"Great place to work, with daily challenges and goals. ATK provided a lean culture with the tools to succeed, and grow professionally. Most of the work force is easy going and cooperative, with a can do attitude. the most rewarding part of our job is providing a quality product to the Nations war fighter."
good,Is built on a strong culture and has an amazing workforce. The company has a good mission in providing for the government and a strong ethical background. Unfortunately the company lives and breaths on the government and the contracts that they get through the government. Sometimes to be competitive they have to make cuts in the workforce and the employees that work there have little to no job security. Great pay but horrible job security.
good,"Great place, great people. I really enjoyed working at Lake City Ammunition Plant. The benefits are good. The pay is good. The hours were great with different shifts to pick from."
good,"A typical day of work would start off with daily stretches which gave the opportunity to greet your fellow coworkers and set the tone for the day, this I thought was a great way to start the day. Everyday had Goals to achieve and reaching those goals was both one the hardest part of the job but also the most enjoyable when met."
good,"The work after awhile becomes very repetitive with not much of a chance at climbing the ladder. Most opportunities are lateral movements to different areas. "
good,"The schedule is 12.5 hours. I had the night weekend shift. You are on your feet for the entire 12 hours."
good,"•	Primarily responsible for developing individual MS Project schedules; in turn creating and maintaining an integrated production schedule. The production schedule combines all active programs (~15) into a quick look format (MS Excel) that facilitates rapid evaluation of program interactions during the manufacture and test phase while maximizing production efficiency in terms of schedule and/or labor, and minimizing risk in terms of negative interaction with other programs or activities in terms of required floor space, test equipment, labor resources, etc."
good,Arrive at 7am. Leave  at 6pm. Great place to work. Enjoy co-workers and management. Great team.
good,ATK always tries to keep their personnel running lean so they can weather hard times in the defense world.  They are small compared to some of the giants so there is less money for training and research projects but they will listen and cover individual training on a case by case basis.
good,"A typical day at work entailed multi-tasking many projects, many of which were quite interesting from a technical standpoint."
good,"The shifts varied from 10 to 12 houred shifts. The job is very fast paced. It is a very repeatitive kind of work, and there is always soemthing to do."
good,"Check my site day diary and site activities .List notable activities and progress including verbal instructions .Important telephone calls ,damage,theft ,vistors,accidents. Seening the works on site being progressively prepared and enjoy the same"
good,The Team of 4 arrives and we all have a meeting to see what the day entails. We all are fexible enough to do each others jobs to get all the work done in a timely manner. Management alway has an open door policy and the communication is constantly flowing.
good,"I start my day, directing my employees their tasks for the day, meet with upper management for escalation issues and report planned /actuals results. I am very engaged in problem solving and customers interaction. We are progressing toward a lean manufacturing company."
good,I handled all aspects of assisting an Operations Executive Vice President as well as 4 Directors. I also handled timecards and day to day operations for over 450 employees. I enjoyed my time at ATK.
good,The Interviewers were Nice an Easy to  talk to had A Great Experience Working with ATK. I was  Crossed Trained in many Areas as a Technician 07. Worked Hard and was on time Every Day
good,I can't say anything huge about it because I didn't technically work there but everyone was nice. And I have no idea what I'm going to say with the rest of this so I'm wasting characters.
good,"I don't know why indeed is making me review this company, it no longer exists.  At the time it was a nice place to work with cool stuff going on.  So long OA"
good,"Really relaxed place"
good,I loved my team/work/life balance here.  This has been a great place to be a contract recruiter for and would love to come back in the near future if that happens.
good,"Great work environment. Communication is good."
good,"Assemble Missile Tracking Communications for the Patriot Missile System."
good,A typical day at work was calling and updating all documents that came in and put them in the computer software programs they work on.  Also scanned documents to update those as well in the system.
good,"I was working there as a contractor, so got no benefits.  As such, my experience is not typical of what regular employees would have.  I liked the work (satellites are pretty neat) and people and thought I was paid fairly."
good,"Great company and team.  Quick moving and growing.  Developers wear a lot of hats. Custom development, lab work and documentation.  Lots of oversight and backup."
good,Quick but balanced pace environment. Employees always helped one another. Great management. Overall work environment was great. Made lots of friends and overall enjoyed my day at work.
good,work anywhere from 8 to 12 hours. long hours and days last minute hours but nice checks. co workers are fun. getting a good check
good,"I  was selected as a Mfg Eng to assist in  everyday issues, past due assignments, SOP, SWI and recommendations of bottlenecks in production."
good,Challenging assignments and exciting programs that can't be easily found.  Company supports professional training and provides opportunity for technical and career growth.
good,"A typical day is filled producing material for the customer. I've learned  different job skills. The management most of the time is pretty good. My co-workers all have pretty good attitude, we all help each other out. The hardest part of the job is when there is alot going on at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is it's fun staying busy."
good,"Verifying all receiving Parts to Purchase Order and Q-Clauses."
good,"Well run, quality of product was always a priority. I beleive that the company will continue to be a leader in the reman business."
good,Challenging and rewarding HR generalist career. Talented and cooperative management staff. Spirit of teamwork and common goals.
good,Orbital ATK was a great place to work. They offered a very clean and safe work place. The management was excellent as well! If they had a location in St. George I would definitely work there.
good,Internship program is fairly new with the company. Great place that offers much help and many company sponsored events that include free meals. Much potential here.
good,OATK treats their employees fairly and compensates hard work.  Each location is considered a separate entity and has their own support system.  Compensation is good - benefits are comparable.
good,Work was always challenging and fun even though it was fast paced. Just hope the economy doesn't cost the company to cut jobs. Pay was competative......
good,Interesting work and good co workers. Loved working on things that you can see grow. And watching them launch and do what you built it to do. Very good place to have a career..
good,"A  typical day at work starts with a really lame safety meeting. Then you make ammo and b.s with your friends. By about lunch you can't stop staring at the clock because of boredom. Management is cool, there is a high emphasis on Servant Leadership and they choose managers wisely. The hardest part of the job is at about 3 years everything gets really boring. You can switch to a different department, but it's just the same old thing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and a solid paycheck. Great benefits and a solid 401K."
good,Good place to work ...I learned about organizing. Managment is ok.
good,Not a tremendous amount of resources but good people by and large.
good,I never in a million years expected to loose my job I planned on working at the company till retirement unfortunate after serious back problems I started self medicating for pain and not following my pain medication as wrote .It was never my intention
good,"Great people, great company, and amazing work.  Work load is high, but 80:9 help.  Great pay, great benefits, hiring bonus, secure job. Management wants to help employees.  All departments are stellar. Great visibility to promote your career.  Team mentality to get the job done in all departments.  Great company to work for/with."
good,"Good work environment. "
good,Co-workers are like family. Great work environment. Benefits are pretty good. Fun place to work. Good for independent workers not needing a lot of supervision. Highly talented personnel.
good,Was a great place to work the people at this company was very friendly and easy to work with. Excellent opportunity for advancement and a competitive promotional ranking.
good,The starting pay for a production tech is only $13 an hours which is far too low for industry standards.  The benefits aren't very good for such a large organization.  The turnover is ridiculous.  Management is a joke and so is career advancement opportunities - even amongt the engineers.
good,Enjoyed my work. Was very productive. Enjoyed working closely with the customers. Loved learning about composites anything to do with aerospace. I stayed busy and learned something new every day.
good,its a good place to work for the only problem is you never know when your going to get laid off
good,Nice place to work. Mangers and coworkers are very nice.Corporate culture is somewhat laid back and respectful of each individuals talents.
good,"I enjoyed working at ATK.  Their commitment to the internal advancement was very nice.  I worked there for over 11 years, and was happy during my employment."
good,"Worked on a forecasting tool to make day to day operations and purchasing more economical. Daily meetings with Supervisors, Department Heads and Department Vice Presidents. Presented and demonstrated the progress and function of a company interface integrating purchasing into the forecasting tool which reduced expenses dramatically"
good,Orbital/ATK is an aerospace company that provides plenty of opportunities to grow within your profession. I enjoy working in a fast paced and team oriented environment.
good,"I like this company, I'd learned alot working to this company,its a great experience. My supervisors are amazing and we have very kind manager. What I enjoyed the most at this company is during December, they give you lot's of goodies i meant they give you gifts and every year they give you nice flowers for appreciation for doing such a great job. It's just such a good workplace."
good,"Pick-up samples of solutions, components, raw materials, and chemicals. Prepare samples for visual and gage inspections and testing. Records results and make distribution to various areas making sure that all forms/records are correct and samples are kept segregated when necessary"
good,It has a lot of variation. Great learning. Hands in a little of everything. exciting programs and a challenging place to push yourself. if thats what you're looking for.
good,"This division is undergoing drastic efficiency improvements in an effort to become more competitive. They are also transitioning from a fun engineering house into a corporate profits driven machine."
good,Working at orbital atk was a fast paced place were you have to know what you are doing quickly in order to succeed at your job. The people can be friendly but you do your job as you are asked.
good,Atk is a good place to work with a positive working enviorment the only down side is the bennifits ard expensive it is also hard on your body. this is also for vista outdoor not orbital atk
good,I enjoyed working at ATK. The project i was able to be involved in was  nice and changeling. I would like to work where there is more challenge and more opportunity for advancement. Basically on a day to day duties i would load 500 pound tooling and precisely position them to run the preset program set to cut the desired part. Also there was alot of cleaning and upkeep of the machines. I was also in charge of all manual moves that any other machinist wanted to do. Basically i was there for insurance of the machine.
good,I really like this company. They lost their contract to another company and I was laid off. Waiting for a call back.
good,I have worked at OrbitalATK for over a decade and it has truly been a learning experience that would be hard to replace. Hourly employees are active in nearly every department from basic operations to supervisory positions.
good,a very good company to work for they treat employees very good and have tons of great benefits
good,I enjoyed my time at ATK.  Some of the upper management were a pain to work with but my bosses were very good.  It seemed that upper management turned over quite a bit so you just needed to hold on until one came along that you liked.  Overall it was a great place to work and over 32 years I saw a lot of changes most of which were for the better.
good,"The work is hard but honest.  They aren't too forgiving about being sick though and I had caught the flu and I literally could only stand to be there half the time.  My illness (which I had caught from a co-worker who happened to be a nice person) had also triggered nosebleeds bad enough to have me need to go to the hospital twice, the first bout of which forced me to have to go home early again.   Also, they kept telling me I wasn't versatile enough, but never instructed me as to when exactly I was supposed to rotate jobs.  There was no regular rotation and every time I found a bit of free time on my hands and went looking to help the other workers, I could easily see they didn't really need my help.  So they kept blaming me when all it was is I literally couldn't find anything else to do other than sweeping floors and taking out trash when things were slow in the area where they cleaned molds.  "
good,"Great manager, great work to life balance, nice office, travle could be a little over whelming but very rewarding. If you get to work early you get covered parking."
good,"I loved my job with ATK, now Vista Outdoors. The Management team that I worked with truly cared about their associates and making quality products. It was really awesome having a company store on-site and getting products for a really great price!!"
good,"For the past 2 ½ years, I was working on a program specific environment. I was not given direction from my Supervisor or our Quality Manager; my duties and assignments I created myself in base of production progress and milestones"
good,"ATK is a great place to work. They are a very large company with many divisions-brands."
good,Working at ATK Space Systems I learned quite a bit.  Not only about IT Security but how to deal with different types of people without letting them get under my skin. I had an awesome team which was more like a family. My only wish is that I am able to find a team like that again!
good,been an amazing place to work and has taught me many different skills. also has increased my ability and enjoyment for hunting and shooting for sport. met and work with tons of great people in a large range of ages.
good,"I work nights as an Inspector now, my job in-tales inspecting bullets for the government. Co-workers and I work well as a team. Hardest part of the job is working 12 hour shifts at night. The money and benefits are good which makes it worth it."
good,"Great place to work, management will/want to know you, work is either super slow or very hectic. Would recommend to colleague and other who would want to work here."
good,The hardest part of working for ATK is the sales aspect.  Getting out there to meet medical practices that are in need of a professional billing service.
good,"kitting tools from 12 ply's to 60"
good,Orbital ATK is a great place if you desire a challenging career.  A place where you don't see the same challenge twice.  Each day is a new adventure.  The company is large so getting acquainted with everyone would be a challenge
good,"Been around and ATK tries to staff to survive the lean time and not do the fatal ""layoff the extra employees"" when times go lean.  If you had  to compare their layoffs to most other contractors you'd have to give them an A for effort.
