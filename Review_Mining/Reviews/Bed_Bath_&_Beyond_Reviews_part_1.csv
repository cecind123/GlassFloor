bad,"wouldn't recommend to anyone. place isn't flexible on hours, pay is bad, they promise things and they dont hold their end of the bargain. highly unsatisfied"
bad,Often lies to employees about advancements. I wouldnt recommend anyone apply unless you plan on needing a reason to hate your life. You are better then how they will treat you.
bad,"Lousy place to work! Managers are lazy and negative, Passive Aggressive, Management arrogant and very poor communication skills. "
bad,Manager we very unprofessional and rude my mother died and the manager by the name of sunjan said all black people say there family die so they don’t have to work
bad,El gerentucho es grosero. Cero profesionalismo no debería trabajar con gente. Te trata como si te hiciera el favor... Que poca calidad de empresa.
bad,"This job was the worst. I would never work here again. The management was absolute TRASH, and they wouldn’t give me days off I needed for my college classes, although I reiterated I was a college student in my application plenty of times. The management are liars, I had to get a person of higher authority involved in situations and the people in HR would play dumb. I DONT recommend this job AT ALL."
bad,Very low pay! The pay does not justify the work. Upper management are two-faced and become vindictive if you try to voice your opinion. Problems are swept under the rug and employees are not valued at all.
bad,"This job was such a BAD EXPERIENCE ! stay away!! This company has zero work culture, only OLD people worked in this department and they did not know how to get with the times, they are very old fashion and did things very differently. They would get upset if you are looking at the news online. Like COME ON! Such a horrible work place... I would never recommend this place to anyone."
bad,This co. suck it's a prison i don't care how much they pay they suck the managers is awful.The biggest high turn over on employees and mangers all good managers left. This place is not a real work place the operational managers is not a good managers he needs help. He sleeps with the workers. This place is just awful. HR is a joke.
bad,Just not a good environment to work in if you are a energetic person....management need to be re train...no respect between boss and workers....store morale is very low...
bad,"The local management is ok. The Market and regional, who are sacred to lose their jobs due to the changing company, were awful. Hateful to employees, and could not care less about the work environment. so happy to be away from a company whose days are numbered."
bad,"Management biased  and not open to the idea of innovation.  Lack diversity. You get promotion, bonuses based on who you know not your work. Worst company in my 23 years of work. Pathetic and zero diversity.  IT Management biased towards certain ethnic group."
bad,They think because they pay you their justified in what they do to you. Stay away literally treat employees as if their worthless and despensible. Company itself has to change from the top.
bad,"While the managers want the store to succeed, they have limited ability to manage or on-board staff in a systematic way. Communication up front, not just criticism after the fact, is so important. Never could get a straight answer to basic questions. Left to struggle as a new employee with very sketchy, incomplete training. One assistant manager cared and communicated clearly, teaching and coaching at teachable moments, and I was very grateful. Long-time colleague was also a lifesaver, sharing guidance freely. The other two just ignored and found fault - old school. They need leadership training. It's not just about bossing people around, it's about seeing what's needed for success and providing it."
bad,"I began working here two years ago and luckily left a few months ago. Bed Bath & Beyond is a terrible company to work for. They cut a lot of hours, micromanage, and they never like to give raises. Before leaving, they wanted us to promote credit cards and the new coupon program, but for no benefits to the employee. While working here I learned NOTHING about professional development, how to talk to people, and there was no opportunity for advancement. The only thing I learned was that: if you did not learn to speak up for yourself, the managers would take advantage of that. They would then schedule you for the worst shifts including Friday-Sunday, while they each made arrangements on which day a manager would work. It was pretty unfair and there was also favoritism. Honestly, I would advise anyone thinking of applying here to not do so and look elsewhere for better pay, respect, and actual professional development. This store was pretty unprofessional and the operations manager was extremely nosey. I REGRET wasting time of my life in this company and now work for a far better company which actually cares about their employees and create incentives for employees to be productive while working independently."
bad,"This company has lost it's way. It really set itself up when they paid Department Managers  Chinese overtime.( Get paid less the more you work).  They got rid of the Dept Mgr position and once they got the taste of blood, these  vultures started targeting the Asst Mgrs.  They were so blood thirsty they practically put a salaried manager in every building in our district on a PIP just to reduce the salaried manager count. The workload is the greater with less help."
bad,"WORST COMPANY TO EVER WORK FOR!!!!!!!!They treat their employees like garbage and work you like a slave...an underpaid slave at that!! I have several disabilities and have undergone several major surgeries (past major surgeries and currently pending 3 more surgeries) and the managers (BOTH store level and regional) REFUSED to give me reasonable accommodations. I even made several complaint to Human Resources and NOTHING was done to resolve any of my complaints and because of this, I WAS FORCED TO QUIT due to constant harassment and retaliation. They cannot keep employees because the work environment and work conditions are so horrible that employees are constantly quitting. The sad thing about this is the company only focuses on generating customer revenue but fail to realize that the employees are just as important because we are customers too. We have the inside scoop on what REALLY goes on behind closed doors and what they REALLY think about you all, the customers. Social media and word of mouth will spread or go viral and can and will have a HUGE IMPACT on the success or failure of a business and can also have a huge impact on a company's FAILING  revenue sales as well. In other words...WHAT GOES AROUND COMES RIGHT BACK AROUND, AND THIS IS WHY THEY ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!! K.A.R.M.A!!"
bad,I started the job from an HR lied to about how much I would be making after training. There was no apology or remorse. The management clearly has no care for their workers but do their best to retain them during the holidays because they need them. The management has a lot of humility to learn and I expected HR to represent me as a worker. Very disappointed and it is clear morals to this company don't apply to the average low paid worker. Find a place that respects you as an employee.
bad,"High turn over rate, bi weekly pay is worthless, no matter how good u are at ur job they will find something to make u look bad at the company, there trying to run there warehouse like Amazon and be super controlling"
bad,"Managers are corrupted. Not a place to work for genuine talented employees. Fake employees with lots of polytics , there is racism also. No mechanism to know who is working & who is faking. Very dangerous place to work"
bad,"Been here for almost two year at the saskatoon location cant even do my own returns without a manager or a supervisor present. cant even out money bacnk onto a debit without one. get yelled at daily after kissing their butts, coming in early and staying late yet im one of the top emplyees there."
bad,Total waster of time and energy. Do not get a job here. The company is going out of buisiness. They will term your employment before benefits kick in.
bad,Beware.... I applied as a simple cashier and the store has cashiers doing  everything.... you are like a slave  working for this company.... when I first applied i looked at all the employees and all of them look miserable.  Its not worth what they pay for everything you do
bad,they will work into the ground to push themselves ahead higher level management cant be bothered to remember the names of the longest running associates.
bad,"And absolutely awful place to work. They fired me while I was on medical leave. Told me I needed to show up after a bad car accident, during which I sustained serious injury. I’m happy not to work there anymore."
bad,"Salary, hourly and bonus amounts differ for each customer service, operations and corporate location and are NOT based on experience.  A trainee will start at $1.00 or more per hour than a 5 year veteran.  Managers have less experience than a 2 year seasoned CSR.  Every ISM imaginable is rampant in the Totowa NJ location.  HR complaints have always been swept under the rug.  Save yourself a missed opportunity to work for a real corporation and pass up any job offers from Bed Bath & Beyond.  It's not worth the yearly barbeque and free ice cream.  DId I mention bedbugs?"
bad,Very crooked company top level personnel got fired for cooking the books the company as a whole is in a never ending down ward spiral they will sacrifice very pawn they have to save themselves and guess what if your at the bottom of the token pole your job is never safe run far away and work any where else
bad,"This is a terible company to work for in every aspect. As a sales associate you will be responsible for one half of the store, ringing up customers as well as keeping your section immaculate. Good luck in getting your employee log in to work for the beyond orders. You need to have five hands and eyes in the back of your head to get everything accomplished in your shift. Be expected to know everything about your position in a short time. You will receive a small handbook and have to sign many documents for every step of the training process. The worst part of this job is dealing with management, extremely unprofessional. They really do not know what they are doing. The log ins don't work, your pay will be late and paperwork will not get submitted. If you do not understand your job duties you better not ask any questions or you will be reprimanded and scolded for your lack of comprehension. Some of the coworkers are ok and others are jerks. I think they forget that they were new to the job too once before. For the most part they are impatient with any mistakes that you make during your training period. Customers can be high maintenance and condescending as in anywhere. There are some that are understanding when we are out of a product even though it is listed in the computer as being available. Oh and do take your break out of the store or you might be paged during lunch!"
bad,"Little to no job security or advancement, management was a joke and outright said that if you didnt like it or any changes they make to straight up find a new job. So I did. Dont work here."
bad,"As part timer if u work more than 5 dont have any breaks like other retail stores offer, expect too much but dont give anything back, poor management."
bad,"It’s cute if you wanna be busy Employee discount is the same as the customers, Hours suck, you will be hired for one department and than find yourself working the entire store,no real training,can’t move up , under paid ,bad communication"
bad,"People are great, company as a whole is horrible, they don't take care of their people..company does bare minimum, upper management doesn't respect the co-workers."
bad,"This company has no hope, it never listens to employees for opportunities for beneficial change for the company. Stubborn to change. Laid off 880 managers for no apparent reason. I trained my replacement. Customer service needs to be more realistic about their expectations"
bad,"They start you out at 13 an hour which is terrible for the cost of living in the area was promised to make 14an hour and once you are close to it they will switch the pay structure and the way to get a raise. The environment is not structured at all, management and HR department seem to change the rules almost once a week and when you question it they seem to have no answer as to why it's for the better etc. Overall just a very terrible company to work for they are super shady and will try to cheat you out of every dime you make. Multiple employees had screw ups on checks and they refused to pay them out or fix the mistakes. Before I left the company we had multiple meetings about the future of the company and how they have to make budget cuts to pay role due to the company not doing well as a whole. They tell you to treat it as if it's your business and to make the customer happy but once you do you get questioned about it and why you did this and not that. Little to no training for what you will be doing and once on the floor you are on your own and it seems as if you are a bother if you ask any supervisor a question. Worked on a holiday and then the center closed the next day  due to a hurricane and they took everyone's holiday pay away due to the center being closed. This is just one of the shady things that happened in my time there I could write a book on how bad this job and company treats their employees. But DO NOT FALL FOR THIER TRICK, PLEASE TRUST ME NOT A COMPANY YOU WANT TO WORK FOR AT ALL!!!"
bad,"High turn around, pay based on location,  typically do not hire full time.  Currently reorganizing the company from top to bottom. Training is now computer based"
bad,"The interview process should have been my 1st clue. Took over a month from start to finish to get hired."
bad,"I worked here for a very long time. Had a lot of employee of the month awards, worked harder than anyone including managers. Was promised a full time position but was never given even though I worked full time hours."
bad,"If you are able to do the work of 3 people during 1 shift, this is the job for you!  If you love to hear everyone complain, this is the job for you!"
bad,The company is ghetto. The managers are sleeping with CSR’s. Not professional at all. The pay was ok. The waiting for your pay raises was aggravating. No support on the floor. One day you can come in and you have no manager or supervisor for your team. It’s in a mall parking lot. Not safe at night.
bad,"First warehouse job. Training is bad, communication is bad, totally unorganized, the wrong people get rewarded. Literally probably the worst warehouse in the area. If you like to get away with wasting time and getting paid for it this is the place for you. Management is TERRIBLE. Lazy and judgmental."
bad,I’ve never disliked a job in my entire life. This was by far the worst job I’ve ever experienced. I’d rather be jobless than to have this job. No cap.
bad,The management was absolutely terrible. They would get mad at you when you ask for help. Didn’t teach you anything. They don’t give enough hours. Not flexible with your schedule. Short breaks. Too much work for little pay . I do not recommend working their
bad,"Hated every minute I was there. Management will only look out for themselves and never encourage a happy environment. You worked hard and the discount incentive was the same as a customer using a coupon. No movement up the ranks was possible, hours were severely cut,  and when I finally got my paid raise, they included the update NY wage increase as part of my ten-cent raise after working for 18 months. I highly DO NOT recommend this company."
bad,This is the worst place to work. Want numbers but can’t pay for production. Managers talk to associates like you are nothing and they want you to waste your points or your sick days on mandatory overtime
bad,"By far the worst work environment I’ve ever placed myself into. At least 8-10 people quit in a 2 month timeframe... And that speaks volume. If you know your worth, don’t apply here."
bad,"would give 0 stars if i could. hands down the worst job i have ever had in my life.  management sucks, nobody likes being there to the point that people start counting down minutes at the very beginning of shifts. people call off and quit constantly. everyone, workers and management alike, hate being here to such a palpable degree that there is no such thing as a good day at this job. i was always doing work outside of my job description, and definitely wasn’t making the money i should have been making for such work. do yourself a favor and never work here."
bad,"If you desire to be verbally used, then go to work for BBB! If you are 18 and live at home expect store manager to call apparent to notify of you being late or not showing up for a shift."
bad,It was a great experience on setting up for grand opening new store. I got the experience to set up a store where people love to stop and getting to know new people.
bad,"BBB has undergone significant cultural changes in recent years.  Business decisions were made in the last 5 years that negatively impacted sales and culture. Hopefully a new CEO will inject the needed business acumen necessary to save this beloved brand.  Layers were added and executive positions created for people who had no brick & mortar background or had little experience or had been consultants or ran agencies and had no practical retail experience.  Unfortunately, although very smart, these people believed they knew more and better than those who built the company.  They had no problem marginalizing these people and dismissing institutional knowledge.  They didn't understand the business, the customer needs or how to build on why the customer loved BBB.  Hopeful for a better future and significant changes that lead BBB back."
bad,"You walk in and no one is happy so that makes for a stressful environment. From this I learned a smile can go a long way. You need to portray happiness to your customers, not grunt at them because they are interrupting your thought on how to re-do a display. Id say the hardest part of the job was going everyday knowing I was underappreciated and would not receive the extra hours I would request."
bad,too many csr's and management being terminated or quitting due to lack of leadership.  If you have a voice in the company you are looked at differently.
bad,"I worked at the Brampton location for years and used to love it. Then this past December it all went downhill and recently caused me to quit due to the horrible management and organization. I was dreading going into work every shift and didn’t need the stress in a part time job I once used to love. The store is a complete joke with an unfair management team that seem to be untrained, unprofessional, disrespectful and do not take care of their associates at all. The associates are constantly at fault yet there is no repercussions for managers that are treating their associates this way. It is disgusting. We are told to greet every customer and provide great customer service, however this rule doesn’t seem to apply anymore to the management team at this location. "
bad,Horrible company to work for.  Back stabbing culture.  Only respected a few managers in the region.  The rest just drink to kool aid.  Look at the stock chart for the past few years to see where they are headed.  RIP
bad,"As a person who has worked retail for many years, I never thought I’d have to deal with this! No hours have been given since the day I was hired, literally 3 weeks going on 4! Help me understand!? So many people left their previous jobs thinking that they would be working!! I was also told I was getting the top sellers position through the co-manager (who I haven’t seen or herd from since she left for vacation), but when they procrastinated on finishing my application I had to re-do the whole application and she made me a sales associate!!"
bad,Unprofessional lack of interest of on the job due to unearned positions. The blind leading the blind no room for growth. Management is unprofessional in handling situations...
bad,The management did not work with his employees and it was very hard to communicate with him. Management had his favorite employees and often told them ahead of time about sales and store promotions of merchandise. Very poor working conditions.
bad,I would never suggest working on Route 1 Bed Bath & Beyond management she sloppy she don't know how to talk to people she don't know how to treat people she thinks she is above everybody and she is the most sloppiest manager I ever seen.
bad,The job was boring and the people I worked with didn’t make it any easier. One of the front end supervisors was rude to the customers and to the employees as well. The manager was very unappreciative. I would’ve stayed longer but it was just too much to deal with
bad,"I was trying to secure this job for well over a month. They lost my resume and forgot about my scheduled interview. When I needed to get in touch with the manager about my work hours since I was going back to school. None of the managers were able to help me, and they failed to tell me that the only person able to change the schedule was on vacation."
bad,"The management at the Brampton location is an absolute nightmare. There’s absolutely no support from managers during shifts. If one of them sees that you need help with assisting a customer, or fulfilling a TBS order, or cashing out a customer, or grabbing an item from a high shelf, they’ll do everything they possibly can to avoid helping you. When associates have a legitimate emergency and need to call off, there is zero sympathy or compassion from the managers. You get written up for anything and everything.  If you don’t do certain things, like be overly bubbly when a customer is talking to you? Written up. If you don’t make enough online TBS orders in a month? Written up. If you come in 2 seconds late to a shift? Written up. The hardest part about this job was not the duties or the customers, but rather the toxic environment that enveloped myself and my coworkers. The turn over rate for this location is absolutely insane. I’ve seen so many coworkers quit on the spot because of the stress. Often times HR will have associates from other locations come to our store to help out, because so many people will quit that we become short on staff. In the time that I’ve been here, over 45 people have quit or been fired. They look for any reason to fire associates, so everyone walks around on their tip toes. Managers here treat associates like absolute dirt, and it’s a shame what this location has turned into. I sincerely hope that no one has the misfortune of calling Bed Bath and Beyond their place of employment. Have some respect for yourself and work somewhere else, where you’re"
bad,Mgmt. inconsistent says 1thing and 1 says another.You get 6hrs a week but there hiring cashiers.Poor service due to many rules for customer to follow.
bad,"I didn't like it there at all. The company makes millions per year and had the nerve to ask retail staff to clean bathrooms, when they can afford to hire a cleaning crew."
bad,"No advancement unless you're kissing serious butt. Expected to treat customers like royalty while you're treated as slaves. Make you build things without certification and when you get hurt, they fight you about workman's comp."
bad,"The GM of our store was great however the 2 lower managers under him are very rude and talk to you so disrespectfully. They make you feel stupid. The customers are horrible they need their 20% off of EVERY item, as a cashier you have to clean the bathroom.. which should not be a cashier duty , hours are super unsteady. Went from 38 hours when I started to less then 10 hours a week!"
bad,"I used to love working here, but since management changed, they treat you so horrible. A manager laughed at me when I was talking about my bipolar.  Don't work here, you get treated like trash"
bad,You basically taking care of everything when there’s not enough workers because they hire and fire people left to right. The managers are nice sometimes but always have attitudes with customers.
bad,"The company used to be wonderful to work for. Over the last 4 or 5 years, it has gone downhill fast. Lack of support. No continued training. A jaded upper management team. It's become a very negative place to work."
bad,"Guess everyone saw they make all their asst mgrs hourly. Dumb decision. They are only now putting up price labels, something everyone else has been doing for the past 30 years or more. They are so behind the times. Their technology is at least a decade behind. And the management is so poor. Making the asst mgr hourly leaves no future for the company. I suspect they will not be around in 5 years."
bad,"They did not train me and had me close one night on “soft-side” I was so stressed because I didn’t know how to answer customers questions I didn’t know where anything was. Worst experience ever, I constantly had migraine and, Threw up because it was so stressful. And they do not approve any request for days off your better off just calling out because they will not give you any days off."
bad,"Turnover in recruiting department because of horrible management!"
bad,The only benefit I got from bed bath and beyond was learning customer service and learning how to work in retail. Its not a place to work if youre looking for advancement or high pay. They use and abuse the good workers and you are only recognized for the things you dont do never the good things you do. Bottom line just dont work there.
bad,"Coming in would start right away. I did mostly returns and online orders. We would responsible for tagging our returns and keeping the Customer Service clean. "
bad,poor commuicaton skills hours werent very good. mamagement was not great alot of things down hill after mangement left. ok company to work for but not the best.
bad,"I was unfortunate enough to get suckered into working here while they were in their ""peak season"", so I ended up working twelve hour days, five days a week, for most of the time I was there, even though I was told it was ten hours, four days a week when I interviewed."
bad,"Was not a good workplace what so ever. Management was terrible and lacking in every aspect, the worst job that I have hard in my years of working a job. Would not recommend at all."
bad,"The company it self wasn't what I expected, the managers are rude as ever, and they write you up for everything. While training I kept getting grief, and I was not trained properly.Their inventory devices are out dated, and difficult to use. My trainer kept leaving and acted as if he didn't want to train me. This company isn't diverse, They play Hispanic music all day long as if there is only Hispanics in the warehouse. Every request to diversify the music was denied. Everyday I came to work ready to learn and improve myself for the company. Everyday I was met with dirty looks from managers, they acted as if it was difficult to greet you.I was also told I can only talk on breaks, while others were able to talk to one another. When I spoke to the manager about the issues that I was having, I was told no one last long in the company because of their strict rules. It isn't a good place to begin a career.  It is as if they hire you just to fire you, I received my first write up three days into training without warning for talking.I didn't get a chance to complete training before feeling like I was being attacked.  I attempted to hang on to the job and ignore the negativity, but every week it was something. Eventually I became uncomfortable, and didn't want to return. There are other employees that feel the same as I do, but they fear losing their jobs if they speak up. (I'm just being honest) from my experience."
bad,"Every single person I worked with hated their job. I would never recommend this to anyone. Everyone in management was either cruel or snide. Never flexible. Very fake. Toxic work environment. You get the same discounts as the customers so there are no benefits. New employees will leave relatively fast so if you work there long then you just say Hi and Bye all the time, it is a revolving door. Constantly hiring."
bad,I would not recommend this job it's not a friendly environment it's for people who don't see no career advancement that wants to make lazy money they might as well close it down cause it's not like they were doing good in retail anyways
bad,My first retial job and worst one hated it so much I ended up quitting. Management doesn't know.how to tall either and they expect so much and give you minimum wage.
bad,"BBB Richmond Hill's management is disrespectful and inconsiderate of all of their employees. They are quick to judge and talk trash about their employees in front of their customers. There is no room for growth or a reasonable pay raise for any deserved effort. They always mess up the schedule, every single week they are revising and revising until there is no one working on the floor... its a real mess. I honestly beg you to stay away from this place, and you will know why when you get the job and instantly see it for what it is."
bad,"When I first started everything was good until I went on medical leave and they tried to fire me, Rules change every day and you can’t tell a manager anything because they tell your business."
bad,"Hostile work environment.  Management only cares about themselves. They are not there to better there team, unless it can contribute to them getting a promotion.  Poor work life balance."
bad,"Only work here if it is temporary or your first time, co workers are nice to work with, yet managers are unappreciative. other than that please do not waste your time."
bad,"Terrible manager and subordinate manager. Lack of consideration for employees situations, consistent mistreatment of employees, (trying to overwork employees without pay) Lost employee records that points out companies flaws. Delay employees breaks and lunches to service customers."
bad,"The job is fast paced however the are completely short staffed all the time and customers notice and always need assistance but there is never enough staff because sales associates are pulled up to the front because there aren’t any cashiers. Management purposely ignores availability for scheduling and makes it your problem if you are scheduled for a shift that they knew you couldn’t work. I was full time and was only given part time hours. No room for advancement. They train you to work in all departments so that if there is an issue with staffing they can pull you from your department, ex: warehouse employees called to cashier, or work customer service, as opposed to them actually hiring people. And employees are overworked so a lot of them come in cranky and tired."
bad,"This call center is horrible, managment is horrible and the customers are also horrible."
bad,"A job that had flexible work schedules but no future. Learned a lot of customer service skills. Management can be tough sometimes, throwing a lot of work on associates."
bad,management not proffessional . unfriendly employees. always have scheduling errors. bbb is not a company i reccomnend to other people to work at. its not a good company to work for and management is unbelievably awful to their employees
bad,Hours were not guaranteed. Half trained on everything. Stuck working without breaks or back up when there are lines in the store. Management treats you like your a child and dressing you down in front of others and customers.
bad,this job is not for someone who has kids because they don't pay fairly. they cut hours like crazy for anyone who is partime which leaves them only working 2 days a week
bad,Unprofessional .. Make you work EVERY weekend .... don’t care about you nor YOUR kids !!!! RUDE & Have NASTY ATTITUDES .. CUSTOMERS are annoying with the coupons
bad,Bad place to work nothing more to say. Very bad place to work. At first it was okay but after some months you will see there true color. The manager will treat you like you are nothing and go from working full time hours to working twice a week to only 4 hour shift which was only 8 hour shift for every week
bad,"The managers are old and are only working there to make a living. They don't care about you and themselves. As a newbie you will carry the blame even when it's not your fault. There is little to no guidance during your training. Every time you run into a new problem you will be expected to know how to handle it and when you do it wrong it's your fault you didn't know. The managers contradict everything they say. This isn't a place to learn, especially for the rising millenials. When I was there people were getting laid off. The company is continuing to fall apart. The facility may look big but do not expect many customers. You will stand around for hours most days and have nobody to socialize with. Expect to starve for at least 5-6 hours before break. It's a horrible work environment."
bad,"below average paid positions, management encouraged and participated in work place bullying, employees where regularly discriminated against and when complained about employees were shortly there after terminated."
bad,"essentially oversees the shipping and delivery of materials and warehouse personnel. They mainly work in warehouse settings and for retailers and wholesalers and are involved in managing the loading of trucks, setting up delivery routes and unloading of material."
bad,"I was a sales associate for a little less than a year. I worked in the Harmon's area (that's the beauty/health department), my coworkers were fine and easy to get along with, all the managers were terrible and rude though. customers can be really awful, but that comes with the job I guess. almost everybody who works there ends up quitting. not much room to move up in the company. they're always hiring because nobody wants to work here."
bad,I will recommend bed bath & beyond as a work place because the environment is very cool and different things to see . The only thing is I feel they should offer people more hours and better pay . Its a very fast pace job and a lot of energy that has to be brought into it .
bad,really it was all the managements fault for making it such a rigid environment where you feel like you could have your head bitten off at any moment. most managers were great but when the store head manager came in the mood changed in a second.
bad,Horrible management. Hours fluctuate constantly. Shady co-workers and even shadier management. Not worth the stress. The pay is lacking and so are the raises.
bad,I would never refer anyone to work there. Too many people get hurts there including myself. The company gets stricter and stricter since I left there.
bad,"The location I worked at was not good for growth or to move up. They underpay for the amount of work they have employees doing. There were no raises even when you’re supposedly moving into a higher position, and there is no proper training from management when moving into a supervisor role or different  position in general. The management was not enthusiastic, productive, or helpful. Some workers get away with avoiding their work and putting it on other people, and there were a lot of unwelcoming attitudes which made for an unhealthy work environment. I would never recommend working here."
bad,"-bad management"
bad,"Bed, Bath, and Beyond is a work area where they don't care for their workers. The work environment is unfair and stressful. Big company like this one will not care for any of your needs."
bad,"Great job to work for."
bad,"First off your supposed to get at least a 15-minute break if you work five hours. yeah I never got that. Second, the management is horrible, if you don't understand something you will be screamed at by management, The vending machines are constantly broken and management won't fix them so you can't even buy food or drinks and instead have to either bring your lunch or go out and buy lunch. and occasionally if you get a rude customer who starts to belittle you for something you can't control? the management wont even try to back you up."
bad,"I worked for this company 5 years started out making 9.25$ to 13.99$ n a 5 year period. They wont you to do multiply jobs while mantain a percentage of 100% 80-90 is not good enough for them. You get two 15 paid breaks and 30 min unpaid break. You might as well sit somewhere because they will come get you if your just 1 min late. If you are on a Fort Lift beware do not touch a pallet not even tap it or you will go for a Drug Test then off equiment for a week. There is NO AC it gets super hot. There is snakes/rodents/ and wild cats in the building from doors being kept open. I was there 5 years we have had 3 fire drills since i was there all just a test. The reason of hireing is not because they are GROWING its because people are QUITTING left and right or FIRING people left and right they are understaff due to poor management and poor lack of respect to there employees.  This warehouse has gone down hill fast.  This is NOT a place to work for they have managers on Drug Court they have Managers that are sleeping with employees and they have favoritism. This place also pays for ""Bug Dogs"" every month. They have two dogs come in and smell for bed bugs due to ugg Comforters contaning Bed Bugs.  They have maybe 60 Order Pickers only half work right.  Lack of Scanners. All equiment is dogged out.  If you work here have something else lined up.  You will need it."
bad,"Very poor management team, and scheduling manager does not know how to make a schedule, mangers are very rude and condescending. Would never recommend anyone to work there"
bad,Absolutely terrible company to work for! The management is a joke. No one communicates at all and you are expected to do 5 times as much stuff as you possibly can in a day.
bad,"My hate for Bed Bath and Beyond is what made me go back to school to get a real job. Just an overall awful place to work, management was horrible, the customer got anything they wanted, but at the employees expense, there were always favorites who were able to get away with everything, everyone i worked with except for a select few was lazy, I just really am happy I got out of there"
bad,It’s a ok job long as u like driving all the way to Lewisville waking up very early u will do great if u like working with angry people in the morning
bad,"The company is stuck in an age that simply doesn't exist anymore.  Management is in constant flux, people constantly changing position.  Being thrown into situations with little to no training."
bad,"I absolutely hated this job.  The management was horrible.  They took the job way too seriously and treated me like I would work there for the rest of my life.  I worked there my Junior and Senior year of high school.  I said I would work when I came home from college on breaks, but after some time away I decided I was never coming back.  You’re on your feet for hours.  You’re expected to get on 10 foot ladders and stock heavy items by yourself and be on your feet constantly for 8 hours straight.  They would not even let me leave the floor to get water unless I was on my ONE lunch break.  You’re expected to be in the back and stock, but also be on the floor helping customers, but also ready to jump to the front to get on a register ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  If you can’t do all 3 simultaneously, they are mad at you.  I remember on my birthday when I turned 17, not one person wished me happy birthday.  They just laughed at me and said “good we don’t have to give you a break anymore.”  I did everything that was asked of me and more, yet they were never satisfied.  They expected me to work until 10-11pm at night when I had to be up at 5 am for school the next morning.  Completely inflexible, and a horrible work environment.  Never going back."
bad,"You can get easily fired. You can go away from the script. have people watching you at all times, very helpful though if you need it. No benefits, long shift"
bad,Very bad company to work for . This company never empowered me and they were terrible with their employees I have no good memories of this company very bad company to work for
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond does not care about their employees. If you came to the store looking for any more than 24 hours a week (If that), turn your attentions somewhere else. They REFUSE to allow you to average more than 24 hours a week, lest they have to offer you their horrible insurance plan. Bed Bath and Beyond is a solid decade behind any other store that I have worked at in terms of customer service, technology, and overall marketing. Be fully prepared to have more than one job to make ends meet."
bad,"When I first started working here, I thought it was okay. I was still in college and this job helped me gain more work experience and knowledge. The management however was very poor."
bad,"Do not work for this place as it does not care for its employees. There are next to no opportunities for raises, promotion, or flexibility in scheduling. If you want a job that cares more for customers than employees...work here."
bad,This isn't the best place to work. They aren't very nice to their staff. They are good with flexible schedules but that's it. They bring in new managers all the time and they can be mean.
bad,There's definitely a lot of unfairness from management to employees. The scheduling is very bad. Managers take advantage of their employees and don't let them grow as far as opportunities for promotion go. It's very clear that employers don't care for their employees.
bad,"Bad benefits "
bad,The managers where all over the place not on the same page  one would say one thing and the other would say something else  pay was not what you would think
bad,I helped set up the store. After set up they decided whether or not to hire on the workers. I was hired on.  Within a few weeks I found out I was pregnant. I told management and they told me they didn’t need me after less then a week of telling them. But yet they where still hiring.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend anyone to work for this company as they only use you and you have no chance to grow because its so cut throat, you ask a manager for help and you get nowhere"
bad,"dislike the fact a manager didn't let me help my co-workers accomplish their task when needed, especially during the holidays. I believe that during the holdiays is when we are suppose to become a team and help one another."
bad,"Fortune 500 and Forbes 2000 Company, with over 1,400 stores across United States, Canada and Mexico. One of the industry’s leading pioneer of wide assortment of domestic and home products."
bad,The company is ok to work for the pay was ok but no room to grow with the company and customer can treat you horrible  and the managers don’t do anything about it
bad,"Company is very cutthroat laid off 900 all over the us to cut cost sad"
bad,"okay place, busy during christmas. I liked working the registers verse being on the sales floor. did not like collecting carts i felt the guys should have done that"
bad,"The fact that you have to live in Arkansas is bad enough. I just didn't get along with a lot of the people there. Many were nice, but some were flat out awful."
bad,"stocking shelves or cashiering"
bad,The environment was very slow and there was little direction from management about anything. I felt as if I was not properly trained on the product we sold and how to sell it.
bad,Worst place to work. Low pay. Low work life balance. Don't trust corporate staff members. Everyone is just doing the smoke and mirrors dance and waiting on there turn to get fired - everyone gets fired eventually - everyone
bad,I learned a lot about leadership here. It bettered my communication skills. I also improved on my  multitasking skills. I worked real independently and organized.
bad,"Dont bother they are just as nad as  Christmas  tree shop. They treat you like dirt even though you have a masters. The rehinal for the boston are should noy be  inher job"
bad,This company is no good and they don't treat their employees fairly and they want people to work like robots. They don't care about anything but making money.
bad,Managers would play favorites and could not set up a decent schedule. Did not care about life outside of work. The managers would close extremely late.
bad,"The job in its self was really boring, not much to do. The best thing was being apart of helping customers find what they were looking for. Not the best job, but if you like the customer service it's a ok job."
bad,"Too much buddy , buddy system going on with employees and managers. Double standards for some employees ."
bad,"Did not like working there, management was not patient with me while I was learning as a new employee. Yelled at me in the store during operating hours."
bad,"i have a scare on my leg because a dresser fell on me and they did NOTHING about it. I now have it on me forever."
bad,"horrible managment and training. got one day of cashier training for 3 hours and was left alone. i was working soft side and within less than a month everyone quit so I was left alone, working an entire half of the store."
bad,I typically was in charge of the gift card and store credit business that the company handles. I learned a great deal and am looking forward to putting that to use in a new job. Management was okay. The work culture was okay. The hardest part of the job was finding work that kept me occupied and busy. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
bad,"No work/life balance-  all about the company, especially for management.  Lack of uniform communication.  High turnover.  Poor compensation.  Long hours."
bad,"poor management stressful , unrealistic sales goals for all asscioates, you have to travel to different locations every year couple times a year for seasonal setups"
bad,"Very clicky employees and managers. No room for advancement, no chance for extra hours, no full-time employees other than management. Pay is horrible for the work you do."
bad,don't care for the job just want find a new place and not a job for me looking for something new and to be happy and this place did not do it for me..
bad,"Management are very rude to those who work hard and they are always threatening to write someone up or fire them.  I think management needs better training on how to work with their employees and not have favorites. They need to offer better pay, better breaks. Management expect us to work like robots and not as people.  You also have those managers that do not work at all and they promote the wrong people to manager position and they do not even know what they are doing."
bad,"The hardest part about working here was dealing with inattentive management. They were hard on me about not catching on when I had little training. Coworkers were great, and business was busy. I enjoyed interacting with customers."
bad,if you have to option to not work at BBB on Breckenridge in Louisville Ky take that option. The only perk is that they pay decent for retail because they are desperate.
bad,They undermine you. You ask for one position and put you where they think is best. They say they want you option but not really. The hours are not full time unless you are really liked. They say they are the best than any other company and lie about others.
bad,"Probably the MOST stressful job I EVER had.You are expected to do 6 things at ONCE including stopping to greet each and every customer that walks in the door, even when you are climbing up an 8 foot ladder."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Unsafe working conditions, the store in the back is absolutely filthy and considering they sell food, they should take care of the rodent situation"
bad,This place did nothing but stress you and have you do more work than what your job title has you doing. They don't take the workers in to consideration. your hard work DOES go unnoticed.
bad,The first day I went in for training I realized why they hired me right away. I did two training shifts in one day and it was like an information overload. They had five people call out/no show so my trainer was very distracted and  sped through everything being taught to me. You are expected to be constantly bugging customers to get sales for the location.
bad,Unless you work in corporate be prepared to not have a home life. You have to make sure that all projects are complete but they don't give the hours to have a team to complete it. So you end up staying well over your hours to get it done. They don't pay overtime to salaried employees
bad,"lack of accuracy, management. during my time with the company there was no consistency in what was explained during training. Management is unprofessional."
bad,no loyalty for the effort i put in here at the job i did like the culture a little but I never had consistent hours so I never truly connected with anyone there. they ended up cutting my hours and trying to change my role which i was not comfortable with
bad,"Management at my location was awful, the workplace culture is very teenage oriented, given no room for mistakes and I left miserable after every shift."
bad,"Depending on who youuu are makes a big difference in the way you are treated. Many of the associates aren't on the same page. Some people take their job more seriously than others. Some of the management aren't very nice. A lot of the associates just work and leave, there is no team effort."
bad,"started out as a replenish worker, then had to do replenish and off load pallets and reload them, then had to do all this and the managers job of locating missing boxes all over the warehouse and never got a raise or promotion, the managers are lazy and backstabbing. the work environment is awful no air condition or heat and nothing but drama, everyone is out to get each other"
bad,"All the stores do not have a stock room, so all the incoming merchandise has to go to the very top of the store racks by dept. "
bad,"Busy work  "
bad,Managers and employees are underhanded. The job is very stressful and you are expected to give 110% while only receiving 10% in return. Everyone is out for themselves and they do not care who they step on to get what they want.
bad,"Pay is low, uppermanagement is not trained well, favoritism exists too often. Not much room for advancement. Very poor lack of commmunication throughout the company. No real incentives to stay."
bad,"I worked for bed bath and beyond for almost two years, the management was all about favoritism and ruthless if they didn't like you."
bad,"Everyone is so fake, they still haven't paid me my final check, they lie about everything,it just sucks to work here. Bed Bath & Beyond is terrible, I spoke to everyone up to the Human Resource guy. He doesn't return calls or anything they just suck. I hate it."
bad,I've been in retail for many years now this was the first job that I've ever had to walk away from for multiple reasons poor management is the biggest they undermine the employees. I was disrespectful by a customer management did nothing and i was asked not to call corporate. The whole year and six months I was employed there were pretty great up until that point. Made great bonds with a few customers that I'll miss dearly
bad,I wasn't part time but i still couldn't get overtime. Meanwhile all the managers would have 55+ hour work weeks. They didnt seem to care about morale either.
bad,"Management is unprofessional, clueless, hardly ever available (unless it's to micro manage you), dishonest (manager tried to rob me of 2 vacation days). They promote the most unfitting employees. Training will seem fun but don't get used to it cuz you're on your own after that. Their ""pilots"" are a waste of time because they always end up abandoned by the company director and all management involved. There's no communication or proper direction with this company. HR is also awful, unresponsive and won't answer ANY inquiries until they feel like it. They're always hiring for a reason! No one wants to stay here."
bad,"Management is awful, lacks communication . Rude managers and supervisors, also  company treat employee's like children. Company benefits are expensive and not good. Pay stinks, raises are in cents. A lot of favoritism. No advancement in company, also very stressful environment. Do not work or even app!y to this bad company."
bad,Poor management treat emp!oyees like children. Rude and anti social managers and supervisors. Lack of communication between management. Awful pay and too many ridiculous rules. No advancement . and a lot of favoritism
bad,If you are looking to make money to pay off some bills BBB is the place for you to work. The people are not friendly there and management stay on your back.
bad,The absolute worst job that I have ever held. Extremely low pay and all sorts of corporate nonsense. Management is completely out of touch with the role of the sales associates.
bad,Unproductive and stressful work place managers lie on associates and no one asks question. They have fired people with no warning due to lies of the management staff
bad,They don't care about their employees whatsoever. They go through the training course too quickly and look down on you for not learning as fast as others. In general all the upper management has a stuck up attitude.
bad,great people bad company. no room for growth. thirty cent raise. new associates usually come in to company making more than veteran and doesn't seem to bother store manager
bad,I've been with this company for almost 11 years making less than 11.00 an hour. People just starting a job there are getting paid more than me. The management thinks that they don't have to do anything and sit in the offices allllllday. And there raise consist of .10 raises. Coming from someone that has been there the longest and know how to do everything in the store. I would never recommend this place to work for..this place should not still be running
bad,They don't care about there staff nor do they treat them well. I did not look forward to going to work. Worked long hours with little to no break. they need to give more to there employees
bad,If you're looking for part time work at night not a career good move pay is terrible and the managers seen to not know how to manage I was almost goaded by a manager into fighting. The worst job I ever had hands down wouldn't recommend it at all
bad,"Long days, good people to work with. The management will never tell you that you are doing a good job. Key holders nasty to Department Managers and Supervisors. You will never get a training program you learn on your own. They give you endless tasks that can never be finished . Advancement in this company very hard to come by."
bad,Management is horrible. They do not care for workers. Managers sleep with their employees. It was all about favortism. They way they run the place is horrible
bad,Worst job ive ever gotten managers never listened or seemed to care. The hours were never consistent and always horrible and unpredictable. My coworkers were crazy and never supportive as a matter of face one of them punched me in my face. This place is pure evil
bad,"If there was an option to give less than one star.... i would. Its horrible working for this company if your thinking about working here, please don't do it to yourself."
bad,"worst management, job security, and culture. Employees are not happy.  Management won't let employees make decisions and employees lack a voice.  Employees who work there for say, 13 years, will not get promoted."
bad,"This company is extremely cheap!  They do not give raises and they are much lower than nearby companies in the same market.  They didn't want to pay out bonuses they promised to employees for Christmas until February and they fired most employees before then to keep from paying them."
bad,The managers as well as other employees were completely rude. Minors were bullied by higher ups due to needing flexible scheduling for school and had hours cut if they needed one day off.
bad,"Never work for bed bath and beyond. Their branch off companies are horrible too. Their management is unprofessional and works highly in favoritism, not worth it, doesn't respect employees. Manager is a bully."
bad,"I loved my time with the company, but it did have quite a few glaring issues."
bad,Unfair work environment. Protect Management if they have tenure more than 20 years. Upper HR management in corporate is useless. Inconsistent with work rules.
bad,This place had very horrible management. I had a lot of problems here and my pay check was even lost at one point. I will not be going back to this place ever.
bad,"I will be ready to go back to work there if I didn't live so far. I would recommend anyone who is in need of a job go there.Great insurance benefits.Great pay if you like to get paid every two weeks, but when you get your check it is well worth it."
bad,"Like most retail companies, job security is not guaranteed. For a short term position and having little expectations then I would recommend this company"
bad,"Management is unprofessional  bad treatment to employees. Benefits are lousy, and  underpaid.  No respect towards  others. Needs improvement in many areas."
bad,"It is understandable that a business has to make profits and maintain it's presence on the market. However, Bed Bath and Beyond simply does just that. The flaw is that the company and it's personnel do not care about you in any circumstance. Awful managers, emotionless co-workers, terrible scheduling, absurd work ethic and picky tasks makes this job a nightmare. Endless negativity and no gratitude makes this company just another McDonalds. You will not be thanked for no matter how hard you work and it will start to deplete a hard working mentality as well as making you conform to a negative environment. Managers will scorn you if you make a mistake and are ready to communicate you weaknesses rather than your strengths. The people who are happy at my location are only happy because they know they won't have this job for their life. This company can care less about the people, and its a shame because they are doing the heavy lifting, with the benefit of strain and sorrow. I would advise all not to work here."
bad,"I worked there too long before i realized my work ethic was not going to get me promoted. Favortism was the worst when i worked there! The pay wasnt that good for the unprofessional antics i dealt with. No time an a 1/2 on holidays. Customers are allowed to disrespect you, and if you so much as raise your voice too loud defending yourself you just may be fired. They take that ""customer is always right"" stuff wayyyy too far! Save yourself the headache and work anywhere else! I wish i was warned before hand."
bad,"I honestly didn't enjoy working here so much, boss's were kinda jerks an the job just didn't fit me. Pay was ok but was time to find something else."
bad,"not a good place to work terrible customers and bad location, pay was terrible in ration to responsibility. the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who wont let you help them"
bad,It is a terrible place to work. This company is by far the most un organized company I have ever worked for. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are desperate.
bad,Hostile work environment. Managers endorse public humiliation and provide unrealistic work expectations. High salary is provided to attract applicants. Above average turnover rate.
bad,Job is not a career job and managers don't treat employees right. If you want a temp job this is the place. No room for advancement
bad,"Overall company has no morals.  Management plays favoritism.  They don't care about their employees.  If you live in the area, and need a call center job, go to AAA.  Human resource far exceed at AAA and they carez"
bad,This was a transition job for me. I didn't like working with managers that thought all minorities that came in were stealing from our location. I would never work for this company again.
bad,Bed Bath and Beyond is all about sucking up. If you stand up for whats right and don't kiss your boss's butt you will be stuck in a lower position forever. They also have a dramatic pay scale and under pay yet over pay depending on favoritism.
bad,"This job was a dead end, there is no room for advancements. At the time i worked for this company. They care more about themselves and less about their employees."
bad,I would never go back and work for the company. They try to make you stay later than what you are scheduled..... Management tries to write you up if you don't stay.... They will schedule you until nine and try to make you stay until one in the morning
bad,"Managers sometimes are lost. Poor desitions making . Poor work ethics. Company benefits are awful. I have worked with this company for 5 years and still not passing 10 dollars an hour. Human resources treat badly . They fire for anything. Even When you have a legitimate reason . Even if you call out and give reason and even bring them a note. they pay raise is awful to 18 to 25 cents a year. "
bad,"Terrible management,no communication with employees at all,most rude to me when i came in as a customer. Pay is terrible the job is worth more than  what thet say its worth and for a full time position only got 35 hrs wasnt impressed. Store manager didnt think freight was important so they got rid of the night crew and put all of it on certain staff. The store manager was also very very rude never said hello if some employees said hi first and completely ignored others, they only really talked to the women never the men. I would never recommend this job to anyone i would never have my kids work at this unproffessional  retail store! This is my opinion from time worked here."
bad,"coming from a former employee of the month, this company is the worst culture i have been a part of. i've never been in a place with so much disrespect, dishonesty, and manipulation.the year and a half i worked there this company was sued 4 times in class action suits for treatment of their employees. DONT NOT APPLY HERE! unless you want a miserable life.....with miserable pay."
bad,bubble place very frriend people. Help the customer locate and thing make sure they found everything they need. Check them out and tell they to come again
bad,"no hours, bad mangers, not enough staff, terrible training. this is not a good place to work even if hey star you with great pay you wont get any hours."
bad,ive worked there for about 2 years and it was the worse place to work.. they make you work like a slave and pay very poorly. they dont care if you have a family life or not.. if one calls out you are told to do there work and get upset if you do not finish on time. A lot of the customers were very rude and talk down to you as if you was stupid or something.. i would never go back there not even to shop.. i wish i could say something nice but i cant because even the co workers were lazy and did very little work while others work very hard.  my advice... DO NOT APPLY OR SHOP THERE.
bad,coworkers suck everything is drama and everyone is always in ur business. Better to stay clear from them and just do ur job and be done with it . Management is good just be careful.
bad,"Run, not even worth your time. Management is terrible. Communication is terrible and its a new manager each month. Novi is the worst. John as the store leader is a joke. "
bad,"The management was awful. I would request them NOT to schedule me on certain days and they would anyways. The flexibility is not there. I was constantly hounded by the manager to sell the ""item of the month"" and if I didn't I would get yelled at. You get one 30 minute break even though you're on your feet all day long, stocking things high on the shelves, etc. The employee discount you get is only 20%, and the customers get that anyways with the coupons! You also have to call the manager all the time when you ring something up for a customer, like a coupon for an certain item, and it needs the managers approval and so you keep the customer waiting until the manager can get up front. The computer systems are so old and have not been updated either.  Not a good experience, I quit after 4 months."
bad,I ignored the bad reviews and took the job and quit in 2 months. RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNN ! Unless you're like me and have to see it for yourself......... Thank Me later :)
bad,"Hectic Days and nights. If your active and work abnormal hours, you will learn a lot of retail positions. Management is a joke like every other retail job. Most of my coworkers were memorable if they weren't stabbing you in the back, again retail environment. Hardest part of the job was dealing with stupidest people on the planet. Most enjoyable was when it was time to clock out."
bad,Attending to customers to resolve any issue they may be experiencing placing their orders. Help customers navigate through the checkout process. My co-workers are great. We help each other when needed.
bad,I assist customers daily with any issues they may be experiencing while placing their orders online. At times we get very busy which is an indication we need more help. I enjoy being around my co-workers because we all get along with one another well.
bad,It was a very upsetting work place. i didn't feel comfortable working with customers throwing coupons at you and no did anything to help you. I would return things that were disgusting and when i would get a manager they would approve the things to be returned after i would tell them i wouldn't be able to return it
bad,"Expect to work Looooooooong hour for little compensation.  Expect a very demanding selling culture.  They openly admit that they are not known for having low prices."
bad,It's a boring day at work waiting for customers to be rung out. The store where I work is slow and some of the Leads have there own rules and expect you to follow them!!!!
bad,"The Management is ignorant, hostile, unethical, discriminative, berating, rude, unprofessional, to the point they need a business coach to come in because of the COO personality. Very Toxic place to work."
bad,"Very stressful work place, with no quality of life. Company has many issues as far of High End Management retaliation against associates and subordinates. Many internal issues covered and hidden by Company. Worst place I ever worked. Very high Turnover in all Locations."
bad,"Worked for over a year and half at Bed Bath and Beyond as a receiver. Started off with a 12$/hr salary which was fine, but after most employees in the receiving area quit, I was left alone to manage shipments. They refused to give me a raise and I stayed at 12$/hr for the entire year and half until finally I quit."
bad,poor just poor low pay management is just rude people that work there for years still don't know where stuff world go in the store
bad,"Outdated cash register system, dirty front end, manager orders you to do things yet stands around chatting for an hour doing nothing, definitely could use an overhaul with a lot of things."
bad,all you do all day is climb 15ft or more up i  on a ladder but this job pay is horrible and they dont care about their employees at all and they are unprofesional.
bad,don't work here unless you want to waste your time and have a lot of nothing to do all day plus you will get part time unless your a manager and there are a lot of rules
bad,Most enjoyable part of this job was the customers & the relationships built from working the same position for almost 5 years.
bad,"Great place to work at if you were grandfathered in before new higher ends. If you were new, good luck work was not fun. Rude customers and co-workers"
bad,"Working day to day was terrible. I was lucky to be scheduled 16 hours a week. No one can live on that little income and with  certain managers, they allowed their friends that were employed to do my job such as counting registers and depositing funds at the end of the day. It was getting ridiculous. They cut hours on PT employees and hire a new person the next day,"
bad,"•"
bad,A day at Bed Bath & Beyond is always exciting. You never know what to expect and that's what keeps it interesting. I enjoy working with my co-workers and have learned to micro manage my tasks at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the public get what they need and not letting them leave empty handed.
bad,"you go up and down the ladders with heavy products with little or no help to place on the the top shelves. you are expected to get this done by a certain time, while helping customers (which I understand, would be nice to have help with going up and down a ladder with heavy products!). While I worked in the Columbus Ohio store, I learned that the management store liked to just sit and give out orders and not actually help their crew. The hardest part was to actually get help when it was needed. The customers I would have to say was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA This was the worst place to work and I will never return.
bad,"Although the business practices and expectations of BBB do not coincide with mine, the customer service training in this job are outstanding! Any associate there receives optimal customer service training with this company. Great start to a career!"
bad,"once i clocked in then i go out on the floor to see what they wanted me to do,either im on the floor or on the resigter.. the hardest part was climbing up the ladder knowing im afraid of hights,,or was afraid... the enjoyment part was to be working around people.."
bad,"Bed Bath & beyond is a learning place. You always meet new people and new merchandise,"
bad,"Very much Part-Time/Minimum Wage "
bad,The Bed Bath & Beyond store that i work for hopefully is not like all the rest in the Company. I was told that if you can't say anything nice about some thing don't say anything at all.
bad,"The Management at this company care more about their profits than they do their employees or even customers. This store is more like a high school setting than anything else I have seen. People who work hard don't get the hours, yet the people who stand around chatting with managers instead of working do get the hours. I admit they have great prices and fantastic items, just wish their staff were as amazing."
bad,"customers are rude and so i management, pay is alright but you get no hours!!"
bad,the company pays minnimum wage and wants much more work. there management sucks
bad,"This company is so management heavy that sometimes it felt like you were running in circles to get things done. The store was always lightly staffed, so not able to provide good customer service most of the time. The company in a round about way pretty much prefers you have no life outside of Bed Bath and Beyond. Working for them is kinda like working for a slave driver."
bad,"Horrible place to work at, you get abuse from customers as well as from the managers...AWFUL"
bad,They don't take care of their employees. No room for advancement. Little to no raises. Management stole and didn't get fired. It's ridiculous. The only thing that makes it worth while is that you have a job and the staff is fun (most of the staff) Some management likes to talk down to you though.
bad,i would only have one day on the schedule out of every other week. The manager was very rude . i didn't enjoy my time here
bad,Management was awful. Work days were to long and stressful.
bad,I felt unfairly treated. The hours were depending. People had been fired for very unreasonable circumstances. Pay was the only ok thing but the raises were bad.
bad,"Very possibly the WORST experience I ever had working with ANY company! Terrible management, low pay and very unsafe working conditions. Worthy of Osha's affections for sure!"
bad,"This company is very unprofessional. The trainers barely know anything themselves. There’s a lot of favoritism going on there. The people who are in charge are a joke! When you need assistance on a call they will stare at you and not help you. The whole training team sucks . I left after training.  They really don’t value their workers and the environment is GHETTO, not structured at all. Look else where!"
bad,terrible place to work for an associate you're not judged off your hard work your treated as a number. Everyone gets the same raises no matter how hard you work. the raises are horrible anywhere between .10 cent to a quarter a year!!!!! you're asked to do management duties with no compensation. they don't hire from within as often as they should they would rather bring in outsiders.they only like to hire students who wont stay so they can pay them low wages. unlike other retailers there are know Christmas parties no appreciation for hard work. terrible at teaching new associates the business. no bonuses EVER!!! the turnover for employees is incredible no one stays because of low wages. almost every associate has to have a second job. the open door policy is terrible. management never has your back. I've worked in retail for over 20 years and bed bath and beyond is by far the WORST!!! I worked there for 6 years and NEVER saw an associate get promoted to a senior manager. upper management NEVER teaches you why things are done they just gives you orders.. TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK..  BTW promoting minorities from within is nonexistent.
bad,"The compensation is good but the benefits and time off are not great. Their corporate environment seems messy, there is a major lack of communication about big changes within the company and employees lack an overall sense of direction for the company. Talent and leadership development needs major work. Every individual managing a team or person is working hard to make a name for his or herself and contributes to an overall feeling of ""every man for himself."""
bad,"This was a horrible place to work, Management talk down to associates and in front of customers, spoke to associates about in appropriate things at registers and in front of customers. Management also rude to customers a lot of customer complaints this nature as well, management  rolled their eyes to customers and associates. Spoke over radio about associates and their issues so customers could hear. Extremely unprofessional and hostile environment."
bad,"They treat you like babies and only pick and choose who does the good jobs in this place.. Cell phones are not allowed in warehouse even if they in your pocket and not used. You have to walk through a metal detector and have a lot of call outs to where you have to give up an off day to work because of their lazy people. And come in early to even get the day you want . The trainers , mmost.mostthem"
bad,They over work you when there's a position to get to the next level they hire from the outside and then you have to train the new manager to be your boss
bad,They don't train you but a WEEK! Than they expect you to go out and know what to do even though you can't use your notes you took during training. I was at work everyday except being very ill and that was 3 total days and got writeups even with doctor notes. They would be better if training was more thorough and longer than a week's time.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Management was a joke at the LC location, pay was god awful, no benefits except 20% off. Management acted as kids. Awful"
bad,"People get hired all the time and come and go all the time, some quit after what they call training. Training day is spent watching videos for the store then a day on the registers. Expect to learn as you go tho. Survival is for the independent fittest. Management and the company always seemed to be inconsistent. Customer service is supposed to be high on their list, however, I was caught talking with customers in line to check out for too long. Basically expect to say what you have to say, help the customer and be able to move on to the next one. Do not expect to be able to be friendly to the customers. Co workers talk about everyone all the time! Of course managers have their favorites. Very few managers are willing to help you out with questions while others help but have the expected attitude. Corporate management is non existent!! Don't expect store support problems to come from corporate."
bad,"I worked here so that hopefully you won't make the same mistake of doing so as well, hours were being cut drastically at my store. Had two to three shifts per week and they were under 5 hours each at best, very poor quality paychecks from there. Management is rude and aren't there to see you as a person, but rather than someone to use until you're dry."
bad,"I don't like working there. The store manager made a comment about my health telling me that I need to get it ""in check"" when I cannot control it. the customers that come in are rude most of the time."
bad,"The managers act friendly to you in private, and they tell you that ANYTIME you need help or are unsure of something that you should ask. Ok. I did just that, and what did the store manager himself do? Get huffy and mad with me. I also had a rude coworker that would assign me tasks and only explain how to do it once, rushing. This guy would assign me all his work and go on break whenever he wanted, leaving me helpless. Also, they clearly show favoritism and seniority, when they say not one job or employee is important than the other.  Working here made me spiral into depression."
bad,"Constantly scheduled days I asked off, never approved time off when it was requested 3 weeks in advance, no known manager, no communication between employees, extremely understaffed and constantly dealing with drama &people talking about each other within the company. The customers as well as the staff were very rude. Staff was extremely rude to customers. "
bad,"The worst job I have ever had... my manager was so unprofessional and rude. Co-workers do not"
bad,This is the worst company to work for. The only way to get ahead is to work for low wages or sleep with the managers. The most unprofessional people i've ever worked with.
bad,Good for a starter job beyond a year leave use them to get life in order for a better life somewhere nicer isn't worth the headache unless your a manager then it's a 4 year deal same situation
bad,"You are not guaranteed to work more than 10 hrs per week, but the manager wants you to be available anytime. "
bad,This is a company that you can never ever do enough in a day to meet their standards. Expectations for too high for everyone. But if you were favored by the management those expectations were Less. I literally felt like I got run out of that company by the manager. I offered a compliment to an employee was called into the office to explain why. I loved the companies ideals. But none of that was lived up to. A very stressful place to work.
bad,"i would not recommend working here to ANYONE. The management doesn't care about the employees, you are underpaid, over-worked, and hounded by management about production percentage, even when above 90%."
bad,Most of the management are very difficult to please and blame those under them for anything that goes wrong. Those who were on the same level as you tend to be the best ones to work with.
bad,If you're hired for part-time (which you most likely would) you will stay there. I consistently asked my management for more hours only to be rejected for 8 months. And a $0 raise after my promotion on top of it.
bad,"I hated working here. Rude customers, rude coworkers, terrible hours, understaffed, boring, mangers smoked cigarettes and smelled, coworkers were negative people"
bad,Re Management: Bed Bath & Beyond is a perfect example of the Peter Principle.  Management had favorites and the others were spoken to rudely.  Employee was never right; no opportunity given to explain alleged infraction.  Management never ever backed up employee re customers.  Loosey-goosey rules.  One manager would say one thing and another manager would say another.  Lazy employees rewarded.  Ridiculously low pay.
bad,"The management was all new managers. Relocated for a brand new store. No one knew what was going on. I only liked 1 of the 4 managers. I was paid $1 less an hour than everyone else and they claimed they'd pay me that extra but never did. No one was organized, they'd just tell you to do something without showing you anything. Especially floor plans. It was ""Here, set these shelves and products up"" and then they'd go behind you and redo it. This was a brand new store and I was excited to see it put together. Favorites were played hard in this store. Everyone knew who the managers pets were and they were all given the good hours and the good schedules. I left for something more full time since they wanted to give me less than 20 hours for 2 weeks total."
bad,Terrible hours but great people fun place work but low pay  and no advancement very little training loved the discount on clearance items for the house.
bad,"Absolutely no advancements, managers are lazy and liars. they work you hard and you stand all day long. Overall I would not recommend this job to anyone I care about. they treat all their employees like thieves."
bad,Company eliminated my position. 8 supervisors were let go in 1 day.  In my store.  800 people across the US. I worked very hard for this company and provided excellent customer service.
bad,"No comment. Did not like it. Very unprofessional experience. Very messy co workers and management. Nothing is ever confidential, even with management."
bad,"Pay is decent, but you will earn it. You will carry cookware and other heavy objects up and down ladders each day. There is little help, you will do most of the work. The task saturation is more than the given hours to get the job done. As we have seen this week, when you have been around a while and make a little more, they will get rid of you.  Good luck if you come this way."
bad,"No room for growth, management and employees had all benign current positions for years. Didn't supply enough hours at times, scheduling was all over the place, and never was off at exact times scheduled."
bad,"The Utah Call Center will not last, they treat their employees horrible compared to customers. And do not work with employees who have medical related issues or appointments. Fast turn over constantly hiring."
bad,Been working at Bed Bath and Beyond for three years. No room for advancement and management slacks.Turnover rate is very high due to the unprofessionalism in the building. If it wasn't for the dead end encountered maybe the job would be worth it.
bad,"Really bad management"
bad,"If you are an associate it would be an ok place to work, as a manager it was awful. Scheduled 55+ hours per week with the unspoken expectation that you work even more. No work/life balance. Very negative upper management, they preach PI (process improvement) & only touch things once but you are CONSTANTLY re-doing everything again & again! Return policy leaves you open to scam artists & it's very frustrating to be openly ripped off & not be able to do anything about it because stores are terrified of a negative customer service review. Constant visits by district/regional/corporate mgmt. have the entire store stressed out. The one good thing is that you get trained on all the cool items that they sell so that you can pass the information on to the customers."
bad,Advancement or pay increases are slim to none. It takes awhile to move up. You can learn a lot about product and styles. also you can increase you resume with the different areas and working situations you could placed in.
bad,Management is terrible. Won't accommodate second jobs but will only give 6-10 hours a week. I've work there for 5 years and barely make above minimum wage. Management can't agree on anything and are very confusing. Won't listen to any employees on how to better help customers. Say they promote from within but I've seen more people hired outside than promoted from within.
bad,The job is hard and fellow employees like to talk about others while on the job. Some get to stand around and do nothing while others get to bust their humps with no help.
bad,"Product knowledge available "
bad,"Your skills are not valued or recognized at this location of BBB."
bad,No one wants to do their job. Call outs happen every day. Managers are childish and unqualified. Not a good job. the hours given are very few.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. Cut throat dishonest management. Long shifts busting your rear with one break. Trust me, look elsewhere. I won't even shop there now, much less let my dog work there."
bad,This company will have huge potential when removing management.
bad,The only thing I didn't like about this job that management wasn't understanding or cooperative with employees. I loved the people that came through my line because they made my job very easy.
bad,By far the worst job ever. Terrible store manager not caring of employees and there families.
bad,"My experience with this company was a horrible one. They treat employees unfair and treat minorities terrible despite experience, performance and education."
bad,No room for advancement and lack of hours due to favoritism. Low level training that causes staff to be unwilling to help customers. Managment remains in the offices instead of helping staff or customers.
bad,"My managers had me working a six hour shift with no breaks, five days a week, for just above minimum wage. At the time, I was happy to have a job, but I didn't appreciate one of the assistant managers telling me ""I guess we'll leave the register to no one today, then,"" when I had 103 degree fever and would have given them all strep throat if I came in. All in all, it was one of my worst job experiences, and I would never work/shop there again."
bad,Not the best place to work if you want to have a fun and exciting job. Not much training provided and technology/systems are so outdated. Staff isn’t that friendly and they treat you like an outsider when you first start. Wasn’t properly trained which was very confusing at times. Staff discount isn’t much of a benefit either.
bad,"I was literally scared to go to work. My operations manager was so fake and intimidating! Minimum wage and wisely varying hours. One week I worked 16 hours, the next I worked 4. They told us to promote the Beyond+ membership, but no one did. If you did you got to put in a ticket for a hockey game but no bonuses. The employee discount is 20% off one item, you can get a better deal with a coupon! Thankfully, my coworkers were much better than my manager. The store manager was kind enough but didn’t do much. Overall, I do NOT recommend working for Bed Batb and Beyond."
bad,"The worst. Stay where you are, you will regret taking a job here. I have been here a good amount of time and cannot wait to leave.  Totally oblivious management,  unless they do what they do to get people to leave. Which may be the case as so much experience and talent has left. You have people who arrive late, chit-chat and stroll around complaining they have no time to get the work done.  The fix for that is load the work on the other  department members.  Always stress teamwork  but 2 people working and the rest goofing off is not a team.  Really sad what this place has come to.  Again,  stay where you are, it can be worse,  and it is here."
bad,Management is bad! Lazy and they lack communication. You do not get help from upper management. All they do is sit in the office and talk about everyone. We need a stronger management and a better leader.
bad,"Don’t waste your time applying, management, customers & pay is terrible. They over work you, micromanage you,  cut your hours if you don’t want to work on sunday’s. They accuse everyone of stealing."
bad,"the worst employer I have ever worked for! they tell you one thing and do something else and get your hopes up for no reason.  I learned absolutely nothing.  if you came from a higher end employer, this is not the retail store for you"
bad,"Working there was only doable because of the few good coworkers. A few of the managers were ok, but overall management was the worst part of working there. Some of the managers were a bit more laid back and they understood that as a cashier you don't always have time to go to a thousand other things, especially when you're the only one working the register for 5+ hours. Upper management in the store is where it got bad, if you had something urgent come up in the family they were unwilling to try and assist in trying to find someone to cover your shift, and they didnt have much compassion. What they expect from cashiers in terms of closing was awful, especially since most nights they would only have one cashier closing, or have 2 there but one leaves an hour before the store completely closed. Overall, the experience wasn't worth it and neither was the money. Not to mention the fact that you only get a raise by 10 cents after you've worked there for a year. Management definitely picked favorites and it felt a lot like being at school. It was very cliquey and you could always pick out who was going to be favorited as soon as they started the job. If you weren't one of the people that management favored there was virtually no hope of you being anything but a cashier for a long while. There were a lot of very hard working individuals whose hours got cut back and they were sentenced to life at the customer service desk, left to do the dirty work that nobody else in the store wanted to do."
bad,"Tons of forced mandatory overtime very low moral, high turn over rate also low pay some people have work for the company only make 9.50 an hour they give 35 cent raise a year and it's a unprofessional atmosphere."
bad,"I worked here for exactly 3 days and 1 hour worth of work before I quit. They continuously dead named me and used incorrect pronouns. Then when I had a panic attack during a break, instead of being asked if I was okay when I got back, I got lectured about stealing time from the company."
bad,It was horrible for that pay. they gave me such short shifts (4 hrs) and promised that it would go up after back to college event and it didn't still only got 4 or 5 hour shifts and even tho they are understaffed they wouldn't give me longer shifts or take off Sundays for religious reasons. DO NOT WORK HERE!! NOT WORTH IT. I had to work two to three other jobs just to help pay for groceries and bills and rent for my apartment
bad,"The OPS Manager told us during orientation that BB&B employees have no need to form unions, because Human Resources would protect and defend us. In actual experience, Human Resources defended management to the hilt."
bad,I have worked this company several years. The Managers are sub human to the employees. It is the worst place I ever worked at. New employees stay 2 weeks and quit because they treat them so bad. No respect. When they let me go when I went to Human Resources to complain on their attitude. I was let go after false accusations. Business is declining. Always comes back to you.
bad,"The daily work routine is pretty easy. Being a cashier is quite boring but stressful when dealing with difficult customers. During some ""downtime"" hours when it's not too busy up front as a cashier, management is super strict with what cashiers can and cannot do. Cashiers are told to not talk to each other when they are not busy (because there's nothing to do) because they are wasting time and instead should be focused on finding something to do. Collaboration is not encouraged at all. As a sales floor associate, there is only one employee per section of the store and they are each responsible for their whole section. If someone from another section is done with everything they are required to do, they are still not allowed to help one of their other coworkers. Managers think that if two coworkers are together, they must not be doing any work and are just talking. This would make sense if the managers weren't such hypocrites and followed their own rules. I have witnessed many times managers standing in circles or standing around talking for more than 20 minutes at a time. Managers also do not allow chatting between other coworkers, but if you somehow strike up a conversation with a manager, they're more than happy to talk about meaningless stuff for a long time. "
bad,"Not family oriented,  you have to know people to move forward,  they do not see your potential.  You are in a crowded room waiting to clock in. they do not appreciate their employees.  I applied 2 times for  an office position I was interviewed and my 22 yr old daughter who worked in the same building got the job when she applied 1 time. I felt a lot of favoritism there this is one of many reasons I left."
bad,"To be very honest Bed Bath, company wise, is suffering an is very under staffed and since something like this is happening they refuse to hire and put more of the work load on the very few workers that they have and refuse to give more hours or a raise to rest of the staff they have. If I wasn’t a college student and didn’t need a source of income I would do like Martin Payne’s catchphrase and ‘Get To Stepping’."
bad,"The customers half the time are rude and disrespectful, so it's/they're not worth my time. The work environment needs improvement and the pay sucks, lastly our hours were cut ridiculously. Don't waist your time!"
bad,"BBB used to be so relaxed and was my favorite place I had worked. Now, you’re so ridiculously micromanaged, and unless you’re willing to sell your soul, advancement isn’t an option."
bad,Too many company focuses at one time. They say they want you to manage but you're not able to. You are micro managed at every level of the job. I have never worked for a company that treated you like a zero when you're in a management role.
bad,"Male managers and district managers. Very sexist. "
bad,The management structure there is very poor. Very stressful when there were calls in queue. Favoritism can be seen based off of race and sex. Fake people manage this company.
bad,This job was nice because it was part time and gave me more free time to go to college. i could also work either mornings or evenings to fit my schedule. Although management wasnt great and I was often left alone to handle tasks that were meant for two people such as stocking vacuums and heavy objects on ladders.
bad,"Worked there 8 years. Watched the collapse of a company. We went from being associate driven and family oriented. To CUT THROAT! Meetings in Vegas, too the airport hotel. Hiring legitimate, qualified managers in at $50-$60k a year. To hiring any Joe Shmoe at $16 an hour by just changing the title from ""assistant manager"" to ""department manager"". Same responsibility, 1/4 the pay. Training now, is a joke. They cut payroll as much as half in most stores. Meaning, there's never enough employees, and your constantly overwhelmed. And don't even get me started on job security. Last year alone they laid off 880 managers to make room for their new (under paid) department managers. With more cuts to come this year. Just google it. I was a rat, scurrying off a sinking ship. Right behind legitimate district, and regional managers jumping ship. Don't be surprised if their long gone in a few years. And don't take my word for it, just look it up.  EMPLOYEE BEWARE!"
bad,"Due to Amazon and Wayfair companies stealing customers this company time is limited.  "
bad,Terrible Management in the area of collaboration; No defined career path; Terrible workers are rewarded over very productive workers; Management doesn't seem to have a clue and do support their employees in terms of growth
bad,"It may not be all of the Bed bath and beyonds. The location in wilkes barre is awful. The management is terrible, with the exception of 1 manager. A ton of false hope throughout the job, almost no personal life while working there."
bad,"i went for an interview, the directions are all"
bad,To messy to get any work done. No ones on the same page. Bad regional manager. Unsafe work environment. Hostile to new ideas. Lack of training. I believe they will close down soon the way they treat people as numbers.
bad,Very small payroll provided depending on the location.  District level management is very 'bush league' to say the least.  The company does not treat their Management well.  Heavy focus on meeting sales plan however to payroll provided to support sales associates.
bad,"First and Foremost, "
bad,"No teamwork, no unity lack of leadership managing with fear, lack of professionalism, Focusing on negative and lack of recognition. high turnover and micromanage."
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty slow. The retail environment is going downhill. Bed Bath and Beyond is losing customers due to online shopping, so it is hard to get hours and keep them."
bad,Culture and moral not very inspiring. Daily meetings non productive and slowed down any momentum that may have been gained during the work day. No guidance or interaction with management.
bad,Was every unfair didnt let people with new ideas. Bring up .would over work there employees and naver appreciate the hard work. But had great coworks. To be around with
bad,"High standards of customer service with often only one associate scheduled per department. "
bad,"Poor work home life balance.  Currently laying people off, replacing with lowering paying jobs, doubt the company will be around in a year.  Worked there many years, proved myself over and over, increased sales year after year and was never promoted."
bad,By far one of the worst places I have ever had to experience. Massive District staff while the store staff suffers and is told to work 12 hours days to get your job done.
bad,"Managers had created a hurtful environment for most female employees. Environment could have been improved, and was not easy to make friends, or people to talk to."
bad,Lack of professionalism. Not a bad starting point to be In and out But most likely a political company since they do things backwards. I would not count on staying there and moving up.
bad,"Constantly cutting payroll while increasing work load,  50 -60 hour work week minimum.   Not enough appreciation or compensation.  They do not put their people first."
bad,"the cashiers are treated badly"
bad,Management will pick a teenager for a management position over a grown adult with management experience and the employees won't include you in anything if you aren't like they are. It's a very exclusive and biased environment.
bad,You can do a good job but don't expect to be treated fairly.  Private information should only be shared with the correct people.  The management does not comply with requests fairly.  Don't expect this company to give you the required 10 min break while working 5 hours.  Should be regulated/go by state requirements.
bad,"Typical day at work consists of no talking, don't speak, and if you have to go to the bathroom you better be less then 5 minutes.  They time you on everything.  The Manager walks around to make sure you are sitting in your cell.  Its a very boring job!  Prisoners have more rights then you working here.  If you have an issue with the management team, you can't get help from anyone.  HR is a waste they protect the company and not the employee."
bad,"This store is bad the customers are very very very rude, the store management don't do nothing and employees don't even care bout the job.Typical dat at work is hearing the customer complain about how the store move everything around the store and they had no help on the floor to find what they are looking for, I learn that trying to helping everyone find everything they need is a plus, MANAGEMENT is VERY RUDE they talk down to the employees they write up the employees for every little thing that they do, they don't do nothing but stand around talking about co-workers the environment is very CHILDISH they will let you go if you late to many times, to many call outs, just little petty things. My co-workers are fun we look out for each other n help each other when MANAGEMENT and MANAGERS is not doing their jobs. Hardest part is standing all day at the register, most enjoyable is you meet some very nice people that will make you laugh."
bad,"I worked there for 10 years as a manager.  The only positive is the benefits.  There are too many negatives:  Worst work-life balance in retail, poor raises for hourly's - 25 cents max a year, rarely a positive comment from the regional managers down to a regular manager, hard to get promoted if an hourly since there are few full-time slots.  And if you're a manager, there isn't enough salary to get the tasks completed and you're expected to pick up the slack for the lack of salary or........stay there forever to finish it.  Without a , ""Thanks for the effort,"" comment."
bad,"Once the facility was fully operational and outbound sale began it was very busy and very hard work.  I would pick customer orders and prepare them for shipping.  "
bad,"the co workers were fun to work with and easy to get along with, the store manager lacked leadership skills to successfully run a multi million dollar store"
bad,"its a good work place with supportive management. everyone has a good auttiude. we hit are number most days. everyone follows the rules so it makes are work day even easier, better & faster. Ive learned three different jobs. thanks to line leader. the hard part about it is we just don't stop until are work is done. we also have a good time at work that we all now we have each others back about everything we do because safety is always first."
bad,"My experience on the sales floor, assisting customers. locate and explain products and other add-ons which they might find interesting.  Many customers are looking for bridal and college products.  Also responsible for register (sales and returns) and stocking shelves and making sure the store is clean and safe."
bad,Not a good fit unless you are not interested in work life balance
bad,"Training was not consistant with in the management program,always short staffed.spent 50 % of your time spent at the registar.The floor suffered from little or no floor coverage on person on each side of the store.this was not good customer service.We would have people on the floor doing varies task but not helping customers any un finshed task was passed back to the manager on duty and had to be completed before they could leave,this be came a routine that was rarely spoken about but was know by all levels of management."
bad,"Both managers are very flirtatious and choose favorites. Not a great place to work. Love the products of the store, though!"
bad,Very few of the mangers are welling to help ( 3 maybe 4 mangers are awesome at their jobs) . It's all about who you know to get ahead and if one Manger hates you they all do. This company is very disorganized. Word of advice keep record of every conversation you have with managers and HR they will switch up  on employees there on you real quick
bad,"Training moves back and forth between information quickly making it impossible to grasp it all or pick up where you left off. Several programs to learn some seem like they should have died off with the dinosaurs. Once on the floor there is no one available to assist you so you have to hope you make the right decision. If you make a wrong decision  you are at fault and must call the customer back. The open door policy is just something they have to say do not waste your time going to HR for any issues you may have specially if it has something to do with management "
bad,"This isn't a bad place to work if you are young and without family.  They spring mandatory overtime on you literally the same day.  As a single parent,  that's absolutely difficult,  if not impossible,  to accommodate and it feels like management has no respect for your personal life."
bad,"This company doesn't follow ethics well. Very unprofessional and dishonest. They stab you in back. Half the HR and management team don't hold the skills, knowledge, quality, qualifications, are education to be in their roles. And they over look hard working employees's that deserve more. "
bad,"Low pay, least benefits job. If you are thinking as a Part-Time job while in college then it is for you, but do not expect as a good full time career!"
bad,"It is a tough job because regardless of retail experience, you are hired in at the bottom rung of the ladder and expected to clean public bathrooms at the close of every night shift. You are spoken to in a disrespectful manner by the store manager. Some customers are extremely demanding with regard to returns and discounts. Respect does not pervade the atmosphere."
bad,"Management is great , co-workers/staff are amazing specually if you work with the morning crew! Great staff people are friendly and nice. Hours are terrible, will get scheduled 3 hours a week with the management knowing that i travel out of town to and from work. Also had an associate working here was an amazing person but got a second job because they promised hours they couldnt commit to giving said person. Moment they found out she/he is working another job his/her hours got lessen more and more each coming week. Individual ended up leaving. Loosing alot of good workers because of hours"
bad,"Since the upper management are very unprofessional, unpleasant, they will not recognize your talent and it’s a dead stop to your career growth unless you become yes man to them. Company constantly loosing sales due to unqualified people were hired by senior management and were placed in store of their choice as store manager or Ops manager. Working environment is very uncomfortable since there is no standard to identify talents and hiring process is based on favors. Strongly not recommend to work this company or its affiliates."
bad,"Lets start with the positive, the upside of this call center is that you  only take inbound calls. No pressure to sale or do collections. Most of the customers call in wanting assistance and help purchasing for registry customers, to report a lost or damaged item or to get a coupon applied to their purchase. The actual job can be fun really, problem solving is like a puzzle to me so I found this aspect challenging and enjoyable.  "
bad,"No work life balance, poor salary, lack of job growth and security. All management (including district) has either been laid off, taken a pay cut, demotion or made hourly."
bad,Manager had favorites  and was grumpy a lot of times. Denied my new availability that was due to my school schedule. Only asked for one day off out of the week due to school obligations and they refused to give it to me. Would not recommend.
bad,"Not the best place to work"
bad,"Job work/life balance, healthcare benefits, management, and culture are poor. Everyone is overworked and stressed. The culture is best described as rank and file employees are part of an expendable herd."
bad,"The Store Manager would not allow me the time allotted to do my modules. I worked hard and got all of the hard lines to company standards.  Also, I was a consultant for bridal.  I also took classes to learn about China and became an expert on China selling.  I exceeded the company goals for bridal registries.  I also order products for customers that were not in stock.  I replenished the hard lines every morning shift and every closing shift.  I reset all areas for seasonal merchandise."
bad,Management does not fairly distribute the workload and plays favoritism when assigning tasks within the IT environment. The computing platform management team does not have the appropriate experience to drive the business forward.
bad,It’s a bad place to work . Management is horrible . The pay is horrible & overall the morale of the company is depressing . I do not recommend this warehouse to anyone at all
bad,"For a youngster who doesn't know what they want to do yet in life or looking to just save money temporarily, then this is a great way to start learning how to assist customers."
bad,"Lack of upper management"
bad,"The management is run so sloppily, that if you ever get close you'll want a hazmat suit so it doesn't rub off on you.  Everyone is passing the problems onto someone else instead of just dealing with them. They'll change the schedule three times in a week and never say anything to the employees. The only way to move up, even to just full time, is brown nosing.  And the G.M. is literally willing to cripple his employees, if it means belly scratches from corporate. Long story short, avoid it at all costs!"
bad,If everything ran the way it is setup this would probably be a phenomenal job. It isn't though. Training is shoddy. A lot of the blame game is played. They hold onto under performing employees much longer than normal.
bad,Management is no good you can tell or ask somebody something 1000 times nothing gets done. The show favoritism and some people can do what they want to do. Unprofessional and management does and says things that nobody in management should do. I was fired for a forklift incident. They said if you were involved on a incident you will automatically get terminated. A man had a wreck a day before me I got fired today and he is back on the lift today. Favoritism is shown tooooo much. The job is horrible
bad,"Raises are very poor;no opportunity for growth; store manager shows little to no, respect for the morale of her workers;not a very promising place to work"
bad,Unprofessional environment. Workplace was unfriendly management was unprofessional would mock employees about their disabilities. There was a lot of drama between staff members and interfered with vibe of the service
bad,"fun and diversity, but managers are too busy focusing on personal issues than employees. the management needs to do better at paying the employees better especially benefits if your going to toy AROUND with hours and cut pay smh."
bad,Horrible company to work for. The advancement is awful and the raises they gave us were not what we deserved with everything that we did for the store. I learned a lot working there bUT would never go back. Only think good was the other employees.
bad,"this job was not my most enjoyable job, there was very little enteraction with customers. a typical day would just be stocking merchandise and making sure the store was in order for the next shift"
bad,"No matter how hard you work, or how much you achieve, you will never get ahead in this company. Unless you know someone, there is no room for advancement, or even a raise in wage. After two years I was refused both request is made for full-time and or a small raise. This company expects the most out of you for as little as possible, and I would never recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"The E-Comm warehouse in Georgia is a poorly run organization, with lack of planning, communication and strategy.  The senior management does not request any input from the lower level managers on how to fix the issues within the warehouse.  Every day all the lower managers spend their time just fighting fires with no time to put towards diagnosing the real problems of the warehouse."
bad,"The employee retention rate of store 772 has dropped considerably within the last two years at which time there was a management change occurred. "
bad,New company and very unorganized. Work is not hard . The HR department does not care about its employees
bad,dealing with immature management
bad,If you work hard and they dont like you as a person. You can not move up to a better position if you do not kiss butt or dating someone there. It's really sad. I am looking for a better opportunity.  No one is working on the 2rd shift so you will have to pick and pack at the end of the day. Then they want people do other people work while there on lunch. Plus no bus transportation go's to the company building. So you have to get a uber if you don't drive.
bad,"Management was very ify,  culture wasn't good, high turnover and used retail thought processes in the wrong environment. Defended antiquated thought processes, held on to platforms that don't/didn't work. To many steps to create the right culture for a productivity based DC. Policies, what policies???????"
bad,"This company is Constantly hiring, people don’t last long. Managers are after your every step. Favoritisms to the senior crew. No overtime."
bad,Not what i expected in a warehouse expected better and I felt safety there was not good . I can see why theres a high turn over rate . just was not the job for me.
bad,this place is just very bad managers suck talk down to you and its just very very bad I wouldnt recommend anyone to ever work here hours are bad so dont work here
bad,"They say your job is to be the expert in heartfelt life experiences. However, your given zero minutes a day to check up on issues that require follow up, they have archaic systems, and they care more about their rules, metrics, adherence and regulations than they do about their employees. "
bad,"I've Never In Life, Worked For A Company That Didn't Want To Pay You. They Used And Abused Us. So Many Quit Because Of Pay Issues And A New System They Kept Blaming It On. Very Unprofessional.  All They Care About Is The Remodel, Definetly Not Their Employees.  The Managers Smoke All Night Long. How Unprofessional And Disgusting.  I Suggest U Think Twice About Working For Them. Cary Nc Location."
bad,"Typical day at bed bath and beyond included customer service, replenishment and merchandising. The workplace culture is a fast paced and energetic one before the store opens and slows down as customers enter building shifting from a task oriented place to a more customer oriented place."
bad,"Open space: 150 people in one room with stinky carpet. Meetings 3 times per day no time to work. Restrooms always full of people, Terrible food for sale in buffet,"
bad,"When you look at the quotes at the door or on company website, simply think THE OPPOSITE."
bad,Bed Bath Beyond could be a better company to work for but some of the employees included in DMM'S and GMM's make them feel uncomfortable.  Poor Communication and poor compensation. There is room to better opportunity but you have VP's that will have you stuck in a department because they don't want to see you grow in the company.  VP's  will not compensate you for more work being giving to you.. The worst place to work at.
bad,The requirements to keep your position have exceeded reality. This is not a call center where you can feel good about your work performance. Daily monitoring and status shared with entire team. CSR's are the absolute lowest on the ladder. Opinions and suggestions are better kept to one's self. No one is happy. No one.
bad,"Store managers have a lot of responsibilities. Which is no issue when you are a hard working person....but keep in mind, no matter how much blood, sweat and tears you put into that place..... it will never be good enough. Not sure how their employment practices are even legal, you are not graded on how well you preform.  You are graded upon how well you do your job and how much you make. So the expectation is different for each person that holds the same position. "
bad,"this job became very stressful, hired as cashier, then moved to floor associate. disrespectful managers whom did not not treat employees fairly. Great customer service"
bad,"Management doesn't have realistic expectations of day to day work. Management also chooses favorites and doesn't base any desicions on work performance. The company has changed its structure, not for the better, it is no longer the great place it used to be."
bad,The managers don't coach you after you fail to meet the standards. They are partial to their favorite employees whom they will coach and help promote.  My supervisor would tell co workers things that she shouldn't be telling it was confidential information.
bad,Worked there for several years and witnessed the slow decline of what was once a great culture but now is just sad. Used to have the support of upper management that really cared about quality of life and career advancement.
bad,Lack of communication between managers. Lack of career opportunities. BBB wants to make it a employee centered culture but if they do not make an effort to screen and train employees well.
bad,This is not a good company to work for. There is a constant management turnover and they do not care about their employees.  They hire people and they quit.
bad,"Seems like almost every employee has the title of manager. Every department has three or four department managers. They say they are a promote from within company, but they will bring people in and put them on the fast track, passing up tenured employees,"
bad,"Workload is heavy, company sets unattainable unrealistic goals. call offs are an every day occurance and work load is the responsibility of the managers. District management does NOT stand up for the store-level employees."
bad,There was always something to do. I found a lot of the time my manager didn't do anything but go around the store and socialize while I would bust my butt cleaning the back room and then the next morning if I came into open it was a complete disaster area for me to clean otherwise I got in trouble.
bad,The company has a terrible work/life balance. Management is very unorganized and not involved like they should be. Very high turnover with very low pay for hourly staff.
bad,"When I first got hired on it was fun, and everyone got along.. A new manager came in and was sexist.. "
bad,"A good place for a side job, but you not good for a long stay. They don't give full-time to often and most of the higher ups got hired outside the store. My managers were so horrible that they never even trained me! I learned all I learned by myself!"
bad,"I worked the front desk for two years. This job made me feel like my soul was being sucked out by the relentless abuse from my customers and the extreme stress put on me by the high standards of the company. This was my first real job so I thought these feelings of sadness about my job were normal, but they are not! The problems with the company come from the top. The managers in the store are victims as well. They are under pressure and are forced to take it out on the lower people. I would rather be poor and unemployed than subject myself to more abuse at this company. The things that happened there will be with me forever."
bad,"There were 4 and sometimes 5 managers working at once and they all had different ways that each wanted certain things displayed, so you a single task would have to be completed multiple times a day. the person in charge of shipping and receiving would regularly use racial slurs as well as call other employees by the same names in front of customers. many customer complaints were made and they were never reprimanded."
bad,This company is very stingy with hours. They'll give you and 4 hours and day & 15 hours a week. I feel as though no one can live off of that kind of salary. They start off with $9.50 per hour but whats that if you don't get any hours? Typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond is cool. Just keep things straighten and try to help the guests as much as possible. One thing I've learned that still helps me to this day is finish what you start no matter if you have to stay late. The co-workers are very hard to deal with but i make it happen and still do my job as im supposed to. Most of them were rude but i can deal with that and if i feel like I cant I let someone know what the problem is (manager). Hardest part is dealing with the below basic hours. I enjoyed the place where the business was downtown.
bad,Always making sure the customer was satisfied with there room. 
bad,at bed bath and beyond i worked as a cashier and did customer service. i learned how to deal with different people in a professional manner as well as assist them with their purchases. i work with a team of cashiers. 
bad,If you like being pulled in a million different directions then this is the job for you. The store is always understaffed and moral is so low that a funeral home has more of a positive feel to it. District staff is unprofessional and enjoy making the employees lives a living hell! Worst company I ever worked for!!!!
bad,"If you want a company that's progressive and humane, do not apply!"
bad,I am only there because I have set hours so that I can finish school .
bad,Worked in the flagship store on 6th Ave for 1.5 years. Made it through every test and milestone they through at me. Managed 2 different department while I was employed there that included some of their biggest departments.
bad,"Not a fun place to work at, dysfunctional. Not enough workers for help. Mean and nasty customers treat you like dirt. Constant changes in philosophy make it hard to execute at store level"
bad,"I worked there for 3 1/2 yrs, wanted to move up, no opportunities. The new manager sucked, no idea on how to manage a store. Very unfair.... That’s why I left.."
bad,"Working at the Bed Bath and Beyond call center in the beginning was a lot of fun. While in training, it made you look forward to getting on the floor. However once you get on the floor it is very seldom that you can get assistance from management. For one there are too many positions available for management/too many people in management. The pay is decent but should be more because of the nonsense you  have to deal with ."
bad,"There were a few good managers that knew the business, but most of management consisted of friends with no experience or education. The company was full of high school drama lead by female managers consistently trying to back stab one another for advancement in the company. Males did not have opportunities unless they planned to pick sides a play the game."
bad,This job is good if you are a high school student looking for extra cash but do not work here if you actually have bills to pay because they cut hours a lot and they also don’t pay you enough.
bad,"They will work around your schedule, it is easy to work here and also go to school. Most of the people that work here are very friendly and are willing to help you if you need help."
bad,"The managers were lazy and entitled. Daily would go in and the store manager would be “ordering” when ordering days were on Monday and Tuesday. The ops manager was a mean woman who everyone hated working with, even the store manager called her names."
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond is honestly going out of a business in probably the next 2 years. As time goes by they keep losing money and losing money and its because of the managers who dont follow the stores policies. Managers accomodate any and every customer who makes 1 small complaint no matter what even when we should not be doing. They took back hundreds and hundreds of returns we shouldnt have taken and they give out coupon after coupon, now hours for Part timers have been cut drastically which means the full timers have to do literally 3x the work. They have almost no cashiers working there so no matter where you work theyll call for you to help in the front every 5 minutes and you cant get anything done. Ive been working at this company for 3 years now and have been a supervisor and i only make 25 cents more than a cashier who gets hired today, a good raise in this job is 10cents. Your under paid for the outragelus amount of work you have to do. And if you wanna go in as a store manager or so be ready to work a shift everyday for 10-12 hours. Hoenstly thats no way to live, Mcdonalds is better then this place."
bad,My managers weren’t even the problem it was corporate. They put too much stress to meet goals that were  not realistic. Did not care about associates.
bad,The managers where halfway. Workers wasn't doing they job you tell a Manger and they see this going on they don't care. It was a cool store. Nice gadgets
bad,"I was not a fan of this company, the management was very ""groupie"" like, and not friendly. It was very hard to relate to and work with any of the management in Fargo, ND."
bad,They dont know their own rules they fire you just because and before they fire you they have you work the entire day and then they fire you 1 hour before your shift is over if im getting fired fire me then not after i worked amlost an entire shift for you.
bad,"If you have always been used and abused, you will fit in and feel comfortable!  The expectations are to do 110% with no help and even cutting staff!  Hourly and Management are worked to death long hours, only to have their budgets cut for staffing.  Then get chewed out for not staying another 10 hours (on top of your 12 hour day) to have the store look like perfection.... yes, really!"
bad,"The upper management of the Concord site were highly inappropriate with the younger female staff.  When the human resource department was notified they were slapped on the hand and it continued.  When they found out who had reported them; they were a target that was soon removed.  I learned that when you report harassment and a hostile work environment you are removed."
bad,"With the amount of stress that the employees are under, it amazes me how little we are getting paid. Management doesn't seem to care either, and it just all feels like there's too many cooks in the kitchen"
bad,"This place was unbelievable unprofessional I thought I was being plunked. They put me on the floor with a lady that had been there a week also to train me. She left and went home I got lost coming from break ended up working on the wrong line for two hours before anyone noticed. The manager used foul language and was not a professional, he discussed personal issues in front of the employees. The system was down refused to send anyone home. This job was a disaster their are employees bullying each other and brawls in the parking lot. This place is unbelievable lacks professionalism in the warehouse. My worst experience ever."
bad,Terrible environment. Long hours and no recogn3. DM was cold and gave no positive feedback. Always short staffed.
bad,Short breaks and they work you like crazy. Very strict management. It was in the middle of summer and I stopped at a water fountain 30 seconds in the were telling me to get back to work. I quit on the spot and will never go back. My health was not important to them.
bad,"How bad can a workplace be that the best part of the day is when you clock out to go home... Not matter what employees do, it is never enough for the upper management. They pay a little better than the average but boy they do squeeze that juice out of you... In my case the general manager was super disrespectful, abusive (with everyone) and easy to turn into an enemy... because of this situation  in less than 2 years I saw employees resigning in every position below his, out 4 assistant manager 3 left the company, out of 5 department managers 4 left the company... and about 25 associates resigned! But the good thing is that promotions are easy to get... because people just keep leaving the company."
bad,"Have been working here for over a couple of years with little recognition for the amount of work I have done and have only gotten a dollar raise after asking my manager why I wasn’t automatically given this when minimum wage went up. They typically give you 20 cents or maybe 25 cents per year for a raise if you do well which is little to nothing.They constantly have the sales associate staff cleaning the bathrooms and doing all the grub work. They have given me less than desirable hours being part time, when i was new there was some weeks I’ve only gotten 15 hours. They barely promote people to full time and this means part timers don’t get paid well or get benefits besides sick time."
bad,Poor communication within the company. Corporate comes out and tells us what’s wrong with the store but doesn’t actually help with a plan to fix the problems
bad,"I have had this job for like two weeks and i’m already over it. I was so excited to start at BB&B, however it quickly took a turn for the worse. The management is nice, however many of the cashiers are very rude. I get attitude thrown at me because I don’t know how to do everything, because I just started. The hours are the worst. I take my classes online and I babysit pretty much everyday I don’t work and I always 9-5/10-6, and by the time I get home, I have to make dinner and it feels like I have no time to catch up on school work. This is the worst job I have every had."
bad,"Son mui groseros. Y nunca ven lo que uno ase por la compania y la dedication del trabajo.. nunca te disen Gracias ....  solo por un error que Conte uno claro por que somos humanos. Lo asen ver mui mal y se olvida lo bueno que todo el tiempo a sido..."
bad,"The management and employee turn around has been a major problem for the past 3 years, if not longer. District Management seems to come in and repeat the same mistakes every visit."
bad,"No one has your back.  Hours were spotty from week to week"
bad,This is a very boring and stressful (somehow) place to work. There are no advancement opportunities unless you are part of the 'circle'. The management the do not agree on most things and do the opposite of each other so they make the staff crazy. And certain people get away with not working at all because they are close friends with the managers... the 'circle'.
bad,"Its very HOT during the summer you're handed nothing but fans no air. The pay isn't reasonable! You start off at $11.00 on 2nd shift as an associate unless you work for IC which is $12.00, a trainer $12.00, & $12.50 for a forklift operator. Your yearly raise is only $0.35. Picking is too much walking! During peak season your obligated to work more days, & more hours. Great time for overtime though. No one cares about you here at this place of work though. You have some managers that will try to help you out, but most of them are disrespectful. They have no respect for family, or personal problems at home. They try and work you past your limit, & you get nothing out of the deal. Pushing out as many cartons as you can will only get the individuals above your branch appreciation, & pay raises. NOT YOU! If you need a place to work just for a couple months then yes I recommend. You have to work 6 days just to make it, & some times there is no over time just on weekends. You have no holidays off expect Thanksgiving, Christmas, & New Years."
bad,"Your schedule is constantly messed with, promises made are not kept, insults abound. The misery starts at the regional level and trickles down, the district management is feared."
bad,"A typical day is customers, merchandising...etc"
bad,I would not advise anyone to work here. The pay is not enough to survive for anyone. You may work between 15-20 hours per week. What adult can live off that? With the you will not be able to pay rent .
bad,i didnt learn anything about the position when i was there all they told me to do was fix any product that was placed funny and to make things  worse it was never busy it had its moments but thats if i got lucky to do something other then just standing there and not knowing what to do.
bad,"literally great co-workers, but terrible management."
bad,"work life balance is tough working over 75 hours a week. Systems Out dated, constant cutting of hours makes it hard to accomplish day targets or planning."
bad,"They do not promote within because it would cost the company more. I have been there since October 2013 and have seen multiple employees quit and also a manager did the same. There are constantly misleading directions given by one authority figure and then you can routinely be reprimanded for doing what one manager says if the other manager personally does not approve. The corporate will come in and ask the employee's, who have been with the company over a year if they know anyone who would be interested in a management position. Never offering it to an existing long standing employee. It is a mess and there is no order and it is a struggle to see any positives other than a paycheck..."
bad,Bed Bath and Beyond will use you up. They really have a less is more attitude about how they control expenditures. They really demand a lot but offer little in time and help to do your job.
bad,Company LIES about severance and that store is or is not closing. Finally we were told the store was closing and they offered no relocation or positions to any of us with the exception of the store manager
bad,I started at 9.75 and did wonderful work for them and only increased in wages to 10.25 after two years and a federal minimum wage increase mandate.They did not value their workers.
bad,Management in different directions allowing for store to operate itself! View daily reports with no time allowance to complete. Learned to create and follow up Bridal Registry. Enjoyable is my leadership and my positive personality as a team player.
bad,"I was thrown into the job with very little training during holiday season. I had to learn the job in a hurry with little to no help. They had unreal expectations for someone who was not trained well. Even though I was able to keep up the fast pace and learn things on my own, it was not enough for ether of us."
bad,"I used to like working for this company, but the people taking over management are self-promoting and only looking out for themselves.  There's a growing feeling of compartmentalization among departments. ""That's not my fault/ my responsibility/ my problem"" has been the response to an issue more than once. You're constantly running to the one manager that will help, and then they get so bogged down helping everyone that they give up and either quit or fall into line with the compartmentalization. It's just depressing to go in and try to care when so few others do."
bad,"One thing that is important to me is to see the work I have done is appreciated. My management at the store was dismal in this subject. Compensation was terrible for basically being a sudo manager there. I was given so much responsibility, mainly because of the incompetence of my managers, and to my main store manager, these issues went unnoticed. Also, the lack of being able to provide this feedback was very frustrating"
bad,Do your job and go home.  Dont socialize and make buddies.  Your coworkers are not your friend.  You spend most your time at work and not at home. Dont expect any family time. Your a robot here.  Benefits suck . Your always being watched.  Don't  do anything private you wouldn't do in front of the manager.  Breaks are 10 min . Points will be taken against you. Wrong or right. Pray your way  through th
bad,Corporate expects you to get everything done that they want but cuts hours back and because of the hours cut back they lose parttime people so it all falls on fulltime workers.  Unrealistic goals set by corporate.  Store managers are moved regularly and told if they don't move to another location they won't have a job.
bad,"A typical day at work was busy, steady pace. Managers had their favorites and made it well known who they were. The most enjoyable part was getting to work by myself."
bad,This place expects you to learn about the endless items they sell with little training.  I felt as though I was harassing customers because I was always in gear of missing the secret shopper that they base your performance on. The management was fragmented with multiple people having different instructions without communicating with each other.  I worked in 3 locations and it was inconsistent between each store.
bad,I have been there for 5 years and only had two raises maybe 20 cents each. There is horrible communication between management and employees and the full time employees lie on the part time ones to save their own butts.And you never get promoted...EVER!! Something has go to change.
bad,"Fast paced job, no rest, employees are berated for little things, like not smiling all day. Interactions with customers are timed and must be under a certain amount."
bad,"-Good company to work for. "
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond was my first job. It started very well, well motivated and very happy to be accepted within the hands of the company. I first learned communicational skills, which was a great deal for costumer service. They Management was not up to good standards because everyone was after another's throat for some grudge against another, but that was not my issue the issue was the importance of the products and not being well taught about the merchandise. "
bad,"It's not a long term place you want to stay at, They're little no hours all you do is stand at around and cashier. Cashiering there is very hard to do. You allot of coupons to deal with. Customers and't make their minds and give you a hard time about stuff."
bad,"They expect a lot for little pay and not much in return. You are expected to know all the departments, and the registers, and if you've been here for more than a year the newer people will more than likely be making more than you. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"My experience has been horrible from day one. If you are a retail manager, you should really consider why they are constantly hiring new managers. Their jobs are always posted online. If you have worked for well established companies that value their employees, then this is not the company for you. There is zero work life balance. The culture is very different than any other retailer that I have experienced . It is common practice to be spoken to in a condescending manner. All levels of management within the company lack professionalism and respect for others. You work very long days with only a thirty minute break. You are not allowed to leave the sales floor. If you require food and water.... Don't apply. Please never consider this company if you have a strong background in retail management. They are very far behind the times. Their benefits and breaks do not compare to industry standards."
bad,It sucks they don’t respect you they don’t pay you the hours are terrible scheduling is not fair there is a ton of favoritism going on employees are not respected they claim to have an open door policy but that’s not true
bad,"This job was great when I first started. They were flexible with my work schedule while I was in school. Then the store manager changed, and things got worse for everyone. I worked there for almost two years and left because I couldn’t deal with the current store manager.  They’re about to lose more great workers because they can’t stand this lady either. She has a bad micro-manage personality. Won’t work with full time employees availability. She is also very rude to multiple employees and customers  (including me and others). Hopefully the company sees how bad of a manager she is and stop moving her around because they’re losing some great employees. This location is struggling enough as it is."
bad,"Had issue with management being liars even up to warehouse managers "

bad,"This company is very minimal on training for new hires. A lot is expected from you. From demanding job duties to pushing sales & let's not forget, going above & beyond for every customer. Although this might not sound too bad, it's different when you're physically dealing with it. This is due to the lack of teamwork & management. This co. is cheap & offers no rewards/perks to emp"
bad,Do not accept a position at Bed Bath and Beyond. Warning do not apply  Worst retail job I ever had. I can not say anything positive about this company
bad,I didn't enjoy working here at all. It was some good times but overall there was a lot of drama and no one helped each other. Managers weren't managing and associates would do what they wanted.
bad,"The specific location that I was working was only bad due to the supervising staff. Each employee was considered a number and not looked at as a person. Also there were no incentives for regular sales associates, but for supervising staff they were given bonuses based off what the general employees accomplished."
bad,don't work here. nothing else to say. just writing this because this site is forcing me to fill out this survey and write a review with a one hundred and fifty character minimum
bad,No me gusta el trato así su empleados es un trabajo un poco apretado

bad,"Busy and sometimes fun workplace. over-worked and under appreciated associates. the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with, they was no hard part to that job."
bad,they rather hire someone from outside then promote from within. i worled there for a year and they hired a new supervisor and i ha to train her. i believe it was some kind of discrimination because i knew everything and always came to work
bad,"The management at my previous location was terrible. They don't care about your personal life or time, they ask you for so much but does the bare minimum in return."
bad,The job at Bed Bath & Beyond is a job like any other retail job with the standard employee attitude. Ping pong tables not available.
bad,"Typical day of work consisted of helping customers and making sure store was stocked. Tend to get your usual shoppers in once or twice a week, some great, some not so great."
bad,"To many managers, not enough associates. To many hours, no bonus program. Unprofessional district manager. Felt unappreciated. Not enough teamwork."
bad,Good place to work.  Customer focused.  Friendly co-workers.  Sometimes short staffed.  Good products. Good return policy.  Very good training materials.
bad,Management was rude and could not care about you as long as you got customers to sign up for credits. If you fail to please their wants of credits they cut yours hours. Typical day was unpleasant.
bad,"Place is the worst, if you want to be treated like a slave and kicked to the curb you'll enjoy bbb"
bad,Bed bath and Beyond offers great discounts. Working on the floor and cash register where you interact with customers was enjoyable.
bad,"I was overall dissatisfied with my work environment. It gave me great experience in such a little time, however. But, over all, very little hours were given and the pay could've been better for such long hours."
bad,There was too much confusion as to the delegation of dutres in the store and on top of that thewarehouse was messy. I wasnt given an option but was coerced into going into the shipping and recieving department which completely contradicted to my future goals of beginning a set designer
bad,"The managing staff is lazy and the store manager is overbearing."
bad,"Check out customers, answer any questions regarding items or registries, help with stocking and inventory. Very busy on holidays and mandatory over time require during those times."
bad,"Poor pay no hours available but they still hire but the staff already there is not getting hours ""':""'';&_-;!'$:!!'""!!:*;!""-? Management is cranky $-+"
bad,the ladder climbing to get product off the top shelving units can be intimidating. Management is not kind and has expectations which are not reality. difficult place to work unless you like the public
bad,"Total lack of leadership in this store. They do very little to help you improve and if you try to take care of yourself, store management devalues you. No advancement and very little chance to be more than part time. Stressful environment due to lack of hours scheduled to get everything done. "
bad,Worked at the E-Comm and the hours were crazy! You can work 14 hours a day and sometimes never allowed to take a break. You are on your feet your whole shift. Leadership team was very sexiest and did not appreciate a females perspective or ideas.
bad,They only offer part time hours. If you looking for more hours apply to a different location. The pay is very low for so much things your responsible for. When I worked there my pay was 8.75 and took me 2years to get a raise.
bad,This store may look nice and organized while your shopping but it is a bit of a disaster to work here. They are willing to teach you some stuff but no one is really there if you have any questions or concerns. You are never able to complete a task because you are always expected to drop what your doing and help out the cashier.
bad,"Management is terrible, summer the hours are fine but come winter the hours drop dramatically, I learned that the managers talks bad about their workers behind their backs"
bad,"stressful, unfriendley unpaid and not trustworthy. not team effort in the store and not organized with the mangers in the store and unease tranning process!"
bad,The structure of this company seems sound but the management falls short of its responsibilities consistantly.  Unfair pay in a competitive market with many other options make this company a sinking ship.
bad,I’m sure it would have been better had it been ran correctly and not biasedly. If you did not have the correct looks then you would be singled out to do most of the work while the other female associates flirted with the manager.
bad,"typical day at work every manager watches you to see if your going to do something wrong in there eyes. the job itself was easy i actually liked working i loved my co workers but the managers made me feel very uncomfortable an i felt disrespected in many ways working there. also after working 5 hours theres no 15 min break unless you work 6 hours or more for a lunch break which i think is very unreasonable, and this is at the Bed bath and beyond at Aventura, FL."
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond does not take care of its employees at all. The people who have worked hard for them for over 10 years are paid dollars less by the hour than new associates. Customers can receive a 33% discount with the right coupon, while employees can receive 20% at most. "
bad,This company is all about the manager's. They expect alot from you and your pay and hours are cramp. I would recommend anyone with a family to work here.
bad,Negative work environment. Company offers zero work-life balance. Management does not have the ability to work from home. 9 hours a day schedule....just not a good work environment.
bad,"I worked here to build my management and training skills. It was always a temporary position. I worked full time hours but was paid pennies and had to fight for insurance and benefits. Not flexible, good for short term employment. Will keep you busy."
bad,This was a typical retail position that was simply a job. The position did not require much effort but also offered little compensation or chance for advancement.
bad,"I leared how to deal with all types of customers. Product knowlege was very important. I made it my own goal to know most of the iteams in the store, if you know BB&B you know its prettyy jamed packed. I was able to learn ordering and receiving freight."
bad,"I enjoyed working with all my crew members and staff."
bad,"Was good 10 years ago, the company is always downsizing, and adding more to your plate. When you start making money, they get rid of you. They expect more than physically possible of management and want you to delegate all your tasks when they pay their employees minimum wage. The district/regional managers are not going anywhere and have old school opinions. I should of left when I had a chance."
bad,The manager at that time didn't treat their employees correctly or fairly
bad,"Early shift consisted of morning replenishment and moved to plan for work day. Given small time frames to complete large projects which backed up the days work. Not enough associates to man registers or help customers with products. "
bad,it was an awesome expierence friendly people the customers were very fun and easy to talk to it was just the managers some of them was lazy some of them didn't know anything about the products we was selling
bad,"I took this job after a divorce, and needed mother's hours at the time and the fully accommodated me at the time. I've gone through 4 store managers and 8 assistant managers in the four years I've been there, and honestly, I've seen many things that people do that the average Joe (like myself) would get fired for, but they keep those people because the hiring process is difficult and the people once they come in the door do not stay."
bad,"Most managers put off work they are supposed to do, leaving things unattended on the sales floor for days at a time.  They spend lots of time on their phones or talking to each other about sports. They often never communicate"
bad,"Just like Boston Market I had major issues working at this job. Certain things like time and punctuality was on me, but getting sat down to be told I was not doing my job when I was doing my job was insane and rude and unforgivable. At work you make work buddies and that is what I thought I made. I was wrong when i thought i can trust to have work buddies  everyone is either a liar or they can not keep a secrets. Everyone tells each other everything about everyone else's problems and it messes with the friendships you thought you made with people."
bad,"one of the not place to work, no affordable benefits, no employee value. working late and hard for no race or appreciation. one place that no learning or growth."
bad,I have worked for this company for years. I watched it go downwards. Typical day at work is full of stress and chaos. Management is not set. Always temporary spots. For high school kids that just need a paycheck this is the way to go. For adults looking for careers you will not get very far.
bad,No career growth . So even though youre okay with low salary rates. Its not worth the effort and skills coz its a company that only exist to take. And dont even match what you can do.  Wish they know how to take care and see those good employees they have who have the potential and really cares about the companys progress.
bad,It’s different for everyone. Depending how you work with others. And your attitude is very important as well. That sets up your day or even week......
bad,It was really crazy in there also I really big mess people were throwing things all over the place there was no space for you to walk it was a really bad work place to be in
bad,This place is run by dinosaurs. The thinking is slow. The changes are slow. Disagreements with executive managers and leaders ship or met with Swift firings. Ideas to make improvements if not from the select group of frowned upon tremendously. E-commerce is a complete joke in the call center is attached to them are even worse.
bad,Terrible place to work. The culture there is not conducive to a good work place enviroment. Stress is the major factor and it seems like it's going to be closing soon
bad,"typical day at work: stand by the register to wait for someone to check out, greet customers, and direct any customers if they need help."
bad,"honestly its a shame such an arrogant man runs this particular store. he actually has the highest turnover rate in the company. i was the early morning stocker. id come in at five everymorning. we would stock the shelves and put new products and displays out before the store opened at 9. you definetely have to find a good pace because 60% of the time we werent finished when we opened the doors for customers. the only negative was the jerk of a manager. i would be sprinting around the store with three microwaves in my hands trying to stock at the pace he wanted me at. would talk down to his employees and call them dumb or old. just outright arrogant. they have an open door policy but when district managers come in youre not even aloud to talk to them. when you do get a chance they literally laugh and say theyll handle it. its never handled. horrible promotional opportunities, and no benefits. horrible vacation days, only three days PTO after 1 year"
bad,"When it came to job advancement--- none"
bad,"Pay was above minimum wage and increased by $0.10 a year. But the hours are horrible. "
bad,The store I worked at valued daily sales rather than keeping employees they had. The average stay at my store for an employee was 4 months. Only a sales benefit.
bad,"I was a customer service associate and occasional cashier. It was alright at first, everyone was pretty nice, though the teaching was very inefficient and the managers barely took part in it, other employees had to step up to make sure I was trained. There was hardly any room for advancement, and if advancement was mentioned they then did an intense run around about training for new positions. They would sometimes even alter schedules without telling people, then reprimand you when you didn't show up without knowing the changes. After a year of working there they gave me a whopping 25 cent raise. Not to mention the fact that any grievances or major issues that were happening were basically ignored by store management until you were so desperate you brought them up with a regional manager."
bad,"They'll hire anyone with a pulse, as long as you're willing to work for minimum wage. You may get scheduled 40 hours, but they make you take unpaid lunches, so you don't get ""full time"" benefits. The company is so cheap they don't provide enough hours for the stores, so they're always understaffed, providing extra stress to the hourly workers. You do get a 20% of discount on most items, and a couple of times a year it's 30% off. No paid breaks, only an unpaid 30 minute lunch. You are also expected to sell, sell, sell, no bad days allowed. Would not recommend working for this company to anybody I cared about."
bad,The management was very disrespectful. The scheduling/hours were horrible and inconsistent. I got next to no training and then got very little help when I had questions.
bad,"This used to be a fun place to work but within the last few years  it turned into a chaotic work environment.  I will say there is room for advancement but it's at your own risk. There isn't much training, you are expected to learn on your own. If you do ask for help you are ignored and the looked down on. Management as well as district management need training in people skills. This company focuses more on customers than their own employees. Customers know they can get away with anything so alot treat employees like garbage and management will not stick up for employees at all. Internal problems are ignored by upper management and you are expected to just look the other way at times. Policies change without any communication or compromise.  The more you ""complain"" the worse you are treated no matter how good of any employee you are."
bad,"Lack of communication, unnecessary stress, no proper training... just a few things about Bed Bath and Beyond that I deal with on a daily basis. The management doesn't communicate when it comes to making the schedules. In fact, everyone gets their schedules for the next week on Saturday night for Sunday. So it's hard to set any appointments when you're uncertain of your schedule. I've been here for 2 months and wasn't trained for more than 2 days, yet I was expected to know the in and out of the way things operate there. Management would get to the point where they were telling me I wasn't ""moving fast enough"" and I wasn't ""pulling top stock correctly"", so they stopped allowing me to pull top stock because they felt I was doing it wrong. The shifts are 4 hours long and if you're in stock and replenishment, you're expected to pull everything by yourself in those 4 hours. Their systems are very outdated but too demanding. Maybe it depends on the location, but everyone I work with who's not management regrets working here because of lack of hours and poor management."
bad,"Working far too many hours a week while full time student, even after speaking with manager. Stressful environment lead to a few mental breaks over the course of the month and a half I worked while also in school. I had maybe an hour or two to myself during a typical week - working afternoons/evenings and weekends, while at school the rest of the time."
bad,"Management messed up they are unfair to associates."
bad,Bed Bath & Beyond is a very negative environment to work in. The manager is cranky and nit-picky. The customers are generally very rude and confrontational.
bad,I will not give any negative feedback to this company. They pay very well but you do work many long hours. I would advise prior to taking a position go to the location and speak with current employees.
bad,"Manangement at Sonic was unfair and played games.They always would change when you were allowed to put in requests for time off. only select few were given their requests. There was definitely favorites, and drama constantly between the managers. I eventually had to leave because of the drama, the games, the unfairness, and to grow in my career."
bad,"Completed money, check and bankcard transactions according to established procedure. Processed sales quickly, accurately and efficiently. Maintained exceptional customer service. Responsible to help the customers find items that they need or explain specialized products that the store carries."
bad,"Ok, not very nice if you are older"
bad,"Every loss of an needed employee they do not hire to replace, just give the job duties to another person to further their work load and of course do not add compensation or schedule more time for the worker to get the job completed. Very little for scheduling, expect complete and total availability even if it is only 10 hours a week they need you for. Being sick and having to call out, is not allowed, will bully you into coming in for work shift even with a doctors note. "
bad,thing's are not together and management is very poor and you have to learn from other lift drivers i really didn't like working here
bad,They are an okay company. Management and leads play favorites with employees. Double standards for work performance and unequal enforcement of company work policy. One standard for the favorites and another policy and standard for others. Shifts and management are disorganized and not sure who is in charge or not in charge. Pace of the work is fast and hard. Co-workers and others not really valued by the management.  However if your looking for a part time job while in school and or looking for something better its not a bad place. Just keep mouth closed and do what they tell you and work your shift and you will be fine.
bad,"Best part of this job was interacting with customers. Typical day was usually boring. The lower level store managers were only focused on their own advancement. Store manager was compassionate. For the most part, co-workers were nice although nobody seemed to really want to be there. Difficulties for me included lifting heavy objects when there were others who more more suitable to this task."
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond prides itself on customer satisfaction. However, any little complaint a customer gives about the company or a single employee reflects poorly on us all and we all have to get further training in that subject even though some of us may excel at that skill. The managers are inconsiderate, they take credit for your work, and when the company is in trouble they blame you. I learned how to deal with customers whom are dissatisfied with products or the store environment as well as fixing their complaints right when it happens. I learned how to work well with others, the most enjoyable part of my job is when I help a customer find what they need. The hardest part of the job is helping multiple customers at once, especially dealing with customers during the holiday season. Black friday at the mall is something that no one ever should have to experience when working retail."
bad,"Assisted customers in finding store items. The job itself was riddled with people unfit to work in a high capacity retail environment and they exploited part time workers by not giving them any kind of benefits and making them work on ladders that were, by my standards, unusable. I learned how to work with retail inventory software and how to produce merchandising stations."
bad,I was young and foolish for thinking a big company like that would be a good place to work. Friendly employees but management could care less about its employees. Was very bad at training and put employees in positions to be successful.
bad,Upper leadership not in touch with store experience. Positions eliminated company wide and existing managers were expected to work at least 12+ hours a day. I was often asked to work my off days. I have driven around the metro area to get items from other stores that my store was out of. This was because store inventory was not received timely.
bad,I worked here for 3 months. They constantly treated me like I was stupid. Managers are rude and unprofessional. One manager was talking behind my back.
bad,"This is a cool place to work during the holidays, but there is no room for growth or advancement in the store. Plus they don't pay that well. Not very many hours if your part time and you can't really get to full time ever."
bad,"Management has its favorites who can do no wrong or their job. No chance for advancement. Low hours cant make a decent living working here. expect too much for the pay, having to cover other employees jobs who were lazy. Have to go up and down ladders. physical job. Management is hard to deal with and does nothing about employees who cause conflict or don't do their job and pass work off on others."
bad,Employer culture could benefit for valuing their employees. Management needs more training. Also more growth oppurtunities.Positive reinforcement is very much needed.
bad,this job has very poor team work ethics it is a good job that has a starting retail job. has many downs they are not very understanding when it comes to personal and health related issues you may have. as a result of over all its a poor/ okay job. you only get $9 an hr if part time not sure how much you would get full time or about the benefits they offer.
bad,"I started working here in California and it was great but, when I transferred to the store in Maryland there Customer Service skills were not the same. I was taught that customers are our number one priority and everyone was always nice, not the case here in Maryland. The managers were not involved that much, they overworked the people that worked hard while letting the slackers continue to slack with the same amount of hours and pay! Ridiculous! Needless to say I left and the funny part is I have seen some of the managers working at other retailers. Also was very disappointed with Corporate here! They were there almost everyday but, didn't seem to fix any issues. The biggest one being the attitudes of the managers!"
bad,"the work environment was okay, a typical day consist of the same each day such as restock/back stock. Some managers were nice  others were disrespectful and can learn to speak to workers regardless of the age."
bad,management doesn’t train you properly except with wedding registrations & cashier. they aren’t flexible when it comes to your home life (i’m a mother of two) & it was just overall horrible. would never work there again.
bad,"I would have to unload and price every item in the 8 or 9 pallets of boxes we would get every morning. Not only that, but we only had like an hour and a half to do it. They did not pay me enough for a job that stressful. They would threaten to fire me if i accidentally priced something wrong."
bad,This job was good at first the money felt right and everything. Until this work environment set in and I realized how the management didn’t help the employees if a costumer was being unreasonable. The pay isn’t worth the time unless 300 every 2 weeks is good for you.
bad,"Started off great. Then, a new manager came and everything went down the toilet. She has no idea what she's doing, doesn't know what she's talking about, and is very lazy. She needs to go."
bad,If you aren't part of certain groups everything you do is super scrutinized. have had anxiety attacks frequently because of the work environment. Management doesnt know how to communicate properly. discrimination is also a thing
bad,"Management sucks. I will barely get hours regardless if ive been here for 3.5 years. I have to do the managers jobs for them most of the time. Pay is ok, but Im required to do so much more than what i get paid. I wouldnt...but its up to you."
bad,Managers are being hunted so they can be replaced by hourly positions. Made  assistants hourly with mandatory OT & work more hours for their current salary to offset a lawsuit.
bad,"My time, tho short, was very unpleasant. I was constantly getting reprimanded for things because I was not doing them the correct way but yet I was not trained in how to do the. My speaking with customers was always criticized because I didn't use enough courtesy words yet my tone of voice displayed the same thing. When needing assistance management of my team was difficult to reach via chats. They would get irritated if you did a instant chat to them to resolved the the issue. Departments that were suppose to help you many times were unavailable so you had to reach out to your team management often with little results, therefore having to reach out to other team management or left hanging to your own to get it resolved. The you were questions as to why you did that. "
bad,"Always up an down the big ladders stocking things an pulling things down. Pushing an lifting heavy objects. Walking bigger objects up ladders an lifting over your head. Very poor training. Managers are not helpful. Associates were rude an did not want to help you, very unorganized."
bad,While striving to expand their online sales competitiveness as well as reduce their square footage and stoee staffing levels the company still expects lofty sales numbers from overworked underpaid employees who have inadequate knowledge.
bad,"It is very fast paced and it is a stressful atmosphere most of the time. it is very rare that you get a pleasant customer, but i still keep a smile on my face all the time.  You run back and forth between doing go backs, recovering and answering phones.  At customer service you deal with customers returns, people trying to return things to get money or more appropriately said, ""steal money"" and every once in a while you have that one customer that yells at you or complains about your service or how slow your going.  IF you are able to work well under stress and are able to juggle 3 things at once then this job is for you. If not, then i would look somewhere else.  I liked working here, because it taught me alot about patience and gave me alot of selfcontrol when speaking with angry or upset customers.  I get many good reviews from customers and i always make sure i put them first. Even if they are mean to me."
bad,I would start off my day by clocking in and automatically have to fix a lot of products that have been messed with along the day because my co workers sure wont do it.
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a typical retail job, but pays less than most.  The average in this area is $10/ hour to start, but here they start most people at $8."
bad,"Work hard and fast, no advancement, terrible raises. They nickel and dime you to death, and maybe once in awhile you can get a quarter."
bad,"learned a lot and now I can say I have worked in retail, however the management was not good or organized and hard to climb to higher pay or job titles."
bad,"Another soul sucking retail job. Starting pay is usually a little above state minimum wage, which is nice. Full time spots are almost never available. Employee discount isn't that great. The employee incentive program, however, is worth having your soul die a little more with each passing day. If you're lucky, you might get to work with some pretty awesome people."
bad,"From the day I was hired I was lied to and lead to believe I would be full time. Scheduling is inconsistent  (one week you get 32 hours, the next you get 10 hours) and not at all flexible to the employee's needs."
bad,"Upper Management has poor management and leadership qualities. They do  not care for middle management and their employees. Too many chiefs and not enough indians."
bad,"if you get the job at least ask for 11.50, sooo much work for only 10 dollars, i would be sweating at the end of the day because they have you doing sooo much, your climbing up and down a really tall latter, caring heavy stuff stocking the items pretty much as tall as the building is, its seriously intense work! the stores are pretty huge so your walking all over the place to find where this object goes... if you want a job with a workout this is the place for you!"
bad,"The best aspect for working as a cashier at Bed Bath and Beyond, was the freedom to manage your own time. Management was very friendly, but did not do a good job of communicating with employees."
bad,for the most part almost all the staff is very friendly the biggest downfall is operations which seems too inexperienced in what he does therefor his decisions and motives for a task are unclear and run backwards  ideas would be implemented that either add extra unnecessary steps or waste way too much time just to understand why this idea exist.
bad,The management there is very poor and the managers are rude which makes me not enjoy working there. It's stressful at times when the managers yell at you when instead they coould say it in a better way.
bad,The hours are horrible. I was only getting 17-20 hrs on a GOOD week. It wasn't a job I could depend on and the hours that I was given never matched my availability.
bad,"The main manager expects you to do his job as well as all the others they hold you responsible for. Great company but horrible main, lazy, manager. You only get hours as long as u are placing orders."
bad,How much is there to say.  This is a retail work environment.  Stores are typically very lightly staffed which turns into large amounts of work for each person with fairly low pay.  They have a culture of apologizing and giving a customer whatever they want no matter what.  I had to actually break the habit of saying I'm sorry as a first reaction to things when i left employment here it is so ingrained to be your first response to anything.
bad,"Ask your interviewer questions. Like what is the turnover in the store. What do you do to motivate your employees. Ask if you make a mistake, how is it handled. If you are a student, ask manager how easy will it be to change your availability. How many shifts a week are you required to do for this position. ASK QUESTIONS!! Stressed out managers = unhappy associates and high turnover."
bad,"A typical day there is navigating through multiple systems and dealing with multiple customer situations. Dealing with the customers was the best part of the job. Management was very unprofessional, it's a no cell phone environment and the manager would sneak and have unprofessional conversations on his smart watch. The team lead was overhead saying the new trainees were annoying and stupid. They give attendance occurrences for any little or big thing. I was in a pretty bad car accident on the way to work and suffered a head injury, had to be transported by ambulance, and I still received an occurrence. The training is completely thrown out the door when you hit the call floor and are just thrown to the wolves. No structure what so ever! The benefits are a joke...way too expensive so it wasn't even worth getting."
bad,"This company will take your soul and make it rot from the inside. They treat their customers like royalty, which a retailer should. Their employees and managers however, they treat like garbage. They preach a company culture that they do not stand by. They say they promote from within, but do not post any open positions or allow you to apply or even know about positions as they become available. If you want to work here as a cashier, it's fine. If you want to be a manager, they will pay you well if they poach you from another company (especially a Lowe's or Home Depot) but not if you work your way up through the company. The work/life balance is atrocious, especially as a manager. District support staff are laughable. There is no positive reinforcement, only negatives and more negatives. They will form an opinion of you, good or bad, but you will never know what that is because there is no transparency. Reviews are a joke. The benefits used to be good, but they were changed and now they're very expensive if you have to ever actually go to the doctor. They also preach about training and development, but they don't support it at the store level so alot of times you are left to fend for yourself. You also don't receive a break, just one 30 minute meal even when working a 10+ hour shift."
bad,"This place was horrible the management talks down to everybody, and bring the whole place down. There is a lot of in fighting from mangers and employees.  There were meeting every night about  complaints that where sent to HR and nothing was ever done to address any of the problems . Management got mad at us for sending complaints about them, if they treated us right we wouldn't have to complain. 3 store mangers later and nothing had changed I would stay away from this place or keep to myself."
bad,"Worked there for a few months the management was cool but it seemed like they started a lot of drama. They constantly changed my schedule without consulting me about it. (I'm a full time college student) they changed my schedule once and didn't let me know so I missed work, instead of calling me they messaged me on Facebook. The work there was completely one sided. The people that had worked there for a longer period of time didn't do any work what so ever. Worst working experience I've had."
bad,"As with most call center jobs, they'll lure you in and promise you so many advancement opportunities and that its such a great place that you might as well be at Disneyland. . . and, sure, its all daisies and sunshine during the training program. But once you become a CSR, you'll see the REAL side of Bed Bath and Beyond. "
bad,pick products. pack them and shipp it. Fill orders daily. Orders as big as 5000 sometimes 10000 orders daily. they sell very nice products. very expensvie.
bad,The hours were never consistent. Management made promises they never kept. Very much like high school with cliques and bullying. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work for this company.
bad,"They tried to teach me everything there is to know in one day. They made me stand for 4 hours listening to the trainer, got a 30 minute lunch break, stood another 4 hours to be trained again, listening to someone talk and do mundane training exercises. I was told they would continue training me the next day. They didn't. I was put in customer service/cashier positions for which I had no experience in. I had no idea what I was doing half the time since they rushed the training, so I barely even knew how to operate the ancient cash register from the 1990's that they never bothered to replace. Customers were mostly pleasant, even if at times condescending. I hated coming into work."
bad,Typical day at work was standing at the door and greeting people as they entered and exited. I learned how to navigate through the store well enough to were I knew where everything was. The management wasn't the best they are not very organized and they didn't seem to care about the employees. My co-workers were pretty cool people at times and others not so cool. The job is not a hard job but the hardest part of the job is dealing with the shoplifters. The best part of the job is going to lunch.
bad,The job is the job; there is nothing to entertain you while on break or lunch in the premises. The Job has a lot of stress mainly because of the customer and the lack or software technology to resolve customers problems.
bad,"Ive noticed when i was employed there, that if you don't let one of the store managers touch you then they will cut your hours and let you go. Thats what happened with me. I reported him to the hire office, and i was fired the next day by him."
bad,"I have been all round the store and worked every position possible(besides management) including front end lead. Was fine until the ""raise"" they had offered, which was a fulltime position, was had been revoked because I started going to school. These people see how hard they can work you without rewarding you and keep you grinding . If you complain, you will see your hours drop and positions change. If they really want you gone they will minimize your hours and push you into a corner until you leave. This is a good company to work for if you keep your head down, shut up, and work. MUCH BETTER IF YOU COME IN AS MANAGEMENT."
bad,Management wanted you to devote your time soley to them. Was un willing to work with me regarding school.
bad,Worst I have ever been  a part of - lack of people skills and running a department - you fail on projects and get promoted - accountability is lacking and favoritism prevails....
bad,"I’ve had my fair share of retail jobs. This was not my favourite as they kept me alone for most of the time to do about a 10 people job. Answering phones, taking care of displays, learn my products to promote and up-sell, deal with a line up of customers waiting for my assistance, put things away/stock shelves, be a team leader and take on more responsibilities, and so on. Without extra pay, they’ve asked me to do more than I could handle and with the minimum help and extremely high expectations. Not for me."
bad,"Enough said. You pay peanuts, you get monkeys. They run the management above you ragged, so they can't help the underlings. Corporate refuses to learn or listen to ""new"" ideas."
bad,"BBB lost their perspective on who they are as a company.  They were trying to become an online retailer ""better then Amazon "" with out the infrastructure. Their plan was to use the stores to convert their customers to online customers assuming that their instore customers wanted to be online customers and would be bbb online customers. Bbb set out to meet this lofty goal by using the store employee requiring the stores to do two jobs and cutting their hours."
bad,It would be best not to say anything. Management would tell you one thing and then tell you something else not talk to each other about what was going on
bad,"not exciting or challenging in any sort of way, unenjoyable."
bad,"Not the greatest company to work for. No insurance, staff and management suck, always under mandatory overtime because lack of support from staff. Monthly goals not realistic"
bad,Working for BBB was okay. I got maybe two or three weeks of training to be a supervisor but when we actually were on the floor it was a hands-off you do your own thing which was frustrating because you're not used to that an environment when you don't know where any of the merchandise is because new product is introduced almost every day and lack of communication from management was the big thing that killed me.
bad,This place will work you to death. They have ridiculous standards and will demand you go break neck fast all shift. There's bias among managers and they will always play to their favorites often based on race or gender. Also you will near constantly required to do required over time and mandatory voluntary overtime
bad,"This place is a retail environment. It is where I go to make money and pay my bills. You can be placed in a local store or a distant store, your preference is not considered. They are a typical big box retailer."
bad,"I worked at BBB for over two years and originally thoroughly enjoyed my job. I was always getting the amount of hours I wanted and I loved the people I worked with. Unfortunately, overtime, things went completely downhill. Yearly employee reviews and raises are meant to be conducted and months went by and so many of us had not received ours. Instead, individuals who do much less work and had worked at this company for many years less get promoted more than once! To expand further on this, individuals who have worked for the company since the store has opened actually make less money than somebody going on their second year. On top of no promotions or raises, there are members of management that make the work environment highly anxiety ridden with condescending comments, rude remarks and having outbursts in front of customers which is extremely embarrassing and uncomfortable as staff and customers. "
bad,"As a whole, when I started working at my particular store it was fine. The work was easy and the people were reserved but kind. As time passes and you learn more, the more responsibility you seem to accumulate with little to no benefit to you. Once you're there and you're working 30-40 hours with no full time benefits or raises EVER, it just gets old. Also, they need to hire better management as a whole. It just seems to be lacking in every department. Would not recommend to anyone."
bad,Can become stressful and extremely hard work. One manager was not easy to work with. she was unsure of her role in her job.  so she gave everyone else a hard time.
bad,"Terrible communication, want you to kiss butt , got to be on the mangers side of everything or else u wrong. If they mess up anything they go and blame you. Manager beats off in bathroom then wants to go and touch your shoulder about how wrong you do something"
bad,They pay you minimum wage to do the job of 10 people the management never owns up to there mistakes and blames lesser staff members. They do not say thank you when doing favors for them and if you are unable to do the favor they treat you differently. They do not follow company guidelines and make up their own rules and regulations
bad,"This company as a whole does not have the best interest of their most trustworthy and hardworking employees in mind when doing anything. Whether its in store management or district, they do not have your back in any situation. I understand completely that customer service comes first but in most situations you will be thrown under the bus so that ""the company does not get a complaint""."
bad,if you're in school and you're looking for a part time job then Bed Bath & Beyond is an ideal place to work. very flexible with your hours and great experience. If you are looking for Full time work and are looking to move up in a company then DO NOT apply here.
bad,"Easily the worst company I've ever worked for. Corporate could care less about the problems and situations that arose in the stores, they just wanted results. Overworked, always stressed, and no where near paid enough."
bad,"The store manager uses foul language towards employees, they over work full timers and people on the floor. Their system is very old. The employees are nice but it's the store manager that really abuses his power."
bad,As the new trend is in retail. Cut costs by lowering the hours of hourly employees and adding hours to management to compensate. Compensation is not commensurate to work load.
bad,"Cons: Managment team is very poorly managed! Not enough hours per employees are given!"
bad,The management here is not willing to work with school or other work schedules. The manager put me on for a day that I was in class (when I was in high school) and told me I needed to be at work at that time. Place has been going downhill since then.
bad,After numerous years at this company the continued hiring supervisors from the outside instead of promoting deserving current associates became very upsetting and discouraging.
bad,"management is terrible, co workers are great, but its disorganized and the company is going into the ground. the managers don't help you reach your hour limit, they skimp on hours with people who actually run the store, and then give trashy employees all the hours."
bad,You just want to stay in your lane. Management is bad no equal treatment very poor management skills they hire anyone for manager basically and  male managers don’t stay in there lane with female employees  but pay is good and   just wish more equal treatment and everyone can be the same and not think less of employees. They also move up employees to trainers without them even knowing the department. Basically based on favoritism and it’s noticeable.
bad,"Because the company is more focused on bottom line and use to dealing with a younger group they usually hire part-time, for cents on the dollar. It usually takes people years to become full time since they work by seniority."
bad,"This company appeals mostly to part time college and high school students. Turn over rate is very high, so don't expect to see the same people everyday. Management has a tough time balancing all the tasks that they need to complete, and the stress definitely shows and infects everyone else. Training is insufficient. Absolutely no way to move up in the company unless you're friends with the corporate people in New Jersey. Don't even think of asking for a raise, even if you have been there for 2+ years."
bad,"The management was out of touch, but that may have just been the one location. It was a basic retail job that had very little training, benefits, or other perks. The culture was great because of the other coworkers."
bad,Management didn't  appreciate all the hard work and time I do each week and looks at all the bad & negativity going on around the store instead of looking at all the good and positivity
bad,"Typical DRAMAISH date..."
bad,My typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond was dealing with customer returns. I was a supervisor who worked 35 hour weeks that eventually dropped down to less than 20. I learned if i wanted to get a promotion i would have to transfer eventhough i was doing manager work in my department. Management repeatedly break rules for customers and when the weekly reports would be printed act surpised to them. The hardest part of my job was when i would make a  decision and a customer would ask for a manager the manager would overturn it. That made me look inferior to the customer and my cashiers.
bad,"worked minimum 47.5 per week."
bad,Working in customer service is always stressful but it is so much worse when the store manager is looking for opportunities to throw hourly employees under the customer bus. I did not lay down and take it so the manager made my life as miserable as she could until she found something to make me quit. The manager is unprofessional and mean but still managed to get a team of some great people that I really miss working with.
bad,"Management was bad. The General manager was fired a month after I left, for grossly missing all store goals. The assistant manager just made the schedule by copy/paste without regard to time off requests. The store paid minimum wage offered very limited advancement, ironically if you were good at the job most managers would hold you back from advancement because they didn't want to find someone new."
bad,"I worked at two different locations in the St. Louis area. The management was terrible, and everyone I worked with was not laid back. The customers are rude, and you dont get any real benefits. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving."
bad,"The store manager is terrible. He is a lead from behind, bloated ex-frat boy. The upper management team is a collection of inept slackers that love to tell you how to do your job, but I have never seen them roll up their sleeves and do something.The associate managers are a bit of a mixed bag. Some are great, other less so. Also, the pay is well below market wages."
bad,"Bad training, bad management, strict hours. I worked there for a little over two years and everyone treats you like awful. You're basically a robot.Keep running if you see this job posting."
bad,"I was poorly trained, and a supervisor was annoyed if I ever made a mistake because of it, and continues to make me feel stupid every chance she gets. very outdated system, slow and hard to use. nice place to work but management needs a lot of shaping up. they don't hire enough people, often times I will be the only one on register, and have to call people from all departments to help out."
bad,Learned so much about cross-selling products and how to up-sale beauty and bathroom products. great experience while in high school
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers but was not very fond of my managers. I learned how to take criticism from managers as well as difficult customers, as well as how to positively deal with them."
bad,"Part time at this job is a que for the managers to work you on the days you specifically ask to have off, no matter what your reason. Too much drama in the work place. I did learn a lot about customer sevice, and doing the job itself was actually quite enjoyable. Management plays a lot of games with the workers that are unnecessary."
bad,"Most of the employees and managers are very friendly, but the store manager and one particular department manager are very crooked. I couldn't handle working there anymore."
bad,"Spent 7 years working in this location with absolutely no room for advancement.One employee was hired as a manager in training and it took them 5 years to find him a location. Some of the managers over the seven years I was there were excellent others were a joke.The store that I worked in seem to be the ""timeout"" store for anyone in management when they weren't performing up to task. They would send them to our location because there really wasn't too much they could mess up. The only positive thing I can say is that there was a fantastic staff. Every time you turn around though corporate was cutting part timers' hours. When I started I used to work 32/week, when I left you couldn't work more than 20. New hires will never make more than $9.25 an hour and their raises are a slap in the face! The highest raise you can get is $0.35 an hour which isn't even close to a 3% cost of living Increase. You never will feel adequately compensated for what they expect from you. Really would not recommend working here."
bad,"Corporate office allows for no local autonomy,  Very poorly ran HR dept.  Employer does not treat associates in a consistent nor fair manner."
bad,"Customers are always loaded with stupid questions, managers don't understand the concept of scheduling, and the hours are so inefficient and sporadic it's very hard to have any sort of outside life. Not to mention the head District manager seems to have no concept of simple economics, which seems to be the only point of his/her job, due to the fact that the rest of the time he/she is sitting in the office with his/her feet up sipping coffee."
bad,I did not learn much from this job the management team really sucked. They had no respect for there workers when I worked there he had to be about at least  people that has passed out from overheating.
bad,Management work well over 60plus hours a week. Some Manager  are required to work days off on many occasions with no comp days.  Very hard to use your vacation or holidays.
bad,"Like many have said the employees seem to find a common bond with how they understand this is paying their bills but they hate the store and company as a whole. Like many company's they are being restricted by the infamous Affordable Heathcare so while they may have 30 regular employees working for the location, only 5-6 are receiving anything above 20 hours weekly. I've worked with 3 particular employees that have been with the company for 10-15 years and are being pigeonholed into their lower roles. The company has no problem switching around a few managers a year, sending one an hour away instead of recognizing their prize employees and promoting from within. They have the right idea about how the customer is always right (believe me...I've seen rusty patio furniture returned from 4 years ago, blenders with avocado puree still in it, trash cans with FULL bags...) they will literally take anything back but cannot afford to offer full time work or benefits to more than 5-6 employees at a time."
bad,"A typical day at work would include helping customers and straightening shelves. Pretty simple, almost too simple. I learned many things working there like how to suggestively sell items, make online orders, and run customer service. It was actually quite a fun job except the management. We were treated very poorly. We would be pushed to meet quotas that were outrageous, and when someone would meet the criteria they would raise it, almost double it. Then get upset with us when there wasn't enough customers interested in the item. They offered prizes and raises at first, but nobody actually received them. Eventually they got so bad that they said our jobs were depending on our sales, BUT we do not get compensation, only hourly. No benefits either. My old boss told me that I have to work 40 hours a week for 3 months straight to be hired on full time. I did so, hoping I would get benefits because I was living on my own. But she should schedule me for 3 months, full time but minus one week. She did this about two times and told me that since the ONE week wasn't full-time it starts over, but my overtime in the previous weeks wouldn't count? It was not pleasant working there, but the products and customers were fairly enjoyable."
bad,High management turnover rate.  No developmental plan for part-time associates.  Communication between district staff is broken.  It is nice to be able to take care of the customer no matter what.
bad,A typical day is getting to work and finding out what you will be doing for the day.It can be anything from cashier to working the sales floo or both..Bed Bath and Beyond educates there employees on the different products they sell which is a great learning experience.Management is ok at times it doesn't seem as if they are on the same page. Co Workers are great.Hardest part of the job is the lack of employees . The Company doesn't like lines at the registers yet when you call for back up everyone including management seem to be busy and ignore the pages.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers make selections.
bad,"Typical day at work : boring"
bad,"The company has little to no respect for its employees. Half of the employees are on a power trip, and are disrespectful to their coworkers. Management is constantly changing, you never know what to expect."
bad,"We worked like slaves. Period. Minimum wage pay with no breaks and an extraordinary amount of physical labor, customer service, and ridiculous expectations with ZERO appreciation."
bad,"Though I learned a lot from working at Bed Bath and Beyond, marketing, customer service, sales, the work was often far too much for the compensation given. Many employees worked for five years and received an increase in pay of one dollar. Management was often corrupt and reached the top through bargaining rather than hard work."
bad,As a manager you do all the work while associates and supervisors walk around. The store manager is clue less and doesn't have a clue on how to run a store. I'm very disappointed in my experience with this company.
bad,"no future, low pay, very hard to advance. people who have worked there for 4 or more years get paid very little. you stand all day or push a cart all day. its very hot during the summer."
bad,"I've learned alot of valuable skills that will benefit me while at future jobs. I learned to maintain excellent customer service skills while working in a fast paste enviornment. Ive learned to balance drawers, count tills, and close the store."
bad,"After over a decade I found that once you got into a management role, others on the same level would do what ever it took to make you look bad and them look good. Things as petty and disrespectful as criticizing your management style to the employees under you when you are not around. It is supposed to be a unified team, a store working toward the same goal. Nothing but gossip and favoritism.  Not all management is bad, unfortunately there are very few that actually care. Store Managers have too much to deal with that they really do not even know what is happening in the stores they manage. District staff is spread so thin they could not even help if they wanted too."
bad,"Bed, Bath and Beyond has been a mostly negative experience for myself. Although I get along with management, their inefficiency and unwillingness to open an honest dialect with their associates creates a large divide between the floor workers and the ones upstairs making an actual living. They rely on underpaid associates to do major projects, ranging from managing stock rooms to maintaining safety standards. Upper level management doesn't clearly understand safety and fully disregards standards, even if they promise they are all about ladder safety and having a spotter. We use disfunctional ladders and are forced to carry objects up to 50 lbs up a ladder without a spotter by management (they turn a blind eye to it and blame you if you get injured, but if you don't risk injury they reprimand you for not getting freight worked to the floor and put into our stock areas). As well, associates are blamed for not having training classes done when only one person per shift is designated to tend to the needs of all customers on either side of a store. Overall, I'd recommend not working at Bed, Bath and Beyond for your own saftey, well being and sanity."
bad,Work culture was good but not great. Management was just fine. No new opportunities to learn but extra hours to work. Hardest part of job was to make people work together.
bad,"A regular day working here is you have to greet/try to help literally every single customer. Regional manager does walks around the store and takes notes of who doesn't, and reports it to management, thus giving you basically a smack on the wrist. If you're a fast worker, you're going to be extremely bored working here. 80% of the time, you'll be recovering. The rest of the time, you're attempting to convince customers to buy things off bbb website(aka ""beyonds""), and climbing the heavy ladders to up/down stock merchandise. If you do well in your area, it gets over looked. No appreciation. They need to upgrade the technology desperately. The computers are so old, the employees are still literally using DOS. The registers are old and very slow. Some of the older employees are very rude, makes you not even want to do your job or ask them anything if you have a question. The younger employees who have been working there a while are really nice, helpful and funny. Hours are flexible but the amount always changes. Pay is not great for how much you bust your butt, sweating in lack of good ac.raise is at most 30 cents. Employee discount is 20%, same as customers if they bring in a coupon."
bad,Some people were nice but for the most part there were a lot of mean managers. I was thrown on overnights inventory and not allowed to leave for my lunch.
bad,"In my personal opinion, the amount of work is not worth the minimum wage. The discounts were the best part of the entire job. If you want to work there, just be prepared for a lot of physical labor, and very high expectations."
bad,Get in really good with the management and you will advance. They are big on playing favorites and unfortunately I'm not one. I have been there over a year and there has been no talk about doing a review in order to get a raise. I have mentioned it a few times and they just blow it off. It is a dictatorship
bad,"Depending  your shift there is Mandatory overtime, some managers are very rude. No air conditioning.  HR wont ever help you with anything.  If you dont have good rates they will fire you."
bad,"There is a lack of training and development to advance your career. Company has quick turnover because of a lack of willingness to change the culture. New hires expect a flexible company that allows you to work from home, enjoy summer fridays, and provide a steeper discount than the coupons distributed to customers. Too many initiatives, throwing everything against the wall to see which ideas stick."
bad,If you’re looking for a company that promotes “employees matter” this is not the company for you. Employees are last on the totem poll when BB&B makes any changes to/for the store. I’ve been with the company a looong time so I’ve observed a lot and what I’ve seen doesn’t encourage one to go “above and beyond”. I stay cause I don’t need to work but the job I’m doing is super easy lol.
bad,"I didn't like working for Bed Bath & Beyond. Two of the managers (including the store manager) treated me like I was an idiot half the time. The other two managers were nice though. The pay wasn't good, especially for how hard they expect you to work.  I did like the other employees though. They were always nice to work with."
bad,Good department Supervisor but that's it. Hot during summer. You go through a metal detector and if you wear a belt you have to take it off. . Upper management is in offices with A/C and heat but they screw employees who are working
bad,"Management are the laziness managers I have EVER experienced. The pay is awful and they expect your first born for it. Like other reviews, it is not uncommon to be short staffed. They go through employees like H20."
bad,"I worked for 6 (mid-November to December) weeks in a store in Florida. As we don't have the winter to fight with and the Christmas population explosion, I would have thought that I could get 30-40 hours per week instead of only 20-22. I had to threaten to quit to get  more hours per week. Instead of 22, I was moved up to 30 hours during the Christmas Season. I paid for it my accepting 8-hour shifts that meant standing (Cashier/Stocker) for 7.5 hours of the time with only 1/2 hour off for lunch. When stocking, this was not so bad. When cashiering, it was miserable when there was no one checking out. Many times I lifted mattress covers, etc. at 10-15 pounds into a basket. Many orders came to a total of $2,000+. I can't believe that this store chain is even surviving."
bad,They keep making major changes signaling that the company is fairing badly. I wouldn't be surprised if they started closing down some of their locations within the next year or two.
bad,Terrible company to work for. Consistently receiving conflicting information on things. Seniority apparently means nothing to them; giving new hires more hours than employees that have been with them since store set up. Cut people’s hours to as low as 4 hours a week. Don’t give their cashiers return codes so you are always waiting for a manager which makes it look like you can’t do your job and leaves customers annoyed.
bad,"I don't where to start!"
bad,"I would not recommend working for Bed Bath and Beyond. The first location I worked in was decent, I got along with the managers and I made friends out of coworkers, but the favoritism was apparent. I moved to a different store when I moved for school and that was possibly my worst decision. The management here is by far the worst I have ever encountered. The two managers that have higher positions are coincidentally the ones that most people have problems with. They are condescending, cliquey, and petty. They are not accommodating with you at all and will constantly battle your availability. The company also gives no benefits to part time workers, yet they still expect you to do the impossible with a low wage.  The employee discount they give you can be bought by customers for simply a $30 membership.  There are also little to no consistent hours between weeks."
bad,"This was easily one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Part of that may be the particular store, but regardless it was horrific. Very biased promotions, so much drama it felt like middle school, and the majority of my managers were a joke. Every Male I worked with was Very unfairly accused of some sort of harassment, in an attempt to make management strictly female (I Am a female) and several of those men chose retirement over dealing with the drama and accusations because it was always their word over a female coworker. I was always made to feel inferior any time I asked a question. I recieved Bare Minimum training and was never given the opportunity to move forward in my career; I was strictly a cashier for over a year. I would not recommend working at that place even if I were Paid to."
bad,"I worked there for over a year and the management was horrible. Managers didn’t really care about your problems and cared more about the customer. The pay was decent, it wasn’t the best. The coworkers and customers were friendly most of the time. Overall it wasn’t too horrible of a job, but the mangers was really what did it for me. The managers were disrespectful and didn’t offer much help or room to advance in the store."
bad,reason for leaving was I was in a car accident that resulted  in my car being totaled and the manager gave me two days to figure it out so basically was forced to quit or be fired
bad,"It is a very stressful atmosphere. They always find fault and rarely compliment. You only get 30 minutes for lunch and no breaks even though you stand all day and lift heavy packages. Women are expected to do everything that men do regardless of age....There is terrible communication. Job training is learn as you go as training is very poor...One is expected to know what to do even though you are not trained properly. Raises are horrible and yet they act as though they just gave you more than everyone else and that they did you a big favor. That is the ""only"" time that you will get a compliment, their attempt to make you feel special...Why have I stayed there? It wasn't always that way and frankly I need full time hours and benefits...I love doing our inventory and I enjoy the people that I work with and the customers..."
bad,I wished I had left earlier. I could have done much better for myself instead of being stuck during something I didn't care for with horrible hours and bad pay.
bad,The expectations of the job description are not fully explained so a lot is discovered as you continue working. The hardest part of the job is that nothing you do feels good enough
bad,"I was hired on the spot after inverviewing with both the store Mgr and the Opps Mgr."
bad,"If you're looking for something to bring in cash on the way to finding another job, I'd recommend it. They don't pay nearly as well as they should and their employees aren't priority."
bad,Worked for the company for almost 3 years as part timer and there is little room for advancement. The environment is extremely fast-paced and you do not get rewarded in any way for what you do besides a possible pat on the back. Stayed with the company due to one manager who helped guide me after hiring me and it is no longer worth staying there for as all the employees have become thoroughly unhappy going to work because of the changes in corporate. Only good for first time job seekers.
bad,"it is very cut throat at this store.  i personally did not have a good experiance working here. not only is it difficult to accomidate some of the difficult customers, and the managment can be very impatiant and degrading."
bad,"For as much effort as you may put in, it doesn't seem to go noticed. They don't care if you go above and beyond because they know they can find someone else to do your job if need be. When you do finally get a promotion they expect you to do so much for so little pay. Not worth the stress."
bad,It is a throw someone under the bus culture.  Advancement is based on if you are liked as a person rather than experience and knowledge.  The culture has evolved into an expectation without guidance culture.
bad,"Great if you need a job for a few months over the summer. However, having worked here for 2 years and having taken a key store role, I have had 1 raise, and new employees are being hired in at an increased salary. You are not recognized for your work. You are publicly humiliated in front of your peers for any small mistake. There is no consistency of management policy, the general manager over rules in every situation. Lastly, they cant keep employees, so your shifts are spread very thin covering large vacancies in the schedule."
bad,There is no work life balance at Bed Bath & Beyond.  They are truly an old-fashioned company where they do not believe in work life balance.  Bed Bath & Beyond has a lot to learn from these modern companies. They will never recruit top talent until they learn that work life balance is a very important aspect of a job.
bad,Owners and top execs not willing to take a pay cut in order to keep stores staffed. Horrible morale. Not innovative enough to compete with growing ecomm.
bad,They dont start you off at $11.50 if true then i want a raise! Thats just bogus! Well they're liars managers have favorites and some managers are clueless!
bad,"no thank you"
bad,"Eveyrday work at Bed Bath & Beyond Call Center is easy. Co-workers are very nice. Management sucks, the reason why they have high turnover rate..Pay could be better."
bad,This is not the best place. The culture has been getting worse and managment is under huge pressure for unrealistic goals.Work for Amazon.Save your time.
bad,"Okay workplace, not much training and threw people around in new positions a lot. they also didn't pay well enough to cover for all the positions they ask you to do such as sales associate, receiving, cashier, and floor-sets/visual merchandising."
bad,The hardest part of the job is getting help from supervisors. The break room had free soda machines and arcade games and quiet rooms. That was about the coolest part.
bad,You cant move up in this company. The management doesnt care about its employees. You basically do the managers job they sit upstairs most of the day just calling and barking down orders they never engage with the employess
bad,"Always work"
bad,"Management was terrible, they very seldom promote from within the company. It is pretty much your standard retail job, don't stay long term unless you plan on working a second job."
bad,They expect a lot from you without recognition. The pay is low. Hard to except new employees making more then you after years of working there. Would not recommend this for an enemy.
bad,"I really enjoyed working here, until I realized how rude the management was. Specifically one person who is in charge of the entire store, yet has such a rude attitude. When calling sick into work from the hospital the response I got was ""Great. Bye"" and she hung up the phone. This is why I do not work here. You lost an amazing sales associate!"
bad,"same thing, different day. micromanaged. short breaks. basic retail store experience from it. schedule well with part time students, pay wasn't all that great."
bad,They don't really care about you. You don't really get any good discounts. People come and go very fast. Lots of theft. Management is just out for themselves and will throw you under the bus.
bad,"Both as a manager and an associate, this was a very difficult place to work. As an associate, there are very, very few opportunities for advancement. They prefer to hire upper management from outside the company. That prompts most of the staff to not put forth their best effort since there is hardly any incentive to do so. "
bad,"With the exception of two of the managers, I found the upper level staff to be quite hostile and aggressive. They were unforgiving, did not provide adequate training and the store was understaffed."
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond was very much about customer service. My duties were to keep the store stocked, work the cash register, and order items on line. The company was really easy to navigate thru."
bad,No consideration of home life or hours worked.  Expectations were unrealistic as most of the scheduled hours as a manager were spent on a register or putting up stock.  No compensation or time given for actual job duties.
bad,"Pay their employees pennies, while expecting you to work your hardest. Not system in order, no disinclined for bad employees. Run their business like a chain gang."
bad,friendly and fast paced environment great co-workers staff was helpful family orientated safe work place low pay no benefits are ok
bad,Extremely sales driven though non commissioned. Minimum wage is  standard. No raises the first year. Full-time employees are largely management. High turn over rate. Not much room for advancement.
bad,I suggest working with HR directly...  Sometimes store managers can try to hinder your growth or movement within the company
bad,Management was horrible.  I had 3 boss's just on a daily pulling me in 3 different directions.  I also had 5 district managers telling you what to do as well.  They were not family oriented and did not care.  Would send you on ridiculous travels to different stores with no ample time to prepare.  It was just not a good place to work.  Excellent place to shop though.
bad,"closing routine: customer service for 5 hours, front facing and zoning for 2 hours (aisle recovery), dropping/filling for the last hour and a half. Usually a two to four man/woman team. Two managers that work during the day. One lead that works only morning shifts. Hour cap per week for part time employees does not go beyond 24.75 hours, while full timers get anywhere from 35-46 hours per week. No room for growth. Not what i expected from a fortune 500 company. Management plays favorites and it shows."
bad,"I love to multitask but there was no room for growth within the company.  I learned a lot working there, but management does not follow proper procedures."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, I like this job. They pay decent and the people I work with are great but I'm barely getting 10 hours a week which is extremely difficult to pay bills and groceries and the management have a personal issue with me."
bad,"The job is demanding. the day depends on the number of customers coming to the store, Managers do not care about you only the needs of the store and will force you to stay at work if you get sick and if you have a family emergency. You will learn how to deal with irate customers and managers."
bad,"I learned many skills relating to sales, merchandising, leadership, and customer relations, none of which I regret from my experiences at the store. The issue lies with the company promoting only department managers and above within the company ranks, leaving employees with hopes of gaining valuable work experience in any management role to seek elsewhere. "
bad,"Overall work place is awesome and everyone helps each others out. However, managers are usually unhelpful, unreliable and practacly unreachable."
bad,"I have worked there for about a month and am completely unsatisfied. The management is terrible and there is no communication whatsoever. I have to pry answers out of management before they give me any answers. Also, I am very disappointed in my many of my co-workers because a lot of them are very rude and condescending. If you have the option, don't work for this company!"
bad,"I have worked for this employer since Mid-2007, and have been a part-time associate since then. Hours for myself can range anywhere from twelve to thirty-nine per week, depending on when I am needed or how many new associates have been hired. Employee turn-around seems to be rather high."
bad,"it was slower than what I am used to. I was a cashier so was processing transactions on a daily basis with little error. The management was not that great, but the co-workers that I worked with were nice"
bad,"Typically a day at Bed Bath & Beyond consists of helping customers and restocking the sales floor. I learned great phone skills, customer service skills. Management are great to get along with, but don't consider the needs of the employee's who help build their business. Co-workers are pleasant and mostly enjoy work. The hardest part of the job is accepting minimal hours, especially when you only have this one job, yet have a mortgage and a family. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people find things they need to make their situations better, be it a bed spread or a toaster oven."
bad,"In overall the establishment wasn't that bad to work for. Very accommodating when it came to your work schedule, but very hard to move up in the company. To many revolving managers to report to each day."
bad,"You as an employee are exspendable here, your a dime a dozen. Uper management in store micro manange and treat their employes like worker ants and children. I worked here for almost 5yrs with nothing but continous argueing and having to defend myself and my fellow coworkers. If you got hurt on the job you'd get yelled at for it. I had a fellow coworker who feel off the ladder and they just got yelled at and was told to go home a change their clothes since they were ripped. You cut yourself on accident with a box cutter forget stiches your getting yelled and and a bandaid and sent back to work. They were not very flexable with hours, I've seen many of my coworkers quite since they wouldn't work with them on their college schedule. An extreamly high turn over rate to the point I couldn't get to know any new employees because they would be gone before I knew it. Lower management was nice they would try to have your back but head management would use intemadation tacktics so it was rare if they could ever do anything for you. Upper management would yell at you in front of customers and fellow employees. I even once got followed ou of the store on my break by the head manager. I got my job and my hours threatened on a continus basis by head manager and head manager in my dept. Over all not a healthy place to work, physically and mentally. I did get ahold of corporate when I worked there and they weren't very helpful either, they care more about the head managers then the little guys. Only bonus to the job are your coworkers and they train you well so you know all the products, I"
bad,No matter how good you do your job it is never good enough. Blood from a stone rings a bell.
bad,"i work sales floor and bridal consulting and cash register. the job itself isnt that bad. but the fact that ive worked there 2 years and i would bet all the money i've made there (which isn't much since if your lucky you'll get a 2% annual raise on that 8 an hour) that the regional manager (whom i see at least once a week) doesn't have a clue what my name is. but he will falsely accuse employee's of stealing, lying and cheating the store. really i just want to help the customers and have the management stop telling the employees (who work hard and do EVERYTHING for them) how much they arent needed. ha so over all, dont work here unless its you LAST resort."
bad,Very unorganized place to work. Oversized and confusing. They need to pay more.
bad,"it is an okay place to work however you have to do everything and management doesn't listen to you, not very friendly place to work up front, everyone can be rude."
bad,"Everyone is passive aggressive. pay sucks. they dont tell you that you are also a janitor, a sales person, in freight and replenishment. Management always threatening your job security."
bad,I was not happy with management and upper management while working for the company. I was constantly left alone up at the front or on floor with no one to cover a break for even the 12 hour shifts I'd work. It's ok for part time as long as you specify you only want to be in a certain position.
bad,The managers were very rude and judge mental and all they care about is getting customers money they treat employees very unfair and they are very rude
bad,"Been at the Saskatoon location since store set up, can’t ever do a return without a supervisor or manager present. Been over looked multiple times for a promotion. Been yelled at multiple times in front of customers. Expected to come in on my days off to work or my hours will get cut. I always put in 110% every shift. Never call out for work, never take days off because I need the hours. But instead of promoting a hard working, loyal employee, they promote someone who doesn’t even work half the time. So happy to be leaving this company. They’ll sink with good employees leaving. It’s a toxic environment. Don’t work here."
bad,"Was not told what shift I would  be working up front. I was just put automatically  in swing shift which was very difficult  for my family and I. There is very very small chance of being moved to a different  shift. I worked hard with nothing to show from it. My scores where high and they still could not help with my hours. I felt like minimum  effort was even made to help accommodate my shift. I enjoyed the job it's self, if I was able to I would have stayed. But management  did not seem to really mind if I stayed or left. Which to me is not good enough  for  a  big company  like BBB. They need to understand  and tell people what shifts they are hiring for instead of telling us to pick a shift and surprise they're all swing shift!"
bad,"Everyone thinks the discount will make this job worth it but I'm here to tell you it doesn't. The managers get snippy and rude, the customers are even snippier and even more rude, and you never ever have the specific shade of Burnt Beige curtain swags they want."
bad,"If you don't mind working hard, standing, walking, bending for long hours then this is the job for you."
bad,"The manegers are nice but dont care about the persons life , they always think you are lying , you work very hard and dont get as much as you work , they like to keep management  to themselves and dont give apportunities to grow unless they have no choice or because they like the person even if you are working very hard and understand more that the other people, they promise alot of stuff  but dont deliver as they promise,  you have to beg for your money at sometimes,  if you are hurt they dont care about you they care only about the job being done , unless they like ypu , not fair with everyone unless they like you .overall money only cares"
bad,"Sad to see how the company & culture changed over 15 years, & not for the better. Cut several key positions over the years to assist in loss of profitability & over the last 2 years drastically severed payroll leaving the extra workload to the few remaining managers, supervisors & leads; however, they maintained the same extremely high expectations which were impossible to meet & left you feeling defeated & exhausted on a daily basis. For managers who took pride in their work & departments , you would find your 10 hour day turn into a 11-13 hour day to try and accomplish what you couldn’t get done that day. Being salary left you without any extra pay for all those extra hours."
bad,"When I first started working at Bed Bath and Beyond it was great, but. then slowly thing started to get tense with management. I don't care for working there."
bad,"This company is attempting to save itself from certain demise. They're buying technology that I've used at jobs almost twenty years ago. The ship is sinking, and they're just not realizing that the end is near, and trying to still make sure that their customers get their 20% coupon on merchandise that is marked up 30-40%."
bad,"Management treats everyone differently, but collectively you are treated like trash. Some people are like the old gum at the bottom, others are like the pair of sneakers sitting on top that you know need to go but were just so hard to part with - but overall, you’re just garbage to them :-)"
bad,"A very challenging work environment. Company is failing to meet challenges in the retail sector. Solid financial foundation, but losing market share everyday."
bad,"this place always had bed bugs, the environment was dirty and the air was thick and muggy. The managers didn't care about their employees at all. Managers were selling items at their desk trying to make money on the side, very unprofessional."
bad,overall the management is very poorly. I mostly learned from the customers. I also felt that there was favoritism. the most enjoyable part of this part time job was helping out customers.
bad,"Bed bath and beyond  have no individuality or respect for their workers, I have heard the management complain and talk about the other coworkers to their subordinates many times they have no life and it is. Ot interestinf work at all"
bad,It won't be long before this company goes bankrupt and closes permanently. The managers are terrible. The customers are even worse. The employees that maintain the company are not appreciated.
bad,"In the beginning it was a wonderful job. Everyone would respect each other and we would all go about our days happy. Of course that only lasted 6 months. After working here for a entire year, constantly earning the most orders every week, personally earning that sest-pool thousands upon thousands of dollars. they currently have me at 4 hours a week after a full years of near full time hours. Completely without warning. So let me warn you ahead of time. Dont get comfortable if you do get hired and DO NOT think you're safe because the word ""seniority"" to them doesn't exist. Just one great example of this is New hires have complete seniority"
bad,The boss was nice at first but as time went on he showed his true colors. He favored all of his male employees a considerable amount and rarely took issues with other coworkers seriously.
bad,"This was a part-time, supplemental income job for me and worked mainly as a cashier in customer service. The company and management expect way too much from their part-time employees with pay being just a little over minimum wage. Often the store is very short-staffed and employee turn over rate is huge. As a cashier in customer service these were my duties: cashier, process returns, damage out items, answer incoming calls,  print out gift registries, get return carts out to the floor, keep the front end straightened, and tidy up the self serve free gift wrapping station. Oh yeah, and push the “item of the month” along with pushing various on-line services. Also if closing, customer service cashier is responsible for vacuuming the front end, changing out  the trash, and cleaning the bathrooms. Again, way too much for minimum pay and management who didn’t care."
bad,"I feel like bed bath and beyond is more of a job for people who are barely starting to work. The management at the location I worked at were horrible. Every shift I had, as soon as I got there I wanted to go home."
bad,"The best part of working here is the friends I have met. The bad part is, when they hire or promote an employee, they do not give them enough training. Most of the training is figuring things out as you go, which can be embarrassing when a customer needs assistance and you don't know how to help them."
bad,I started out being flexible with my schedule and when my mom got ill they were great fitting me in to a permanent position and time frame to give me the flexibility with my job there and at home.
bad,"Discount is same as customers discount, 20%. Company likes to keep employees part time so no benefits. Only 10 min breaks. Work is hard physically no matter what job taken."
bad,Everything depends on your specific location. My managers constantly changed. Work load was sometimes overwhelming. Trains you in customer service. Management also depends on location.
bad,bad hours. keep you later than they have you scheduled for. do not work with school schedules for college students. do not allow for time off for vacation even when told 6 months in advance when being hired.
bad,"I enjoyed working there.  But, there was not an opportunity to move up in the company We would heip stock but never got a thank you or that looks good.  You follow a main chart on decoration and have to follow."
bad,"Flawed company, very easy job, does not pay well and not enough hours. Fast paced work environment, very stressful dealing with returns and coupons with a bad computer system. No room for advancing for the right amount of pay."
bad,Everybody is overworked and stressed out! Managers are not taking responsibility for their actions. It's really tough customer talk to you anyway and you have to take it.... without anyone backing you up!! Glad I got out of the situation when I did!
bad,There weren't many pros to working at bed bath and beyond. Management could be very stubborn when would come to time off and requested sick days. One thing I enjoyed was for the most part there was a sense of independence which made working enjoyable if you like that. However it also means you cannot rely on most coworkers or management which I found almost every time I had a work related issue.
bad,"Typical Retail brick and mortar system. Rely to heavily on there hourly employees, and they're the first to be sacrificed when the numbers are to low."
bad,"Maintain and organize store inventory levels, and stocked sales floor; Enthusiastically interact with and assist customers with their product inquiries and purchases; Have vast product knowledge to assist customers with their inquiries and purchase; Professionally interact with store managers and other sales associates; Conduct sales transactions, and assist with front end responsibilities, including, but not limited to, opening and closing of registers."
bad,"Was hired as a picker. Orientation had nothing to do with job. Went in to work job and they tried to force me to work in another department doing a job I detest. They said it would only be for a couple of days. I told them I couldn't handle this particular job AT ALL and asked if there was anything else I could do. They said no because I was not in the system and there was no trainer where I was hired to work. I told them to call me when they got me in the system. So I am probably out of a job, but why the heck bring me in when I'm not in the system? Ridiculous. I will do almost any other job in that plant except for what they tried to force me to do. I ABSOLUTELY hated where they wanted to put me and why waste someone's time to train me on something that I'm not even going to be doing? Ridiculous and unacceptable"
bad,"Great place to learn different skill , good associates that was very hardworking . Manger was not always team players . Pay could be much better for the work you had to do"
bad,"Never felt more stressed and underappreciated. Management sucked, they didn't every do anything unless the higher up managers were there and yell at us for not getting our work and their work done. The managers would sit up in the office unless they absolutely needed to come down. They were constantly taking lunches up to an hour and a half and get angry when we had to go to the bathroom."
bad,The basics of it is is that bed bath and beyond is a first time job sort of place. You can't stick with the company due to terrible raises and unequal pay. The managing staff is either amazing or terrible depending on their mood while they expect you to be 100% happy like we are robots. The only thing that keeps you going is sometimes the coworkers are nice but that's because you all understand that life at that place is not the best
bad,Management is terrible. Too many people want to act like a manager and are NOT managers.  The company policies allow customers to do whatever they want and because of that customers come into the store rude and belligerent.
bad,NO thought for life management very poor on work for value i.e.pay and time off is critical to success of any one working. If one works more than 60 hours a week even salary labor should receive correct compensation.
bad,"it will keep you busy. i didn't really care to work there, the management kind of sucked, the store wasn't the cleanest it could be, but thats just my opinion"
bad,"If you want something relatively easy, and pays minimally, this job would totally work for you. The store I worked in felt like it was falling apart at the seams, but it meant no one really cared what you did."
bad,"Customers are a nice aspect of working here. Mainly nice older women who love to chat. The general manager is good at handling conflict, but the women managers are so prideful it ruins what could be a friendly atmosphere. They step on each other's toes and push their way around everywhere like lions in a den. "
bad,"Wouldn’t go back , wouldn’t recommend to anyone not even if it’s your first job rather work somewhere else they don’t really care about the hours they give you"
bad,Worked at bed bath and beyond for 5 years. Hated everyday after the 1st year. People are held to different standards than others. No clear objective. Key holders just sit in the back and don’t support the the  supervisors. A highschool atmosphere.
bad,"Most of my experiences with co-workers was fine but still mostly felt aggressive. Even on 4 hour work days it felt like a lifetime, and I come from working 12-16 hr shifts at a prison and it was fine."
bad,The job is average you wok a little bit over here and a little bit of there. I don't like the unfairness that comes with the little branches of that company basically it sucked after three months of working there dues to the bias judged culture of bbb.
bad,Manager does not like when people use the bathroom.  Even if there is some type of issue that warrants trips to the bathroom.  District manager has the same attitude.
bad,Sometimes the day was great and meet interesting people.Many times customers would talk down to you because they think their better than you because their age or that they have better jobs that you.
bad,"Work you to death, Work saturdays and sundays. long hours in a warehouse alone. I was the supervisor so if someone called in sick I would have to go in and cover for them.  We have to approved orders and make sure that there wasn't any fraud"
bad,"When I 1st started here, it was room for advancement. Now everyone is trying to leave. Managers included. They dont care about its employees and they lie to try to and keep you motivated. They are sneaky and really dont care what you are going through. It's not a hard job but people (management like WFM) Make u hate it. Overtime was a big thing, now they dont even try...if you are thinking about coming here...do yourself a favor and DON'T...btw even I'm looking to leave as we speak."
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a fast pace environment that is a fun place to work. The people are friendly and will work as a team, not saying there is no problems but the type of managers the problems are solve quickly. It is a place for advancement with hard work. I enjoyed working at Bed Bath & Beyond, but do to medical reason i was no long able to work in that type of environment."
bad,"Great company to work for, only issue being that there is little room to grow. Great opportunity to merchandise and create ownership of displays and setups."
bad,"Displays a practical approach to solving problems"
bad,its an ok short term job but their raises are low and they don't reward for working harder so everyone does the bare minimum. I spent about 5 years there and they kept leading me on about promotions and they would never act on it. I felt very under paid for the work I was doing and how much I was able to contribute. I liked the job itself and never would have left but I felt like I would never make a living wage unless other managers quit. (which I didn't feel like hanging around for 2-4 years waiting for that to happen)
bad,"Typical day is trying to complete a project while giving your attention to all the customers working at the same time.  Micro-managed, customer is always right kind if place.  There would be times a nice customer shopping would make you smile, but other than that I left with a headache 90% off the time. Don't forget the coupons!!"
bad,Oversight of tax compliance and general accounting related to sales & use. Handled audit reviews and general correspondence related to department. Reported directly to senior management.
bad,hard work on your feet all day.. great job for college kids looking to earn some extra cash... as with any retailer now days its hard to get good help with the hours alotted
bad,Poor management from the district level through the regional level. They are not in touch with the reality of the stores and the current working conditions.
bad,"The environment at bbb was number driven and not conducive to customer satisfaction.  While I spent 10 years with the company, they evolved into numbers and not people. There is more to life than making profits."
bad,I've been here for over a year and was offered a 25 cent raise and I asked for 10.00 and they didn't even want to give me that but told me all the time how great of a worker I was
bad,"As most companies it all depends on who they have running the show, at BBB I’ve seen great mgrs and the worst, it’s typical that most corporations don’t know who they hire in terms of bullies and A holes as management"
bad,The pay is very low for the job duties.  The pay just a little over minimum wage and you'll end up working just about every job in the store.  A lot of customers are nasty too.
bad,You would do retail related activities such as walking around saying hello to every customer and be so nice and kind that hopefully they will buy more products.
bad,"During my time at BBB I can honestly say that the daily routine was monotonous and made me dread going into work. Everyone starts at minimum wage, ignoring the fact that I had college loans to pay off. Bad overall vibe of company."
bad,A typical day at BBB greed customers taking returns answering phones giving refunds placing online orders cashing out customers assist customers on the floor direct to the proper department.
bad,"everyday work was very hard but I got through it, I've learn a lot of people skills, costumer service skills and product knowledge. it is an enjoyable place with good work people. hardest part was changes but I got through it with a good team."
bad,"Bed bath & beyond was my first job and by far my worse, wasn't used to rude co workers rude managers, very unfair, quick paced on weekends slow weekdays, little pay for too much work"
bad,"everyone out for self, you rarely see people move up in the company and they will put 100 jobs on you while store leads stand around and do nothing i just dont understand"
bad,"The hours were not flexible at all. I had to beg and constantly ask my manager for extra hours at work because the money was needed. They constantly hire new poeple, and always cut back on the old workers hours."
bad,"too much turnover, no work life balance"
bad,I have been with the company for over a year and have never been complimented with my efforts or deeds. I have gained experience in customer service and learned about home products. The part of this position that I enjoy the least is the amount of time that you have to put in for days off. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to please the customer.
bad,Managers push the staff too much and don't do any work. Equality seems to be hard to find. There is no chance on advancing or progressing in the company. Not a place to go work unless you are desperate for a job.
bad,a typical day at work was very hectic. To much tasks to do and not enough people to work. To many managers on duty in one day and not enough support for workers when difficulties arise. Not enough workers to work in the store daily and had to do Janitorial duties every night. Being told you did a good job but you could have done better. Had to greet and escort every customer to right department made finishing tasks given to you hard. Answers phones for managers and district managers. Being reprimanded by managers if stressful situations arise and blaming store policy instead taking blame on there faults. Having to do others peoples tasks that didn't get finish on time.
bad,"The typical day would go,"
bad,"I had worked here several months until I had decided that I could not work here for a long period of time. I worked as a sales associate and cashier. The job allowed for a great amount of experience and it got me other jobs in retail also. Yet, management needs a lot of work. The problem was due to my advancement as a sales associate in need of broader skills in the store."
bad,"At first being hired based on experience alot of us were brought in to build a core team. The company was glorified as being a great place to learn and grow. Had plenty of opportunity to learn but there wasnt much attention to supporting and setting employees up for success. As receiving manager i had a huge workload which was no problem for me but with lack of support from upper management there was no way of getting everything done, being a manager below the upper level team meant i had no say in anything. My work was not important at end of day but would still get blamed for everything. Also first year was great, was given plenty of extra responsibiltiy including store openings and staff training, was being finessed to become next ops manager until my current ops manager at the time neglected to do his job and i was thrown under the bus even after he admitted to lack of training me. After that i was treated like a sore thumb no matter how hard i worked and the great reputation i had with co-workers and fellow department managers, upper management belittled my every move. Saw this happen to other associates/managers not only at my store but others as well. Note to company: leave your american managers in america, the canadian retail culture does not need nor appreciate their back stabbing, iron fisted ruling. You lose alot of great hard working people that way."
bad,Company was in stage of flux when I was there.  Main office cleaned house of top management at local level in store I was in and had temporary management for one and a half years while getting things straightened out. No benefits except for a handful of positions because only those few are in full time positions. All sales and customer service employees are only part time.
bad,"I thought this was going to be a dream job. I had been pulling 18 hours days and doing many overnights to get the new concept started. I was supposed to run the entire department (food and wine)."
bad,Personally I could not wait to switch jobs out of this particular line of work. I could not enjoy myself or put myself fully into this job because it was a terrible working environment. After the managerial change within the store it all went down hill.
bad,"Bed bath and Beyond is not a bad company. I have been with the company for five years. I have worked at three different stores within the company for school purposes. I believe that one of the particular stores I worked for the management could have been of higher quality when it came to how to talk to employees, scheduling, and understanding of personal circumstances. I enjoyed my co-workers at each store. A typical day at work is either working at customer service helping customers & being a cashier or, working on the floor stocking products as well as helping customers. The hardest part of the job is working long hours in the evening getting off at 11 p.m. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers. There is not mush room for advancement. That is one of the features I did not like."
bad,At first working there is alright then it turned into a terrible place to work with a lack of proper leadership and the negativity of staff and managers. The size of product to the size of the store ratio is ridiculous and the assumption that the product will be reasonable to locate is ridiculous. With mass amounts of product and low staffing it is hard to locate everything also the store was well overstocked. Being an associate would have been better if the leader would do his job and not act as if things were not his problem and the store had a larger more capable staff.
bad,"A typical day at work, is answering phone calls an helping customers any way you can. Management was ok, my supervisor was great. My manager and team leads were horrible. Of course when you start a new position there are still a few things to learn, so you ask questions. The team leads i had were very unprofessional, rude,loud there is no other way to put it. They were sometimes even rude to customers & the manager knew that but nothing was ever done. My co- workers were great we help each other every chance we get, we usually ask one another for help or to check something if we are tied up istead of the tem lead who are there to help, but just sit there and shoot the breeze all day. the hardest part of my job was coming in, from the negative work environment it will cause anyone stress and anxiety. the most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers we all got along like a big family. Other then that the job was ok. Glad i left."
bad,very poor structure  mgmt. don't follow your schedule you work always past ur schule time and sometimes get days cut without notice
bad,Co workers are easy going and work as a team. Managament can not delegate needs to work on communication skills. Needs to be more relaxing environment to stressful.
bad,Great part time job for students. I don't recommend this job for someone who is trying to make a career out of it or support a family unless you are in management. Moving up in the company is difficult.
bad,"Just a job, there isnt anything really great about it. Working in retail has its good days and bad. A typical day at work would be helping customers and putting out product. The management can be good or bad. Has its days. Its only a part time job but they schedule you in the middle of the day. might as well be full time. Hardest part would be working with difficult customers. The most enjoyable is when you clock out. This is not somewhere i want to be long term."
bad,"The job is not bad to work at it can be very productive. However, the environment is not professional. A typical day at work can be drama filled at times"
bad,The people were great to work with. I loved the customers and the products. the atmosphere was good and the managers were very helpful
bad,long hours there are times you work from opening to closing to set up the store. the customers are not nice at all.  and they treat mangers like they are slaves
bad,great opportunity to provide good customer service. Not really room for growth but a opportunity to better your customer service.
bad,Since orders are placed for the most part at store level you really learn how to be a true business owner. The average raise for managers is only 2% annually so factor that in when negotiating your salary when you start. There is NO option to bonus.
bad,"This is a place where you will always be busy, and not be recognized for a job well done. When being promoted it was said that the words ""good job"" will never be said again and that the new term will be ""what could be done to make it better."" Most of the workers there are great people, enjoyable to what i have come across, but management not so much."
bad,"It is an alright place at first, just not enough people to enjoy the job. The management is pretty good, they're very nice. Easy to learn environment."
bad,"the days working their was great. I learned 2 new languages and learned everyone had a different taste."
bad,"Work / Home life balance is horrible. There is little to no training before they give you keys and send you out of the ""training"" store. If you are in a low volume store, you are expected to be everything from a cashier to stock person. Often times, you are the only manager in the building with 2 other associates. Yet, you are still expected to do the work of a 5 person team. The upper management does not listen to any ideas to make things better. Most store managers act as if they are better than you and no matter what you do......its always wrong. The company starts managers out in a designated ""training"" store that is typically close to your home. These stores are high volume and therefore have a ton of staff to run the building efficiently. Then they will give you a ""promotion"" (which is just giving you keys to a store that is typically 2-3 times further than you are currently driving) with no raise. Your new store is typically a low volume store with lots of problems. The problems stem from not having enough payroll to properly staff the store. It is literally the WORST retail company I have ever been a manager for. If you enjoy your family and like to be happy at work......DO NOT APPLY."
bad,"Product knowledge"
bad,A typical day at work at Bed Bath & Beyond was unpredictable. I learned all the departments on store level. The senior management team was supportive when they could be but their demands and the pressure they were under out weighed their free time to develop and coach. The co-workers were PHENONOMAL! More than the majority of the time there was literally no staff on the sales floor during peak business hours. The comradery built among co-workers to help each other get through some difficult days was about the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,I work in receiving of Bed Bath and Beyond. Which means I get in all the freight. I unpack all the freight and price everything that needs to be priced. I have learned cashiering and stocking shelves. The management at Bed Bath and Beyond is alright. They are very hard to communicate with. My coworkers are good people and are fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of my day is making a customer happy.
bad,Although they say that they promote within there were never opportunities to grow.  I wanted more out of my position therefore I decided to move on.
bad,mostly was training when i wasnt training i was supervising the sales floor
bad,"Provides great scheduling flexibility in a ""low-stress"" environment"
bad,"Good workplace"
bad,Raises are horrible...below .50 cents per hour per year.  Not alot of sick or vacation days in a year.  Too many crazy rule and someone always looking over your shoulder.
bad,Great started job for people just getting out of school I learned a lot bout people working there
bad,When i worked here I felt like I wasn't trained enough for a lot of the problem i ran into along the way. The managers would be too busy to come up to the register because they were assisting brides and I would end up having to figure things out on my own. But this would be a good place to work if you have a lot of experience in retail.
bad,"BBBY talks a good game about customer service but ultimately the job, even for managers, is about putting away freight.  There are few reports to help manage the business, no real metrics to review and no real plan to follow for merchandising.  Part of that is just retail, but the fact that they don't have a plan to begin with makes it more frustrating.  If you are a manager good luck getting any of your work done during your 50 scheduled hours; you'll be floor coverage and putting out freight.  Have to come in on your own time to do the job they pay you for. If you're considering working for them, get into as high a volume store as you can.  Medium and low volume stores have no payroll so the above statements are more true than higher volume stores; which will typically have a few extra supervisor/dept mgr level positions that take some of the burden off of the 4 key holding managers in the building."
bad,"Go in and immediately start handling the stores merchandise. Great customer service skills, that was one of the ways we handled store theft. No comment on management. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was getting a schedule that was a balance between work and home life. The best part of the job was interacting with the different store patrons."
bad,"was expected to do everything with very little help. managers were never to be found, and very few people worked, just enough to staff the floor"
bad,the company was nice and had ok benefits for managers. i worked hard.  but i needed to find work in my field
bad,The management team is unwilling to listen to other ideas. They really dont care about thier associates
bad,"I had been working at BBB for 2 years. Showed up on time for the most part and rarely called out. The managers were strict to begin with, but then they brought in these managers that had no idea what the company's expectations were and tried to boss around the workers who had been there 1yr+. They also hired a bunch of idiots who thought we were just going to babysit them. I finally walked out bc a manager had told me that I did not have to work there if I did not like it."
bad,Customer Service
bad,"A day of work is a day of labor, but always kept the great satisaction to the customer and never satisfied the employees. Therefore, their was no unity and no progress."
bad,"They are always doing interviews because the turnover rate is so high, which says a lot about how the employees are paid and treated. Granted, the turnover is high in most retail jobs but at the store I worked at it was outrageous. We had people the management made quit in less than one week on several occasions. No one in their right mind would do the jobs of ten people in five hours while being talked down to like school children the entire time."
bad,"Work has its busy or slow days, at the store is all about customer service at all times we greet, assist, make references, sell items, use computers, consult bridals, make coupons adjustments, use a cash register. I learned how to communicate with people. Save customers money with coupons, management is strict. The co-workers at Bed Bath and Beyond and I have a fair relationship. The hardest part of the job is to stock and climb latter, best part of the job there is interacting with people and learning of products."
bad,Too much was going on store manager choose his favorite when it came down to promoting worked very hard and felt slighted.
bad,"Managers vary based on their experience with other companies. Pay is decent for retail, but do no expect benefits unless you are looking for a management position. They are very frugal, so they tend to extend giving people better compensation for as long as possible. The very best raise you can get is 3%, and that is not very often. Great if you are in school, not if you want a steady job or a career."
bad,"As an Assistant Manager, expectation is to get it done without cost. DM & Co. expectations are borderline outrageous. Payroll budget & schedule hinders accomplishing tasks. This entails 50-60 hour work week, with little time for a personal life. Managers are freight team, putaway team & floor coverage for 25-30 hours a week. Does not allow time to audit, merchandise and work in your department on a regular basis. Strong resolve needed. Pay is co-effecient ( 40 hrs at a set rate with all other hrs. at OT rate.) Great but minimum expectation is 52 per week. Systems are at least 10-15 years behind, so it does slow down processes."
bad,I have worked here for 3 1/2 years and have never worked in such a toxic environment. Managers are rude and the other associates just dont care. Staff does not keep up to task with yearly reviews nor well being of any associate.
bad,"Management was very friendly but turned a blind eye to alot of issues. Cashiers were awful. They would always be on thier phones and video chat in front of customers. Very rude and often would talk negatively about customers/co-workers in front of customers. When I worked on the sales-floor I was often told to just attend to customers, never actual tasks. Ended up quitting because I was being harrassed by co-workers in front of customers."
bad,"Second retail job, not new to work but this killed my drive for a bit, management can be good at times but the systems in place and the clutter they call a stock room makes it hard to be helpful to people and makes you look like a fool, i worked here years ago when i was in HS so im sure they improved a bit but don’t expect a career here if you dont work for corporate, lousy pay too in my time there, just not a fun time."
bad,"Stressful, little hours. People come and go constantly. Coworkers talk behind each other’s backs constantly. Horrible pay. Only 20% off discount... like the customers get? But they will work with you on your schedule! Never enough employees. They cut hours a lot. Customers can be cruel, (but that’s just retail.) If you work hard you can advance, but most likely won’t be offered full time... And they avoid paying you more.."
bad,Dont do it... not worth the headache.  Worked here 6 years and only received a $2 raise ... within that time ... started part time finished as a fulltime department manager
bad,"This job is okay if you're trying to get experience and learn from your mistakes. The work is not bad, it keeps you busy and you learn some skills that are applicable to other jobs. You do have to answer the phone, label and send back the damaged merchandise, cashier and act as customer service all for minimum wage. I loved my coworkers and we'd get to joke around and enjoy our jobs as long"
bad,"At first the company was a great place to work. Managment changes all the time. What one says to one, then the other will tell u something different. Including upper staff. District people."
bad,"The company thrives on paying less than the market salary competition. A lot of promises, but so little to offer. Promotion from P/T to F/T was easy, just work fast & smart. F/T to supervisor took 4 months then 6 months to a financial increase that isnt sufficient. After taking LOD , empty promises and no financial growth.  There are also made up titles to give power to those less paid. That is a road to disaster."
bad,Fast paced environment where mgt doesn’t support their employees it was difficult at times working when it was busy. They never seemed to have enough help on the Front End of the store
bad,"Typical day is very fast paced, being pulled in six different directions, which is what I liked that and helping customers. It is a very physically demanding job. Lots of lifting and lots of climbing very poor Management training was left to figure it out on your own if it wasn't for the physicality and the poor management I probably never would have left"
bad,Great job as a first job.. management is NOT THE BEST but if you're on top of things then it could be easy to avoid any need for help.. seek others for guidance.
bad,I would not recommend working here. The company used to have advancement and fair work ethics. About 6 years ago it changed. Lost site of caring and developing their associates. Customer service within the store became fake. Even to the point of racial mistreatment from customers and the associate had to just take it. It made you hate helping customers.
bad,"If being helpful and working in a fast pace environment is what you love bb&b has it. Ladders, heavy lifting, assisting, lack of training for everything except the registers. Yeah it will make you strong if you can handle it"
bad,"they train you well and the co-workers are nice. management however is rude and almost unapproachable. ultimately it was the bad managers that made me want to leave. as a university student working 15-25 hours a week was pretty good, and if you're a good worker they do ask you to stay later/fill in for other people's shifts sometimes."
bad,"I’m not sure if other retail companies treat their employees any better, as Bed Bath & Beyond is the only retail job I’ve had. I worked for the company for two years and while I had some good experiences, the company itself is a joke. They only give their employees a 20% discount, which is the same as the coupon they mass produce to customers. Their annual raises for part-time employees are 20 cents whether you’re the best employee they’ve ever had or not. They pay you less than competitive companies yet expect you to do 3+ jobs in 1. If you’re hired as a sales associate you’re expected to assist customers, get orders, push freight, clean/organize your designated department, clean the bathrooms, sweep the floor, get carts, etc. all in a 5 hour closing shift for about $9 an hour. If you’re lucky, the 1 other associate they scheduled on the floor will be there to help you but usually they’ll call in and there won’t be a replacement because they’re always short handed. If you work customer service, good luck. They’ll let customers take advantage of their return policy in any way possible. Doesn’t matter how old and disgusting the product is, they’ll return it with or without a receipt. I’ve returned things from used toilet lights to greasy pans. If they stopped letting customers take advantage of them, maybe it would compensate enough for them to treat their employees better. They cut hours extremely often, one week you may get 30 and the next you’ll get 15. They also have no problem scheduling you 6 closing shifts in a week when they’re short handed. Anyways, not a bad job if"
bad,"Management is weak here overall the whole company, they are so greedy with money. They do not give benefits to anybody unless you've been in the company for over 10+ years and get turned into a manager. People come and go so quickly due to poor management. They are constantly hiring because nobody want to work for this ungrateful company."
bad,"If you don’t mind never having the schedule you asked for and working with hostile co workers that want you to feel small this is the place for you. Just like many department stores, it’s a failing business. Policy’s are always changing because of that, which is hard for customers to understand. Another huge issue for me was the staff, managers were ridiculously rude and never gave the hours employees asked for, unless they had been with the company for years. Our caishers were treated the worse, again mangers allowed customers to walk all over them. Also our employee discount was only 20%, which if you know bb&b that’s literally what we give to every thing customer. Working at bb&b is terrible, but a job is a job."
bad,Management Team are long term employees of the company and lack vision or strategy on how to structure departments or implement strategic solutions. They hire competent  and knowledgeable staff with experience but do not promote tor advance their career.  They keep the long term managers in place even though they are not qualified for the leadership position.  They attempt to do re-orgs with the same management at the top and shuffling resources to different teams.  I do not think they realize that its not the teams failing its the management leadership failing.
bad,"It is such a retail job that varies greatly on how good your manager and coworkers are that it is hard to tell for every store. But most customers are old people who can either be crotchety or nice, and your coworkers are a coin toss. Managers vary, but don't expect yours to talk about giving you raises."
bad,Bed Bath and Beyond is a nice company. but the management is bad. They do not care about their employees as much as they should . They should get better management because people would stay longer.
bad,Overall might be a decent place as a first job or starting place to build work history but the pay is very low even for full time (ie. not enough for anyone to live off of)
bad,"Lots of work to do in a single day, usually can't get every task completed due to lack of time, and expectations. Management can be friendly, but usually don't understand the workload. Co-workers are friendly and caring people, usually content to keep to their own departments."
bad,The experience for the most part was positive although the work environment became very toxic and unhealthy for me personally. I enjoyed the experience and learning curves BBB had to offer.
bad,I initially switched positions shortly after starting due to a disrespectful coworker. To my dismay I ended up with another abrasive coworker who I have a difficult time working with. I've learned a lot about how to deal with difficult people.
bad,"During my time at Bed Bath & Beyond, I had to work twice as hard to make up for the slack that others would leave, causing my to almost work myself to exhaustion multiple times. There are also people constantly talking behind your back, even if they say they are your friends."
bad,I enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with. Some of the management had communication issues but overall dictated work accordingly. The work requires some hard labor when working the freight side of and great customer skills when working the sales floor. Customer interaction is essential in your succession in this work environment. Knowledge of inventory aides in your asdistance with customer experience.
bad,"I thought this would be a fun place to work, but throughout the years this place opened my eyes and saw what kind of environment I was in. Management/employees favorite people, not enough employees, management listens to a complaint you have towards another employee, but doesn’t do nothing about it. Wouldn’t recommend working here. Having to clean up your work area after others knowing you didn’t make the mess. Ask too much from you but get nothing in return."
bad,"It's good for retail work but that's about it. I would only recommend working here if you really need to due to financial need. while this is a Nation-wide company, the technology is substandard and has a high turn over rate due to the very poorly trained management teams."
bad,"Never expect the company to defend you in any way no matter how right you are. We've had customers spit in associates faces, pillows thrown in faces, and have been cursed out by customers. Management always finds a way to make it your fault and what you can do better. ""Its all about perception"" they love to say. Now I understand that the customer is always right... but when it comes to your own employee being assaulted don't expect the respect and the sympathy you deserve. it is a good job in the sense of getting you buy, but definitely not long term. being disrespected gets old. Another thing that is frustrating is always being late to breaks. I understand the business needs come first but its unfair management makes sure they get a break on time and even take small breaks during there shift while being on the clock. Now the store in Gainsville is lenient in the sense of childcare and calling out I have to say, they are very understanding. hours very seasonal as most retail jobs, but overall I would not recommend this place to work for long term."
bad,"Not a long term job but good for a high schooler. A lot of ladder work and freight , but overall not a bad place to work. also not alotof opportunity to move up in position"
bad,"Be prepared to work long and always on your feet. This job requires that you stand and walk for long periods of time, climb up and down  ladders, carry a lot of merchandise/stock, work fast, give over and beyond exceptional customer service and have a lot of stamina."
bad,"You could work hard and take all the attitudes from the customer but management doesn't care about that. They only care about what you did or say to customers if even the customer is wrong. in order to move up in the company, you needed to be able to brownnose to every manager everything day even if they're wrong or don't know how to communicate with others and make sure the customer always gets what they want."
bad,"After being hired under a previous manager, new managers came over and there was issues with how they handled employee affairs. They choose favorites and started scheduling employees against availability among other things."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Stressful hours, changing schedules, and unfair treatment was very common. I would not refer others to this specific job unless they just absolutely needed money."
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond is okay. It's pretty stressful. Personally, I was never fully trained to do anything other than register. I won't speak ill of the place, it just isn't really for me."
bad,Didn't work here very long but they never scheduled anyone enough hours. It involved a lot of heavy lifting. I faced shelves and displays which were the hardest part of the job imonly ever worked a few hours a day
bad,"on a typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond, I receive and process incoming freight and new merchandise to make sure it hits the sales floor for our customers."
bad,"Upper management (senior and above) just looks at numbers. Employees are not a factor any more. they just let thousands of managers go to save money. Company is becoming directionless, leading to low sales, poor customer service, and general apathy from employees."
bad,"At Bed Bath and Beyond, there is no culture, the management is upset just by working there and it made the days drag on. I would not recommend working there."
bad,"horrible place to work. rude customers. breaks don't come on time or no break at all sometimes. ""The customer is always right"" policy for ex: a customer can return a 8 year old item at your store, even if they didn't buy it at BBB, as long as it comes up in the system or you can find a UPC for it. The customer will 20% less the current value on store credit. Absolutely ridiculous!"
bad,I loved my position but am not happy about working 4/5 weekends when single people with no commitments didn't work weekends or evenings as much! Managers had their favorites and if you didn't fit the criteria you got shafted on days off and scheduling unfairness!
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a stressful company to work for. People are not held accountable to their job requirements, There is little room for advancement. The workplace culture is such that everbody's deadlines are so tight that the business falls apart easily due to overwhelming expectations and subsequent finger-pointing among associates."
bad,Theres not a whole lot of positive things that i can say about this company and the way they treat their employees. supervisors and management team are disrespectful and treat you like garbage. If you enjoy being a robot and not having any freedom then this is the place for you to work.
bad,It is a great place if you are looking for something that is only part-time and don't require a lot of money or benefits.  Its fast paced and exciting but sometimes too repetitive.
bad,I honestly tried to get back on mostly because it can be fun working there and the pay is good but Human Resources screws you over big time thanks to them and something stupid i caint work there ever and wasnt even nothing bad a mis understood no call no show when i had actrually resigned and signed the papers
bad,corporate didn't really care about their employees; they are replaceable.  Working in a department was hard enough but try working the closing shift being in a department
bad,"The entire company seems to be a mess. They say they promote from within, but all management seems to be hired from outside the company. The lower employees that have been there for years are responsible for training new management instead of managers training new management. The company promotes ""PerkSpot"" which is supposed to be this great online profile you can use to get all kinds of discounts for hotels, phone service, rental cars... etc. However, you can get better deals on Groupon and Hotels.com. The management gives you unrealistic deadlines for outstanding projects during the day when you are supposed to be focusing on customer service, but then scold you for the projects not getting done or for not meeting sales. Every manager has different expectations and other managers scold you for doing things their way. Management also claims to want to work with you on scheduling for school or for second jobs, but then don't adhere to your availability posted on your online profile which causes scheduling conflicts and act like it's your own fault."
bad,Most days I would process returns and manage lunch breaks. I learned customer service skills and management experience. The management team was always changing and was never consistent. The hardest part of the job would be how little I was getting paid for the amount of responsibilities I had. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the opportunity to learn more.
bad,expected to work all hours of the day and cover gaps in coverage from absent employees.  high level of stress with very little sense of appreciation and belonging
bad,On a typical day you will assist with customers. Management allows employees to grow in a fast pace environment. They give assistance when you may not know enough about a product. The hardest part of the job is freight during the holidays. The most enjoyable part was the work culture.
bad,"If you like working short staff, this is the place. There are a lot of wonderful people working here but it can be stressful. Most work part time and advancement in the company takes a long time. If this type of customer service is your cup of tea, then I would recommend you go for it."
bad,"While the different sections in the store bedazzled me, I didn't really appreciate the lack of management. They were present in the building, but always in the office above unless pressing issues came into play. It might be other people's cup of tea but the job was just not right for me. I enjoy ideas for my living space and countless gadgets to use in the kitchen but the overworking with unjustified pay (in my opinion) was not something I wanted to stick around with for a long time."
bad,"This job was fun because of fellow employees, and the insurance was pretty good, but all of that still did not make it a worth- while job due to the Management, very petty, no advancement, want something for nothing. Hr is just as bad as local management, disputes were dismissed, very unprofessional."
bad,"A typical day starts with stock replenishment followed by a morning meeting to discuss the plans and projects for the day. During Store hours most of your time is spent greeting and assisting customers, processing online orders ringing transactions. Those at customer service ring returns and exchanges. The evening is spent putting away new shipment and recovering the store. Tills are counted at the end of the night."
bad,"Typical day is constant work not very fun, stressful because it was always understaffed, the management is decent, some more than others, I have caught one of the managers on facebook at least three times, but yet you're always supposed to be constantly working, and for as long as i had a constant schedule they start messing with it and don't give you a heads up because it's ""your  responsibility to check it"""
bad,A typical day would depend on the mood of the manager. She would micro manage from her office and pull you for other things just to yell at you later for not getting your stuff done. The Co- workers were awesome! Bed Bath stopped promoting from within several years ago. All the managers at my old location came from different company's. During my time there I only saw 2 people promoted from within. Definetly a good place if you going to school or retired and looking for some extra money.
bad,"They have a good associate training and development program, but drop the ball with management development. They shoot from the hip a lot, but they expect calculated and extremely impactful results.  They will promote you, but have been known to and will screw over some of their hardest working managers and employees."
bad,"It started off very great working there. Over time, you realize it's not great at all. As a cashier I had to iron drapes and shower curtains, build displays (small & big) while answering phones and checking out customers."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working along side my coworker's and customer. Great benefits!!!! Great benefits!! Great benefits.
bad,"Honestly if you really need a job then yea this is the place for you, but they are constantly losing people because the management likes to harass the employees.  You will receive absolutely no help from anyone in human resources if you try to complain about a manager, which is why I was fired"
bad,"* A Typical workday varies, Schedule is never set . Shifts and amount of hours vary week to week.Shifts on average are five hours long although they have been as short as four and as long as ten with no consent. I walk the sales floor and assist customers with purchases and products.I  am pressured to sell items via an online service constantly. I tend to do other various ""handyman"" tasks as well as the work of managers and other co workers"
bad,"Whether this job is tolerable or not will have a lot to do with if they have decent management at a specific store.  "
bad,"For being an inside job, it really will teach you the meaning of hard work. I enjoyed it for the most part, but when I realized there was literally no way for me to advance to ANY higher position WITHIN STORE.. that's when I realized this wasn't the job for me. I would work hard every day to the point of exhaustion and was only making $7.50 with no hope to advance.. When I found a second job, my managers refused to work with my new schedule that they cut my hours bad enough that it ended up not being worth the 5 minute drive. So needless to say, I eventually left."
bad,"One of my least favorite places to work.Keeping your job almost always depended on their monthly mystery shops,God forbid you miss telling a customer hello.They would take you to the office and treat you like you stole something.Saying ""hello what can I help you find"" is impossible when you  5-10 ppl walking by you all at the same time.The expectations was unreasonable.When you are closing the store and you only have 2-3 ppl and a manager but you have a stockroom filled with merchandise that you have to stock and topstock is crazy.Many night we would be there until 3-4 am just trying to work all the new merchandise in.God for bid the district manager was coming in the next day.......don't expect to go home before the sun comes up....you just worked a 16 hours shift and have to be back at 1:30 to do it all over again,"
bad,Good Company with many great associates working.  Indivudal districts may vary; my district lacked support from district and regional management.  Many opportunities here for the company if more followup happened on their regional and district staff.  Listen to your store level managment and associates they are the gears of the business that directly affect the customers!
bad,"While I love working with the people that I do, being in retail is not something that I want to do for the rest of my life. The hardest part for me about going to my job is knowing that I don't really enjoy it that much. I feel stressed out and irritated whenever I go in because I know that I can be better, do greater things. I feel as if I'm holding myself back from being what I know I can be."
bad,"My day started before opening hours so that I could reply to emails and do stock management. Then I would try to make room in the very tiny stock room and began unpacking, receiving and entering the huge amount of stock that was coming in and sitting in the middle of the store. Don't get me wrong I loved getting stock but I was receiving an unlimited number of boxes with too much repeat stock that I didnt order or need. Our number one priority should have been our customer but it had to be the stock for too many reasons to mention."
bad,"I learned a lot at BB&B, the classes they give to sell products are easy to follow and remember. Having said that, they only taught me some things about the products on ONE side of the store, and little to nothing at all about the other side. Also, they expect me to cover a side I have no knowledge of so others can go on break. What puts me off about BB&B, and maybe its just me because I have a credit union, but they refuse to set up my direct deposit, which means I have to go out of my way to pick up my check and either cash it or put it in my bank. I have given them countless information countless times and everything they need to set it up, but for whatever reason it never gets done. I have loans to pay and it seems like they do not care."
bad,It's an ok job for the interim between overseas work and trying to find work at home. There's no process improvement and it's very dry in personality.
bad,Management can be better but overall the work environment is well.
bad,"Organized and completed project to open up 2 new departments within Bed, Bath and Beyond.  The World Market and BuyBuy Baby stores were successfully merchandised and opened."
bad,"A typical day at work would include unloading truck, scanning inventory, and preparing it for shelving."
bad,Poor management
bad,"Very flexible with my school schedule and extracurricular activities. Pay was above minimum wage, but not a career job."
bad,"The store I worked at may have only had it's issues due to the store manager. She was removed from her position shortly after I left and the overall environment may have changed after that. While I was there she was very demanding and somewhat unrealistic in those demands. On my birthday I left on time as opposed to staying late, since I had finished what needed to be done for the day yet I was written up for leaving. Most days I was the only person in my department leaving me to receive, process, reconcile and make ready all merchandise that came into the store that day. While this store was not one of the largest, it was still a high volume store with a high volume of daily receipts to process and make floor ready."
bad,"You are over-worked and underpaid. "
bad,"You can work front end (customer service, cashier), work stocking their pharmacy section and walking the sales-floor, or you can work in receiving. A typical day at work when it gets busy can be hectic and you may get many complaints from customers because they expect more sales associates available to help them out. You can't just tell them there aren't enough workers to help out that day but all you can do is apologize. Either way, it makes you look bad. Other than that, it's all right. You just follow through the tasks of helping customers and help check them out, return merchandise on sales floor, and other P.O.S. operations. They are fair with scheduling. The coworkers can be fun to speak with, but make sure you are mindful of customers first!"
bad,"Many hours, outdated practices, inefficiency, outdated systems and hypocrisy. The concept is often penny wise and pound foolish (no distribution centers, antiquated computer systems). Managers are paid well but expectations are grueling and unrealistic."
bad,"Following a trend of the retailers who are all gone.  The new vision and plan I would hope can have success, but the overly laborious merchandising and outdated technology and systems the company still operates with leaves them in an unfavorable position. You cannot suck all the operational budget out and think it will cure the lack of your foot traffic and revenue sales.  Root cause analysis is not a strong skill in the decentralized management culture of BBB."
bad,"A productive 10 hr shift, that you can enjoy and be satisfied work your days work. I enjoy making a fun work environment, because i believe if you enjoy what you do thier no task that can't be accomplished"
bad,"Way too much training ( videos) on customer service interaction and no training on special orders,beyond store, and other computer applications needed daily by customers.Too busy of a store for any training on  the floor..Awkward & unfair to new employee. Some Dept managers lie and get away with it. Much favoritism."
bad,"difficult environment with low pay and little management organisation. Safety is not a priority at their stores. The people who work there are good, nice people, but the overall culture is difficult to thrive in causing a lot of employee turnover."
bad,The past 3 years they been laying people (totaling close to a thousand) off first started on the store level & then in corporate. Even the CEO got canned along with other VPs. In July 160 more people got cut including me. Total of 9 people on my team. There will be more cuts coming. Management is very condescending and talk down to you. Had to check them. They are racist on the low
bad,"I worked here twice, first time I liked it; was my first full time retail job. Managers then were hit or miss. The pay sucks for as much as you do for the company and what they expect out of you. The second time I worked their was only part time and I just couldn’t handle the drama and lazy management. They worked the good employees in the ground and just ignored the lazy employees."
bad,"A typical day would include cashiering and often times running to go get an item or check a sign that was often in the wrong spot or hadn't been updated, as well as scanning multiple expired coupons and having to explain to the customer why the coupon was worth 10% and not 20% due to its expiration. Management would tell us the policies and how they had changed and train us on how to deliver the policy to the customer for a return or purchase, mostly returns. Once a customer was upset the managers would more often than not make an exception and give full amount refunds, discounts and apologize. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer our policies and then a manger allowing the sale or return to go through. The workplace culture was pretty upbeat and there was always someone to talk to and ask for help, which was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"It a decent a job experience, you the work given to you and it's a good day, but theres little advancement in slavary pay. The job work frame is great, but the pay not so much."
bad,"My short time at bed bath and beyond was somewhat enjoyable due to my fellow associates there but aside from that it was a fairly normal job that came with little to no excitement. Along with that, they didn't pay well when it came to working on holidays such as Christmas Eve and New Years Eve."
bad,"Managers pick favorites, if you’re not a favorite you may be treated poorly by said manager; sometimes managers will make derogatory jokes. There is a lot of drama in the work place with coworkers because they are all mostly teenage girls. It’s very hard to move up in the work place. And the customers there are extremely rude, they will not hesitate to make you cry or get in your face if you do not have an item in stock. However their flexibility is awesome and the managers tend to be understanding with giving you set hours a week. However if you don’t set those hours you can be doing an arrangement of shifts. Great work place for high school students or college students"
bad,"Company has a hard time with change, old systems make it even more difficult to get things done in a timely fashion. Management doesn’t train and very unprofessional. No work from home options, no lap top, no work life balance, bad company culture"
bad,"It was fun at the beginning, then it all went downhill when 'The Main Office' started implementing pointless duties . Also, they expect 100% open availability yet only hand out a one or two 3.5hour shifts a week."
bad,unless you become a manager or plan on staying there that long i would only recommend it as a part time job for a s student who can work very little hours.
bad,The store management  was awful. The general manager was a legitimate racist and had shocking outbursts of rage and profanity TOWARD CUSTOMERS. this was typical.
bad,"At first I really liked the job but then people would quit and they wouldn't hire very many to replace them, which meant we were short handed a lot, I never got a lunch on time, I always was drowning in customers and returns typically without help all day. Cashiers are supposed to see customers and direct them to their line but instead they would play on their phones and ignore them, sometimes a manager would get on to them but eventually didn't care anymore. The turnover rate there is very high, don't expect to get paid enough to live on their because it will not happen. I asked for a raise when they wanted to send me out of state to train and they wouldn't do it, I would just like to get paid .45 more which is what they were hiring new people in at. Also the store manager is a hot head and very emotional, you will get belittled in front of customers and employees."
bad,Working at Bed Bath and Beyond was such a great experience in the beginning until everyone started quitting. I enjoyed coming into work but after when all the load was put on the part-time workers such as myself I started to enjoy it less. Now I'm trying to find another job where I would be appreciated.
bad,Bed Bath & Beyond is an excellent place for complacent people who are looking for stability and a steady paycheck. The company totally lacks the dynamic leader who is driven to get things completed. There are many groups within the company which hasn't gone through any changes and it takes them 5+ years to deliver on the projects and there are literally no internal repercussions for moving at sloth-like speed.
bad,"I left after 9 months because of the broken culture"
bad,Took this just to have a job until I can find a job in my career field. The pay is not enough for all they expect you to do as a CSR. Good for a part-time or temporary position.
bad,"Every Decision is clogged in politics and infighting; It takes too long for changes to be made and improvements to be implemented."
bad,"The company is going through changes and not sure if it is the company direction, or just the district manager, but not a very good environment right now."
bad,Fast paced yet fun. Managers were really nice but the work wasn't worth the pay. The employees were really helpful and happy to teach new employees the ropes.
bad,My time spent with Bed Bath and Beyond was not great. The leadership was never on the same page and caused the store level employees more work and time away from family.
bad,"BBB is known as Blood Bath and Beyond for good reason. I started as a part timer 3 years ago and worked my way up to senior manager, but ever since our stock tumbled below $20 a share the company has been a miserable place to work."
bad,"I believe that the reason why persons like myself have not been able to advance to other positions, receive more hours, advance from part time to full time, and are unable to relieve benefits due to part time status is due to the fact that the company is not doing well. As was recently reported in the media, almost 900 people in management positions were let go in what was an obvious attempt to save money and downsize. This is a demonstration of how the company is not thinking outside of the box, not adapting to a changing market, and not updating their portfolio to make the company more competitive. Instead, they've fallen back on old corporate moves which hurt their workers but benefit their bottom line. I was hired with the promise that eventually reach full time hours and nearly two years later, they have kept me just under the minimum that would make me a full time employee. Many times I am either the only person on the floor or one of three part time associates on the floor in a store the size of a football field, which has over a thousand products to be maintained and, on very busy days, hosts over a hundred costumers a day. I and my associates feel used, overworked, and denied the hours which would mean better pay. For these reasons, I would not recommend applying for a job at Bed Bath and Beyond for an extended period because it will not be worth it."
bad,"Too many people giving direction above the Store Manager. Each one with their own priority rating. If you made one happy another person was upset. Everyone believed that their vision was the most important and failure to follow it would lead to chaos. Trying to follow multiple directions was chaos and the stores reflected the true lack of  clear leadership."
bad,"If you are working part time as a student, or if the job is temporary then I see nothing wrong with the job. But, overall its a very boring labor intensive job."
bad,"At Bed Bath and Beyond, you could not do anything right.  They did not care whether you went to lunch or not.  There was never enough staffing present and you were dragged in every direction."
bad,"The store manager at Mission Viejo is very unfriendly , she only cares about her friend group,  not professional at all. It's  always  very busy the time goes fast  that is what I really like, the discounts  are better on the holidays."
bad,Very poor pay for very hard work! Schedule planning was poor as well. They are constantly asking and calling for extra work time. Products are way over priced. Can't believe they stay in business. Fustrating because you are always being called to cashier. How can one get anything accomplished on the floor?
bad,"The management switched out randomly and became poorly."
bad,"Laid off 900 Dept Mgrs in one day, no one saw this coming, under staffed and mandatory to work 47.5 hours a week. Loved my job despite these things and loved my employees"
bad,"Working for Bed Bath and Beyond was sometimes rewarding, and sometimes not! There is a lot of inside politicking that goes on between upper management that affects store level associates unfairly!"
bad,"By far, the worst company I have managed for.  They spend very little on payroll, some of the lowest of any fortune company as a matter of fact.  Each year, the CEO's and founders buy back hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock to line their own pockets.  No, I mean no, work life balance, and no satisfaction.  No matter how good at prioritizing you are, you will be farther behind in your ""must do's"" then you've ever been in your life.  Couldn't stress hard enough, avoid working here at all cost."
bad,"Have worked at BBB for over 5 years.  Started part time, now working full time.  They put you anywhere they need you to fill in when other employees don't show up.  Hours typically are not good.  Usually get stuck working late night hours and all weekends  (2-10 or 3-11).  Not worth it for the pay.  10.75 an hour after 5+ years.  Started at 9.50 an hour.  They use to give yearly reviews and that has stopped.  Typically .15 to .25 cents yearly raises. And consider yourself lucky if you get that.  They promise you advancement,  so you just about kill yourself for more pay.  Only to find out someone new get's hired for the position.  Offer you a $1 an hour raise then never give it.  You have to jump through hoops with managers just for a .25 raise per year.  Training is poor at best.  ONLY reason I am working is for the health insurance which is Blue Cross, Blue Shield PPO for our family.  Most employees are nice enough and agreeable. Managers are stressed and tend to be pushy.  Store managers usually last 1-2 years at the store then get transferred.   High burn out rate.   Not the worst place to work for but certainly not the best.   2 stars out of 5."
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond is very stable and if you get a job here it is yours pretty much for life.  They are very tolerant of mediocre performance.  Unfortunately there is very little upside.  Senior management is very stable and has been here for a long time.  Raises are mediocre and unfortunately don't have much to do with actual performance.  On the bright side, if you are mediocre, you will get the same raise as the person doing great."
bad,No true structure. Very antiquated technology comparable to the 1980's. Talk customer service culture but resources and support very limited. Work life balance non existing at management level.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the team members I work with day in and day out. We have fun and take care of our customers, every customer every time."
bad,To much pressure on staff. Labor was at a bare minimum. Dirty work environment. Poor scheduling. Very bad overall experience. I would not send new associates to this company.
bad,"Communication is a must for any company to succeed. Everyone being on the same page is a key to success. This does not happen at Bed Bath and Beyond. Rarely are the managers ever on the same page about anything. It is bad from the top down. One word I would use to describe the atmosphere is, toxic. Everyone relentlessly complains about everyone else."
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond pays well depending on location, they work you hard though, your hours that are given are definitely put to use."
bad,"Company as a whole doesn't care about its employees or managers. People within stores are awesome, caring people doing the best they can, with what they have."
bad,working in a park with children. making sure all stands are operating in a professional way. Coworkers are fun to be around. Enjoyable part of the day is that it is a fun environment.
bad,BBB is good if you do not have a life and need a job. However management is pretty much like working on a plantation. You'll make good friends with your coworkers though.
bad,"Management is constantly changing how things are done without properly informing ALL of the employees. Lack of training. Too much favoritism. Managers expect way to much to be done in not enough time. All the company thinks about is the almighty dollar. Customers, overall, are treated well but not so much for the employees."
bad,"I didn't work with them very long, it was a bit dangerous climbing on very tall and unsafe ladders was scary,  I enjoyed very much organizing and decorating throughout the store."
bad,"I used to work at another location and, while there are problems at both, I much prefer that one to the location I am now."
bad,"A typical day would consist of meeting after meeting with no breaks."
bad,"Managers didn't' really""work"" and were always delayed if we needed their help with something. Nobody in the staff cared and the managers wouldn't do anything about it because they wouldn't fire them anyways. Other worked for 4 years and never had an opportunity to become a lead let alone a manager. not because of lack of effort but because of lazy and uncaring management."
bad,"I felt very stressed to the limit. If the managers find out you are a decent worker, instead of praising you, they give you more work for the same amount of pay. You have to pick up slack for the other employees. I started out with one job and ended up with four titles when I left, all at the same salary level. Its a number game for customers, not the employees. If someone calls out, you have to stay even though your shift ended two hours ago."
bad,"Must be able to multitask, put up stock, customer service, and maintaining department standards. Managers work with you. They work hard, Twelve hour days and only 30 min lunch. Product incentives every month."
bad,"my job task was to maintain store overall appearance, go up and ring the registers when told to"
bad,"Changed day to day, with job duties, responsibilities, and customers needs.  Very fast-paced, and the day went by quickly."
bad,"A typical day at work would be me scanning the customers items, you don't really learn much. The management and co-workers could be better but it is enjoyable."
bad,I enjoyed helping customers find difficult items and learned to work with customers. The hardest part of he job was straightening an stocking the store at te end of the day. This was only a summer job for me.
bad,Do more work than you get paid for .....tiring and frustrating.
bad,"what more is there to say about retail, it's retail! a lot of work, mall atmosphere, mixed croud"
bad,"Company is run by collevtive and long term politics. Why are they constantly interviewing for new managers in the job market, because they ""burn them and turn them"". Very difficult to work for this company if you are anything other than a size 6 or less."
bad,"Management is just eh. If at any point you decide to step down from a position no matter the reason, you’ll be highly disrespected and walked on. They promise training at orientation, however I was never trained on anything basically sink or swim. There’s a lot of drama. A lot of heavy lifting, constantly moving things, going up and down ladders. You’re not truly compensated for all the hard work that is done."
bad,I felt like I was unnecessarily micromanaged every day that I worked there. There were so many unwritten rules and each manager had different standards which were inconsistent.
bad,"Honestly its okay, but there are better jobs out there. Management is all over the place and needs help be checked. Also call out if you are not coming in because they take that very seriously especially when they are always short on staff."
bad,"The employees on the floor have great personable attitudes. However, management is a mess and everyone is stressed because there aren't enough cashiers to keep the lines down. The shelves are constantly missing a lot of product. Great people to work with not such a great company to work for. Pay and benefits do not seem to be based off the quality of work. Scheduling very flexible."
bad,The location of BB&B I worked at was possibly a rare case? I would only suggest a part time side job at most. If you can get full time you're a rare case/lucky/the store was desperate.
bad,"there was no real communication between other employees or manager, quick to be written up vs acknowledgment for a good days work. also managers never communicated properly with employees."
bad,"In the past, top management needed to be trained how to stay out of other employees private lives. Moreover, the pay at my current position does not match other companies (some that I know are going out of business) at the same level. In addition, I also do more work than higher management at those other companies, for half what they make. Other than that, the original amount of work I did under the level I started at was fitting and fair (at full time). I had a lot of fun at Target, and the people I worked with there became like family. I can not say the same for Bed, Bath, and Beyond."
bad,"You don’t move up unless you are old, and and been there for years. Barely even that. and when it’s time for your yearly raise, it’s only a few cents."
bad,te inculcan a dar un mejor servicio de calidad y satisfacción al cliente desde dar la bienvenida a invitar a regresar al cliente
bad,"Management isnt great, they need to hire more people so they make other associates do more work, pays well though, no drug test. A lot of people come into the store so it is pretty stressful trying to basically help everyone at once, and youll be constantly cleaning up your department, unless youre a cashier."
bad,"A typical day at work would look like running around, reacting rather than planning. I honestly only learned work related tasks only applicable to the business. Management, no matter which store I worked in, were always frantic and once again, reacting rather than planning. The company offers a happy culture but it is all a facade. The hardest part of the job is knowing that upper management doesn't have your back, so walking on eggshells is a daily activity. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a staff that is also going through everything you are going through, that was at least you have someone to sympathize with you when something goes wrong."
bad,"They take more stock in the customers and not with their employees.  The hours were long.  Didn't like the ""pass the buck"" culture. Needed to train the employees in ALL areas."
bad,"If you are looking for a place to work where you can do almost nothing all day and never get fired, this is the place for you. You need to actively try to get fired here, and even then, you may not be let go. "
bad,"Stressful environment with constantly changing upper management."
bad,"My problem was retaliation by the store manager, not friendly at all, love everybody else."
bad,"I learned a lot working here, I did customer Service, cashier and bridal registry.  I was a full time student at the time going to college and working. Didn't get a lot of hours and was working late hours."
bad,"Well okay to work there but it hold lot thing need to be fix start off whit people they hire 30 people come in and between 10-15 people going it faster past and very hot inside some area don""t have water and ice and employe work for litter money they paid but it okay"
bad,Time management and micro-management add to the daily stressful environment.Did not know everyday what would be the area that would become the focal point. Not consistant with direction.
bad,"They want you to learn a lot and sell a lot really fast and without offering commission. There is opportunity to move up, but in my opinion it isn't worth the benefits."
bad,Don't expect to move up not much space for promotions or a raise. Good place to work as a college student. They do hire management outside the company
bad,"Working in retail was very exiting and a new process for me to take in life, but dealing with angry customers and then having your manager side with the customer and make you look bad, that was the part I didn't like. Over all i loved the job i think its a great start for everyone to have as a first job for experience."
bad,Started out as a very positive work experience. The pay is wonderful. The managers are very demanding and need further education on proper work etiquette. Showed a great deal of favoritism with certain employees.
bad,very  intense work place. cookie cutter policy. everyone read from the same play book. can be moved from your location at any moment. department can and will be change at short notice.
bad,"I'm going to sum this place up. The attendence policy basically refrains you from doing anything but working. If your sick, you go to work. No exceptions! If you have to go to the doctor, you go to work. No exceptions! If you have a family emergency, you can't turn your attention to that. You go to work! "
bad,"I have been with Bed Bath and Beyond for two years now, and I can safely say that unless you plan on spending a good chunk of your life with the company, you probably won't move up unless you do a lot of brown nosing with the upper management (i.e. District Manager, Corporate Manager, etc.) or if you have a nice store manager who really REALLY likes you and your work ethic. In my two years at the store, there has only been one person moving up from Sales Associate to a Customer Service Trainer position. She has been with the company for 8 years. They only promoted her because we were without a CST for roughly 3 months. Our former CST quit due to the new store manager harassing her. She complained to HR and Corporate office about her situation multiple times and no one took her seriously. So she quit. This is not the only case I've heard about."
bad,"-Typical work day consisted of getting o work at 6am and stocking the store from 6am-9am, then will finishing the freight also helping customers and cashiering."
bad,"It is not too difficult to get a part-time position, but getting a full-time position is a hassle.  The stores are usually not staffed sufficiently, so it is common to be asked to work later than scheduled and called up on days off.  Shipping and receiving, and replenishment are usually on very tight schedules.  Any unforeseen event that delays the work, causes a huge pileup in tasks that sometimes bleed into the next work day.  There is a good amount of job security though.  The management is fairly reasonable, and try to accommodate employees and their concerns."
bad,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to learn retail, but is a bit behind on some processes."
bad,"50 Hour work week, minimum. Promotions based on hours put in, not the best qualified. They have really cut back hours for associates, which means a lot of register time for managers. Talk things up, but then they don't give you the resources to succeed. VERY old computer system and registers (IBM 1990)."
bad,It sucks can gain friendships but management is so unprofessional and unorganized
bad,hire too many managers. communication weak. expect you to learn from books
bad,Its was ok and the people that worked where very sweet to me and they help me a lot and the boss as well anytime i need help the would help me take care of all the people that need help by myself
bad,Crazy place to work. not much help on the salesfloor. you do everything not just your assigned department.  very poor district staff. great people to work with.
bad,"I worked at the bbb location in Goleta, CA for about a month before I quit. I don’t suggest anyone apply here. The management was very hostile and the work environment was just very unwelcoming."
bad,"I was left with out a front end manager or senior co-workers after black Friday when a lot of complicated returns came in. I was unable to complete these returns without assistance because I had not received the training I needed for this task. "
bad,"This was definitely one of my least favorite companies to work for. Manager would schedule you outside of your availability and expect you to show up when he left work early everyday and never came out of his office. If the store is slammed and the customers are piled at the registers don't expect help from the 5 managers on duty."
bad,"I worked there for 17 yrs. I loved helping the customers and running the business. The products were great, the initial training was great. The company focus shifted away from what they were good at and that was educating the customers on the product and helping by them select what works best for them. The workload kept increasing with reduced staffing hours making it almost impossible to maintain the standards without working longer hours. Too many trainers in the district/regional level that don’t train or add value to the stores needs which put more strain on the stores ability to staff properly to assist the customers. When I had to let go 2 managers and promote 2 to supervisors as hourly replacements for them, I saw the writing on the wall and It was my time to go elsewhere. I gave up some vacation time but I no longer carry the stress of the impossible job structure."
bad,"Like most retail position, the pay is very low. My store pays the cashiers the same salary as the costumer service workers even though they do five times as much work. This job is fine enough if you're just a cashier. I started off as a cashier. I would NOT recommend working on the service desk. The costumers treat you like garbage and the managers let them. You get paid minimum wage and you deal with a ton of abuse from costumers. "
bad,The people for the most part were great to work with at store level. Expectations of upper management based on the allowable hours given were way too lofty.
bad,"I learned how to deal with customers needs, manage 15-25 people."
bad,Management was hard on employees and lead by fear. Constant customer flow with little downtime. There is ability to move upward within the company if interest is shown.
bad,Good atmosphere in term of management and employee team.if you the integrity you would promoted soon. They will not appreciate your education.........
bad,Big company many selfish people. I worked for 15 years there and really was not treated that well. Though I do love shopping there I have learned a lot about the company and people who run the store and how they treat their employees........ not very well.
bad,"Management cared very little about their employees, there were some exceptions but not many."
bad,certain managers were cool others were not so holy didnt know the dress code to work and didnt give enough hours wanted more hours but was not gettting them
bad,Bed Bath and Beyond has a lot of work to do with the managers and how they treat their hourly employees. The co-workers however are some of the greatest people you will ever meet.
bad,If you are a manager you are at the whims of the company. Zero work life balance and if you are not friends with your store manager you dont' get any consideration for your personal life.
bad,"A typical day at my job would be greeting and working with customers, putting away merchandise, and displaying merchandise to customers. I often answer phones, take messages, look for product at other locations, order product for customers and interact with customers all through my shifts."
bad,this place is not as fun to work in they just want you to be like a robot go in work clock out eat clock back in and work work work. management are not as friendly as other places
bad,"After 5 years working here it went from a place that respected and appreciated its employees and helped and encouraged growth to a place that only cares about money. No appreciation, no flexibility no teaching, no help expect more for less money and less appreciation. If you have a family don’t even bother because they will not work with you and your family situation and schedule. You need to do what they want when they want with nothing said about it being a conflict. Forget about making doctors appointments because your lucky if you get your schedule for the week a week in advance. There is no set schedule or even remotely close to similar schedule to follow. And if your pregnant you are exspected to do all tasks everyone else is even if you are not supposed to"
bad,Bed Bath and beyond as a mandatory requirement for managers was to work extra days (while on salary) and not be paid extra. It is not a place for me to recommend.
bad,"Mangers suck and are too harsh sometimes, they literally don't care about their employees. The work environment could be so much better but it isn't which is why most people don't stay there for too long."
bad,The manager at the Longview store started yelling at me as soon as I started paperwork.   Paperwork was sent to my computer at midnight before interview at 9 am    I did not have a clue I had to fill out more stuff.  It was their fault for sending it so late.  She did not care.  She was rude and hateful.    The second day there I watched videos.  Third day they had me on a register and because I was learning and a little slow she yelled at me in front of customers.  It was really embarrassing.   After that I never went back.
bad,I learned many things about retail.  They have courses to products you can take.  I also learned customer service skills.  I worked on the sales floor as well as being a cashier.
bad,Best part of this company is that people are shifted to and from stores and you get to meet a lot of people.  We often refer to ourselves as the Bed Bath family.  The company is constantly changing and some times not in a good way so it is hard to keep up with which direction we are headed in.
bad,"Every customer on the store I was working in was always in a foul mood. They would always interrupt your conversations, cared less about you being on break or not. And always complained about not being able to get a discount."
bad,"Depending on your type of management style, this may not be the place for you. Many broken promises, no follow through, no accountability, no communication, inadequately and incapable staffed senior management   Most days decisions are made on a sliding scale and the culture seems to be the just wing it mentality."
bad,"While BBB strived to give customers a positive shopping experience, its eagerness to do so could be considered off-putting. I was not comfortable being expected to helicopter over clients and customers, and neither were they. As it became known that the company was beginning to have financial troubles, I felt that the pressure to make any kind of sale/helicopter customers was even more suffocating. I was also frustrated at the workload I was given as a part-time employee, as I was never offered to be full-time to be given any sort of benefits. This was especially frustrating once I entered the registry department, as I began to see a rift between my department and the others due to a more comfortable workplace setting (we had chairs and everyone had to stand all day). I couldn't work under the environment any longer and I'm glad I left. I appreciate the friendships I made during my time here."
bad,For the company to survive it must change its business strategy. Don't see the ASM role continuing in the future based on current trend. Those in customer facing positions are the real BBBY and have a ton to offer if given the tools to succeed.
bad,"The company has potential, but upper management needs to get with the times before its too late. We are still using Lotus Notes and cannot work from home. Upper Management spent too much on open space office concept when we should be investing into Technology in our E-commerce are to drive business."
bad,Good if you need interim work while you're attending school. Good if you get bored easily. Not good if you get tired easily. Workplace environment depends on the store you work in.
bad,One of those jobs that you take only to make cash and nothing else. Majority of staff are young or unskilled workers so make sure you really need the money before applying.
bad,Poor management.  Great job poor hiring practices blah blah.  Didn't like the hiring practices not a great work environment. Shorted pay check. Changed hours.
bad,"There are a lot of confusion going on in workplace far as moving products around all the time and can not figure out where they go anymore, and so on."
bad,A day is unknown you really don't have specific task or job description if asked you need to drop your task to assist others. some departments are given priority as well as some positions.
bad,"I personally hated working here because everything is too strict and management has favorites, everyone is constantly worried about losing their jobs."
bad,I found this job to be great to learn basic retail skills I did not find it to be a job that you would want long term but it also wasn't a bad job its good for young people.
bad,"The only redeeming factor about working for BBB was the people. The company itself has cut through the bone of resource and productivity, damaging morale beyond repair and giving zero support to the management teams but expecting them to deliver perfect results. Because you are all in the same boat, you easily become very close to everyone below and above you, and I have made some wonderful friends from my experience there."
bad,"Good entry level retail job"
bad,"Management is very poor. Managers will speak down to you and are very condescending. They are very rude."
bad,"This job does not really have any opportunity for growth.  I think if you are young, and just need a part time temporary job this could work.  Management is very disorganized."
bad,"get used to standing for the whole 10 hours, its not easy, also its both quick and slow paced. they try but not very organized, stressful, long and boring."
bad,It wasn't what I was looking for in a job. It was too crazy especially over holidays. This was just not a good match for me. It was more like a phone service company than an actual store.
bad,"Duties included put-aways, replenishing, picking, packing, moving products to meet daily goals and deadlines. Daily equipment used cherry picker, sit down forklift, double pallet jack, RF scanner."
bad,At first it was enjoyable because of the coworkers. The managers are not the best. They like to sell each other out and don't show appreciation for the work anyone does.
bad,"People stole from us, rude to us and some people you genuinely helped.  Company has clear guidelines as far as safety, workplace attire etc.  It was a good first job and I still carry some of that experience with me almost 20 years later."
bad,"Very fast paced environment, easy going, and flexible with scheduling and hours for those who are students. Management is very open to change and new challenges"
bad,"it was alright for a first job, taught you a lot of responsibilities. The employees were all sweet hearts and honestly the only reason I kept going back.."
bad,As a receiving leader its a lot responsibility on the job  making sure all trucks are receive properly. printing out reports and matching  the number of items that has been receive in the system is one of the most hard parts of the job but everything else is like a normal day.
bad,"A typical day in Customer Service is simply handling customers returns. Some people need to exchange, some are unhappy with the expensive product they purchased, and its all about not taking those unhappy customers to heart and understanding they are upset with their product. It wasn't everyday I saw an unhappy customer, but it was always a rewarding feeling seeing someone happy about getting a replacement coffee maker!"
bad,Good people to work with. Management isn't the best and systems are not that good. There is some weekend work which is not fun
bad,I love the job and the people that I work with but the company does not care about their associates. I have asked for several raises because I am doing managerial work but all have been denied. The work is hard and challenging. The management is terrible and are not willing to help. Overall I love the job and what I do but the company is terrible. I am one of the hardest workers but I make less than $10 an hour.
bad,their manager who are manipulative but the worker are good people. its a good job to start just for that its not good to stay there for a long time
bad,"While it was ok generally speaking to work there, I was at odds with the lack of common sense of the management there and with the Corporate office whom I had to interface with. Overall, not a place I would work at again."
bad,Typical day at work would be putting up product and working with customers. Management was good and co-workers would help out.
bad,"•	Handled dynamic objects of the application using regular expression of QTP"
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond was a nice company to work for. It was a cey face-paced, fun work environment. Managment was succeptable. Break room was fantastic. However, pay just wasn't enough."
bad,"A typical for a receiving associate is usually walking into a mess. Very disorganized and you'll spend quite sometime cleaning up after everyone else. You have to adjust to working fast in a small area where there isn't much for you to move at all. You have to be a quick thinker because 9 times out 10 nothing goes according to plan. Management is very iffy at times. Would I say if they are reliable? not really. When Things are getting out of hand, we find ourselves on our own trying to make things happen. That's one thing that I actually like about the job. It showed me that I can still get the job done no matter what. The one thing I really dislike is the lack of support. receiving is the most important part of that store, but when it comes to asking for help, sometimes you'll be left with your hand out."
bad,"A typical day at work would be ringing up customers at the register, make sure our register is organized, on down time fix up things that aren't in its place, and return unwanted items back to the floor. Management was horrible, there wasn't any communication, or understanding from the managers which made it very hard to enjoy being at the job. To be honest the most enjoyable time was to see your customers happy."
bad,"A typical day at work would be: CUSTOMER SERVICE, helping any and every customer until he or she is satisfied, cleaning and organizing the department, filling the merchandise and backup cashiering when needed. I learned a lot about customer service. How an associate is to talk and help customers. Also, obtaining as much product knowledge as possible. I learned how to work well with others. The management was very stern and direct. The co-workers are extremely friendly and dedicated. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. But I enjoyed being able to help make everyone happy!"
bad,"A typical day involves having your own workload. The problem lies when you are constantly told that every small task to pop up becomes the top priority, therefore delaying your workload. If you are able to complete the continuous pile of priorities, then you might be able to do your workload. There is no employee that will help you if your workload does not get completed. Time sensitive work constantly gets put on the back burner and therefore when it is not complete, it still falls on you because of the way the store is run. I learned how to constantly move around and handle many things at once, however am never given the time to perform my workload due to other ""priorities."""
bad,As a member of the management team you were scheduled  45 hours a week but expected to actually work 65+. This was not a condusive environment for me to raise my children as a single parent.
bad,"Overall, the particular store I worked at was pretty relaxed which can go a long way in a retail environment. Like many retail jobs, the pay is abysmal and the hours aren't too great either. Management canbe a touch unprofessional at times but at the same time, are not overly strict which again, goes a long way in retail."
bad,Don't have too much to say at this point. Anyone from the company who sees this post will know it was me. I was the only First Assistant in the area
bad,"I assisted customers on the sales floor.  I also assisted on the cash registers, and provided customer service. "
bad,"This company provides extensive training. However, they seem to have a program of not promoting from within the organization."
bad,"It is a fun place to work in that you are wholly responsible for success of your store. However District management leaves a lot to be desired. Also, training is almost non existent. Also, extremely long hours are required, even more than normal retail."
bad,I enjoyed working with customers as well as the retail atmosphere
bad,very long and hard hours
bad,I liked working there. It was a very stressful environment due to the lack of respect for employees.
bad,It was not a happy place to work. everyone has to do too many things at one time and I felt they criticized more than encouraged their employees. I enjoyed working with the public but wasn't happy with management.
bad,Had a store manager who would sit in his office all day and talk to his girlfriend. Did not take time to get to know the employees. Good place to find a solid working family though.
bad,"Enjoyed my job but management could of been better. Only reason I left was they were not willing to work with my school schedule and even telling them I had to be at school by 4 , they would continuously schedule me for afternoon shifts."
bad,"The fellow employees I work with are amazing and down to earth people, who try to make each others positions as easy as possible. Unfortunately, the location I work at must attract some of the worst customers I have ever had the pleasure of talking to. Of course some are absolute darling and great to help throughout their shopping experience, but others will have the tendency to try and find fault in even the smallest things, only to save a few cents. If they can't find anything, then expect to be asked if we can give them coupons by at least 10 different people every day. It is similar to walking on eggshells in fear they might get unnaturally angry. The turnover rate is also quite high, so expect many people to leave within their first month and having to cover the dept. they were supposed to work, instead of getting your own tasks completed for the week. Overall though, the absolute best part is working with some of the best people I have ever met and becoming close friends. If you are someone who wants multiple great and interesting fellow employees surrounding you, then Bed, Bath & Beyond is wonderful place to meet them (At least at the location I worked at)."
bad,"Immediate hire made it easy to get in, but associates were a young immature crowd. Good managers and leads, also had lived in same area as a manager @ 1 time. Also good values and training."
bad,on a typical day you stretch out and you pretty much get to work its a very hard place to work I did it for 7 years management they don't listen to their employes our it would be a better place to work..
bad,"The job itself is fairly easy, a mix of customer service, keeping the store organized and a fair amount of physical labor. Management is great at working with the employees with any and all questions and concerns, yet they are consistently pressured from upper management which in turn trickles down to the employees. Theirs also a serious lack of communication between management which results in constant scheduling and other errors in the store. Most shifts have a skeleton crew to take on several responsibilities in order to make up for the lack of people we have. This in turn results in poor customer service, ridiculously cluttered stock rooms and a poorly organized store."
bad,"I have been working at BBB, as I have yet been able to find full time work."
bad,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a company I joined back in 2003, and was a company I truly desired to excel in. Over the period of 15 years, the company has declined in understanding the overall importance of how to staff a building. At the beginning in 2003 we staffed a high-volume store with around 1300 hours. Now we are currently running a 5 million dollar store with 800 hours a week. This includes a six, 47.5 hours per week, management team. This leads to an overall decline in our ability to staff the store sufficiently enough, to take care of our customers, per our company standards, and expectations. Their is no cohesion, organization, or accountability with the management staff, or associates. I have not been given an opportunity to ever grow this business, due to the disorganization of the companies daily, business plan. I don't see a bright future for myself with this company, because I don't believe in the current path the company is taking. I'm looking for a company that has a passionate, and drivin business plan. A company that is always motivated to move in a positive direction, towards success. I'm also excited about working in a positive work environment, and working with my co-workers. Thank you for the opportunity to join your team."
bad,"Competitive working environment. Some workers are friends others aren't. Poor management not all but most. Learned a lot about the products I was selling. Such as where they come from, how they were made. Also different varieties depending on the product. We would start the morning off by having a meeting as well as close time. If working on floor I would walk the area check for possible restocks. Provide customers with excellent customer service skills. Keeping them up to date with our latest products. As well as monthly email signup offers. As a cashier I provided customers information about our item of the month. Also promoted sign ups for emails and coupons. Made sure front area of store was neat. Items that customers did not want was to returned to the front end area to customer service. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. I learned from management that nothing is more important than a happy customer and friendly and welcoming environment."
bad,Thier was alot of training which was good. Lots of support and customers were excellent.
bad,I do not really like retail and I did a lot and was not compensated for it.
bad,at bed bath and beyond you will be fit. you do freight every day you also learn how to down stock top stock and back stock. you work with nice customers and will move around on the floor a lot. you will learn about different sheet sets towels bedding even hardware such as ovens stereos and vacuums.
good,"If it is a first job or a temp job the beginning pay is great for part-timers compared to other retailers. hour for part timers are non existent during certain times of the year."
good,"I found at the store location I worked at, a huge issue with unfair treatment to employees. There was too much favoritism towards specific employees by management."
good,"Retail. Great for summer job. Or teanagers, or retirees. breaks are way too short. if you work 8 hours, you should get an hour break period. Lots of cool gadgets and love the kitchen accessories!"
good,"Although I personally had a bad experience with management and the way they handled a serious situation, I somewhat enjoyed my time working here. A typical day of work consisted of stocking shelves and cleaning the store, some cashier work and cleaning duties. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful. I learned great customer service skills working here."
good,I do enjoy working there but the hrs and hourly pay are not what I expected in a business like this.
good,Not getting paid enough here barely making over minimum wage and I been here for over 13 years!!! I'm just tired of working hard and getting no recognition of what I'm doing and I'm done
good,If apply make sure u are ready mentally and emotionally it is a roller coaster. The job was okay but then they start to take avanoand the underpay u for what u do.
good,"Not efficient, constantly moving the same merchandise to multiple locations...store managers are determined based on convenience not ability...managers manage and do not lead by example or held accountable for their actions or lack of"
good,"If you want hours and if you want to advance in the company find somewhere else, managers will put false hope in moving up and if you as for a raise forget about it you can work harder then anyone in the store and not get recognized"
good,"It started off great but management really went downhill. Also new employees were not being trained right and didn't know what they were doing. The hours got cut horribly and I had to get a second job... and then when I did and changed my availability, they tried to deny my availability change request. It was a hassle and I quickly got sick of the management."
good,Management is a joke. Not one of them is on the same page you get pulled in 5 different directions. After one manager has you perform one task another will disagree and make you do it all over again to their liking it is a vicious cycle. Very clicky and immature management even at a corporate level.
good,"I am no longer interested in working for this company.  Therefore I am looking into options.  Started in Florida as a Floor "
good,"It is a good place to work, its not a full time position unless in management level. And its really hard to work a 2nd job because the schedule isnt always the same."
good,"Over worked, Under paid, Under appreciated. 10% of the people do 90% of the work. The rest get paid to do nothing. I am a fraction of the 10%. The co-workers that work are fantastic."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a thriving company when I started, Ive committed myself to excellence at work while the company continues to change its direction and focus, Im at my capacity with them with nowhere to advance to.  My job has gone from serious training and safety to just covering hours.."
good,I’d say working at BBB was quite a pleasure at the beginning. That is until I started working there for a while and it was difficult to get along with certain workers and management.
good,"I’ll never work for this company again. They do not care about any of their employees. They are selfish, rude, and undeserving of anyone’s time. They will easily replace you."
good,"Unfortunately this company has poor training, you are lied to about there being help once you get onto the floor, there is barely any help. It's sink or swim. Our temporary supervisor trainer on the floor seemed overwhelmed by all these new people the floor. Consumers can be very rude, to the Consumers, you need to be Be kinder to the Customer service representatives! We are trying to help"
good,"I worked for Bed Bath and Beyond as a sales associate for one summer.  My shifts were in the Morning from roughly 6am to 12pm.  The management was poor during my time of employment, we were consistently under staffed and I was asked to cover shifts multiple times due to this.  The labor itself was mostly sorting inventory and stocking the floor, which was at times difficult only due to the weight of the actual items I was given to stock.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to pick up more hours at almost anytime.  As an employee for only a few months the availability to pick up extra hours was a nice bonus."
good,"I’ve worked here for 2 and a half years due to their flexible work schedule, but this particular Bed Bath and Beyond does not care about its employees. They give sales associates loads of projects to do throughout that day. Usually there is only 1-2 sales associates in the floor and they are expected to help customers, answer phone calls, go up to the register when needed to keep the lines down, do endless lists of tasks and meet quotas for “Beyond orders”. They give no insentives for employees and on top of this the store manager is rude to her employees. Associates also only get one 30 minute break when working an 8 hour shift and no other breaks."
good,I worked there for a short time do to the pay and the hours.  I shifts changed continually and I was unable to plan for time off.  The discount was the best part of the job.
good,"I worked at 2 locations for Bed Bath+Beyond. The work is fast paced but it's not overbearing. The first location was great even though the customers were annoying, work companions make the day go by quicker. The second location made me sick. I wanted to call out every day as the management made my life a living he||. It can be a great job depending on management. Beware."
good,"This job is good to start off, but for career advancement not so good they expect you to know everything but the don’t compensate you if you knowledge"
good,"simple how to stock the floor and maintain the stock area in the back"
good,"very fast paced job, nice people, good environment. wish we got benefits. at times i feel as i am being under paid for all the hard work we do. but other than that its great"
good,when it came to scheduling they were completely bias giving their favorite employees morning shifts and the work horses the closing shifts. We were forced to stay late way past our scheduled times. Corperate was called several times by my coworkers while I worked there and mangers were just transferred to different stores. We were forced to push online orders even given a quota by some managers that if we didn't sell we warned we would get write ups. When holidays were close everyone knew and was expected to stay until 2-3 A.M. to close the store.
good,"If you don't mind being on your feet from 4+ hours a day and doing absolutley nothing then cool, this jobs for you. I honestly did not enjoy working here. Apart from not doing much, i felt i did my best yet the managers were always unhappy. My shift usually started at 5. I would come in, help customers and straighten the shelves, and be done by 7 and there would be no one in the store."
good,I assisted customers and managed my department while also working the register. This helped me better multi-task while still preforming at a much higher rate.
good,boring place. horrible hours. really thats it. human resources really looks down upon the employees
good,The store managers there should treat everyone the same!!! Dont play favorites!!!   Also make sure everyone gets fair hours and not just the ones that kiss your butt!!!!!!!!!!
good,"At BedBath&Beyond, they have very poor eating area."
good,Management is very poor and does not advance the strong employees. They expect a large amount of work with very little compensation
good,"As with most call centers Bed Bath & Beyond is no different when it comes to an all time high turnover rate. I think what drives people away is the everyday repetitive annoying calls, call quality metrics, angry customers (stress builder), limited schedule flexibility (no weekends off only granted to HR) and poor quality systems available to perform work properly. Changes are taking place and voices are being heard from what I've seen lately which have a slight impact as the overall working hours have been cut as well so that's a plus, lunches remain to be an hour so that's also great! Periodic spirit week and Birthday treats along with employee recognition parking is a nice gesture of appreciation."
good,"The only great part about this job was the free soda. The management was horrible I had a different manager every month. They were super strict on bathroom breaks and dinged your working score if you were using the bathroom. I ended up getting a bladder infection from holding it too long. "
good,"not enough hours, no growth, no raise, just a typical retail job with minimum wages. it was a part time job for me. no career opportunity. i didn't have to work on weekend that was beneficial."
good,"Some higher management, including district management, talk to you in a unprofessional, sarcastic manner. When you attempt to stand up for yourself and work ethic, your belittled. They expect you to move mountains and practically ""babysit"" associates that have no sense of responsibility or respect for the job."
good,"Not everyone was good to work with, sometimes management was lacking in all areas, praise was not given when should be. Over worked and underpaid but the people sometimes made it worth jt"
good,It felt like I was always walking on egg shells. The managers were always in horrible moods. Expect to always get in trouble if you work here. Not everyone is bad but it’s very click-ish
good,"At first, it was okay. I was able to make a few acquaintances who helped me through my entire time of employment, but after a while the manager worked us like slaves for little pay. There were times when they hated when the workers would call off due to being sick so even trying to get sick days were a hassle. The job is okay if you want temporary work, but not long term."
good,Several management changes that the culture was always changing.  Not a secure environment to work. I was hired part time and they would schedule me near full time hours so I didn't receive benefits.
good,"This is a great place for young students and retired people to work, or as a second income. You can't sustain life working this job. There is very little room for advancement. The environment is friendly."
good,The store is very much up on the new items. The staff is very confident with their knowlege of the merchandise within the store. They have many bargains for college students for their dorms.
good,"This job is very slow, if you like  a slow paced job then you'll like this job. The management suck, if you tell them about days you need off they totally ignore it and still schedule you on those days. They also change your schedule last minute. Overall the job is not hard at all."
good,"Managers would have favoritism, unfair treatment of workers, underpaid,no opportunities to grow, system was a mess, untrained managers. Workers had to figure out how to fix problems because managers were not well trained."
good,Job duties are endless. Co-workers are impersonal as well as the management. No room for self improvement. Clique based environment. No chance of moving up the ladder.
good,"grea job but not advance, no raises. Only good thing about it was the flexible schedule. Was there for 5 years and no advancement. Great experience in what not to look for in a job."
good,"Managers weren't organized, the systems are so old and outdated which made it harder to work,  the breaks were so short, the store was unclean and the sales staff was expected to mop, vacuum and clean the bathrooms. It could have been better....."
good,"Long and hard days not much help if any. Taken off your job to cover "
good,"A normal day at work is usually fine, but this is never a relaxed environment. There is always something they can do, which is not for everyone. Management varies based on which manager is working and it makes for a sometimes inconsistent workspace."
good,i have worked there for two years and its honestly one of the worst jobs you could have i wouldnt suggest working in an establishment such as bed bath and beyond
good,it was fun at first but later you were having to do literally everything. pay was way below what they work you for. people would always quit or just not show up
good,"It was ok for a little while but I would not recommend working here for a long period of time. It very busy, you have to deal with a lot of rude customers."
good,"Fast paced, Teaches communication skills; hardest part is holiday rush and rude customers; workplace culture is very diverse; flexible hours are usually available."
good,Its an alright place to work but not for full time.  if you need some grocery cash its not too bad. I would only go back if in a pinch. Not a fan of having to focus on sales.
good,"A learn as you go environment, with a training program that lacks implementation. A company built on customer service, that is constantly reducing service to the customer. Constantly redoing others work due to managements' denial of the issue. The workplace is a typical retail environment with busy and slow times. Fulfilling a customers' wants and building a relationship with them as repeat customers is rewarding."
good,"I worked at the Customer Service desk. Helped customers with wedding registries and finding items in the store. Short breaks, long hours during the holidays."
good,"Extremely high demand of employees with very low pay or benefits. It is a position in which being required to lift heavy objects, constantly stuck heavy items and climb 30 foot ladders ended up not appealing to me."
good,"A typical day of work at Bed Bath & Beyond is full of ridiculously rude customers who are only interested in saving money. I used to genuinely enjoy helping people until I started working here. "
good,"I did not particularly enjoy working at the store that I was assigned to.  A typical day was very stressful because I was almost always working the customer complaints/service desk and I was also the youngest employee on the team.  The most I learned from my time there was that if you have a problem, keep your head down and deal with it because the management sure wouldn't.  My co-workers had the same attitude as I did and we all commiserated together. I did not mind working there because it was a job that I needed, but I was highly disappointed with the managements treatment of their employees."
good,I love working in an office setting but there was little to no structure at all. Management was all over the place and very childish. The pay rate is good for a college student home for the holiday/summer season to make a few extra dollars. There was no room for growth or advancement in the company or to maintain a social life as the hours were very long and grueling.
good,"This was a general retail job in which I learned the most about customer service. It paved the way for me to be great with how I interact with customers presently! "
good,Some of the management team is very nice. They are not very lenient with sick days unless you are full time. Customer service is great. They do care for their employees just not as much as they could.
good,"Very, very long hours. No time for Family life. Co-workers were very professional and easy to get along with. Loved meeting new customers on a daily basis. Hardest part of the job was not being able to see my kids. I was working 55-60 hrs a wk."
good,"The hours aren't good, and it's hard to advance. The hardest part is when is slow because you just sit around doing anything. "
good,Typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond assisting customers helping them understand the product
good,A typical day at work is assisting customer's at all times.
good,And they did not want to talk about them right now at the end of the day I still work there so in conclusion to me working there I do not want to stay on record anything about them
good,Bed bath and beyond is a good enough job for those that are going to school and want to make some pocket change while making that happen. Do not recommend for those looking to make a decent amount of money
good,"This place sucks. They don't like to promote based on experience, but on your social status. There are a few in management that genuinely care for the job but for the most part it's just a place to hang out. No accountability for your actions and very minimal supervision"
good,"Didn't feel welcome, training was absent. Hired as manager in training by district manager, unknown to store manager. Communication between associates and management is nil."
good,"Overall good place to work. Friendly and professional atmosphere, great team to work with and good experience as a retail associate. i enjoyed meeting people and helping to find the things they where inquiring about weather in store or on line with their beyond store."
good,"Process reports, deal with vendors and project managers, update calendars, fast paced, stressful, flexible hours, outdated technology, IT Dept unresponsive to needs of associates"
good,"Management made my life miserable.  I was hired to work with customers recover stock and sell merchandise. "
good,Compared to other retail jobs I've had this has been the least stressful. The management is good depending on who you get. It's very easy to get days off.
good,"I had been working at BBB for close to two years when they decided they needed a lead for Hardlines, I was up for the position and had been working hard as a sales associate who cashiered and was a bridal consultant. The job was given to someone who refused to go up and cashier and refused to use the back stocking procedure because it was too complicated for her. Nice lead.. when I told them I was leaving g to work at Goodwill they general manager said I was leaving to work with the fleas."
good,The people i worked with were amazing but the hours sucked and as a part timer you barely got any hours. I did just about every role for the company from associate to customer service associate and got paid $10/hr. Not much room for advancement.
good,"When I was hired I was told that there will be a shift bid coming soon. As long as you show up to work on time and get good QA scores you can change your schedule. Fast forward to today still no shift bid. Apparently they aren’t doing it anymore. Morning shift get voluntary time off, shift give aways and the benefit of leaving work and it’s still light outside. Nights get absolutely nothing besides there entire day at work. Wake up go to work get off late just to be back the next day."
good,"Typical day early morning working  "
good,"Not a terrible place to work, but they definitely play the favorites card when it comes to the way they treat and reward their employees. This is a place where hard work might not pay off...."
good,"There is so much I have to say, but in summary the people are really good to work with, but the management is very poor. Don't expect too much from them because they don't care about you...they only use you when they need you."
good,"Each store is different. I worked in Olathe, KS. The management at that location recently changed for the worse. Previous management was well-liked and highly respected; heard employees and understood that life happens. Current management acts like he was given the short end of the stick and doesn't seem to enjoy being there. Since the changeover there was a mass exodus of good employees, including myself."
good,I have not worked for this company for many years. I did enjoy working for this company while in school to better my life. Was a great part time job that worked with my currents needs then..
good,"Although the first year of working there, it was great. But, they don't care about their employees and there's no job advancement. People come and go all the time. They cut hours for people who are working part-time. There were several times where I had to work as little as 10 hours. I couldn't survive on that."
good,"Normal retail job, customers can be rude, no benefits because of working part time hours, not very flexible with days off, employee discount was the same or worse than store coupons"
good,"The managers do not communicate with one another. They do not complete their own designated tasks and assign it for associates to do. Customers expect for you to hold their hand while they shop. Many of them are privileged and racist towards employees. They do not follow the law in where an employee lunch must be scheduled 4 hrs in. For example, if you are scheduled to work 3-11 they will schedule your lunch at 5 pm because they do not want associates going late. They also are under staff because of the minimum wage is going up and they expected employees to do maintence work when the maintenance staff is off. They also do change your schedules last minute before communicating with associates."
good,"You have to be able to deal with a wide variety of customers that tend to try and abuse the return policy.  The return policy is ridiculous, so it's fairly easy to abuse.  My managers were pretty bad, and they had over-hired so no one was able to get more then 15 hours a week.  Also, there was very little training and explaining of tasks.  Maybe other stores will be better, but the fact that the only benefits you get is a discount that is the same as the coupons you get every week in the mail, and they just last year let go thousands of employees, I think it's just company dynamics."
good,I think the new work schedule will cost them more good employees than they realize. A lot of good workers will leave due to this especially with it being forced on them in the middle of the year right at their peak time.
good,As a customer it's a very fun and friendly place to shop. If u ever shopped there u will find a great variety of unique products that u never thought existed.
good,"I wouldnt give this dying employer anything above a bare moderate review, because the corporate big wigs dictate without having the perspective in the store, and it falls downhill to everyone else."
good,"A typical day at work for me was answering emails from our customer service, troubleshooting & processing orders."
good,The manager does not seem to understand how things go she expects things to be correctly and done on time she tries to give direction but does not give me correctly the customers and employees are overwhelmed because they need help in the employees are not trained right we can get new coworkers in on the same day of the training they are put on the floor to help customers in whatever department  I feel like it is my time to go and find a proper job with more pay
good,Managers have very high expectations but don't expect them to stay long.  I had 4 different general managers and probably 10 different floor managers during my 2 and a half years there. They expect you to meet sales goals but we don't have even close to enough customers to meet them.  They also limit all associates to under 25 hours.
good,"I personally enjoy this job due to the people I work with. Although I enjoy the job, they expect you to complete multiple peoples jobs daily without going in to overtime."
good,"this was a temporay seasonal job, I wasnt there long enough to get any benefits or advancement, it was enjoyable, I stayed very busy and the day went by very fast"
good,"Onboarding is incredibly informative for new hires, and the company looked to continue the training with refresher courses in all departments.  Department leadership severely lacking in organization and planning- frequently changing focus of where the priorities within a respective department lie.  Management would often  dangle carrots of ""promoting"" or something being ""good for your development"" when the reality was the task given out was only to make the manager look good with no recognition given to the associate and/or team behind it.  Internally promoting was an absolute pipe dream unless one dedicated their lives to the company, or had connections above store level."
good,"Positively interacting and greeted each person, and directed inquiring guest daily. Stock shelves with quality goods on the floors. Introduced customers"
good,it is a fairly simple job but without management being willing to assist you it makes the job seem impossible. once the management is all on the same page and begins to see the employees as people instead of numbers their employment rate and performance rates will sky rocket.
good,"The work at Bed, Bath, and Beyond was average for a retail store of it's caliber. The work was tedious, but doable. The issues I had with BBB was the poor management and even more poor turnover rate. Employees were left to themselves most of the time while the management sat in the wedding office. When any issues were brought to the manager, they were ignored."
good,The management is the worst management I have ever experienced.  Corporate management is even worse and don't care about their employees. They force you to roll play even when you don't feel comfortable doing so with certain corporate employees. This was only a temporary job and i don't feel like i should've been placed in certain situations where i felt uncomfortable.
good,Every job has its bad days but here it seemed i had more bad than good. The people i worked with were ok but management would have to be my issue. Some in charge would not do what was needed to keep the store afloat.
good,District Staff ran the store and did not allow Managers in the store to have opinions about the people that worked for them.  Didn't allow staff to have input on promotions or advancement.  BBBY prides itself to be a neighborhood store and claims it allows managers and associates to be creative and chase things but the District5 Manager had to have the say in what you could chase for the store and where you could merchandise things.
good,"Many times I was scheduled on days or at times that were against my availability.  Every time that I called and told my managers that I was not available to work that day or time because it was against my availability they got mad at me for not being able to work on those days or at those times, and I was the bad guy for wanting to go to church or having classes."
good,"Pulled a stock replenishment report and pulled the items that were sold the day/night before and restocked them on the shelf. What I learned is that the customer is not always right, the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, the most enjoyable part was working with the co-workers that I enjoyed working with."
good,Allowed my professionalism within customer service to grow. Afforded me the ability to deal with a large diversed staff as well as customers. Which allowed me to grow tremendously with problem solving.
good,"Very busy and high paste. Not flexible with scheadualing. "
good,"Work was monotonous."
good,this place is good for young teens not living on there own. Great associates some were rude and management but okay could be better
good,"i worked seasonal for Bed, Bath and Beyond. It was very chaotic and unorganized in terms of management. Not too bad of a job, but would not recommend."
good,Good place to work. Friendly coworkers. Always busy throughout your work day. Always helping customers find what they are needing.
good,I learned a lot about products that i didn't know in the past. For the most part I enjoyed working there. I wasn't able to advance in my other line of work.
good,"At first it seemed like a great place to work. I was repossessed on my first night of work and called immediately to explain this to my manager just in case I had trouble coming in to work. He understood and told me not to worry. Upon returning to work I started to realize everything that happened to me and I explained to management would turn into gossip between other associated as well as management. A year went by and I continued to go into work without problems. I understand having a year like mine would annoy anyone but that didn't seem to be the issue. After 15 months I was finally fired after being humiliated by HR, the store manager, operations management, cashiers and other associated all in 2 weeks time. I expressed my concern to HR who retaliated with terminating my employment due to problems with a brand new vehicle and my favorite reason ""You are unable to bare your own weight"". Essentially I was let go for being too fat and for Honda building a lemon that was unsafe for the road."
good,"Customer service is really important to the company, ""the customer is always right"" motto. "
good,"It is what it is, As we know any retail job is good for college students and people who want a flexible wartime job. Not a good place to make a living. The company offers opportunity to move up but for those who are very dedicated to fallow a management path."
good,Every work day is busy with multiple interactions with customers. you learn about almost every product in the store and have universities weekly. Co workers are friendly. Hardest part of the job is helping customers who are less than friendly. Enjoyable part of the day was learing in the universities.
good,i like my work team they are fun to be around and when its time to tackle work and get moving everyone knows where their place is ....
good,Bed Bath and Beyond does not encourage people to further their education in order to increase their chances of promotion
good,Bed bath and Beyond is a simple job to have. It doesn't require much thought process and you learn about everyday household items. Management is usually easy to understand and easy to get along with. You will definitely meet some interesting people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. the most enjoyable part of the job is feeling a sense of pride when accomplishing a task.
good,"it was a great experience, on the other hand managers need to learn how to work with their employees, and make them feel like they are part of the company."
good,"typical day: clock in and stand behind the till helping customers till lunch then same thing in the afternoon"
good,"i enjoyed working with public and high energy store , always had sales going on and will take merchandise back anytime even if its 2 years old and used heavily !"
good,"Always something to do weather you're getting things done in your department or helping a customer. Management is always giving you product classes to stay knowledgable in what you're selling. Fellow co-workers are the same as anywhere...you have your slackers and you have your hard workers but everyone tries to help on some level. Management doesnt really praise you for your hard work, Instead they give you more work with little pay. Getting full time with this company is difficult so unless you're just wanting a part time or second job, I'd look somewhere else. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting your customers what they came in for in store or via our online store."
good,"Never get enough hours to live on, manager is nice at start but will ignore later on no since of purpose there just feel out of place and unwanted by the older employees"
good,"Over the past five years I’ve learned so much while working for BBB. I’ve been blessed enough to have transferred from one state to another. I’ve worked full-time while in school and made more friends that have become family than I ever thought was possible. Although over the years I’ve noticed how the company has changed, they don’t show respect or value to good employees and have lost a lot great employees due to their lack of value, benefits and respect."
good,They give you more work. Not more pay. Inconsiderate with the hours. And have some unrealistic expectations of employees. Management makes me dislike the job. Fellow co-workers was the reason I stayed.
good,Started off as a part time associate and got put in a full time position. There has been a lot of turn over across the company from associates to managers to even the ceo of the company. Not looking too good.
good,The management could be better. As well as the organization and environment of the store. The job itself wasn’t bad. I also feel as if they had favorites which affected a lot.
good,"I am a High energy individual love to work with fun motivational, energetic individual and I'm also a team player. I'm able to train and motivate others to keep going when the going gets tough."
good,"There was a customer service and team culture years ago, but that’s all ended. There is no more room for advancement and after all of the firing of Managment the few left standing are unsure of their job security. It has become a very stressful unbalanced work environment. I’ll will miss the people when I find something new but definitely not the current state of business. They’re unfortunately trying to fix a way too broken system and there is no one running the ship."
good,"The job of sales associate is much faster pace than the position of cashier. You interact with a lot of customers, and have to maintain the appearance of your section. The hardest part of this job is trying to make every customer you interact with happy."
good,"Compared to most other retailers they are pretty flexible with schedule and availability, and they are not super strict with management . There is a lot of clientele and often times understaffed and a very inefficient way of handling situations"
good,If you want easy pay with little to no work this is the job for you. Nothing was too difficult and the job itself was meaningless. Although the other employees were nice they were not driven to succeed in anything else.
good,"If you want to be treated just okay and an employee, this is the place to be. I currently work there, and let me tell you, once you're trained enough, you're on your own."
good,Cashier was fine. Autocratic boss who like to intimidate you and a boss that needed to impress upper management. Had social clicks like high school. You had to dress to be a cashier but had to clean bathrooms (contradictory roles) they need to higher someone to clean bathroom. Cleaning bathrooms should not be a cashier job.
good,it was ok not enough hours however co-workers are very nice most mangers were also very nice just no paid time off for part time which really isn't good
good,Managers do not treat associates well and expect things that they cannot accomplish given the parameters. The managers do not listen when associates say that something is wrong and needs to be fixed.
good,"Hours only a little flexible, pay not high enough for how much work they have you do - you could be hired as a cashier and trained all over the store but get no pay raise. Raises are only 1 per year and mine was only 20 cents, not nearly enough. Pay was low to start with and there was no base pay, everyone made different amounts and it was frustrating."
good,"Not taken seriously while trying hard to a higher position. Also, kept later than scheduled constantly because I was taken advantage of being set on wanting perfection."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is not a bad place to work. It’s stressful climbing ladders to get merchandise but I got used to it. We do not get long enough breaks and the management was awful and rude. If it weren’t for her poor attitude. I’d still be there.
good,Very flexible if you are not a manager. Managers are over worked and underpaid. Turn around rate is very high. Store managers are usually helpful and looking to promote
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was transitional position. I learned about the retail industry. My work was not confined to one type of work. I did several different duties including cashiering, shipping and receiving, etc."
good,"In my opinion, it's a relatively okay side job. Probably not a good main job. Low amount of hours to offer, no benefits other than discount for p/t. Erratic or spontaneously emotioned management. Short breaks, if you get one. Not very organized, and stressful."
good,"The managers (2 in particular) are very condescending and quite cliquish. It’s like the people who’ve worked there longer have a higher status. When I started, some employees even told me that people didn’t usually stay there long directly because of said managers. As far as company mission goes, it’s pretty simple; Customer Service and safety. The regular employees are amazing especially the ladies on the front end. It’s pretty easy to get in. There is some work drama though. I recommend using a paper app to apply. You get an on-spot interview when you hand it in. My main issue with working here was that I was constantly scheduled to close i.e. moving a ton of freight by myself. And that is no one person job. It moves a little more swift with 2 people, better with 3 but 1 person doing that is no bueno. And I stated to the manager on my end that I couldn’t do it and he assured me he’d have the schedule tweaked but 2 weeks later I’m still alone on Saturdays. I will say tho once you get over the “I don’t want to be here” (first 15 minutes of clocking in) the day work wasn’t really too tedious and it went by quickly."
good,"Working at bed bath and beyond is a good part time job for older teens and college students, but I would not want to be there full time because it is too stressful."
good,Always working on the floor never time for your paper work.  Store employees good to work with.  District Managers hard to work with.  They didn't care about what was going on in the store just want you to say ok.
good,"For a call center this job is not bad but its run like a daycare.  Its slow right now and you're not allowed to do anything at your desk in between calls except talk to your coworkers for which your continually being told to be quiet.  No crafts, puzzles, knitting or crochet, no books, no reading, no surfing the internet so for 3 hours a night all you can do is stare at the walls and try not die from boredom.  You will be constantly told how poorly you are doing even though your monthly scorecard says otherwise.  The pay is good but management is terrible, they have no support on the floor and the three people who can help you are always busy doing something else.  "
good,"high stress environment with very rude customers, I've never been treated so poorly "
good,"Nothing to hate or dislike about Bed Bath & Beyond, but there is not really anything special about it either. Good entry level job for highs school students or college students."
good,The people that I worked with is what kept me with the company for so long. I became bored with the job and no one provided advancement opportunities or professional development was offered too late.
good,Great customer service. Great people working for company.  Great discount offer.  Need to review medical and dental benefits.  Structured environment.
good,"Bed Bath& Beyond is a great place to work if you're looking for a part time position. The hours are flexible, and the jobs are relatively easy. But they expect A LOT out of their lowest level staff members. During a typical day you're almost always understaffed, and one person is required to do the work of multiple. As a full- time associate they are still willing to work with you, if you're in school, which is nice."
good,"La administración es de puertas abiertas pero los jefes siempre tienen la razón, los supervisores o managers de cualquier área son su jefe, la seguridad no es lo primordial, lo importante es la producción, no tiene buenos beneficios en salud por parte del empleador, si se aseguran que sus empleados tengan sus 40 horas semanales no devuelven a nadie a la casa, seria buen trabajo si el pago por hora fuera de 2 dolares mas el trabajo no es fácil."
good,"I personally like Bed Bath and Beyond but retail is not the career field I want to go into. Even if it was there is little to no room of lateral growth at this company, or maybe just the location I was at."
good,"What attracted me to Bed Bath & Beyond was the competitive salary and opportunity for advancement, Unfortunately the Company tends to overload at the Manager Position, which gave little to no chance to move up the ladder. Customer Service & Safety were a priority,which is the conduit to the success the company once had. Online Retailers began to affect the bottom line, which began to create uncertainty for numerous employees."
good,My time at Bed Bath & Beyond was an easy flow of work but the management kept me right at 39 hours a week in order to not have to pay me full time and they paid me minimum and while living in the state of California I could not pay my rent on that
good,"First job i had. "
good,You must be ok to climb ladders all the time. And everyone rings on the registers when needed. the hours are long and there never seemed to be enough people working.
good,Some managers came and went and some were better then others. They will constantly ask you what you are working on and it gets very annoying very fast
good,"Bed bath offered no train to employees promoted to supervisor or managers.  They conducted themselves the the bad managers they served under.  The cycle just repeats it's self.  The are experimenting with a new IT structure which is horrible and confusing.  In my group there was little to no training or mentoring it was give me and never here is some.   They bait you by giving you money up front but there are no real raises or bonuses after two years you are way under the industry norm.  They promise you a sign on bonus (Don""t tell you it's stock) which you can not touch for 5 years and the value never reaches what you where promised"
good,"-Management were friendly sometimes"
good,This is an easy job style with flexible hours and typically flexible management. A typical day includes assisting customers in the best way possible which includes customer service and on-floor help.
good,"The best thing about the job was the pay. The upper management has a poor view of balancing home life with work. The actual company policy states they promote a culture of criticism, not the most encouraging place to work."
good,"I learned about store products and key selling points and customer relations. Management friendly.Nice, friendly  supportive culture. Hardest part of job was poor pay with little hope of advancement and embarrassing raises.Most enjoyable part was staff relations."
good,"Use Bed bath as a stepping stone to go to a better employer."
good,Normally the store isn't that busy but due to the weather getting nicer its pretty busy. I woke in the baby section of the store so my ora is pretty different from the rest of the store.
good,"I typically begin my day, by printing out the notes for the department i am scheduled in. I have learned the products and their use so I can provide useful knowledge to customers.The workplace is steady and fair. The most difficult part  of the job is having multiple cutomers and trying to maintain tasks while assisting multiple customers at one time."
good,This job will teach you just about all you need to know about the home materials from the bedroom to the kitchen. The people who great. The only things is that you can only be part time unless promoted to another position.
good,"Typical day is cashiering and stock."
good,The job is very stressful but it helps build tolerance and learn more on how to handle difficult situations. You will learn to work under pressure and make the most out of it.
good,The employees weren't all nice but the customers were great. There were rude managers. They made me do more than one job when my title only gave me one job.
good,Management isn't very good at communicating. Toomuch gossiping occurring in the work place between the management. Poor hours are given
good,"BBB makes a good starting job, but if you expect to move up in a business, I would not recommend staying with the company. If you apply for a fronf end position and would like product knowledge, you basically have to do it yourself or keep bothering management about getting ""classes."" "
good,"Very busy and lots of Managers on duty , lots of different projects that need to be completed everyday and new freight that needs to be back stocked or put away every morning. We completed online orders and over the phone orders"
good,Retail experience at it's best. Return policy makes job open to anything in customer service.  Smile and having patience is the only way to be here.
good,"This job was an ok starting point. I'm ready to start a career that I can continue to grow in. Working with this employer was a great opportunity, however I need a more stable place of employment suitable to help support my child."
good,"The day sometimes started at 6 am and didn't end until 7 pm. Constantly busy. Co workers were good, Hardest part of job was pleasing the DM, Regional Manager and VP every Tuesday. You think you are doing good by increasing sales  and they would destroy your momentum in 1 second. Never satisfied and never gave any praise or thank you for all the hard work."
good,"This job was fun when I was younger, learning different departments and also learning about customer service and how to deal with people which gave me what I needed to help me today."
good,"A typical day at work involves me greeting customers and helping them find items or give ideas of items that may work for them. I also help cashier when asked. I learned that people can be complicated from time to time, but with a positive attitude you can make any situation enjoyable. My co-workers are nice, but not everyone tries to work as a team. The hardest part of the job is doing the same thing day in and day out. The most enjoyable part of the job is engaging the customers and meeting new people."
good,"Very fast paced work environment with little to no variation in daily tasks. Supportive management, extremely focused on numbers and sales. No room for advancement unless hired as a manager. Most enjoyable part of the job was doing bridal tasks and getting to work with newly weds and engaged couples. Due to the large amount of customers attending the store we dealt with quite a bit of unsatisfied or unruly guests, which taught me to keep composure in stressful situations."
good,"No Bonus opportunity for Managers"
good,Bed Bath and Beyond doesn't require all to much to work there. You just need to be able to talk to customers. The only thing I don't like about the company is that it is very hard to terminate bad employees and they don't hire from with in the company when they are looking for assistant managers. This leads to a disconnect between the new manager the regular employee.
good,"I learned what team work is really like. There was good communication between the managers and the employees. Everyone would come into work and know exactly what the need to do, no micro-managing."
good,I started with this company in November 2005 and decided to part ways with this company in 2015. After transferring to Ohio from the Charlottesville VA location I was quickly promoted to inventory control a position that is set up for the person in that position to fail. In 2011 I wanted to move into a customer service manager position and was not promoted. Around year 2009 it is my opinion that the changes made in management took a turn for the worst. HR management for this company are not big fans of women of color.
good,Nice job. Coworkers make it a better place. Management and corporate made rules that they did not even follow themselves.
good,I learned how to timemanage. work through large amounts of incoming product & customers.
good,I have learned a lot working at Bed Bath & Beyond. I have learned a lot about the receiving process and what to do with everything in they aspect of Bed Bath & Beyond. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the customers the products they are looking for.
good,"Messy, disorganized manager, RUDE co-workers, a lot of talking about people behind their backs. You normally won't get over 20 hours unless you are a manager but good luck with being promoted!"
good,just working as a cashier and dealing with different people everyday.
good,"What started as a great possible career choice has turned into an exercise in futility.  I worked my butt off for over 2 years for this company with promises of promotion and raises, but after 2 years have only received $0.55 in 2 combined yearly raises.  I regularly worked overtime and came in early and stayed late.  There is no appreciation for hard work and dedication, they just ask for more more more.  management in my store in particularly are only out for themselves and what you can do for them.  i would not recommend working for this company unless you like busting your butt and getting no where."
good,"A lots of things changed since I worked here, but I dislike management. There were all young and unattached from the job."
good,"I enjoyed working with the public; having a diverse customer base every day with different situations arising. I learned how to deal with various situations and different customer's concerns, however, there was always great turnover in the management team. Good work went unnoticed because of so many employees. They were quick to criticize without having knowledge of certain situations. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with management that did not know how to properly run the floor but I enjoyed working with the general public."
good,"I work the morning shift at Bed Bath &Beyond starting my day at 5am. The first thing I do is stock the floor with two of my co workers. After we finish the cages in every department of the store. We top stock whatever product that doesn't make the shelves, if top shelves get too full with whatever product we back stock the products in their specific location. Once we are done with that we move on to the U-boats, these carry all the large products that are in each department. Whatever doesn't make it on the shelves get back stocked. We use four foot ladders, twenty foot ladders, and dolly mores to stock the product."
good,"If you enjoy customers trying to steal everything, management not scheduling enough people, and people leaving on their lunch breaks and never returning, this job is for you!"
good,A typical day at work is helping customers on the floor at all times while balancing your daily tasks of the jobs you are assigned for the day.
good,"team meetings, customer service, inventory and replenishment for my department, on line orders telephone orders, straightening and down stocking of items occasionally jumping on a register to help front end when they get backed up."
good,"This was a pretty good job, they tended not to always stick to what staff was available for when they did scheduling. Turnover was very high and staff morale very low."
good,"Assist a lot of customers on a daily basis, and coworkers interacted a lot to each other for certain goals to be met. Management would always go out their way to help you out on a project."
good,When I first started to work there I was given little to no training. You kinda have to teach yourself how do to most things. The management is all over the place and all of them don’t do the same things. But over all it’s not a bad first job and the staff are all fun to work with
good,I would like recommend this company but I would like to see the Employees get treated Fairly because you’re doing your Job and a lot of other jobs in this company but a little pay rate they always cutting hours  so you might get 10- to 15 hours a week are you might not get any at all
good,"While working at bed bath and beyond, my fellow employees were all so friendly and ice to work with. I wish the pay was better with all that you are expected to do."
good,"Typical day was busy learning constant new updates to the policy and new products coming into the store. Bed Bath and Beyond is struggling to keep up with the changing times of online shopping. Hardest part of the job is constant change in policy and pricing. The best part is you can advance quickly if you are good at your job. I learned a lot about customer service, sales and promotion. I recommend this company to anyone looking to work a retail job."
good,"I enjoyed my time at BBB. But the managers were not great. You worked long hours with not much to do. I wouldn’t recommend it for a younger person , mostly older people work there."
good,Dress code is not followed and the allowed clothing is disgusting. Great place for lazy people. Be prepared if you like to work because you will be doing everyone's.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is restructuring, and getting rid of managers that are paid too much, regardless of performance. (At least that's what it looks like from within). "
good,I needed full time and wanted more day shifts and even after a couple years it was unavailable still. But if you just need a part time job for extra money (not money to live) then it is good.
good,"It was great working there the co workers were great. I enjoyed my opportunity there. Just management changed a lot while working there."
good,I worked at one location and loced it. There was fairness and great managment then when i was promoted and transferred the new store had 3 store managers in under a year and the lack of fairness and work life balance followed by no room to grow has forced me to find a new job with another company.
good,"All of my coworkers were great and supportive. We were all in the same boat, as cashiers and sales associates, so we understood the stress well that comes with those positions and helped each other out. The management wasn't the worst, but they don't do their best to support their employees. I had many coworkers even afraid to ask managers for support because they always had poor attitudes when dealing with us. The customers weren't bad either, but it is a very busy location so you run into all types of people, good and bad. You get a lot of hours during the holidays but you will work yourself to the bone."
good,"Good product, expensive product. They do carry everything you could want or need for the most part. Like any place it has its good and bad. Overall experience you do learn a lot about product they train you on everything."
good,"Didn’t like most of the managers there , they complained to much and didn’t like you taking days off. Only two Maher’s that I actually liked but the others were rude and one of them were young and immature. And it is a very busy place , and it’s hard to multi task when your not used to doing it at first. And they cut a lot of peoples hours . I barely had any hours only working twice a week. For literally only 4 hours at that."
good,Working there was alright in the beginning but I wouldn't recommend any one I know to work their and its also not a place i would of stayed for long term.
good,Pay was very minimal for work and training expected. Too many hours of overtime that are not compensated correctly. Assumption was given to work extra with no notice
good,Company is a great place to work the manager of Eservice was always on edge you never knew what the day would be like. The other team members are great very helpful when you are starting the job and throughout also if need be.
good,OK to work for as a temporary job. There is in some stores mis management and much favoritism. Your hours not consistent working needed hours per week.
good,"They are really flexible with your schedule but they never give you enough hours and expect a lot from you. Depending on associates, a lot of them aren’t team players. Management is something else.."
good,It’s okay while your in school but as a career wouldn’t recommend no advanced for growing or moving up. You might as well as move on management  isn’t very good either.
good,"Learn many different aspects of retail merchandising and sales; learn a lot about customer service. I know of a least one supervisor who quit because of the negative energy there. High turn-over; frequently understaffed. Fiona is sterling! Best supervisor in the whole place. Corporate is behind the times, however, especially in terms of information systems and customer access to computer technology."
good,"I mean, it’s retail. If you’re a student looking for a part time gig that’s flexible with your school schedule, this location (Riverdale) is GREAT at being flexible. Really understanding team, and in general you’re not micromanaged. It’s extremely hard to advance in this company though, which is why my recommendation is great for anyone in high school or college interested in part time. Other than that, please find something more stable if you’re looking for a full time position and good pay."
good,I absolutely hate Working for Bed bath and Beyond management is awful! Whyy am I still here? Im currently looking for another job but anyway they have their favorites if you know what I mean. They treat you like your the dirt on the bottom of their shoes! Its like high school all ober again  the managers gossips about everyone it’s completely unorganized there is this one manager whos been working with the company for a while and he doesn’t know anything you can't depend on him for anything. He’s very rude to the customers.!!!!! Its awful!
good,"Working at Bed, Bath, and Beyond was a place where I could really hone in on my customer service skills. Customer service is key working there. Most of the coworkers were friendly and willing to help when it was needed. Some managers were friendly, others were not. I would recommend Bed, Bath, and Beyond to someone looking into working in retail and customer service."
good,"While I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond I found that the management staff had unrealistic expectations for the sales staff. They would expect us to keep our side clean, put away stock and floor go backs, help customers, and be available to ring at a moment's notice. I found it hard to properly do my job while trying to get all my tasks done."
good,"in season relatively busy. while personally I have nothing against the management. it depends on their judgement whether or not you get advancement in the company. the hardest part of it is dealing with the disgusting customers who push their coupons, phones, cards and money in your face. the policies change almost every week. the most enjoyable part are my coworkers."
good,I loved working for the company until I wanted more growth and they always over looked me. I got along with everyone and goals and such were obtainable. Just never a lot of incentives.
good,Daily and weekly project game planning. constant filling. Do whatever it takes to get the job done. Department manager receive great training for the rest of their careers.
good,Women were payed less than men for the same job/skills.  Too much drama among coworkers.  Managers needed to communicate with each other better.  The Bed Bath and Beyond I worked at is now out of business.
good,"There is always something to do. It is the typical ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean"" type of working. Coworkers are generally nice, but management tends to be juvenile and occasionally unreasonable. Many roles at the same time, such as being customer service oriented always, and needing knowledge of most general products in order to inform customers and to up-sell/close sales. Obtaining orders within the location constantly striven for (although there is no compensation for this type of sale). It is difficult to advance unless manager suggests it, and it is still quite rare (especially for the younger demographic of employees). Job includes a lot of lifting and repetitive motions (so much so, that employees tend to develop tendinitis)."
good,"It was a part-time job during my school years. The manager and employees were nice and they did accommodate my study schedule during my exam. "
good,"I've learned a lot about the products."
good,"it's always busy and packed, I loved that about the job. really keeps you busy. hard part is angry customers upset with you because they lost their proof of purchase and had to receive store credit."
good,"Receive shipping detail as well as maintain a clean and clear docking area. Broke down pallets, stock and organize shelves, keep track of inventory and assist customers at checkout."
good,"The people that I work with are all generally really kind, and I've met some amazing friends here- the management is also good for the most part.  However, there is no room to move up in the company at all, no raises other than a 25 cent yearly raise no matter how many departments you're trained in, and the Christmas hours are absolutely nuts.  It is a very physically demanding job, and the pay doesn't equate to the amount of work employees do.  I think a lot of the problems with this company start at the top of the management chain, and there are definitely things that need to be changed to make it better for their employees.  Also, a lot of the customers are really rude and get mad at employees for things that they have no control over."
good,"Better advancement within the company should base on work not if they like you, better training programs for all employee well.  Better  benefit and pay as well"
good,"I was intrigued by the fact that I would be responsible for ordering and setting my own merchandise. Unfortunately, it turned out I had no assistance in doing so."
good,This was a very good company to work for initially.  They developed talented people and grew rapidly.  The retail environment changed and they fell behind.  Now they seem to be searching for how to survive in todays retail environment.
good,"Good people to work with on the floor."
good,"It’s difficult to get promoted past supervisor, they promote within to a certain extent. All managers are hired from different stores, even department managers."
good,"This job was only part time with no opportunities to move to full time. There was no room for advancement  because instead of promoting people who were already working at the larger store, they shuffeled people around and hired people from another place.  This is a good job for students or people looking for minimal hours. They will schedule around your availability. The coworkers were helpful and kind. Management was so/so. Depending upon who you were dealing with."
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond is in a state of flux.  AS with many retailers their brick and mortar stores are in competition with Amazon.  The retail industry is brutal.  During slow times they cut your hours, over the holidays you can't work enough.  "
good,"I most look forward to interacting with customers and creating a positive shopping experience. All of my coworkers get along and work as a team to make the most of our shift together. "
good,it  was miserable constantly bringing in new managers  customers complained about the cleanliness it wasn't great. not to mention the customers weren't always there somedays we would only have one customer
good,The job is okay it’s honestly something you want to make money at and if you can find better sooner go for it! It’s a temporary job I could never see myself working there for more than a year to save up for something. Personally I don’t like my job at all. You do way more than what your paid you don’t get time and a half on holidays. Also you get the same discount as any other customer would with coupons for 20% off your order. There’s no true benefits in working here just a job that pays.
good,"Great company to work with, although your never guaranteed hours or full-time because they only offer full-time to managers. Not much room for growth. Kind of a part-time job to make extra money when you have an actual full-time job."
good,Very nice environment but not for me. People are kind and my hours were  very flexible. I only worked there for 4 months and value the experience it gave me.
good,"When there were no customers then all you can do is organize your register.  You can never leave your register.  You will get punished if you help the customer too much, such as helping the customer to their car when they have multiple carts or too many bags."
good,Learning product knowledge being able to assist each and every customer Accordingly A typical day's work includes answering phones making outbound calls faxing failing  looking up products placing online orders The most enjoyable part about this job is getting to meet new people on a regular basis  If my customer leaves with a smile I feel my job is done
good,"Probably the worst place to work drama, unprofessional, employees stealing, do I even need to say more? Employees disrespectful to the customers or trash talking other employees in front of customers"
good,Depending on what manager you would work with it was a good day. The company would hire just anyone. They never recognize hard work from workers. They also wouldn't let you pass 25 hrs.
good,It is an ok place to work but we have double standards it’s suppose to be equally between associates managers and so forth. Our pay is less than most warehouses and pay scale within the various jobs are no where near what it should be. We do get paid time off and we have a point system when out without paid time off whichever you use they have remarks to make they say life happens but they don’t really want life to happen. Seems like the ones who work the hardest are always the ones in trouble with nothing being said to other associates.
good,"Bed, bath & beyond is a fast paced work environment with constant customer interaction. You have to be knowledgeable about the products that are carried in the store and ""never say no."" There is quite a few training classes to become well established in the store. Restocking and cleaning the store is daily routine and is expected from everyone. Typically everyone treats each other like family and works as a team to get tasks accomplished."
good,"Understaffed at times. District management cared less and less about store moral. When it came time for a promotion, I was judged by my department based on a week I was not even in."
good,Unless you get a cushy management job you will be working very hard for not much pay. If you just need a basic retail job and you are ready to not have any real training then you'll be fine.
good,"Job paid well for a part time retail position, but it was a stressful job and you would leave tired every time. They were flexible with their hours as well."
good,"A typical day is full of working freight and trying to figure out where to topstock the copious amounts of products that were ordered. Customers here can be especially rude, but customer service is number one here. I worked part-time but only got to work nights, which wasn't ideal for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the one friend I made."
good,"Relaxed work place"
good,Managers work 50-60 hrs a week. Comp time is not given. Overtime is expected. Raises are practically non existent except for the director. No bonuses.
good,Unless you are friend or family forget it! Nothing is very clear. So much gossip. I have not been at this location very long.  The manager seems to have favorites
good,I really didn't feel like I fit in at BBB.  The company works very differently than every other retailer out there.  It's decentralized so a lot of the decisions come from the field and not the buying office.  I left when the company moved to New Jersey
good,They do not have a viable working plan for the future of this company. It started out team oriented with an emphasis on customer service. They have cut the roles so much that everything cannot possibly get done.
good,"felt good to help clients order on line for products that were not in store ,show them how to save money give them great customer serves get great feed back from them so that i could make there next vist better"
good,"Brief retail job but hours did not fit with my academic schedule,"
good,"Of my years at Bed Bath & Beyond, most went well. I have little hard feelings with my position not being filled, but I was not allowed to retain it, after a move out of state fell through."
good,"Be on time every day, make sure that you have something to eat and drink. Make sure that any illnesses is taking care of and under control or you'll end up fired"
good,"Overall physically demanding job regardless of position. Upper management not very supportive of store staff. Extremely high focus on customer service as a culture, which is a positive thing. Merchandising skills and creativity is an enjoyable part of the job"
good,coworkers there are nice and help you out when you didn't understand things and it has it moments when it gets really busy but it goes by really quick.
good,This job is very physically demanding. Constantly on your feet with very high expectations. Communication is key. Task completion is expected at all times.
good,"I loved my management team but when I was hired I was led to believe I would be more than a cashier, but the trainer was never working and everyone else that was hired with me was getting the training I wanted while they just wanted to be a cashier."
good,"As a retail associate, I was always engaged with a customer or with organizing the floor. I definitely learned a lot about products and product merchandising. In my situation, I worked while attending college, so I worked with other college students who didn't necessarily have the same work ethic as I did. However, certain individuals in management had the ability to bolster the team morale and create an enjoyable work environment."
good,not that great of a place to start for your first job. it is a job were others are power hungry and if you are not at a secure (in profit) store then you will constantly find a low employee stay rate.
good,bed bath beyond was quick paced but slow at the same time. i didn't really like it as much because i enjoy being envolved and working with my hands. it gave me great communication skills and taught me about more responsibilities.
good,"As a Sales Associate, you help create the energy and excitement surrounding our clients’ products, by providing innovative solutions to guide customers to the right choice. it is a very fast paste, great team work . The pay isnt too great but the work is worth it.You will be able to pay your bills."
good,"I can't speak for every Bed Bath & Beyond, but the store I work in, as far as management goes, isn't that great. Communication isn't the best, and advancement is slim to none. As far as the work itself, with the required amount of people there should be in the store, it can be enjoyable! Customers are generally great, and product knowledge is something the company strives on when it comes to teaching. With the right team, Bed Bath & Beyond has the potential to be great."
good,not much to say. general warhouse stuff. does not pay well. management is terrible. co workers are ok. drive time and distance from metro athens area is too far.
good,"I enjoyed the simple ways to handle call volumes with customers inquiry for the company's products and offers. When management would start an incentive, they would never follow through. Advancement is very rare at this company and also the pay is minimal compared to the work."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a very simple retailer. Their focus remains two things, exceptional customer service and keeping the store full. There are very few reports that are utilized, sales are rarely discussed, technology is limited and the pressure to hit goals is virtually non existent. "
good,"A very noisy place to work, free pizza once in a while. You do get to wear your pajamas to work once in a while. How wants to wear their pajamas to work!"
good,"Always good day at work you learn new things every day. Learn great people skills. Management is good, they have well people to work with."
good,I enjoyed working at Bed Bath and Beyond. The management was nice and worked with school hours. The store manager also kept a fridge and freezer stalked at all times and bought us lunch about once every other week. The coworkers also became great friends of mine in such a short time. One even offered to let me sleep on her couch after only knowing her for a month due to flooding closing the road that I lived on. The only downside was that the managers had been there for 10+ and there was no room for promotions.
good,Was able to do a lot of things in a year. Managers are very unprofessional. A lot of competence for higher opened positions. Their raises are unfair and low.
good,"Working briefly at this place was really interesting. The customers were able to not only take advantage of the system, they weren't even addressed about it. The customers were able to use coupons that, although had an expiration date, did not expire."
good,"Assisting customers"
good,"If it is your first job in high school or just need a little money then its okay, but it doesn't pay enough to survive adult life and the management that was at the one i worked at was horrible. they had 3 different store managers in three years. the assistant managers also changed a lot so there were a lot of different rules, and confusion. The store manager, showed a lot of favoritism and never talked to employees instead got other employees to relay messages for her. It was a mess, no order what so ever."
good,"Standing on your feet for 10 hour shifts is not ideal.  Especially when you only get a 30min lunch break.  Dealing with the general public can be challenging, however management did offer several ways to de-escalate situations.  I did get management experience with direct reports.  For the most part, I had a good team to work with.  I emphasized, ""It only works if we work as a team"" and my employees respected my philosophy.  Learning how to work with different personalities and finding different ways to bring out the best in every employee to get the job done."
good,I was a cashier and the inventory control manager. They will keep you right under full time hours so you do not qualify for benefits. The compensation doesn't keep you above the poverty line and you will not advance within the company.
good,Not interested of expressing my thoughts about this company besides that the people there are great but they are not too many opportunities for job advancement.
good,"If you're interested in working for a secure company BBBY is the place to be. However, job growth is practically non-existent so be prepared to bring home that salary you negotiated from day one. This company is also archaic in their business structure. There isn't a work from home policy and vacation days are slim unless you negotiate for more. You only get the national holidays off so if you have children, be prepared to use a vacation day on Presidents' day. I work in the marketing department and I do arrive and leave on time so the work/life balance seems to be OK. I can't say there is much of a ""culture"" in this office. The most the company has to offer you is a catered lunch in December... and that's all. They're trying to bring up the retention rate but offering a trial ""bring your dog to work"" policy which has yet to be implemented. I'd rather get summer Fridays than see a dog sitting at my co-worker's desk. I have a biased opinion on management since it is a mystery to me as to how my manger received the role that she is in; therefore I cannot speak for everyone. If you sign up for the health benefits you only have one option so you'll be paying a $400 deductible throughout the year and $50 deductible for dental. The one thing you have to look forward to... a 2% raise in May. Don't spend it all in one place."
good,"Customers arent so friendly, but with good customer service you should fine.Every department smells sweet like differnt home aromas. The hardest part about the job was selling the monthly pick. Management could be better."
good,Loved helping customers and learning about all the products. My favorite part of the job was talking to the customers and getting to know them. Fun culture.
good,"A typical day at work includes talking to customers, checking them out and doing returns. I love the people that come into the store. I enjoy helping them save the most money by telling them which coupons will give them the most discount."
good,"I fold the towel section, clean up the aisles in the bathroom accessories aisle, and help customers. I learned some people are nicer than others. My co-workers were friendly people. The hardest part of my job was finding an item a customer needed but I did not know where it was either. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of happy and friendly customers after helping them."
good,"A typical day at work would include me replenishing the store of its merchandise from the day before. After, I would either work in receiving for he entirety of the shift or work on the floor as a sales associate.  Although I aim to learn something new everyday, learning new things is usually limited because I have mastered the jobs I fulfill. Considering I have worked at this establishment 5+ years, I very seldomly find the work I do challenging.  The most important part of my day would be interacting with the customers and building relationships with hopes that they would continue to shop at Bed Bath and Beyond."
good,I got to open up the very first BBB in Alaska. So from empty to full of neat product. I wish they had better hours and pay. Would like to have benefits
good,"When i first started here, I loved it. I went to school with all of my co-workers and the managers were great. I always picked up available shifts and worked a lot of hours especially for a part-time. Overtime though, it did get tiring because there wasn't opportunity to grow within the company. Even after two whole years, i wasn't even able to receive benefits or full-time."
good,A fast paced work place. Busy learning about all of the products and procedures. There is always training but very little time to get trained. The company expects a lot out of their associates in a very small amount of time.
good,"I love working here, but then I don't. Things would be a lot different if the manager didn't relocate. Thanks. I really miss all my co-wokers who were once there and are no longer there."
good,"I would go to Aardvark and help around. I learned with great perseverance I can do anything. In the beginning, everybody was very nice, but after they moved to a new building, everybody became really shady. People were stealing other peoples medications. My co-workers where very rude to me, the other workers, and customers. The hardest part of my job was to be around people who disrespect others. Although this place was ok, I still had fun playing, taking care of and being with the animals and other people."
good,"A typical day included but was not limited too:"
good,"Had to take customer complaints, one right after another. No breaks. the good thing is I did meet some nice customers"
good,"A typical day requires me to restock the inventory, assist as many customers as possible. I enjoyed interacting with customers and giving the best assistance possinle."
good,"I have gained more knowledge in retail, cashiering, how to build a relationship with customers, sales, and consulting bride and grooms with making a registry."
good,"fast paced, great customer rapport, fun, little room for advancement due to frequent management changes, great co-workers, great learning experience"
good,"A lot of stocking shelves, customer service, and unloading freight. Management was okay, not as willing to work with my school schedule. Co-workers were great and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor of putting freight away onto extremely high shelves and dealing with snobby customers. The most enjoyable part was working with great people and the discount on items."
good,"I enjoyed working with such wonderful people, I wish I could have stay longer"
good,Delightful to work with my employees on a day to day basis. I enjoy developing and training associates to increase their job performance knowledge. Working in retail management for the past 10+ years I've learn the importance of relationship building and teamwork.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is very inconsistent with polices and not a very honest company. for example. You are given X amount of hours to train associates, But the GM would schedule the employee off on the day he or she would be trained. I have sat in a office with GM and DM and listen to them bash other managers verbally and laugh. I have witnessed managers cut hourly employees hours in retaliation for personal reasons. I've witnessed managers use counselings in jest not for training purposes."
good,"same as every other retail store,lazy management ,favorite and non favorite co-workers."
good,"Consistently stocking the floor and top stock/high shelves(top stock). Learn good communication skills by helping customers and learn a lot about new products that come out. Management was constantly changing, so never really got to know them. Co-workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job is top stocking heavy items on very tall ladders. Most enjoyable part of the job was setting up new displays for the customers."
good,Work retail stocking shelfs. Customer come first management was in office.
good,"Bed Bath is a two sided coin when it comes to your overall happiness while being employed by them. On the associate level there is a lot of talent in these employees. Working with hourly employees was always very fun and engaging for both myself and customers. Bed Bath offers very good training on how to sell certain items in the store and allows you the ability to promote items of your choosing to ""chase."" However upper level management expects you to spread yourself incredibly thin to complete a large variety of tasks everyday. A typical day would first be to analyze any sales numbers to see what store sections are lacking and what can be done to change these numbers. Also following up on top items in the region to make sure you are featuring them properly to boost potential sales. Then helping customers on the sales floor since great customer service is something they focus very heavily on. Helping customers during store hours is done along with any department moves or rotations, freight prep, freight put away and also ringing on register when the lines become long. The ability to control what you feature and promote was always fun but it can be stressful to complete store projects in a suitable fashion."
good,"Well, after 4 years of working here part-time with no benefits and no advancement opportunities and constantly winning employee of the month, I say I wasted my time damaging my resume with this employee loyalty blot. Management usually comes in two types with this company: the ones who hide from responsibility and the ones who get their hands dirty with you. The co-workers are pretty typical teenagers with no work ethic and bitter adults who wished they stayed in school. The happy people are usually the ones passing through and luckily they outnumber most. The hardest part of the job is working with people that simply don't want to work. The most enjoyable part of the job...well for me it was my managers always stuffing the freezer full of ice-cream and buying everyone lunch occasionally for no othe reason but realizing happy employees make happy customers."
good,You have to work their a long time to get an advancement that's worth saying there for. Even if you are up for a promotion there could be another employee that has been there longer that would get it
good,"Great place to work, but was not consistent in available hours to work."
good,My typical day at work usually starts by examining how much overstock has to be processed in the warehouse. Then manually updating through the POG system.The hardest part of my day was deciding what to eat for lunch. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting an item to a customer thats not in stock on the sales floor.
good,"The managers were completely rude, Not professional not all, Cussed all the time and were not fair to all employees"
good,"Although the pay is usually good, the hours usually are not unless you choose managment. They do a great job in making sure you know the business inside and out and sometimes you get a taste of how to do everything but it causes confusion in job title when they have you as cashier, yet they always have you doing customer service, and dont give you certification for it."
good,"being a team player and help customers that need assistance finding items. Sometimes if we don't have the items that the customer needs, i will order it for them and have it send to there homes."
good,Typical work day is morning huddle go over task go to assigned departments and just assist customers. You get trained on the products sold which was helpful.
good,"10 hr days, inventory/ordering/customer service/training/coaching/hiring/promoting/yearly reviews/ loss prevention/safety work flow/ terminations/ transfers"
good,"Fun place to work but there is no real room for advancement.  Hours were being drsticcaly cut, raises not given.  Nice part-time job if you are looking for one but not great for full-time employment."
good,"Day to day was fine. The job honestly was not that hard at all! Management often bullied employees, which was not okay at all in my book, and left a bad taste in my mouth."
good,Great place to learn the basics of a retail store but other then that nothing to brag about. There is little to no job advancement opportunities for a regular employees. unless you start off in management you will be stuck in what you were hired as . So if you want to start low and work your way up it will not happen for you at this company. You literally have to quit and reapply for a manger position if one is open.
good,"Working at bed bath and beyond truly wasn’t awful. But when I first began I had only 1 day of true “training” which consisted of one of the manager telling me everything and how things worked. Went over things if I needed too bit it was SO much information in such a short time. The next time I worked I was immediately put on the floor and they wanted me to do things as if I had been working there for months! It is a fast paced work space and you NEED to know their products and what they offer because a lot of customers will ask for certain things and if you don’t know then they get frustrated. I’ve been in bed bath and beyond before but not too many times, so even so I’ve never really scoped out the place to see what products they have, where they’re located. If you wanna work were you need to study honestly lol. Know their product, know where they’re located, know what services they offer like the coupon system and the membership programs, etc.. now with management, that was a joke. They’re rude, unprofessional, get frustrated when I would ask for help or really anyone else. They’d go upstairs and talk bad about employees... it was just astounding to hear some of the things I’ve heard."
good,"I my point of view "
good,"For someone older this job is a good idea. but its not a good idea for someone,  who is young and wants to move up. Too much enthuse on beyond sales. That's it"
good,"When working with bed, bath, and beyond, I personally had a lot of fun and love working with customers that came in. Generally if you needed help with something, you could also ask fellow employees to help. They trained you for everything and made sure you were prepared for any situation. You had access to a lot of hours even if you were a part-time employee. The hardest part is sometimes not being able to help a customer because we didn't carry the product they were looking for. The best part was the satisfaction of helping the customer find what they were looking for and more."
good,Bed bath and beyond was my first job once I graduated from college. I quickly excelled to higher job positions within the first 6-8 months of me being with the company. A typical day at work consist of long lines and sometimes angry customers along with lack of staff. The hardest part of the job would be not having enough employees to help get the tasks done and complete within a timely manner.
good,"I was part-time while going to school and thought this would be an easy enough job, and it was for the most part. But the managers expect a lot from you and that can be tiring. I had a clear set availability but would still be scheduled on days that I had marked off, or for hours that I didn't have available. Sometimes the work environment can be unprofessional as my managers would talk bad about other employees right in front of me. "
good,"Micromanaging manager with more concern with detailed employee reports to find a reason to terminate anyone who isn't completely compliant, wrong or right, than being of support in any capacity to the team. Making terrible managerial decisions that cause the entire team to suffer. Snide and condescending and willing to lie to get rid of people. Backstabbing and two-faced going to great lengths to get rid of anyone that dares challenge his antics. Unsupportive, and completely lacking empathy and interpersonal skills. HR is NOT there for the employee but rather to sink an employee. "
good,"employees were amazing to work with... but there is no progression when it comes to moving up (part time to full time) and or more. easy to work, but just alot of wasted potential"
good,"Work was slow, until customers started coming in, then it got busy. I would not recommend working here unless you like restocking shelves and helping rude customers, while dealing with managers that always want more from you."
good,"If you are full time then good. If you are contractor then don’t expect more."
good,"I was working hard for nothing with no benefits, and not paid well. I was planning to leave there for a while until I found another job and then I did but it took a year."
good,The biggest issue for manager is that there are no  growth path for managers. Focus is placed solely on the numbers and not the care of employees including managers. One week vacation and no PTO.
good,"Bed and bath taught me alot of skills, It improved my customers service skills tremendously. I leanred alot about the job world from them. They are horrible about raises and hate if your sick"
good,"Some days can be very fact paced others can take a lifetime. Always work to do which is good, but pay is lacking for all the work expected. Pros are that other employees are great people. Good for an entry level job but didn’t find much room for improvement in the long run."
good,"A typical day at work was easy going. Unfortunately, once they've found an area they like to keep you in, you do not get to work in other areas of the store nor advance correctly. I was told I would go from cashier to on the floor, but instead they kept me in the Customer Service Area. This was fine for me! I loved working the customer service counter. If you're looking to work somewhere that doesn't get old, there's a possibility this would not be for you."
good,"Great employer before being traded publicly, then became the next over bloated corporation. Bad leadership and decisions that fell behind the times and kept it from being what it had promised to be."
good,"Hard work, long hours, never seems to be enough staff working to help the customers on the floor, ringing out and get the tasks complete.  Lots to do, tough job."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a really good place to work, but only if you seek a part time position. It's excellent if you are a college student, retired, or otherwise need a second job, but terrible for a full time position."
good,"Wasn't a great place to work. Wasn't the worst job I have ever had.There is no sense of teamwork among each section of the store. It was ""hard side"" vs ""soft side"""
good,"A typical day is spent helping customers and cleaning up after them as they walk through the store. I learned a lot about cookware, cutlery, and appliances. Management was rough, I have worked with them through a manager transition which was rough before and after. Most of the people I worked with were awesome which was nice, its probably the only reason I stuck around as long as I did. The hardest part of the job was doing all the tasks I was asked, which was a lot, for the rate of pay that I was receiving. The coworkers and some of the customers were the best part of the job."
good,My typical day of work consisted of finishing up someone else's job to get mine done. Then being pulled of of my job to help someone else look good to their boss. I learned that management only care about what is going on day to day when they ate directly affected.
good,"Ok place to work. Really don't know what else to say here, But I do need 150 more words, listen my children and you will hear about the Bed Bath review you all should fear....muahahhahahahah"
good,"Learned how to have a job; this was my first job out of high school.  Management was pretty okay, days often seemed long and there wasn't many chances to move up the scale."
good,"A polished and dynamic customer service offering a comprehensive Skill Which blends Experience in Cashier ,Clients relations ,retails and institutional sales.Well-versed In delivering exceptional customer service while maintaining the higher level of confidentiality .Quick leaner not intimidated by new challenges, responsabilities and situation.Employ a high-level of Professionalism in day-to-day work,enjoy challenging on an individual-basis, but also thrive in hectic, customer-focused , team work Environnment."
good,People are friendly. Not something you can support yourself if you live alone and pay all your bills. Good for someone who is looking to make extra money with a second job or those going to college or in high school.
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a good place to work if you are someone who is in need of a job and never have dealt with customer service before. This company will train you to deal with different customers daily and how you can work around to meeting sales targets daily. It will also prepare you for other corporate job opportunities if that is what is on the individuals mind.
good,Was hearing about the gossip of the day. The store is always a mess. They only have two good managers. The store manager isn't the kindest person. And other worker can get away with stuff other people can't. And the work environment makes you want to quit.
good,"A typical day at work will never be a cake walk, be prepared to walk, climb, lift heavy weights and deal with workplace gossip. The hardest part of the job is finding ways to prioritize and be prioritized. The easiest part of the job is dealing with the public."
good,"I was informed today that no employee is allowed to book off time during ""Black-out dates"", those being from mid-November until early January!!!! My anniversary and my grandmothers birthday is in December and the only time I am able to go home to spend time with my family is over the Christmas holidays, but apparently those don't exist at Bed Bath & Beyond. I am happy with my co-workers, not happy with my paycheck, not happy with the ""black-out dates"". If you don't mind working your butt off for less than $1 over minimum wage, then definitely come work here."
good,"Upper Managment does not have your best interest in mind.you need to Be self-sufficient and adaptable. figure out your priorities and pick up daily activities quick. Training is minimal, expect to be thrown into the deep end."
good,"Very, very, hard work for minimum wages."
good,Lots of downtime while being expected to still look busy and staying within a small designated area. The job expectations weren't very high as a cashier but when the customer flow was low it's difficult to keep yourself busy. Lots of complaining amongst co-workers about having to wear five different hats at once. Upper management was okay. They just tend not to listen to your preferred availability.
good,"Four years in started as enjoyable - with help all around, reasonable hours and friendly environment. It then turned into a mismanaged short-staffed workload explosion. "
good,Hard work and dedication is not rewarded. Internal promotion or hiring for higher positions was unseen. Promised training that was never received. Only supervisory positions were hired from outside the company.
good,good discount and hours the managers were nice for the most part but sometimes they could get annoying the pay was not that bad and the dress code was also flexible.
good,"Working for this company has taught me great customer service skills like for instance listening and emphasizing with customers problems professionally. Understanding exactly what they are looking for. Product knowledge is the key to helping each customer. I simply enjoy assisting each customer and their different needs. "
good,Great training. Learned a lot while i was there but the management was terrible. Spoke to employees in a poor manner. Always sided with rude customers who disrespected employees and nothing was ever done. Received the same discount as the customers.
good,Reviews don't help much each with each store you get different people and different kinds of managers. Don't rely on these reviews to much just go into the store and talk to people.
good,There are plenty of things to enjoy at Bed Bath & beyond!
good,"BBB is typical of many retail companies, but tries to convince its' workers that it's somehow better. Perhaps it was at different stores I didn't work at, or decades ago, before online shopping."
good,I was hired for my experience and skill in the furniture and design category but throughout my employment I was asked to do other tasks that were not within the direction I was first given.  I did perform at a slower pace to pick up these other duties but without direction I was soon trying to catch up with little hope of doing so.
good,"The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet on a concrete floor never being able to sit down. Very hard to take a break because of scheduling of only 1 or 2 people at cash register and the volume of business."
good,"In the 15+years I have been with the company the focus has gone from providing excellent customer service to generate sales and customer loyalty, to a more dollar conscious environment. The pressure to increase sales can be demanding and stressful,  however overall it's a good place to work."
good,Bed bath and beyond is a great place to work however they DO NOT promote from within and if you are in line for promotion you will more likely see a random person with no retail experience come in ahead of you before you get the position you have worked so hard to achieve.
good,doesnt get too busy so you just have to stay busy throughout your shift with new products. employees are all very friendly and tend to communicate with you during slow periods of the shift
good,Was not a bad to place but some of the employees were rude and I did not like most coworkers. Sometimes there will be no one on the floor and customers as well as you get upset that no one goes to help out.  Also they expected a lot from you as a cashier. During the day you had to be your own security and be aware at all times while attending a customer. During the night you have to clean the restrooms by yourself if you're the night cashier.
good,"Working at Bed, Bath and Beyond can be stressful at times. The management expects projects to be completed while having sell products to every customer. If you work nights you have to do freight and sell products as well. It is very difficult to do both. The pay is very minimal for the amount of work that is expected out of you. As a cashier you had to sell an item of the month and often times the product was hard to sell. The management would get mad if you didn't ask even if you knew the customer would say no."
good,"Store manager could care less about the store. Other managers their are good to work for. Better benefits would have been nice. However, its one of the most underpaid retail positions."
good,A typical day working at bed bath and beyond was working with both customers and co workers who could either be very distressed or very happy. The job itself was not bad but i believe the managers and the leaders could do a better job at interacting with the cashiers and sales associates. The customers were more likely polite so it made things easier whenever the cashiers would accomadate their coupons.
good,"A typical day at work was standing at the door for 7 hours with a 30 minute break. I have learned patience. The management was very bad. Paperwork did not get done on time and the communication was very poor. The hardest part of the job was the management, it was a tough management to please. The most enjoyable moment were some of the employees."
good,I've been with the company for almost 3 years and I have yet to say I LOVE this place. I love what I do its just the company is not that great to work for.
good,"I enjoyed the people I met at this job. Especially the managers."
good,"I have nothing I want to put in this field.   I'm a very positive optimistic type individual and being raised around wise parents and grandparents I was taught that if you have nothing worth hearing, then simply say nothing.  That was very good advice.  I have nothing I want to add to this field presently."
good,"Management change after three years of being there and it wasn't a good change. I was promoted and my coworkers started to bully me. My boss did nothing about the situation. However even though things got tough I learned valuable customer service skills, breaking down freight, teaching others about product knowledge and dealing with problem solving issues."
good,"Scheduling is on a preferred basis. Initially I liked the company, but quickly learned there's a culture I did not fit in with. In larger part the organization is filled with stores staffed with people looking to quit and frustrated with company. The company has a mission statement of customer service and safety. The store teams hate the customers and are likely to be injured due to the way the stores are structured with high walls, and the constant use of ladders."
good,"I don't know about other locations but this one in particular had too many visits from corporate which had no clue about what its really like being in customer service.  The company made too many demands on associates.  The customers are ok, you get those who claim to have left their coupons at home a lot.  The only thing that made me stay there as long as I have were the people I worked with though turnover is quick there."
good,"when I'm working there, everything is slow and sometimes the day goes really slow, i don't like doing nothing. But when everything is fast paced, I like to put in work, put in production. I'm more into the fast pace than being slow and bored all day"
good,"Engaging with customers was enjoyable and fulfilling. Management often can be demanding of employees. High stress environment, with a high pace requirement"
good,It was a fun place to work for about a year but after that everything started to go down hill it was no longer a place i wanted to work or enjoyed working at.
good,"Typical work day... 3+ large medical bins of other departments go backs, damages, empty boxes from items being stolen, employees calling out leaving you understaffed, incompetent managers that hide in the stock room... I would be scheduled for an 8 hour shift and leave after 10 hours most days. The only enjoyable part of the job was working over night, other than that there really are not a lot of benefits. It really depends on the store you work at, but 2 of the 3 stores I worked at were very dysfunctional and did not care about the employees that did their job."
good,No fulltime positions. All of the full-time positions are held by employees whom have been with the company for over 10 +years. Very face paced. Multi tasking is a MUST
good,I enjoyed the work there and the environment.  Also the team work that came with it.  Allowed a more personal experience with the customers.  And was able to learn about why you were selling the items you were and what was best for the customer.  The hardest thing about the job was understand the store as a whole and make the time to do all the paperwork and learn the things needed.
good,If you like a slow paced environment then heres a nob for you. Its very relaxing until it gets busy. Sometimes you're assing to work only 4 days a week. The gours are okay wish it was more hours given.
good,"BBB was a great place to work till after the recession, the company became less employee friendly and more corporate. They took programs away that promoted a place to enjoy going to work to a place where you did what you had to do to get by."
good,I got this as a temp to hire position. I hoped to make it long term but once i got inside i realized that i may have made a grave mistake. We live and we learn.
good,I was able to learn a lot of useful information about house wares. The work was very enjoyable. My reason for leaving was being under a manager that openly told me she didn't want me to move up in the company because she felt like her job was threatened.
good,"There is room for advancement but it is very difficult. The yearly raises are minimal , and the discounts are the same as the customers. I would not recommend staying here for long , but if you get a good set of managers , it could be worth the job."
good,BBB is a very friendly place to work but the pay rate compared to the assignment and the way calls are graded I feel very out of place and believe its unfair.
good,Pursuing the opportunity to enhance my career and use my skills to their fullest by securing a Regulatory Affairs in Pharmaceutical and/or Accountant in the Finance department position with reputable company.
good,I noticed that the management has a facade. The management is nice and welcoming at first but then they just expect you to show up with no support and have no regard for questions you may have.
good,Running freight that comes off the truck is a typical day at work. The job is easy and good for college students. You will learn basic customer service skills.
good,Typical day at BB&B started with stock on floor and would stay pretty fast paced all night. I enjoyed the constant work load I had been tasked to do nightly. I also loved talking to the customers and helping them out. Unfortunately the management team here was not flexible when it came to my school schedule and made it difficult for me to do both. Eventually they took me off the schedule and never attempted to work around my school schedule.
good,Great place to work and the management is very motivated in helping employees get to be bridal consultants and moving them up to bettering themselves.
good,"Working here was almost too relaxed, I was never challenged and was always bored. I did learn a lot about customer service and about how to make others happy and to appeal to the people in charge."
good,"I get paid $10 an hour to lift, climb, and interact with customers. They expect you to be a superhero and be everywhere at one time. Some of my coworkers aren't helpful at all, with customers or assisting at closing time, and still receive more hours than those of us who actually want to work. The managers expect you to do everything but do nothing themselves; they sit in their offices for about 80% of their shift. At times it's relaxing, when it's a slow day and I like most of my coworkers, but there are a lot of flaws that need to be worked out as a company. They are also very good at working around employees' schedules, such as second job or school."
good,Its fun to work with the customers they have so much energy and it promotes great business. They welcome our help and services. My coworkers and I work together to keep customers happy.
good,On any given day you would just be helping people find things and this can be hard because they use the most insane inventory system i have ever seen and half of the stuff isn't what they call pogged. In other words we have no idea where it is. Management is hit and miss as with every company. The hardest part has to be not punching the pain in the neck costumers asking dumb questions or wanting to use 10 coupons. The most enjoyable part is leaving. You are constantly pushed to get online orders but everything is so expensive people would rather buy from Amazon so it makes it hard.
good,"It felt like a inappropriate environment at times, even the managers were outrageous. Co workers were seeing each other, even the softside associate started sneaking off with the supervisor."
good,"A typical day at work is very tiring. Most of the time at my location, there are a lot of call outs so I often have to pick up the slack of other workers. I love the products I sell and learning about all of the products. Not much advancement available for this company."
good,"Relatively comfortable culture. Daily shifts include greeting majority of customers, helping them find what their looking for, and completing other daily tasks such as freight."
good,The people you get to work with are great but the customers are rude and mean. Because of this job I think everyone should have to work in retail at least once before being allowed to shop in any store. Be ready to be talked to like you're stupid.
good,At first I really enjoyed working for Bed Bath where I learned a lot. However I quickly learned there was little chance for advancement. During monthly or quarter month end employees were expected to work weekends and for me it was just too much.  Great people which I miss a lot.
good,"Depending on the Manager your experience can either be great or horrible. I worked in one store and had two GM's at separate times. One was a fat, lazy tyrant, the other was fair and had a great work ethic and led by example. I hated my time with the store under the tyrant but I loved it during the second managers stay. Workplace culture is good but somewhat coerced, Good place to work if you want to eat, sleep and breath your job and hardly have any time for anything else. Plenty of vacation time ONLY if you're management."
good,"Working in the receiving end of bed bath and beyond "
good,"Life At Bed Bath and Beyond was busy, with heavy emphasis on customer interaction. "
good,This is a job for teenagers or someone who like a boring retail job. I didn't learn anything because everything that was required was common sense.
good,Stress on safety but no concern on health and welfare of the associate. Next to no training. Sometime you worked alone. Everyone is friendly. If you are off for a long time due to an illness your hours are cut greatly.
good,"If you are planning on working with very unfair, self-absorbed, and insulting management, then go right ahead and apply for a job there! When the management does not appreciate the amount of work you put in for the place, or respect you for your efforts, it is self-loathing to work in such environment. Unfortunately, if it is providing bread butter for your family you are stuck working there until you find another job with enough pay."
good,"Nothing within the facility is hard to learn just takes time to get used to but once you get it the day to day process is quite mundane and boring. Some co-workers are a pleasure to work with while others start random and useless drama. Management has its goods and bads as well where some of them understand you are a person and will go to bat for you while others chose to blatantly lie to your face to meet their goals. Learned a lot here, started with no warehouse experience and i will be leaving with three years general experience plus the two years of inventory control and the two years of forklift they trained me to drive. Great place to start out if you are looking to learn and get your foot in the door to larger warehouse and production facilities. Most enjoyable part of the day is when we hit the time clock and don't look back."
good,As receiving manager the work place was always busy.  The work load always changed with the time and season.  I had to keep up with productivity. The job entailed working the sales floor as well.
good,"Most coworkers are great but more often than not you will be over worked, under paid and unappreciated. Almost nothing gets done because they don't hire enough people to work the registers so you spend your day ringing up customers but then get yelled for not doing a good job in your department"
good,"I learned a lot although, hours were cut drastically and there was no room for advancement within the company unfortunately. Management was not the greatest at times, but the staff were friendly and most relatively helpful."
good,"If it weren't for the fact that I have a really great boss, I probably would have left a while back. The store is perpetually staffed with just a skeleton crew, which creates a lot of coverage problems—they will pull people off the sales floor to ring, so at times, one person is expected to maintain an entire half of the sales floor. It's just not realistic."
good,"A typical day at work consists of ensuring the store is neat and well stocked, and exceptional customer service is given to every customer greeted. Management needs to communicate more efficiently. The hardest part of the job would be learning how to deal with each different customers need to ensure they leave with the right products for their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the incredible co-workers who go out of their way to help their fellow associates."
good,"Customer service, management was bad, lack of praise when you did a good job, pay was bad for the amount of work an effort given ."
good,I'm a customer service rep. Nice and friendly people who shop at our store.  Management is mostly reasonable.  Co-workers are fun to work with.  They really make or break the job.  Overall good working conditions.
good,"Overall I learned a lot being there. It was a good time for the most part, however it just is not practical. Unless you are a manager it is not likely you could live off this paycheck alone."
good,"the management is good for the most part but other employees make it a very unpleasant place to work, it is like a live soap opera."
good,"Working with so many products can seem daunting to some, but really, I liked it - so many cool things to learn about and try out. All things I learned about product was self taught - the training was almost non-existent. No matter how much I urged for details on products from management they'd just tell me to fake it and wing it when recommending things to customers. I didn't like that so I spent my own time researching products and reviews to better help customers. "
good,The management did nothing but watch others work. The most enjoyable part of the job here was getting to know all the regular customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the bosses.
good,Day to day work life at bed bath and beyond is slow in the morning and busy in the afternoon and evening. At night time is when the store can be slower depending on the time of year. This is the time when employees begin to clean up the store for the next day.
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond consisted with stock replenishment, customer assistance and cashiering when necessary. I learned about the various products and services available at the Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. The management staff can vary depending on store locality and each store can have different policies and procedures. Majority of the employees are temporary and part-time with no ambition to move up within the company. The most difficult aspect of the job is knowing what needs the customer has based on vague explanations from the customers when describing what they are looking for. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is the opportunity to freely move throughout the store and not be tied down to one specific location in the retail environment."
good,"I worked here for a little over a year. The people were nice and fun to work with, but after a while you start to realize that the managers cares about themselves only. They wont treat you fairly. The hours they give you are good at first, but then they suck after a while. There were good days and bad days. You don't get anywhere with this job."
good,"Working for BB&B Is interesting. My co-workers and customers are great, but management is sub-par. I'm not sure what the qualifications are to become a department manager for this company, but they need to screen people better. The managers are very unprofessional and they talk down, and embarrass the sales floor associates almost daily. There's not much chance of advancement here."
good,I work the floor and help customers find whatever they need.  I also do projects and put out merchandise.  The managers are easy to work for as long as you complete the task at hand.  It is a good workplace but there is no room for advancement and the raises are not competitive.
good,"The work environment is very.....""the customer is always right"" which may conflict with some of the rules and guidelines management initially set for you. It's pretty easy to be hired with the company but they work you to the bone and aren't fair with their wages."
good,A typical day at work is providing customer service and taking back returns/damaged merchandise from customers. Also placing special orders for items that customers are looking for but not found in-store. The hardest part of the job is balancing your day within different departments of the store.
good,"The company constantly hires new people, giving all the hour's to the new hires and not to the senior staff. "
good,"Bed bath and Beyond (bbby) was not afraid to give hard work. There was always plenty to do and a lot of physical work to be done. This was the hardest part of my job. However I did enjoy working in operations. Inventory control, receiving, organizing the stockrooms and merchandising. The management worked very hard but what I didn't approve of was the constant changing around of management. All in all I really enjoyed my time at BBBY."
good,"Management didn't really care about the store because the company in general didn't want to do anything to actually make the store work more efficiently. The hardest thing for me was being the most hard working girl (since only females work the customer service desk) up at the front. Their was at one point a position called 'front end lead' but the district manager decided that our store was fine with out someone in this position, which was false. I ended up doing the job with out the pay increase or benefits of having a key for the registers. It was this general frustration with the company that i decided I would be better appreciated elsewhere."
good,"A typical work day at bed bath and beyond ranged from detailing the truck of inventory, Opening, Pricing and sorting out with a four hour period. A disliked the lack of team members they would have on staff when more help would be needed. I found solace in only one co-worker who felt the same way i did about the company i worked at."
good,"Its not a difficult job. Retail in general is not really difficult. Customer service values are top priority. This is a great job for friendly motivated sociable people."
good,Must be willing to help and engage every guest in the same manner. overall a great place to work if you;re looking for a part time job.
good,"The best part about this job is the customer service being number one priority."
good,"restock the store while its closed,put merchandise in the stockroom go on the computer website to purchase items that we have little of, when store opens very heavy Customer Service with inquiries of items that we offer on Our Website, if needed, ringing up Customers purchases on registers, returns."
good,"No chance for management experience with my 25+ years of retail management, No opportunity for FT or benefits after 8 months after being promised a department management FT position"
good,"- Greeted customers and worked the register"
good,bedding and other household thing. different types of companies and products. management was different coworkers was helpful and fun. getting thing done. serving the customer
good,enjoy working here but the hardest thing is we are behind in work and company cut off all the overtime i really like some of the managers for example my manager i feel like i can practically tell her anything. my co workers get along with all of them we are always talking about over time and what can be improved in the company.
good,"good co workers, learned a lot of new things, down size was I felt harassing costumers special on weekends had to go to costumer every 5 min to ask they need help even I already asked them"
good,"It.s very busy fast pace job , a typical day looks like helping customers find what they need to their satisfaction. As well as straightening the aisles in the store and the merchandise . taking pulls from the back of receiving also putting the back stock out. Helping with wedding registry's. Taking calls for back-up cashier . Helping customer service."
good,"Unprofessional. Management does not value employees, a lot of favoritism. Insufficient training."
good,"It was ok, slow pace work, learned how to be a cashier. Co workers ok, managemnt ok."
good,"t. I also monitor officers' approaches to employees to ensure proper ethics  are observed  I need to be able to push back when they aren't, to keep the firm on the straight and narrow.  Not an easy responsibility. With that being said I have been told by management and associates alike that  my legacy would be"" She was firm but never did she not care and worried about  her people""  I am proud of this. This ability helps me to view all angles so the outcome is the best interest for all parties.  I have never had a EEOC claim. Trust me there was opportunity to have been several . I love my carrer and it reflect each day through my relationships with my all my associates."
good,"typical day at work:"
good,"Maintain PC’s, Lexmark T652, MS810 Printers and Zebra ZM400 Printers, HP Thin Clients, and HP Proliant servers to Minimize downtime."
good,"A typical day at work would be starting off cashiering. while you cashier you must also answer the telephone. if there is no one in line you must stock the shelves.its a never ending circle of running to the cashier line, and running back to what you were stocking. Fellow co workers were very friendly. some of the management was awesome. other parts of management were unfriendly, and non approachable. "
good,"its a good job for when you are in school, they are very flexiable."
good,"It was a great environment to learn about the manfacturing process, but it lacks Job security."
good,"I worked at locations in San Francisco and West Los Angeles and I really liked working in San Francisco. I feel like the management was friendly, fare, and open to employee opinions. In Los Angeles the whole culture of the store was horrible I hated working with Christopher and they where not open to employee concerns."
good,"Its a warehouse environment, so a typical day could be a hot or cold environment. Responsible for over 96 PC's, Printers and support over 120 Motorola scanners,along with Imaging of PC's and software support for 6 different applications. DHCP/DNS, Remote support 24/7."
good,"A typical day would be to greet and assist every customer in the department. Ask qualifying questions to determine a customer is looking for and make suggestions based on their needs. Add any add ons that may help their purchase. What I enjoy the most is when I can assist and satisfy a customer with their product ensuring that they are going to love it. Unfortunately, most of the time we were short staffed and busy."
good,"Though fun, was pretty chaotic. Managers cared less about employees."
good,Productive environment with great co-workers. Floor Sales Associate and Cashier.
good,9 years working with no problems until store management changed all aspects of my job. Including time and cleaning overhead with no mask or coveralls. Plus changing my time schedule every week in witch had no purpose.
good,"help customers find product and straighten up rooms. Management is not the best co-workers are decent individuals but managers abuse their authority.  I enjoy interacting with the customers the most when i go in to work"
good,"My job in Arizona was wonderful, but found in moving home and transferring to the Cleveland store very challenging as the systems and proceedures are very different, as well as the management. I loved my job with Bed Bath and Beyond and would go back if I had an opportunity in another store.  I was always on time and rarely missed a day (about 2).  Management was quite structured and changed a lot. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers. The other employees were very nice but did not stay long."
good,"Not a place i would go back to, Hours vary, dont really get paid enough for what you do. Managers rely on you."
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath And Beyond goes like this: "
good,"make sure the products were easily accessible, visually appealing, and constantly available. Organize products and help customer service at a fast pace."
good,"Fast Pace work place with a lot of customers. A typical day at work administrate classes, file paper work, place follow up calls with customers and provide customer service. "
good,"Being my first job, i was eager to help customers and help them find what they needed. But it was not about the customers at all. All the management wanted is to look good for their superiors at the expense of their workers. There was no morale with the workers."
good,I learned to multi- task and learned to deal with irate customers.
good,The Management Development Program is geared more toward newly promoted Managers with little management experience.
good,Good company yet there is no advancements available and they have opened so manu stores that the positions are set. insurance is way to high. There is always the treat of losing your job. Management can not be management. Always having to second guess your actions. They are very good at training their store staff. Hardest part was watching how they handled employee concerns or issues and yet couldn't say anything even if it wasn't right.
good,The one place I worked that allowed you to give great customer service 100% of the time.
good,There is a lot of confusion among management. My typical work day includes checking out customers and handling merchandise.
good,"I hated it personally, but thats because the management at the Appleton store was horrible. I quit after a couple months, I didn't like retail and needed a bigger challenge."
good,"A day would be cashiering, recovering, putting out freight and customer service."
good,"I would come into work and start stocking the store from top stock and retail left from the previous night. I would then start working on cleaning the back room up, and then the truck would come with product and I would unload, price, and sort out the freight. I was also in control of four rooms that needed to be perfect for corporate. I was also in charge of my side and a leader."
good,"In the positions I held with this company I was able to implement and greatly enhance my customer service skills as this the number one priority based on company culture. I am given opportunities to work autonomously and grow individually. However, I often felt like a number and am simply a device used to enhance earnings of upper level management. Pay is mediocre and there is very little room for advancement, which is an important aspect of a position for me."
good,NA. I Do not what to leave a review of this company.  It was a starter job  out of high school and gave me good customer service experience. It was easy.
good,"BBBY was a great college job. Eventually I took a full time management position, prior to the end of my degree. I developed many skills during my time at BBBY - supply chain management, team coordination, department and inventory management, etc. A solid stepping stone for my career. The workplace culture could use come improvement. The portion of the marketplace BBBY inhabits is slowly closing between Amazon and Google. My time with BBBY was heavily characterized by the nature of the marketplace at the time. However in my experience the management team often falls short when motivating their employees for achievement, personal development and success."
good,"A typical day at work for a night shift was rather slow, there was not much to do besides tidy up the store and keep things clean. Although on the weekends and days where shipment had come in things were more fast paced along with keeping the line moving at the registers and making sure new products are put out on the floor. They provided good hours but the management was on the lower end."
good,It was a great company now not a great place to work anymore. The employees lost the morale. They don’t treat there employees who been with the company good at all!
good,I was only employed  as a Seasonal associate for their pick period. The hours of working now as reduced and their pick is almost over now. At times I have to lift good over 60b
good,"Not a happy place to work. Given too much work for one person to handle and no supportive and helpful management. Some team members were cool to work with but most did not care to interact with each other. This may not be the same at other locations, though."
good,"Lots of work load. Multiple systems old and new. Management sucks, especially HR. Barely any raises unless you over work youself. Old clock in system so it was easy to be late."
good,They paid a decent amount at 70k a year with most weeks being a four day work week. Down side they would tell you that you need to work extra days just minutes before you leave the day before making it almost impossible to get a baby sitter and the direction of upper management was constantly shifting with out any plan
good,I was only there a short while as a seasonal employee. Learned how to use a scan gun and got certified on a forklift. The certification is only good at their location tho.
good,"The staff is made up of so many kind, caring and charismatic people. Unfortunately (I've noticed on this website) they claim to hire for full time and i'm not sure if it's the company being strict with JUST our store or all stores, but they outright refuse to hire anyone for more than part-time if they aren't in a managerial position. The last raise I got was a .20 cent raise which in technicality is a fantastic raise in percentages, but it's impossible to make enough money to go to school (I still live with my parents so I'm lucky), purchase a new car or even move out. This is a fantastic starting job for teens or if you can work another job on the side."
good,I wish more benefits were provided. There is not enough benefits. The only benefits offered are that we get a 20% discount of merchandise and a 401 k after a year of work.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond has great ideas in place to ""come back"" and be a powerhouse retailer again.  "
good,"When I first joined BBB the company was much more successful than it is now that brick and mortar retail is in such evolution. There is a lot of confusion and misdirection currently there, but the company still has some strong management and can adapt to the changing marketplace. Success for employees is dependent upon the senior management of the company finding the right recipe for the brand to continue to be relevant to new consumers."
good,"It was a large company and I was an associate at 18, the conditions were fair. I felt I wasn’t paid for my labor on the floor. Lots of heavy lifting and constantly restocking. Most nights I would be one of two people on the floor if not the only one. Lots of call outs or no shows. They paid minimum wage and there wasn’t much room for advancement or promotion. Managers were rude and training was rushed."
good,"Low pay, high turnover rate. I was called on a regular basis to come in to cover for someone that did not show up. When you don't pay well, you get employee's that don't care. "
good,"Ok place to work bit the usual gossip mongering, favoritism, and raise dependant on intangible goals not actual tangible experiences that promote BBB."
good,"It’s an easy money job. You don’t need any work experience to work there. But it can be frustrating at times with that store in general, the shelves are pretty empty and the management isn’t very organized or professional. You have moments where you feel bad when you can’t help the customer find what they’re looking for because we NEVER have it. The store is ALWAYS understaffed."
good,"Typical day at work is stressing because we are usually low on staff."
good,"Cashier or sales floor associate, you got lots of stuff to do with so little time. Pay is terrible but they did follow through with my schedule and let me work whenever which is why I stayed."
good,I mean the El Cerrito one is very unorganized and have too much drama. Its a nice area where are they at but the customers arent really nice so you will need to be VERY patient with them.
good,There are a good company to work for but long days and a long drive for me but all and all you can get more if you work more but I'm part time and a temporary worker
good,It's a good place to work as a first or second job.  There are no pay increases to speak of and no options for promotions.  You'll have plenty of time to look for a higher paying second job because of the low number of hours scheduled.
good,"Great for college students. Management needs more training on people skills, time management. No stability at the store location. No accountability from staff and leadership"
good,"A typical day at work involves very strict adherence to call metrics, documentation and compliance with some support and minimal allowances for customer follow up. There are over 20 software applications to provide service for customers. Documentation of every call is required. Calls are recorded and are scored.  Call Center Representatives receive a monthly score and if that scores dip below a certain grade, a written warning is issued, which must be signed. Annual wage increases are performance based, based on last three months scores. This is done with the goal of quality and adherence. The hardest part of the job is not providing great customer service for our customers, it is in understanding and meeting the metrics, which frequently change as the focus of new management shifts. Also, Saturday work is required and, in response to employees requests for an occasional Saturday off, this granted, but with a performance based condition. The best part of the job is the team supervision, who try to provide perks for the Customer Service Representatives, like performance based contests, monthly birthday cakes and in house luncheons."
good,"Indeed is forcing me to write a minimum of 150 characters, so I’m just gonna write some basic stuff about BB&B. It’s a good starter job for teens & you’ll learn a lot."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a nice place to work but not when it's understaffed. When it's understaffed you have to do things that are outside of your job description. Also the store has a bad vibe when it's short staffed.
good,"If you don't have responsibilities then Bed bath and beyond is a place were you can work. At the store that i worked at, has alot of call outs so they will call the next person available. Not all the time is a person that knows that particular area. But you learn."
good,"If you're looking for more hours, I would say look somewhere else. They cut back hours due to slow periods. For example there were times where I wasn't on the schedule at all or working one day a week. that's not going to cut it if you're working part time or even if you had another job and was used two having two incomes."
good,It was a very great start at bed bath and beyond and working for retail but the management wasn’t organized nor payroll. Very nice people everyone had little work parties. Had fun.
good,Es una empresa que tiene sus beneficios los cuales son favorables pero el salario es mínimo
good,"I enjoyed working at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but was surprised that department managers didn't have more input as to what to do in their own departments."
good,"Great products. "
good,A typical day is extremely busy and can be very rewarding to assist customers with a wonderful shopping experience.  I have learned there are all types of people and there are different ways to provide them with the best service.  Multi-tasking is a necessity for this job.
good,I work there for a year and little to complain about beside the threat of Wright ups for somethings I had no control of such as the time refram in receiving. Also management didn't always take with one another so things got lost in translations
good,Good place to start your career. Management could use an overhaul as they continue to move the same people around that have been working there for 20 years
good,"job was very simple and easy i pretty much enjoyed it, i was always in the customer service box, you really got to have patience and people skills when working here and be able to multitask."
good,"the job was fun and i enjoyed it, my co-workers were great and i still keep contact with them. there was one manager is particular that made my experience there less than great."
good,"This company makes everything as hard as possible on the worker."
good,I didn’t get enough hours and the pay wasn’t on time and the work environment wasn’t good i didn’t feel apart of the crew and i didn’t want that to be my temporary job
good,The overall arena of Bath Bath and Beyond is okay. The management could definitely be improved. I honestly have not learned to much while working in the facility. There is not hardest part of the job other than handling customers that may not care how they come across.
good,"most of the time they were flexible, but not the best managers or leaders.  Training staff was not the best, often young and inexperienced. To much to do in one day and not enough time to do it."
good,I enjoyed working here as it built up my ability to work in the customer service/ retail industry. I mostly enjoyed my day to day activities but management was very hard to work with especially with a school schedule.
good,"not a good place to work. The store manager will not recognize you  for the hard work you do, but they will say something if its not getting done fast enough. your raise is 10 cent, i got lucky and they gave me 13 cent raise. i was listed as part time, but worked full time, because of that i was not able to get benefits."
good,"In this customer service job you are required for the most part to stand in one place all day. This would be fine except that you have 1 or 2 managers supervising up to sometimes 20+ cashiers at a time and the line becomes long. Many times due to one issue or another the line comes to a screeching halt, and some managers see you take a breath after taking care of many customers and wonder why you are ""doing nothing."" Other managers however can see all the work you are doing and let you off the hook. There are many occasions your only option is to ""pass the buck"" and you are left to wait there with an impatient customer for  a few minutes but this can reach up to even 5 to 10 minutes, which is a lot of time that can be used to help the customer with a problem that can be solved easily, but due to bureaucracy, you are required to keep a customer waiting sometimes for a simple yes or no."
good,"Lots of people work here forever, there is job security but dont expect to go anywhere.  Come work here, learn and leave in a couple years.  Plus the company is going under so theres that."
good,It's a good job for someone is looking for part time. The hardest part of the job is managing yourself when dealing with coworkers and customers. Overall it is a great work environment but part-timers basically get nothing in terms of benefits. Not even better pay during holiday shifts.
good,"Typical day consisted of showing up to unstock trucks in receiving stock room or assisting customers on the floor. Despite the strenuous hours some are required to work, fellow employees seem to always be upbeat."
good,Terrible work life balance.  Good customer focus.  Terrible people skills in head office leadership.  Would not suggest working here if you want to see your family.
good,It's retail. managment has changed since i was there. I hear it is better but my experience was not good. Like most jobs it still feels like high school with some of the behavior.
good,Overall a good company. Little to no room for growth. Work life balance is bad. There is not enough help to run the store at a level that is expected. You have to find a way to get it done.
good,Sometimes working here it is absolutely stressful many times it is not the customers that's a pain it is employees and management at times because they expect you to do so much instead of helping us to get the job done or showing us the correct way instead of yelling at the employees.
good,"Bed bath and Beyond is my first official job, the employees were extremely nice. I got to call out whenever something came up and it was understandable."
good,"Worked here for a year and it has gotten very old and tiring for me. A typical work day could be good or bad, it all depends on whether or not they schedule enough people. I've learned management and supervisor skills, as well as how to better my customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is staying positive when you get those really tough customers that always think they are right."
good,"If you're looking for a temporary job, this might be for you.  Not a great place to advance. Many different skills required, multiple tasks at a time, very fast paced."
good,BBB taught me a great deal about time management and gave classes to further product knowledge. No one person is an island.  Everyone relies on one another to get the job done.
good,"Beginning my career at Bed bath and beyond was quite interesting, everything was quite interesting to learn. However, there were jobs i had to complete which i wasn't trained it."
good,"I loved my job, but my manager was very rude to me because they didn't like my mother and I working together. I was usually helping her because she couldn't lift heavy things. They didn't care and yelled at me alot for it."
good,"It was a great company to work for if you just need something part-time and quick, but I would not stay there long. It was very fast paced and you had to be able to move around quickly."
good,"typical day is stressful"
good,"The morning shifts are a little hectic and the night shifts were really easy. I learned customer service and how to talk to random people. The management was different, some were good and some were bad. The culture was laid back but consistent. The hardest part was working freight and the most enjoyable was talking to new people."
good,"Stressful work environment, Management bad mouth each other. Customers are rude and entitled. Employees show up late or not at all with no consequences"
good,Good job for students and a part time job. Management can be okay at times. Not the greatest. No benefits for part time and no advancements in the job from myself even working there for 2+ years.
good,"This is a great place to work as a part time job.  It's a relaxed work envorinment, that's flexible with your schedule.  I've enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Loved the people that I worked with. The main problem is no consistency from manager to manager. Also, not many hours for part-time during summer. Training ok but you get thrown into position right away...ready or not."
good,I was always surprised by the amount of tenure management had at BBB. I worked at 5 different stores during my time with the company and can honestly say that the majority of the staff was hardworking and committed to their jobs.
good,"workers make it a fun atmosphere, management is fair but the job will wear you down, would not recommend staying more than a year. almost no schedule flexibility and they're strict with time attendance. being late 10 minutes is the same as calling out. if you know ur going to be late u might as well take the night off"
good,"I appreciate the certainty that BBB will be there the next day, unlike some retailers lately. Even if I find a full-time job I will keep a few shifts at BBB. I wish we could get more hours. The hardest part of my job is carrying large, heavy boxes up and down ladders. As a customer service associate, my favorite part is when a customer walks in with a frustrating problem and I sent them home happy."
good,The management is not as great as they make it out to be. You basically have to annoy them to the point where it annoys you to get their attention. It is obnoxious.
good,"I worked in customer service even though i was never trained to do so.  We were short one day and I got moved to customer service from normal cashiering.  Not only did I end up staying at customer service with no raise, no one even acknowledged that I got moved permanently.  I never wanted to work customer service, but it was expected because we never had enough people."
good,"Daily tasks included restocking shelves on the sales floor, customer service, and working the register.  Providing excellent customer service and janitorial tasks were also part of my everyday routine."
good,"A typical day at work includes filling up merchandise that has been shipped in, helping customers who have questions, being a back-up cashier, and straightening up the department for the next day."
good,"was working two jobs at the time, they were not willing to work with me on my hours before I moved. Had to change them to my secondary job instead of being my primary."
good,I never had a set schedule or days off. was only put in one place to work never got to explore outside that. didn't seem like there was too much opportunity to move up
good,"Come in, work, go home."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond can be very stressful, but it can also be very rewarding depending on the day. On most weekends and early weekdays, the store is packed with customers. It can get very draining sometimes when you are constantly helping guests. Weeknights on the other hand are a lot more slow, which means employees can work at a more relaxed pace when straightening the aisles. Some customers can be very rude, but there are some customers that are really grateful for your time, which makes working there very rewarding. Friendly customer service is very important to the company, and can make all the difference when you are helping out customers. Managers can be disrespectful some of the time, making the motivation to work there harder, but   co-workers there can be a friendly and fun group to work with. The hardest part about this job has to be balancing fast-paced customer service with work related projects and cleaning up, all in an orderly fashion."
good,"Customer service at Bed Bath & Beyond means the customer is always right. Most of the time this was not a problem, most customers are understanding and honest. At my location specifically, a lot of customers were dishonest and incredibly rude."
good,i would stock the shelfs on the hard side of the store which had all the cooking pot and pans and the coffee machines and i also had to work the front by using the cash resigter with also giving custormer service to anyone that walked by my aisle.
good,"Like any retail job, it can be difficult. In such a small town, you were often lucky to see anyone in the 4 hours before store closing. "
good,"No longer a viable retailer. Better companies to work for. The company wants your heart and soul, and good portion of your life if your salaried. Compensation if ok if you live in the right market to survive."
good,"Their way of teaching you in throwing you in, but since you don't have the proper training, your growth is stumped, and it is too fast paced for upper management to take the time to teach you."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to build relationships with our customers and associates. Great training and product knowledge. Would be able to implement if more hours where given to the store to do so.
good,"Okay place to work but it looks like the times and competition"
good,"Everything is based on making the customer happy, which is important for a big corporation like Bed Bath & beyond. Customers must come first in order to draw in more future customers."
good,If the company hadn't restructured I would never have left . All  store s are run different  hard to run with little bit of hour's and help now the experience managers are gone lot of training for the other managers to have to do now hard to teach the culture.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and assisting new people every day. High employee turnover. Low wages. High pace most days due to understaffing.
good,"I was 1 0f 900 managers that were released on August 3, 2017.  In the early years of my time there, there was great room more advancement - no longer hiring management level."
good,Typical retail environment. The customers full satisfaction is what we desire and its something that I look forward to achieving each and every day. Great working hours.
good,"If you're looking for a place to exercise your problem solving skills, this is the place to do it.  The core company values and policies are fantastic and make taking care of the customer easy.  However, they do not treat their employees as well as they do their customers. They are trying to move in the right direction with technology but are sacrificing the employees who have worked hard for them in the past and unless they change their ways may end up going the way of other big box retailers."
good,"After working at this company for 16 years they just let me go because the store are losing money every day, but the funny thing bed bath and beyond  are continuing to open up stores ......."
good,Didn't really enjoy working at this job but it gave me good experience with customers and all types of personalities. I received adequate training in over the phone conversations and working with employees
good,"BBB is a good temporary job.  They work well with your schedule, and as an employee you get 20% off your purchases.  But if you are looking to move forward to a manager position, this job is not for you (unless you live in a big city...you are more likely to advance say in Houston or Dallas than in a small town).  Full time positions are rare and few in between.  Managers are a hit and miss.  I've had a few great ones and a few horrendous ones.  Every year you get 20-30 cent raise.  They would rather have 20 people fighting for 5-20 hours a week than have 10 good people running the store."
good,"While the customer service expectations are high, the company has lofty goals that you can tell put the management staff on a high stress diet of long hours, with little reward."
good,"While working at Bed Bath and Beyond I learned all aspect of retail. From the cash register to receiving and from stocking to sales, I was able to learn almost all aspect of the store. This allowed me to grow as retail/sales person. My coworker were always helpful and we pushed each other to do our best even hours started to be cut based on a new system they had for part time workers."
good,"Start on freight"
good,"The company is great to work for, but there are issues that need to be addressed that has caused conflict, and no trust in the system to advance within the environment. There has been some good opportunities internally, but the candidates were already pre selected before the interview process took place. There were three occasions where candidates with key experience were overlooked for opportunities due to the process is rigged. Many leaders and associates have started looking for other opportunities outside of the company due to favoritism. The moral of the team is down, but many stay due to good work life balance and the benefits. There was a situation where I was personally told that I was not eligible to apply for a position due to I was not there 90 days, but the another manager who got there after I did was able to apply and received the promotion. The company contradicts themselves, and the favoritism is getting out of hand. I do enjoy the associates that I manage, and with a low head count we supersede our daily goals consistently, and set records for cartons per hour."
good,"Got the chance to meet great leaders, but sadly they did not put their work flows into action. Great personal, opportunity to know different cultures, and people."
good,Lots of room to advance if you're good at what you do. Extremely disorganized. Lots of pressure on Registry consultants from regional staff. Unrealistic expectations for managers. She
good,The work itself is fairly easy with unrealistic deadlines. The biggest issues is management store level and district level. Store is divided very often at many stores due to store managers lack of training as well as HR skills.
good,Working with customers makes the job worth it.  They appreciate all we do for them.  It is tough to keep up with all the online companies out there that are starting to put the big box retailers out.
good,"I've worked at multiple locations. Each one has their own environment, especially depending on the manager. Can be a very fun, family environment to work, but also stressful."
good,"Management has poor communication. You perform multiple job titles for little money. Takes a long time to go from part time to full time, and then thats when they really take advantage of you."
good,"The job is how you would imagine it. The hours are flexible and work is rather routine. The people that I was able to work alongside were great individuals who I quickly became friends with. However, management could use many improvements and because of that the turnover rate was high."
good,"Quick paced, very stressful, non-caring managers, back stabbing managers. Everyone for themselves and non helping the employees."
good,"Working at Bath Bath beyond told me a lot about customer service and a lot about sales associate  ,  The staff was very friendly and I always had a great time at work"
good,I did work with some nice people it was also fast paced which made the day go by fast and of course I loved the discounts. I was overall treated unfairly because I was African American I was paid minimum wage then when another race other than African American got hired they got .50 cents more and it was not because of there experience.
good,"Which some stuff would change for the better , felt at time people have been mistreated, some people are really not motivated for this job and it puts stress on others"
good,The managers although well meaning are very counter productive to the staff. Over ordering can make a simple shift extend 2 or there more hours then intended. Often time the stores understaffed for the volume of customers for weeks at a time resulting in uncompleted work cycles. The employees have a great sense of humor. Sometimes they manager throw parties that help boost morale.
good,"Work is fairly easy. Management is ok but they do not like to take any escalated calls. Your on your own basically and sometimes team leaders are not as efficient, they spend time doing nothing and hate to answer your questions. Time and attendance policy is crazy and a little far fetched. If you want to work the pm shift which is 4 pm to 1am be prepared to be paid the same as all the others reps. We were told 12.50-13.50 but the pay remains at 12.50 hourly."
good,"I liked the work and thought I was improving. I had gotten faster at hanging/removing the clearance signs and I had gotten caught up on price changes and was steady with other Inventory Control Managers at other Bed Bath & Beyonds. "
good,Managers can be difficult.  Pay is nothing to write home about.  There's not really any opportunity for advancement.  Expect to work with a lot of young people.
good,"•	Recommended merchandise based on individual requirements"
good,"Management was okay. Very cooperative with hours and times even with giving more hours. Some people that have been given responsibility as a manager would just to help out, let the power get to their heads and were very rude and are extremely hard to work with. Not a plus when the job is already stressful enough."
good,"I loved working in the office and having the option to also interact with customers and help them as well.  The company fosters a great culture, unfortunately the management at each location doesn't always follow through with that."
good,"scheduling is good always gives u three weeks in advance "
good,"I've worked at Bed Bath & Beyond for six years now and it has been an up and down experience. The work is fairly easy. Unlike commission based retail jobs, there is no incentive to push items on customers. Although associates are asked to recommend ""add ons"" and the ""item of the month,"" selling more results in no benefit so there is no reason to go overboard. This makes customer service much more doable in my opinion. You're free to help customers make choices in saving money and not just try to get them out the door with the most expensive items."
good,"well let me tell ya, they are cross eyed retards managing that place... never met a team of folks willing to amputate a leg so that their thumb would stop hurting... but hey at least the insurance is good, until you get fired"
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of greeting and engaging with customers, no matter what project I'm working on. I have learned many different aspects of bedding, thread count, down and down alternative, side sleepers and back stomach sleepers, and most importantly how to engage with a customer and getting them exactly what they need. The management team is very unorganized and can be biased. Most of the co-workers are nice but there are many cliques as if we are back in high school again. The hardest part about the job is the change in schedule each week, so planning out my life is very hard and the pay is very minuscule. I enjoy meeting new people every time I work and end up learning something new, and it's also nice to see returning customers because they have enjoyed your services."
good,The work wasn't too demanding or hard. Great place to work and employees were friendly. Some of the management however were unprofessional and rude.
good,"I have been working at Bed, Bath, & Beyond for five years. I worked as a part timer for 3 years and then i was pushed up to full time. Everybody is responsible for doing everything, such as, operating a cash register, collecting carts, working on the sales floors, working in the stock rooms and cleaning bathrooms because we don't have enough workers or hours to assign people to their own positions."
good,"With Bed Bath and beyond opportunities for advancement are around every corner. The company will take and make managers from every walk of the food, drug and retail industries. It is however a very aggressive and competitive environment. Once you advance to operation and store manager positions, the pressure of job performance becomes far more complex. The expectations for results are high and the tolerance for failure are almost non-existent."
good,"Poor upper management.  Support staff weak."
good,"Daily staffing is always low so everyday takes a lot of work. "
good,Helping others finding the items needed for there home. Checking them out and being sure that they have found all items needed.
good,Same thing day after day with a constant need for replenishment with a limited amount of staffing.  Leadership in general is ok but growth is extremely limited.
good,"they dont pay well, the technology is very old. they are flexible with schedule, they dont train you very well. i would only suggest this job if its a temp job"
good,"Long hours and many 6 and 7 day work weeks.  At times not very organized in operational processes.  Who you know not what you know, was the typical process of advancement."
good,"I worked customer service desk. so i really was always in the front entrance.  Management were ok, they would sometimes be disrespectful to us."
good,"Working here was enjoyable when it came time for the holidays, but then not really because the music gets old really quick. The most valuable thing I learned here was to call HR yourself, and not trust that your manager will ""handle"" a situation because that literally means nothing here. Terrible company."
good,"Typical day at work was me alone in the back, bathing dogs, doing laundry and cleaning up. I learned how to groom large dogs, cut nails, clean ears and trim the hair in the paw pads. Management was good, until something personal happened to her and she choose not to schedule you anymore. My co-workers were very nice, and helpful. Hardest part of my job was to bath scared dogs. Enjoyable part of my job, was being around animals."
good,"A typical day would consist of; an overview of freight that would need to be merchandised, maintaining great customer service, and making sure products are out for customers. The hardest part of my job is planning where stock is going. The most enjoyable aspect is the people i work with."
good,"Customer Service is number. Greeting and assisting every single customer and making them feel special is our job. Co-works are ready, willing and able to help and work as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is having people thank me for the time I spent with them. They are so appreciative to have someone who cares and get to chat with them of repeat visits"
good,"Responsible for warmly acknowledging customers as they enter/exit the facility, providing assistance to meet each customer’s needs over the phone and in person, completing sales transactions and exchanges, resolving customer complaints, maintain clean/organized work station and surrounding areas, recommending merchandise to customers, ordering merchandise online if it was no longer available in store, printing out gift/wedding registries upon request, completing inventory each month, and restocking materials at work station at the end of each shift. "
good,BBB believes in promoting within.  Job demands sometimes may be hard to balance with home life.  Very customer service based.  The customer is always right.
good,"I have worked with this company over a year, and I must say it has been a very safe and professional work environment. My days are constantly busy and that  fills me with joy byhelping others. Working at Customer Service has taught me to be more patient and caring of others shopping experiences. Most of the customers are elderly people and I enjoy helping them find their merchandise. My management  team is very helpful and give great direction. I enjoy the weekends because thats when we are the busiest. I love working under a little stress customers coming back to back, phones ringing, customers needs assistance on the floor,and when I'm there I feel my customer service is needed. The hardest part of the job is when a customer leaves the store unsatisfied."
good,I started out working in one side of the store learning as much as possible about where all the product is to better assist the customers. By the end of the job I had worked every position available to a part time minimum wage employee.  As anyone knows customer service can be very difficult and not for everyone. Bed Bath and Beyond is difficult with customer service because of their high expectations and business culture. Bed Bath and Beyond practically gives away product to some customers just because a customer throws a literal fit in the store. I had smoothie thrown at me because a product wasn't securely locked to its base and exploded all over the customer's kitchen which they then blamed on me even though I never showed them the product or checked them out of the store.  The managers in the store I worked at were very friendly and rather fun to work with. I always enjoyed the overnighters where we had schematics of how they wanted the seasonal section to look and we would redo all the shelves and product to match the schematics. The hardest part of the job for me was customer service. I enjoyed working with customers on the floor and helping them find something they were looking for. I also enjoyed completely redoing the back stock rooms so all employees could find the product they needed.
good,"A typical day as an email associate at Bed Bath & Beyond was to come in, sit at your desk and begin to answer customers emails. The work was very easy however extremely tedious and boring. The management do not listen to their employees concerns and a lot of unnecessary micro managing."
good,"Bed Bath & beyond is a very demanding company to work for.  It is not a bad company to work for, otherwise I would not have stuck with them for 10 years.  I have learned a lot over the years, merchandising, customer service, receiving, ordering etc.  My biggest complaint is that they do not promote from within the way they should.  I had been promised a promotion over a year ago.  I woke up at 3AM for months going into work early, staying late.  I did everything asked of my old store manager only to have this store manager leave before I saw any final result for my future.  I was given a new store manager only to have to start from scratch.  If you think you are making any progress, think again.  They will replace every manager in the store; sometimes multiple managers within a year.  I am looking for another opportunity because I honestly feel like I have no future with this company.  They prefer to hire management from outside sources as opposed to rewarding loyalty and hard work."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond was a great place to work for several reasons.  I only needed it to be a PT job to supplement income for a regular FT job.  The management at my particular store was extremely accommodating of my challenging schedule changes.  The customer base is a pretty good one, they are coming in to buy lifestyle ease items rather than life survival items.  Meaning, they can get most of these items at other retailers - comparable pricing, but we carry many specialty items for the home that may not be available at other stores, but they are really Need to have items, they are more Want to have items.  BBB also has one of the most liberal attitudes towards guaranteeing their merchandise that I have ever seen.  The philosophy is customers should always leave happy when possible, so unless it is just really a situation that is going to be a hardship on the company, the customer will be accommodated in regards to returns, exchanges and prices.  It is very easy to provide great service when you never have to say no.  It is also company policy, that if an employee is in a situation that they feel like they are going to have to say no to something - they don't have the authority to make that decision, they maintain the good will of the customer by stopping and calling for a manager to take over."
good,"Meeting new people and maintaining relationships with current customers a nice part of the job."
good,"Come to work in jeans and a polo, organized shelves did what ever your boss needed done for the day and provide excellent customer service."
good,management was all friends so never mived anyone up unless they were really cool with you they didnt care about how hard you worked
good,"A typical day is hectic, running around from cashier to cashier, assisting with transactions, then hopping on a register to help clear the lines of customers. When not ringing, I am assessing cashier performance, answering customer questions and directing the flow of traffic in the store, while making sure that merchandise displays in my area are full and shopable. In my time at BBB, I have furthered my multi-tasking skills, perfected a poker face when dealing with difficult customers, learned a great deal of product knowledge, and developed an affinity for customer service. Sadly, I do not feel supported by most of the management staff. They contradict themselves and are quick to assume the worst. Some of my co-workers are stellar, and some are terrible, but nothing changes, despite what we on the Front End team communicate to management. The hardest part of my job is trying to live up to inconsistent standards set by management. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting tons of interesting people from a variety of backgrounds and helping them get what they need."
good,"Customer service is overall a hard position to fill. You deal with all different types of personalities and you have to be prepared for whatever the customers throw at you. You learn how to bite your tongue, patience, kindness, sympathy, empathy, and over all you learn how to be a people person. The coworkers are all extremely nice, but the management has their ups and downs. The hardest part about working here are the customers and how the schedule is always a surprise because scheduling is not this company's forte. But the most enjoyable part is definitely the coworkers because everyone is just like you and everyone is trying to get by with the day."
good,"A typical day at work consist of always smiling and helping customers. I learned that there was always a way to make sure the customer left the store satisfy, even if we didn't have what they was looking for in the store. Management was good, they were on top of all employees making sure we was doing our jobs. My co-workers made the environment very friendly. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was having customers remember my name and leaving the store happy because of my customer service."
good,Typically I come into work and put a smile on helping customers with any questions they may have and efficiently working the register to ensure customers leave satisfied with my customer service skills. Help them get out fast and happy. Always have to keep the customer happy. The best part is being able to help someone with there question and helping them find exactly what they were looking for without a hassle.
good,"Provide support for company stores"
good,Your work/life is not the same especially in retail. Schedule changes every week and if you have a child then having a retail job is difficult.   A typical day at BBB can be very annoying and fun. Annoying and stressful because of rude customers and if it's a very busy day some customers may think you have eight hands. I learn stuff everyday at BBB there's so many products in their that I haven't even heard of. The hardest part is dealing with a rude customer and biting her tongue. The most enjoyable part is having a nice customers and especially when a  customer understands that the store is very busy and have to be patient.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond showed me the power and results of structured training.  Several aspects of the mandatory training programs are still incorporated to maximize my daily personal efficiency and my current staff development.  I enjoyed the physical aspects of my role at this company and the expectation to operate as the ""owner"" of my department."
good,Provide customers with any assistance needed throughout their shopping experience. I was proficient in helping in any department at any time because I was well cross-trained. I was a cashier and handled money with no discrepancies during my tenure and left with a good reputation and working relationship with all employees and managers
good,Offices aren't very flashy. Management was very good though. You can learn a lot there.
good,"When I first interviewed for this job I was beyond excited not only to be working in one of my favorite stores ever but I thought I was making pretty decent money as well for a part time job. However, they conveniently left out certain aspects of the job for me to find out after I was already employed. I was prepared for a customer service job which included cashiering however I spent more time in the back room on a ladder or putting things on/off shelves to hardly help customers at all. On top of the poor communication between managers and other employees I was so stressed out about feeling like I SUCKED at my job (along with others, I was not the only one feeling the pressure) I ended up jumping at the chance for a better job and did not stay long at BB&B. There was no encouragement and no responsibility taken for lack of efforts on certain people's part; it was all our(the low ""ranking"" employees) fault. I was only told that I needed to be better at my job and that I (and employees like me) were the reason we were so unproductive."
good,"The company itself is a great place to shop, with many great products.  The company expects the employees to do the restocking early morning.  I did notice that, even though there were men available, women were expected to do some very heavy lifting."
good,Fast paced retail environment. Must be able to multi-task and provide excellent customer care at all times.
good,"Fun place to work only if you love customer service. job is very competitive, but if you work hard all year they may not give you the raise you deserve or was promised. Management is always moody and co-workers are very gossipy and may have been promised the same things you never received like a pay raise or higher postion."
good,"As a sales associate, I spent my time being approached by 60% of everyone who entered through the door because they could not find something or refused to read.  On occasion, the item was sold out and I would need to secure another from a different store or warehouse.  After store hours, I would do stock and freight. From close to midnight-1 AM were the only enjoyable hours to work there as you can chat with coworkers as your work together without being bombarded by people too lazy to use common sense to locate an item or read what a product does."
good,"This was a part-time job for me. That is all anybody at that store had. Despite some of my coworkers excellent work, they never were rewarded with promotions, or even full time positions."
good,"Retail is not glamorous no matter where it is. Hours are long, so many co-workers call out sick and leave the store short staffed. "
good,Enjoy the people I work I with.  Interacting with the customers is also a pleasure as well.
good,Productive and fun but a lot of management changes which required you to be very flexible something they didn't go over with in the interview cause some unwanted drama in the work place.
good,Overall not a bad company to work for. I would like to find a company that is more organized and has opportunity for advancement and considers work/life and long commutes
good,"Although this job was relatively easy, often an associate would be left by themselves to cover half of the store for hours at a time. My days were either boring or stressful and nothing in between. As a new associate I was left on my own a lot with no one to show me how anything was supposed to be done, and a handful of the managers would get angry that tasks were not completed even though they knew I was new and inexperienced. I learned the ropes very quickly because, as I mentioned before, it was not a difficult job. I also learned from observation that associates could stand behind a desk, barely acknowledge customers and play games on their phones for hours without getting in trouble with management. I learned very quickly that part-time people were constantly looked over for any kind of acknowledgement unless you found the right manager to butt-kiss. Also, part-time associates get no benefits of any kind and only minimal raises after a year's worth of work."
good,"Great workplace culture.  The company's stores ares based on an emploument model of 3 or 4 full time managers for the store, and the rest of the staff consists entirely of part time employees."
good,Theres nothing good to say about the company so I wont say nothing at all!
good,"A typical day at work consisted of handling customer care issues as well as maintaining work space and department cleanliness. I learned the importance of maintaining ""the customer is always right"" standard as well as the importance of remaining positive in all circumstances. The management at Bed Bath & Beyond was honestly difficult. Scheduling was usually not given until a few days before you were needed it, making it hard to schedule appointments outside of work. My experience with co-workers was quite enjoyable. I formed lasting friendships and we truly were a team. We learned to work together and we stuck together through ""tough"" situations with customers. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the ""customer is always right"" attitude. When a customer is trying to just get something for free, it was hard to provide that service knowing that our company would be loosing money in order to keep the customer happy. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and sometimes being the only polite person they have come in contact with the whole day. I love making people happy. "
good,"easy, laid back. but always about the customer. team work was a plus. hardest part was cleaning the bathrooms"
good,"BBB was a fun place to work and it defintitely upped my standards as a customer service representative. We were supposed to know as much about our products as possible, and training was usually fun instead of boring."
good,This job was very physically demanding. There was much ladder work to be done. All the freight was put away by both the management team and the associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates. There were many extremely friendly people that were a pleasure to work with.
good,a typical day can vary you can always expect something new but on the flip side you do tend to learn alot about product that we use everyday that we take advantage of it is hard to get you point of view across or your ideas about how to make things work better and sell more because they have a set plan o gram of how they want it and they cater a tad to much to the customers
good,"daily work was as to be expected for a store opening, very chaotic and everyone there is new so there was a lot of scrambling. the managers on site were very good at keeping control of a tough situation though."
good,A typical day at work is all about prioritizing and managing time. Employees must be friendly and out going.
good,management is messed up. the corporate BBB only cares about saving money and not how it affects their employees.
good,"A typical day at work is going in and working in customer service doing returns,exchanges,and purchases. Doing bridal print outs and wrapping or packaging. The hardest part of my job is around like 4 o clock we get extra busy so to have to answer the phone help customers and check out customers can be very stress but at the same time i like being constantly busy makes the time go by very fast and i can easily deal with a little bit of stress."
good,"Pay rate is decent at first. Poor (2% or less) pay increases. 45 hour minimum work week. They only opened 2 stores in 2011, so advancement is nearly none existent."
good,So much to do without great compensation. Came in during business hours and assisted customers and after we closed prepared for the next day.
good,"Good place to work, meeting new people everyday. Fast pace job, employees are really nice"
good,This company overall was a good work environment. The managers cared about there employees. Everyone was treated equal and there were no problems in the work place. Mangers were very flexible with the work schedules.
good,"Management could be better and safety practice could be more enforced. Overall, the job was an ok job! It would be better if it was more of a happy work space. Seems like management come to work mad and that makes employees mad and lack work ethic."
good,"Company is struggling to stay relevant, wants to get closer to employees but business realities often get in the way. Needs to update systems and processes to be more modern."
good,"it’s a great job for young teens looking to get into the world of working. management is a little rough to deal with sometimes but that’s mostly due to stress caused by regional/corporate parties. no benefits other than the 20% discount that you can get with coupons anyway, and getting a raise or a higher position than what you were hired for is nearly impossible."
good,"Like most retail positions, they put more emphasis on creating a great shopping experience for customers. They expect a LOT of their employees, but give very little training to new hires. Absolutely no room to move up the latter."
good,Managers do not have your back. They side will employees that have been there for years. Co workers are amazing. Loved the customers that I had. High turn around.
good,management wasn't the best they would over order some things and under order other things. corporate would micro manage the store too much and cause issues
good,overtime was a necessity.  A lot of discovery for ambitious.  Direct supervisors were amazing.  Employee incentives were minimal.  Average workday 10-14 hiurs
good,"I worked in Bed Bath and Beyond's DBG which is their own creative studio in NYC. I went in with high hopes. The pay was more than I expected which is great, but because the company is constantly restructuring, they will never provide a stable job. There's no leadership there and the company cuts spending in every department or claim they need people with ""more experience"" for extremely easy and mediocre tasks that can be handled by the current worker. Therefore, freelancers, which makes up about 70% of the office, will be fired or have their hours cut. It's a very discouraging work environment with little team effort, and very limited communication. The work was fairly easy and deadlines were tolerable, but getting feedback and making revisions was a headache. This job is great for anyone who can handle the workload and doesn't mind abrupt termination, but for those looking for a stable job, this isn't it. Also, the office is closed for very few holidays and since most of the workers are freelancers, PTO is nearly non-existent."
good,Really great company. Most managers were really nice and gave me lots of work to do when it was slow in the store. I learned a lot about customer service there and it's really helped me in day-to-day life. It was a great experience.
good,"This company strict follows its corporate vision statement and spends substantial time training and preparing its staff. It also pays better than most retailers, but that's in part due to the substantial amount of product info you need to learn. It is especially stressful for retail as they routinely expect workers to complete more than a single person's workload."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond has its pros and cons as you would find anywhere. It is retail. Therefore, it takes a certain person to work in such an enviroment."
good,Typical work day consist of not enough employees and loads of customers. There just isn't enough help to meet the demands of providing excellent customer service and performing other tasks. Meeting new people is the most enjoyable part of the job. Management doesn't know how to properly speak with employees. They act as if they have no respect for them.
good,"Overall, I only love the wide variety of what they sell. Part timers get minimum wage. Company as a whole hates to add hours to schedule unless they are desperately in need of your extra overtime stay."
good,Your life must and always be bed bath and beyond. Eat sleep and drink it  and even then you might not advance. I liked the work I was happy working but I had no social life
good,"If you dont have or want a life then it's for you.  You are under paid for the work you do and they will work you to death if you let them.."
good,"The job isn’t hard, but the managers gossip unnecessarily. Decent hours, easy work, plenty of customer service. Fair wage, no overtime for regular associates."
good,Simple enough work just the micromanaging and the lack of them trusting you can handle your own calls. They say they its not by a script and to go with the flow but when you’re actually trying to they mark it off your overall scorecard which can stop you from making a bonus at the end of the month.
good,"don't know CEO,  Have not been there long enought. 15 miute break at 4 hours of work, only a half hour at 6 hours . Not much of full time positions, Part time.A change of managment has just occured and things are up in the air.They employees are of the younger set.thtas all I can think of. You know the saying "" If'n you don't have something nice to say , DonOt say nothing at all"""
good,"Loved my managers and coworkers but pay is horrible, no room for advancement and hours are terrible. Discount is nice but it's the same as customer with a coupon."
good,Able to work your way up but forget about having a life outside of there scheduling. Most managers don't have a clue on what their doing or what is supposed to get done. Makes it very hard to understand the in at hand besides waiting on customers.
good,The Job had many moments that had me confused and asking myself why in the world am I doing a managers job for them when I should be assisting customers and cleaning up the store.
good,"Getting along with your coworkers here makes for some great work experience and a fun time. The customers are very kind and will wait if need be. Also, the managers can be understanding."
good,"The job requires a lot of dedication and work for very little pay and pay raise. The largest amount of a raise is 0.25 cents a year. As a email customer service representative I work doing emails and assisting customers over the phone while simultaneously having to follow up with both of them. They blame every action on the ""business needs of the company"", but fail to provide the higher pay for life needs of our personal lives."
good,"I had a blast working st bed bath and beyond , even for a short period of time . I left because I had gotten a better paying job.  Closer to where I live , and my staff that I work with now is not disrespectful one but ; we all work well together and help each other when needed . We communicate and everything . I only had that at bed bath and beyond with specific co workers , and some were just disrespectful and acted like your boss , when they are at the same level as you while working . But overall , the managers here are very well respectful and do not discriminate . They are helpful and you can talk to them when you need any type of help while doing your job ."
good,"Employees are treated poorly by managers, with a few exceptions. They expect you to work like a dog during back to school and holiday time, then they cut everyone’s hours down to almost nothing from New Years until June. If you’re looking for some holiday money, it’s a good place to work. If you’re looking for steady income, then look somewhere else."
good,"Work can either be really busy or really slow. No day is the same. I am either helping brides, making other registries, helping customers on the sales floor, helping at customer service, helping at the registers when there are no cashiers, or helping put away stock. Some days are good and some days I feel like there is not enough of us."
good,"company has been operating in the same manner for too long and has not evolved at a pace of their peers"
good,The company is going through a transition and they need to make their employees feel empowered to drive the business. Employees in general do not feel appreciated and many of the best are leaving for that reason.
good,"This is a fast paced environment and customer service is the number one priority.  The people are great and become as family, but the pay is not competitive enough for an adult with a family to support. This is a great first job or part time after school job for a teen, but near impossible to keep anyone else afloat financially."
good,"Company with many internal powerhouses, but limited by antiquated processes and methods. Starting to break free from their past, but with the same historic leadership, there is a lack of fresh ideas. Several realignments in the past couple of years aimed at cutting expenses have eliminated many opportunities for growth. Excited to see where the company will go as they continue to adapt. Recently all salaried managers excluding the store manager were converted to hourly associates, requiring them to work 50 hours to match the pay of their 45 hour salary, leaving many disgruntled employees."
good,Enjoyed working with bed bath when every one was working together.communication was poor and everyone wasn't working together to achieve the store common goals. Servicing the customer was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,It is a slow paced job. The only times things would get busy are around the holidays. The fellow employees there were so nice and also were the managers. Only down side was the pay and the very rarely upset customers.
good,"Workday is 9.5 hours per day and 48 hours per week salaried. "
good,"The environment was rather nice. I had many great coworkers and gained a couple friends from there. Within the sales associates and cashiers, we were basically one big family/team. The only problem I had there was management was never stable. I had about five different managers for my department in just one year. Because of that, things were always messed up and mixed around in the department. I'm not sure if they still do it now but from back when I was working there, they base your raise on the current manager's review of you. On my one year review, the manager at the time had only been working there for a month or two. She did not know me at the time and for some reason, she didn't like me whatsoever. Because of that, I did not get a raise. It was so unfair. Even previous managers said I was doing a great job and I was one of their favorites."
good,"OK company to work for depending on which dept your in."
good,"Bed and Bath is a good place to work, but there pay level is very low, and safety of others is very week. The maintenance Dept. pay was not bad, but in other depts. the expected a lot out of for very little pay."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a job. The night shift is responsible for restocking the shelves from pallets of new inventory."
good,"The company in 2011 was booming, there was exponential growth, tons of hours and lots of opportunities. Over the last few years there has been a lot of cuts, like when Bed Bath and Beyond laid off over 900 employees with no notice. Not going in the right direction, having a hard time changing with the times."
good,It is a good company to work for except they do not offer full time work or benefits.  The Company starting salary is good but not a lot of pay increases and no paid time off.
good,"Like most jobs, your experience will greatly depend on your co-works and what manager you have. One of the ones I had obviously played favorites but was more willing to teach. Another was a pretty good guy just really rough around the edges. Being there felt like being in high school at times. Gossiping, whispering to each other right in front of your face, at times there was a lot of unnecessary drama. The worst thing was the pay. Unless you live with your parents or have another job the pay is not enough."
good,"Being a sales associate at BBB is a great part time job. Flexible schedule, and its a lot better than minimum wage. However, I would highly recommend that you DON'T work as a receiving associate at this company, you are vastly underpaid and overworked in comparison to being a sales associate."
good,I've worked several different retail jobs and this company expects too much of their employees for the amount of compensation paid.  You are working in your department on the second floor and suddenly are called to the first floor to cashier.  If you work a closing shift you are expected to go ot to the parking lot and bring shopping baskets back to the store at 11pm regardless of the weather.
good,"Boring, Depressing; the environment could be way better if management were also worried about they employees as much as they do for their customers.  "
good,As the retail landscape is changing with Amazon taking a big bite out of it in most Retail stores we must fight for every dollar and be able to stop on a dime and make changes.
good,"Low pay for the amount of work you're expected to complete."
good,"What could I say it was a job. You did what you what you taught to do and do it well on all tasks. Not a bad job just did not pay enough. "
good,Depending on who you're working with and where you work you could either have a wonderful job or a stressful one. They always seem to be short staffed and customers are always ornery. Their computer systems are heavily outdated and are slow when trying to Special Order items for customers. Recently gave our 20% off purchase benefit to people who pay 40 dollars a year so the only incentive we get are randomly chosen items from vendors.
good,"--Hired to be cst, then not trained. Threw me on front end full time instead. Which can be awful stressful."
good,It’s a good job but I would recommend this job for someone who’s OLDER not really a teen job even though I worked here during high school. Managers are not the best.
good,"Company is slow to embrace technology due to lack of infrastructure and a long tedious approval process. Often planned project timelines are adjusted due to lack of resources. Company is not innovative and always playing ""catch up""."
good,Typical day is about 12 hours in your department.  You need to be able to go from one task to another when called.  You have your own department to maintain and learn.
good,"Being at Bed Bath an Beyond for as long as I have, Im expected to wear many hats for minimum pay. Was working to be a manger for the company but they no longer have department mangers. I said yes to everything they asked me to do in hopes it would look good working towards management. Has turned out to be a dead end job but I still maintain a great work ethic. Management are not on the same page an feels like every man for them selves. Its not a bad job for a young collage student or somebody coming in with prior management experience."
good,"BBB is a great place to start with a customer service background because of the fact that we expect very high standards for it. It is still retail, though, and so it is still very hectic and fast paced and can be emotionally exhausting. My managers in the store I was in did do their best to take care of their people, but corporate loves to cut hours. Unless you have full-time, don't expect decent or consistent hours."
good,I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. Management was unmotivated and unreliable for the most part. Organization was lacking but overall I enjoyed what I did.
good,"i felt that the company was going forward as far as customer relations and hospitality. the most enjoyable part of all my shifts was going above and ""beyond"" for my happy customers. I also felt that i wanted to obtain more knowledge about managerial opportunities that i was unable to pursue."
good,"Just a job that needs to be done, if you need a job and are young or just need somewhere to work you can work there. I would recommend coming in with manager experience they change managers often and hire in new."
good,"I worked here part time for over a year, and loved all the coworkers that came and went during that time. However, I saw people who fully deserved a promotion get side-lined over brand new hires, and the management was stuck so far up their own butts I couldn't believe it. But I guess that's the same where ever you go. "
good,"Typical day at work involved stocking in the morning, making sure everything is ""customer ready"". Some times you will work on the floor, sometimes you will work at the front (cashier), and sometimes you will work in receiving (My favorite). The customers can be very rude there, the higher managers can be rough and the benefits are terrible."
good,The managers were really ignorant to their employers. I was not treated right at all. The pay was not great. and the hours were all over the place and not consistent.
good,The store manger and manger are good people work with some time. When they get mad the take it out on there employees and I do t think that is far. That’s why we have employees quiet so fast or not show up.
good,"cons"
good,"Very hard work. You spend all day on your feet and are required to climb 15 foot ladders. Also, you are required to lift heavy items over your head on the 15 foot ladder."
good,Management was great to work for. This was only a part-time job for me while going through school so I didn't have benefits or anything like that. But it was very fast paced and busy!
good,Good company but doesn't allow enough hours for sales associates to stockshelves and give good cusotmer service. Good training on merchandise given to employees.
good,"Coworkers and management are helpful and friendly. Days and hours can move along at slow paces. My store sometimes has free snacks and/or food in the break room for employees. Weekend shifts are very customer-focused, whereas during the week the focus is stock, inventory, displays, etc."
good,Great stepping stone to acquire knowledge on useful house-hold items. Not good for job advancements/ job promotions. Recommend to take the knowledge and move to better opportunities if available in a different place of work.
good,Everything was good in the beginning but things started to change. To the point where the work i was doing was worth what i was getting paid and i need a high paying job.
good,"I loved the job itself, helping customers was great! However, they are making so many cutbacks that I don’t see how the store can run properly. It would  be nice if they offered some kind of benefits to part time employees.  My hours were cut down to 5 a week after the holidays. I had no choice but to find another job."
good,It’s an ok company to work for. But they aren’t too concerned about the little people. High turnover. Easy job for the most part. A lot of lifting depending on where you work.
good,"Overall, great company to learn and work for. Team work was definitely required but learned a lot working here. Learned some leadership and people skills."
good,"Bed,Bath&Beyond is a great place to work at times it can be stressful depending on the the amount of customers that come in the environment is really great the workers are fantastic and management is great this company they work with college student and allow them the time they need for schooling  but they only hire part time which at first was really good for me considering i already have a full time job but if your looking for advancement its really hard to get a full time positions with this company on average you would get around 20 to 30 hours max"
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was a challenging experience since we as employees were required to repeat phrases like robots and let customers walk all over us. I did enjoy helping people with customer service or on the floor, however. I got along well with almost every coworker, and we made teamwork fun while being productive."
good,It was a friendly environment and everybody was easy to get along with. I learned how to communicate with customers and learned the ins and outs of how retail was ran to be successful.
good,The people who worked there when I got there are almost all gone now.  One person makes it very difficult to work there. The corporate office was called many times concerning one individual and nothing has been done to remedy the employee turn around.
good,"I was a cashier and customer service representative at this job. It was fast past job that allowed you to make quick decisions on the fly. Yet again, I enjoyed my time there and the friends I made there."
good,The hardest part about the job was the management always changing. The most enjoyable part is that i made plenty of new friends and the environment was nice. I learned so much here but i mostly learned it on my own. I was known to always get the job done but I felt as if i was the only one doing so.
good,"As a cashier, good way to learn customer behavior and culture. Learn patience and tolerant levels of different customers. Hardest part is to cope with school and work balance."
good,"Bed Bath is a very Customer service heavy company who is trying to stave off death by Amazon through intense customer service focus. They do well with training their employees in this facet of retail but sometimes this can lead to them putting to much emphasis on the customer and not enough on the their lower level employees. Management and hours are another big issue, but i am unsure of whether or not this has to do with money issues within the company or just a complete lack of understanding of what resources they need to run certain stores efficiently."
good,"although it could be challenging at times it was fun, and i enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them find what they needed or alternative solutions"
good,"I was a customer service representative. I dealt with returns and exchanges as well as Customer interaction at all times. Nice place to work, They just didn't hire full time employees nor any type of benefits was my reason for leaving after 2 years."
good,Tough at times but everything was always manageable. I liked it for the time i was there i wish there was more payroll at times for major projects. Not much room for growth.
good,Good part-time job to have that is low stress. Hard to get more than 25 hours a week or full time status. They try there best to make a great culture but it's hard doing that with a retail store.
good,"Productive workplace, good for seasonal workers. Ability to get on the job training. If you are a fast learner you will move up depending on immediate supervisor."
good,"I would say that working here was good at some point and at others, it was stressful. i felt like we were just numbers instead of employees. There would always be new workers coming in and out every week."
good,"Customer services at Bed Bath & Beyond outdated, no directions to stand when check out (no signs, no arrows, no lights at cashier stands {nothing}) Each cashier has to take 5 seconds or more and walk around their stand and redirect the lines and walk a customer over to their lanes. Guest are unclear what to do in this situation and sometimes get frustrated!. This can get very stressful doing the holiday seasons(s). This area in customer service drastically needs improvement."
good,"I worked here for about a year and a half and have no major complaints. Management is nice and helpful, the job isn't too fast paced or anything like that. In fact it can get kind of boring sometimes. Overall good place to work."
good,Its an alright place to work for. Hard to move up in the company and they are not flexible with your hours or work days. There is a scatter brain mentality and proper management is lacking. Often too many managers working at once and it is unclear who is in charge.
good,"The company continues to have excellent benefits but the people at the top of the food chain making the decisions are falling further and further away from the reality of the actual business needs within the stores, away from the corporate desks.   They also have adopted the idea replacing each full time associate with 2-3 part timers meets the demands of business better.  The reality is there are fewer and fewer associates that care to show up much less actually carry their share of the workload."
good,Decent job but too many hours and no opportunities to advance career with them. Want something else where I can grow with a company. Loyal to them but not sure they are to me.
good,"A typical day at work included clock in, meeting, and straight to work, My day consisted in driving several different forklifts. Whichever was needed that day."
good,"If you are good at your job, they will offer hours, I was lucky enough to have a really good management team but the other stores I visited were not the best. The hardest part of the job was living off of the pay"
good,I worked part time seasonal for this company.  I enjoyed the customers and the store merchandise.  I did not enjoy cleaning the bathroom.  Other than that it was the usual retail job.
good,the job is ok. i was there for a year and some months. the job isnt really hard at all some of the customers can be problematic but thats anywhere i guess.
good,"Fast paced retail environment, you have to be a multi tasker to survive, which I was. Store mngmnt varied from store to store, some very good, some one wonders why they are still employed. Managers are well paid, but the associates are underpaid which does cause some negativity among the workforce. Hardest part of job was not always having the right kind of help. I loved my job and am still in shock over being let go"
good,A typical work day at BB&B is fast paced and very challenging. Time and people management is essential. Management levels are little distant when it comes to communication. BB&B employees don't work for each other they work with each other. BB&B have a lot of great programs in place to keep their stores competitive in the ever changing retail market. I really enjoy the customer interaction and solving customer service issues. Great teaching and learning experiences.
good,"As a part-time sales associate, my hours during the week varied from 5,7 to 9 hours. "
good,A normal day at Bed Bath would be slow paced and quiet mainly on Saturdays were when we got most of our business. I learned to gain a lot of patience from this job due to most of our customers being elderly people. The hardest part about this job was stocking inventory on top of columns  in the store.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was a great place to work. Like every job it had it challenges but was manageable. I enjoyed the merchandising and the standard of customer service with this company
good,After almost 17 years working at Bed Bath and Beyond my job position was eliminated with little or no warning.  The company is going to restructure of store level positions.  They will no longer have Department Managers in the company only full time or part time supervisors.  There is no room for growth.  Their brick and mortar stores are failing.
good,"It is a decent place to being working, but little room for associate advancement. Little opportunity to grow and usually very demanding. Tends to lack organization where I have worked and they continue to improve. Managers are decent, although tend to contradict themselves, but that is just individual people. As far as culture, its not too bad. They have a friendly customer service policy and they emphasize importance of assisting customers.."
good,I have been with Bed Bath and Beyond for three years when I first applied they gave me the opportunity no other job gave me without no experience at all. They have taught me a lot even though sometimes customers can be tough with you at times it just teaches us something new everyday.
good,This bed bath and beyond location is a very diverse location but the management is unorganized. One manager in specific has no leadership skills at all.
good,"It was a very good first job, a typical day at work would usually be very calm but often times there were days where everything was hectic. We got behind from the day before and are not rushing like mad to finish it. The management there is understanding and compassionate as a whole. Although once you get higher up in the cooperation you find a deficiency in care and opinions of their employees other than their legal obligation to do so. The company as a whole is unreliable yet expects nothing but their employees whole lives."
good,"Having worked for the company for nearly 10 years, and progressed from cashier to Receiving Manager, I learned a lot working for BBB. One thing I'll take with me, professionally, is that if you accomplish your daily goals, you will avoid confrontation."
good,"I enjoyed my time at BBB, but only because of my co-workers."
good,The workplace would vary on how busy it is depending on day. Weekends are the most busiest. Management expects employees to be knowledgable about products and give excellent customer service.
good,"I enjoy the management at bed bath & beyond , a solid group of intelligent & respectful leaders. They make the job tolerable and at provide considerably relaxed work environment"
good,"It;s a retail job... You're overworked underpaid and there's only a few managers who actually know what they are doing. They have an ""open door"" policy which means you can complain about your concerns but nothing ever really gets done. Many associates have to double as managers and supervisors without the compensation. It's very frustrating and I only work weekends."
good,"I loved the customers that came through the store, I never had to deal with an angry customer, they always left with a smile, and never had any problems"
good,"I kinda ddnt like the job because of the hours.. it was part time. And at times they ddnt treat us fair,they had there favorite. And ddnt give me a chance to move up and do more."
good,"they are restructuring. they have a reputation for paying well for management positions. lots of room for growth. they also own Buy Buy Baby, Christmas Tree Shops, Harmon Face Values, Cost Plus World Market and are looking for other companies to buy."
good,I liked the job very much. They worked with my schedule and allowed me to work inly on the days I was scheduled. I didn't really like the team leader as a manager though.
good,Greeting customers and assisting to find products and with any questions regarding their purchases. Stocking all the products and cleaning shelves. The hardest part was climbing 15 ft ladders to stock
good,Day shifts included constant customer interaction with little downtime. Night shifts involved a heavy cleanup of the store. Great co-workers and managers made the job more pleasant. The hardest part was rushes of customers during the day
good,"I learned how they perform online orders in store, restocked inventory and handled freight, they usually register train most new employees, but since I was a freight associate I was never taught. They're lenient with scheduling occasionally. A couple mangers are more intimidating than others, but that's not a bad thing. Coworkers are very friendly and welcoming."
good,"Absolutely loved working here. The customers were some of the kindest and I loved my job, but some of the employees make it hard to want to come into work."
good,"I wouldn't say I had the best time, a lot of the people were fantastic that I had the opportunity to work with, but I would not say its ideal, as the new manager of the store isn't the easiest person to work with."
good,"I was made the primary customer service person over a year ago and I am still in the same position, I have asked if there is any room for me to have a little more responsibility in the store but it has not been granted to me. There are little benefits working here. The discount is 20% off your entire purchase. Relationships between co-workers and management is mostly awkward and uncomfortable. I have learned a lot about working in customer service and how to multi task and solve problems."
good,"The job is not too difficult, just your typical retail duties. They stress the importance of good customer service. You always have the option of ""passing the buck"" if you don't know what to do. The managers are patient and understanding usually."
good,Working at bed bath and beyond was a great way for me to develop my customer service skills and cash handling experience.  My daily activities included many tasks ranging from working in the front on the registers to receiving packages back in the warehouse.  My knowledge of how to work a store has greatly increased every year I was employed at bed bath and beyond.  There have been times I had to take on certain manager like leadership roles and they were fun and exciting but as far as growth to actually move up in the company didn't exist.
good,"The company culture has gone downhill in the past several years. Depending upon the region and district you're working in, you may have a remarkably different experience than someone a few states away from you. Your coworkers will be awesome, which is great because you will struggle to accomplish the most basic tasks. This is because you will be understaffed every single day. Between being a cashier, handling various challenges that pop up, putting away the never ending freight, and your LOD shifts, you will find it hard to complete your regular managerial tasks. This will be done on your time. Your store manager will either be someone who leads by example, spends time teaching you, and is a general rockstar, OR it will be someone who consistently leaves early, expects you to stay until the job is done, spends little to no time developing you, and will make you wonder how they even got their leadership role. I've worked in several different regions for this company, I recommend staying away from the mid-Atlantic region. They play by their own rules in that area."
good,"Be yourself and try to help as much as you can is what I learned from working here. People who work here are nice, management can sometimes be a hassle but its not unbearable. Most enjoyable part of my day is when I can easily a help a guest find what she or he needed."
good,"Coworkers were okay"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me punching in, checking my assignments for my 5 hour shift, then trying to unsuccessfully get them all done in my limited amount of time then punching out. I learned a lot about customer service and time management. There were some managers that were super cool and would help me if i was struggling, but there was also managers that would sit and watch me fail then scold me like a little kid for not getting the oilers of work done that they assigned me. As a student, if something school related comes up and you need to call out, they will pretend like its okay, but you can tell by their actions and sarcasm in their voice that they'd rather you be working in the store than working on your education. The hardest part of the job is probably the amount of work. I was new and when I was unable to complete my work in my shift, my manager would compare my speed of work to someone who has worked at this still for many years. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet new people and socializing with my coworkers when the managers aren't breathing down our necks."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is on occasion an ok place to work. However it is one of the most demanding jobs I have ever had. The people were great and the work environment was stable.
good,"Typical Day= Stocking Shelves, Helping assist customers by answering questions and locating specific items for them even if they may not be in inventory. "
good,"Very productive work. The management could be a lot better. the co workers are Great people to work with, Excellent communication skills!"
good,"-Good Management"
good,Overall this place a great company to work for. The product we carry is very diverse so I get to see and meet a lot of different people. My co-workers are great to work with and are very helpful all around. The hardest part of this job is getting acquainted with all of the new and changing merchandise and where it's located in the store. We have short breaks and to me hours are hard to come by at this particular moment. Management for the most part is great of course in every job we have those couple of bosses that we don't get along with but there has to be balance everywhere we go. I have learned how to accomplish tasks and special projects in a timely fashion and within a team environment seeing as though I usually work better in a more secluded environment.
good,"routines-freight,down stock,sign checks,customer service. learned merchandising and ordering. management have little training time or time to help employees.Co workers work hard and i keep it buisnes only. hardest part is time management and most enjoyable is the work itself."
good,"They kept things following, had slow times where I would have to find something to do, but most of the time I was busy. Crowded hard to move around with equipment. Overall an okay experience."
good,"This is a very, very busy retail store. I trained as a cashier and had no opportunity to learn any other aspect of the store. Management is rude and disrespectful toward a certain area of the store. Loved my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects and putting up with rudeness from management. Was told when I was hired that they have never let seasonal employees go but they let all the seasonal employees go without any notice, even as they were hiring and training new employees."
good,"It was a fun experience working at this store , I learned a lot of things ,daily and worked with an excellenet team of girls who carried out the best customer service and worked endlessly to satisfy the customers"
good,Seasoned workers doesn't mean growth and advancement for all. I have only been here for 10 year but there are employee's that have been working for the company that are well advanced but are looked over because of favoritism in upper management.
good,"Needs more organization and consistency.  Managers shouldn't rely on employees that have been there long to manage new hires. They should do a better job training and screening new hires. I enjoy a fast pace environment  but I believe we need more breaks we only get a one 30 minute break if you work 6+ hours, sometimes you work a 10 hour shift with this one break."
good,"Rough schedules to work, specially if you are going to school. There is no room for promotion unless you dedicate your whole career to the store."
good,Working at Bed Bath and Beyond was a stepping stone for me. It is my first job and I have learned my customer service skills with this company.
good,"Pressler & Pressler was a job I've had since my Junior year in high school. Enjoyed working there for the most part, but wasn't really the field I wanted to continue in."
good,I was the only cashier/customer service associate most days for 8 hours a day. We typically needed 2 people during the lunch rush.
good,Not a a bad place be prepared to work hard and long hours for average pay. Has the potiental to be a career and has the potiental for advancement but not a bad place to stay.
good,A typical day at work consist of working freight. Learned that  this type of job is for a young entry level manager. Managers are like high paid stock associates. I enjoyed taking care of the customers.
good,"Typical day I would start out in gift wrap, but I wouldn't be there long before I was moved to either induction or picking. Everyone for the most part worked very well together and we normally met our goals, I  didn't really find anything difficult about any job I did. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would go to picking, I really enjoyed it."
good,"Worked there as a high school kid. Most of the time the management was unorganized and aloof."
good,"a typical day at work would be organizing anything that's not in place, helping out guests, helping others with their job assignments. the hardest part of the job was flexibility in your schedule and the best was working with my team members and working on projects."
good,"A day at the job is usually fast paced, processing and handling freight, including pricing. Co-workers are easy to get along with, management are okay."
good,"Days are very long!!"
good,"If you like someone checking the the lenght of your T's crossings or how big/small the dot on your I's are, you will be happy there"
good,I work at customer service so I mainy handle returns. The management there isnt the best but I have had worse in the past. My co-workers are amazing. We are all relatively around the same age so we kind of go to each other for advice on things. The hardest part of my job is not having enough coverage when the lines become insanely long. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to make sure that the customer leaves happy.
good,"typical day consist would consist of helping customers doing task for your manger, and cleaning up the sales floor, while providing friendly customer service to all shoppers and possibly trying to get a beyond (online orders for customers)."
good,"A typical day at work would be running the front end of the store. "
good,"Subpar upper management"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond could be a great place to work, but lacks in many important areas. A typical day of work would include starting the day with planning your work plan for the day, (which never happens, because they will ask you to do something else, and then later ask why you didn't do something in your department) checking email and calendar for daily tasks due, price changes, customer service, shelving new stock. "
good,"I was only seasonal, and part time, good staff."
good,"-open door policy"
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was like working with family members.  The variety of staff, from age to life experiences,made for a lot of fun during your shift.  The management changed, frequently, which created a feeling of instability.  I really enjoyed working at the Customer Service Desk."
good,"a typical day at work would be making sales of many different household products, working at the cash register or stocking new merchandise. i learned a lot about how the retail industry works and how to manage a cash register, as well as customer service and how to help customers get exactly what they came in to purchase. Although i did gain great experience in the retail field, management and co workers were not cooperative and were continuously subjected to drama in the work place, no one worked cooperatively also if there was ever any issues management did not seek to resolve them. The work environment was very tense, there were long hours, and not many with scheduled hours leaving one person or two doing a lot of work themselves."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond was a fun job, a day at work for me consisted of helping the customers with items, ringing up customers at the cashier, and retirieving carts for our store."
good,Help Decorate customers home. Windows Specialist Love my co workers.not enough hours
good,"Most days were usually the same. Customers were always pleasant. Management was hardly ever seen. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with management, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers make decisions. I learned a lot about interior decorating and cooking."
good,"A typical day at work would be having a meeting with all employees before the store opened about any new items or coupons that came out. Also being positive to get employees ready for a great work day. I learned great customer service skills, because they hold very high standards for there customer. The manager's were very knowledgeable with all products in the store and helpful teaching us about the items. The hardest part about the job was having to lift heavy items when stocking. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to not only work as a team but working dependently as well."
good,This was a part time position to fill the gap while I found an event management position.
good,"Moving up in the store, is not that hard they really take in what you can provide in your talents seriously which can lead to a better position. Management was 50/50 some were really cool, and others were not that much. My co workers were the best part about the job, and the fact that in the time I worked there I learned a lot. It all comes down to preference with this job, and the reason why you would like to work there."
good,great people but some of the management was not employee friendly
good,my typical work day started by zoning the floor. I greeted customers and looked for hazards before I looked for any jobs to complete by management. opening shifts i would start to put all freight away on the floor or in back-stock. closing shifts i would zoning and get the store ready for the next morning.
good,Retail is retail its not for everyone its repetitive  at this job you are constantly restocking the shelve and management will say don't do any thing dangerous on ladders when you have to stock shelve that r up to the celling but you get the impression that if your not will to endanger your self you will be let go of!
good,If takes for every to get promoted. The company rarely promote with in.
good,I liked this place located on the Upper East Side in Manhattan.
good,"I worked there for 6months on the floor and it wasnt too bad, the customers made up for it"
good,"*My typical day is I work either morning's, mid shifts or evenings. I work either at Customer Service or just on a regular register. I deal with people on a regular basis. I answer the phone on a regular basis. I clean on a regular basis. Constantly answering questions for customers. I ring customers up at the register. I do returns on a daily basis. I interact with management and other employees."
good,"When I began working here, I was a senior at a new high school. Getting a first job was great, until I actually worked there. I worked an hour after I got home from school until close (5:30 pm to 10:30 pm). This was challenging for a new student who had a heavy work load for school. I learned that the customer is always right and to always please them which is a given. The management wasn't understanding of my predicament with school and I requested earlier hours and to work mornings when it came to weekends so I could focus on my school work more. There was no change in my schedule, even though I requested multiple times. The co-workers were nice but they liked to start drama and I made sure I stayed clear of it. The hardest part of my job was working until close and then having limited time for homework and sleep. The most enjoyable part of my job was selling a product we had to promote and getting a slap on the back for doing a great job."
good,I really enoyed the regulars that shop at Bed Bath and Beyond. They always had a smile on there face because we had great customer service experience. We always went above and beyond for the customers. I was promoted to be the front end supervisor in a 6 months time frame as well. I really enjoy the cash office counts and having the ability to solve customer issues when needed. I was very dependable for my co-workers. We all helped each other out when we needed it and the management team was great.
good,"Customer service focused company who does believe in making the customer feel important. Managers are involved in the buying of product within there own department. They are allowed to 'go after' an item to help drive sales by buying the amount they want to. Very few companies allow to make those purchasing decisions. Everyday you are re-merchandising sections, moving product to other locations to help drive sales. I enjoyed training employees to learn and utilize systems and product knowledge to in turn help customers and sell with confidence."
good,Working for a company that truly put its customers first was an enjoyable way to pass the work week. Unfortunately more than one employee lost there job or earned raises due to clerical errors on the part of upper management.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a high volume retail store. BBB needs to hire more employees to get the work load completed to their standards. Without enough employees on the floor the management is forced to pick up the remaining work. BBB wants their mgrs. to be strictly supervisory, which is impossible with current workforce."
good,"A typical day includes business analysis, vendor meetings, heavy email and internal projects.  You learn how to prioritize, think quickly and form relationships throughout the organization.  Management is changing and it's too early to say how effective they will be at re-directing the company.  The hardest part of the job has become always changing set of expectations and how to achieve them.  My co-workers are smart and dedicated and generally speaking the highlight of the job."
good,"The environment here is great. Most of the employees are friendly, and even the most of the managers treat you like family. It's a very diverse group of people who wouldn't discriminate for anything. Having multiple managers has the problem of inconsistent rules and regulations but otherwise works perfectly. You almost always, know exactly what your work schedule is 2 weeks ahead of time. Can ask off plety of times for a long length of time so long as it's 2 weeks in advance or if you have someone to cover your shift."
good,Company in transition- was at one time known for the quality of people it maintained but no longer a  top priority.  Must be able to do more with less at all times and retail locations are not viewed in the same light.
good,"Very shorthanded, management is okay (they do try their best with what they have). Not the worst place to work but not the best. This company does not like to hire full time."
good,"Job is flexible as long as you manage your time well, which is a MUST. The pay is pretty good and they have decent benefits. You must be a go getter in order to climb the ladder but it is not impossible."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place if you love making customers happy and love talking to new people. Customer service and satisfaction is everything.
good,"I worked all the time and knew the most about the front end, but when a manager position opened i wasn't even considered for the position. People were being hired and given the hrs I asked for."
good,"Atypical work day would range from 4-7 hours. I learned that customer service is important in any retail setting. Customer service may be stressful at times, but it was a learning obstacle. The hardest part of the job was language barriers and the ability to give customers exactly what they want."
good,They do not have  considerations  with the employees. They are extremely  estric  with  points in attendance  even when  we have   doctor appointment  and emergency.
good,"To be successful and learn and teach the people who wants to learn and achievements they goals. "
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place. If you are just starting in retail it is a great place to work and learn different tricks of the trade. They are able to work with your schedule.
good,Management has become sterner. They put too much work on our plates with little reward in the long run. Always understaffed and constant turnover. It's a stressful place to work.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is one of the leading retail shops with its locations in North America. It is a good place to work. Culture is innovative and encourages feedback.
good,If you enjoy doing 3 peoples jobs to get a maybe 25 cent raise from minimum wage you'll love this job. This may come from the fact that we have upper management breathing down our neck. As we are a destination store in a mall outside of city limits. Otherwise lovely experience with my co-workers.
good,Enjoyed review and enjoyed experience at bbb....Bbb was a great place to work very good staff and other co workers . I never felt embarked afraid to ask a question. In all bbby was a great job
good,"I worked in the receiving department. It was fast paced and physical work but fun. You meet a lot of people. Most people were very friendly. My supervisor became one of my best friends. You work with each other so much that you become a very close knit group. My only complaint is that I was part-time the entire time I worked there. There were plenty of times I worked full time hours, however I was never offered a full time position."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond has been nice. Everyone is every friendly and helpful, especially management. The best part of my day is coming in and seeing a smile on their face. That gives me motivation to have a good, productive day. Working in the warehouse, I have gained more experience on how to operate the appropriate machinery such as forklifts and hand jacks to successfully get the receiving job done in good time."
good,The fast paced environment helped make the shift go faster.  Customers are very receptive especially when you can configure the use of the coupons to save them more money.
good,"I would work RTV, that place was a mess, the works would change repeatably and for the job and the assignments i had to do i felt like the pay was unfairly"
good,"As each location runs their own ship, the lack of consistency causes customer service issues. Lack of firm merchandising guidelines allows for creativity, but lack of control over the day to day makes running the ship complicated."
good,It was my first job out of high school. It was okay working there. I didn't have a bad experience but it wasn't something I wanted to stick with because it wasn't very challenging.
good,"An easy job but very boring and repetitive, feel like a robot with the things you have to say to every customer, hired too many people so no one had hours then most people quit and everyone had a ton of hours."
good,It is something to do for a pay check. No advancement. Mangement has horrible comunication skills. Just somewhere to get a little experince for your resume and a light check.
good,"Management is very strict and they like to stick to the corporate book rules. Flexibility with schedules seemed very difficult to do. My coworkers seemed very clique-ish and were not the nicest people around. My efforts sometimes went unnoticed and I often felt underappreciated. Now, you do get to move around different departments if need be, so you won't get tired of the same thing for too long. A group of employees were given pay raises right before I left, and it happened often."
good,Good environment. A bit slow paced but easy job and helpful co workers. Good experience with customer service and communication skills and money transactions.
good,I have nothing more to say or add to this. I really nothing to say. It's ok to work there. You have to work at a fast pace. Especially when there is new merchandise
good,"Your hours will began to decrease after about 90 days.  Favoritism was shown.  Everyone got along and respected one another.  When you call for back-up, you get it instantly.  Great Team Culture!!  The customers were fantastic!!!!"
good,"My time at BBB wasn't bad.  I did feel you had to ask for recognition and if you wanted your pins then hopefully you were friends with the person in charge of giving them out.  They did training often on products in the store and when new items came in, but sometimes go so fast it was hard to keep up.  There is a lot of items to know.  Management expected you to follow the rules, but would break them themselves."
good,"I worked at BBBY for 16 years in various position, I was hired at 3rd Shift Supv of the NOCC, became the Datacenter Manager in 2013 and I had  a good relationship with my fellow co workers and the Executives...Over all my experience at BBBY was very positive."
good,Working at Harmon ( which is the sister store of bed bath and beyond) was a great first job for me. I worked with them for 5 years and finally decided to leave. Nothing bad at all pushed me out but I needed to get out of retail because sometimes it can get a little rough dealing with customers on a daily. but that was honestly least of my worries. I loved my job and everything that I did there.
good,"My position at this employer was very flexible with hours , but also very unpredictable. I could never depend on getting enough hours to provide for my family."
good,it was a god place to work. The distance was my only problem. The people are nice and so are the customers. I like to shop there myself. They have a lot of nice things.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is an elegant environment in which to work, with sales of quality merchandise. The regular management on staff are competent and patient; however, higher ups from the corporate office visit unannounced which in turn creates pressure in all of the regular staff and employees. Employees on average do not stay very long as a result. Customers are held in very high regard and treated very fairly (as opposed to the treatment received by the employees, especially when corporate are around. Very tense atmosphere to work under. received"
good,"It can stressful place to work. Some of the employees when I was there didn't help do things like they were supposed to like help stock items. They would hide in the towel room, receiving, drapery and rug room. The management were very nice and helpful when it came to needing to understand things."
good,"all good, there many years. Was fun working there some hard work, company is changing direction, I started there as a department manager and moved up, was in many stores while I was there"
good,"The managers are good and responsive to questions and in various situations that arise during a shift.  The employees are very helpful to answer questions that I may have, and are friendly always saying hi, good morning and see you later.  Am always learning something new about cashiering and working service desk.   Only get half hour lunch break during a six hour work day."
good,"Would have given them 5 stars up until 2014...Everything went "
good,"The interview process for BBB consisted of applying through the posting on Indeed and then having the HR coordinator conduct a phone interview. After that, I had to travel an hour and a half away to interview with the district manager. That interview consisted of a lot of questions about my previous job such as how sales were, what kind of stuff did we sell, how was traffic, ect. but only a question or two were about my job performance or relevant experience. "
good,"If you need a quick job this isn’t the worst place to work. Relatively safe environment, quiet, easy to learn, worked with my school schedule, and then just didn’t completely hate it."
good,It was a nice place to work. Long hours and ok pay. You would do so much work for little money. Expected to do your job and others to pick up the slack of others not doing what they are supposed to do. Currently lost a lot of hours due to sales down and workers barely are making decent money. The general manager is amazing overall. The other managers are ok and childish. Poor communication skills and always trying to get associates in trouble.
good,"When I started at BBB I was 18 years old. It was a great first job. I learned how to work as a team on projects and management even set up fun and competitive challenges with incentives to work better. "
good,"If you're looking for your first job, this is a great place to start. The culture is fun and friendly, and not too much is expected of you. They really push the monthly items stuff, but don't sweat it if you don't sell much of them, they won't reprimand you. People in my area (Redmond, WA) had some sort of boujee complex but managers were good at getting them off their high horses without being unprofessional."
good,Not much room for moving up. Lots of call in opportunity at my location. Very good at training. Give out a lot of product knowledge. Overall a good place to start out for retail.
good,Not enough employees. Management keeps cutting hours an want you do do more an more.  Been waiting for my raise for 6 months asked three times. Oh we forgot.   Have a employee that management is afraid of they let her stay over time that takes away from hours four other people.   She is rude to employees an customers if it's a bad day. Most days are bad for her.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a good company to work for but the available of hours and store atomsphere improvement. The employees need a better discount as well.
good,Working at bed bath and beyond what is a really easy nice customer service part time job.   it could get stressful around the holidays but the customers were very nice and management was supportive.
good,"its good if you are just starting out."
good,"Many different sections and products to learn, new people to meet and exciting environment and location. The scheduling could get kind of interesting sometimes."
good,"it's a fun place to work as a first time job, or a second job alongside your second, but sometimes management doesn't know what they're doing. co-workers are friendly, for the most part, but can be snooty. environment is nice, but managers are a bit mis-understanding when it comes to health because it is understaffed."
good,"Nothing special or different, simple Retail. Great place to start off, but only ideal if you're looking to build a career in retail. Though, there are plenty other companies that offer the same opportunities. Excellent place to shop!"
good,"management is difficult to cooperate with"
good,I had a list of things I had to do each day. I had to work fast and smart. Management was ok as long as you got the job done. Some of the people were great. My job was not hard just fast paced. I liked most of the people I worked with.
good,"Fast paced, lots of training provided, enjoyable coworkers. Great products, okay discount, mediocre pay rates. Can be a bit mundane and redundant. Deals with a lot of angry customers at customer service desk. Stressful at times, uptight management."
good,"It was relaxed when slow, cleaning the store and putting items back is a big part of the day, as is shopping with/for guests. Being at customer service was just standing and cleaning that area."
good,They make sure we have a activity or event every month and make sure that they include games and food and also have suggestions that they look into to see if we can get it approved for the job
good,"The only bad thing about this company is when working for them they are very under staffed and require to do lots of manual labor. I'm required to climb ladders and put of freight, such as coffee makers, microwave, vacuums, cookware."
good,"Excellent CSR training, good sales training, hire felons, no background check, no real room to advance, low pay, no benefits, strange training anagrams."
good,"Not a bad job if you are willing to work hard. You will always be busy when working here--work often includes lifting and carrying heavy item up ladders. "
good,"There is a strive to stongly provide a noticbly better experience by being the expert in products for home and heart felt events. "
good,"At first it started off decent. There were many managers and supervisors, as well as employees that were able to work together. I usually stay out the gossip but there was a lot going on for me at times. I worked extremely hard always took call in and sometimes felt it was for nothing other than my financial struggles."
good,"Job was quite physical. Ended up having to leave company due to husbands health crisis. Carpal tunnel made it very hard on me physically. Coworker were ok, but you never really knew who to trust"
good,"I loved working @ BBB. My employers were very kind and friendly."
good,It was a fun place to work mainly because of my coworkers. My store was the easiest to work at because it is smaller than all the other bed bath and beyonds. Customers can be annoying.
good,"Depending on what shift you are given, its an alright company to work for, would go back. Advancement could be more available but pay is decent for what you are doing."
good,"Great place to learn how to deal with the public.  Stressful at times like any other job, depending on one's position.  Occasional short staffing causes stress for remaining employees.  Possibly the nature of retail."
good,"14 years at a company I grew to love, train, coach and drive business. Times are getting scary, less than a year ago they closed our neighboring store in Oxnard. 30 people lost their jobs, benefits, paid time off and security. Store lost over $150,000 per year over the last 5 years in theft. Company is not going to report as a company positive earnings again at close of fiscal year. We went to hiring minium wage employees but expect top dollar work. There will be lay offs at new fiscal year 2019 and for those of us not willing to move, relocate or promote we are not a protected employee. 10 yr employees dont mean anything any more."
good,This was a customer service job. You do customer service things. I greeted people and it was cool. They were actually pretty good. The pay was averagely minimum
good,I enjoyed coming into work and getting to know the different products that we sold. Every single day was different. The store manager was always helpful and always said hello even to this day he says hello to me.
good,"While I was employed at Bed Bath and Beyond I worked in 3 different positions and I was only really trained for 1 of them.  It made it very difficult for me to be successful in my positions and made it very stressful.  They also preach customer service as their number one goal, and when I first started there it was clear that was a focus.  After about a year they began to make changes to staffing in each of the stores and it made it very difficult to keep customer service as a priority.  In all of the stores I was in we had a hard time keeping the customers first and completing the tasks set in front of us.  We went from having 6-7 people working on the floor to 2-3 and they reduced the number of cashiers we had working.  So when there was a line up front, which happened all of the time, we had to pull people from the floor up to the front and it took away from the customers on the floor.  The benefits package and vacation time were fair, but the day to day work made things stressful and draining."
good,"Management is not always easy to deal with and I just need a change of scenery. I did learn a great deal and I am thankful for any and all skills I have learned and developed here,"
good,It was okay just know you will be required to do inventory for all stores. I didn't like that within 4 months I had been transfedred to three stores because they have a high turn over rate.
good,Bed bath and beyond touches merchandise way too much. Making for a lot of wasted labor. They carry way too much inventory which makes it very difficult to keep organized.
good,"Over the 13 and a half years I was with the company I dealt with a wide range of experiences and challenges.  Company is great for merchandising and learning how the product brings money into the company.  Also great to be able to teach and instruct other employees to be merchants as well.  Great place to work if you like to be physical and task challenged.  My over all experience with the company wasn't so great.  I put a lot of hard work in with the company and have had to grind my way to the top.  Customer service was a HUGE part of moving within the company.  Knowing what skills are needed and what to look for is essential.  Having as much knowledge as you can get is key to succeed.  Getting someone to explain and indulge in what makes things tick within the company either store level or corporate level is a battle.  I did everything from cashier, shipping/receiving, RTV damaged product, open and close the store, order product, map out and reset rooms, inventory, freight flow, training, merchandising, remodel stores, build and tear down fixtures, signing,  customer service, walked with the CEO,district,regional managers and learned form the best in the business.  I enjoy learning and this was the awesome part of working here.   Met some really great people along the way as well.  Over the years I've seen the company care for their employees change and not care so much as they used to.  I saw positions eliminated and people lose their jobs over it.  Bottom line of this company now is.....Who can I get to do as much as possible for as little compensation as possible.  The"
good,"Busy with customer service, cashiering, helping stock items and do inventory. Helping with new brides and grooms choose items for their registry. Help setting up for holiday sales. Learning valuable information about all the items in the store through classes."
good,"A typical day at BBB would include arriving at 7 AM to restock shelves, and then opening at 9 and working on the floor as a sales associate and in customer assistance. The management there was very good overall and they ran a fairly smooth ship. The best and worst parts of the job go hand in hand. The customers that you deal with on a day to day basis can make your day better, or just bring you down a bit with how they act. Enjoyable overall!"
good,"I use to do different duties . I do problem solving invalid ,unscaled , unpacked or damage items that has to be shipped to customer's address. I do clerking on checking and releasing record of items to be packed and shipped."
good,"job is ok to work at. pay isn't that good, neither are the amount of hours you get. you learn about different products so that's one benefit. benefits are also meagre."
good,"plenty to do, a lot of customer contact and physical work too. I learned a lot about talking to people as well as the dos and donts of customer service"
good,"Managers are viewed as hourly associates too often. Hope you like folding towels, climbing ladders, and running register most of your time. IT is 20 years behind the times."
good,"At work we need productivity ,quality, discipline and respect each other, workers, managers, supervisors, foremens and employers.be friendly with colleagues"
good,a typical day at work was greeting every customer and making sure that they came and left on what they came in for. If we didn't have it in the store... we would make sure we ordered it for them.
good,The tasks that are assigned to the employees make is hard to balance with customer service. Not enough help to get your job done. Training program is no so good.
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Once you move into store management the growth really slows down, with fewer opportunities.  I would have stayed with the company, if there was career growth opportunities seen in the relatively near future."
good,I had worked at this location before and went back to work there recently. My co-workers are nice and helpful.                                                        n/a
good,Working at Bed Bath and beyond was fun. With the constant changing of the seasons and having to change our seasonal section a lot it could be stressful because upper management comes in and complains about the store not realizing it is in the middle of a transition that they wanted. But the Store managers are nice and strict. Which are great qualities for management. You have to get things done. Associates are cool once we all started working together. It helps the store flow nicely. Sometimes you have to do things because others did not want to and it can be stressful.
good,"The mission and model is great customer service is the top priority. The hardest part of the job is their locations are under staffed and their budget is low. Its difficult to get more hours, if you are not a full time employee you cant go over 40 hours a week. The pay is 13 a hour ,  the work is not that hard but it becomes overwhelming because of the understaffing. If on the sales floor your expected to put back returned merchandise in your department, recover the department and also provide the front with back up if needed."
good,Working st bbb was very frustrating and stressful and enjoyable at the same time the lack of employees made it more stressful but other than that I enjoyed it .
good,I worked all day re-stocking merchandise that was purchased from the floor the day before. It was fast paced work that required long hours of focus with few check-ins from management. I liked the managers that I worked for. I felt that most everybody was energetic and positive. My only complaint was the low pay for the work that I was doing.
good,"Wasn’t able to stay on because I wasn’t able to work past 8pm. Setting up the store was fun. Met a lot of cool people. The dust was unbearable though, I have asthma."
good,Consist late night work shifts labor work lifting climbing ladders as well as customer service. And bridal consultant. Closing shift store cleaning and stocking
good,"I was hired for Bridal/China area, I was put in Hard lines which is first half of the store, for the first 2 months. Training is very quick and a lot of memory."
good,The job is a good job pays good and it's a fun working environment but the mandatory Saturday and Sundays it's not good for a person that have young kids that the weekend they cannot spend no time with their kids
good,It was a good experience I only wished the salary matched the quality of work I put in.It was not meeting my cost of living expenses.I had to seek other employment opportunities.
good,"-  cashier"
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is great for entry level workers. Once you reach the Manager role their is limited chances for advancement. Recently their were several roles opened in Senior Management level roles which were mostly filled by outside candidates. As for managers their no on going coaching to help them improve as the senior managers have limited experience within the company. The culture however is great for entry level employees as they offer bonus programs, benefits, and PTO. They also do hold activities to boost morale."
good,"I'm seeking better opportunities. It's a great place to work as a stepping stone, as in for a student or someone seeking supplemental income as a part time associate."
good,Good job to work during the holidays to make extra money. Also for college students when home for holiday breaks. Meet nice brides when completing registry for their weddings.
good,Made great friends but management was not understanding of certain issues. Were not understanding of a changing schedule or things that would pop up like family or personal issues
good,"great place to work, good pay.job security.room for advancement if dedicated.co workers are supportive and helpful.management is approachable for the most part.there are incentives for a job well done."
good,I liked working at bed bath and beyond because the training was great. They took the time to teach you everything about the company. Plus the discounts were great
good,"I love this store and decided that it would be beneficial on both ends, getting the opportunity to work for a place that i enjoy and being able to obtain extra perks. The perks are pretty much no different than that for the customers as employees get the same discount. It took close to a year to get to full time status, the employee reviews and raises are trash unless you have been working over a decade for the company, no matter how hard you work. I was disappointed in the fact that the company expresses opportunity for advancement, but it seems that there is little interest in employee enrichment and support for growth."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a company that has many good things about it, but the company is struggling to find it's identity.  Turnover is increasing, demand is going up, employees hours are cut, and you're working harder than ever.  The focus is on customer service, but the pressure to be perfect is hurting the company."
good,I enjoyed my time at Bed Bath and Beyond due to the team work environment and the chance to help customers purchase qualifying items. I enjoy shopping and helping others find what they are looking for to advance there experience.
good,"As long as you do your job, and have consistent punctuality you shall be fine. The most rewarding part are the coworkers, everyone is young and relatable. The managers are young and relatable as well."
good,"Not enough hours, management was nice, coworkers were good, just no room to move up and reach potential. Would promise more hours but never got them. Did not like that."
good,"Store is well run, good retention of the employees, great management, clean and friendly place to work. Management listens for the employees desire to better themselves, therefore they provide good training in timely manor."
good,"The company sells a lot of fun, updated, innovative products that can either be necessary or unnecessary for everyday or seasonal use. The working environment is stressful and people yell a lot at the front end help."
good,not a good experience working at bed bath and beyond hours weren't so great manager always called on my days off to go work and if I would deny to go to work they would cut my hours
good,"A good place to work for a short amount of time. Hours were flexible while in school, worked with my school schedule. Coworkers were all very nice people to work with."
good,"Customer Service Representative.  Answering inbound calls, helping customer with orders and also tracking them. It was a great opportunity to work. One of the best work environment, nice and easy job."
good,A very slow paced job during the week but stressful during the weekend. Confusing management and overall not a very good place to work. Hardest part of the job wasn't that bad.
good,Fun job super flexible with hours. No time and a half on holidays which was not fun. easy dress code. You end up having to stay super late especially during the holiday season
good,Although I expressed by leak of ability to relocate I excelled through the SMIT program rapidly but was always offered positions that required relocation.
good,Great part time to have. My coworkers are great people. We also have regular customers that like to come and talk to us every occassion they can. The work is not difficult.
good,I was a cashier and rang up customers. I loved the products that they sell but we didn't get any different discounts then the customers did. The hardest part of the job sometimes was to always smile like they wanted you too because customers can get a little mean.
good,"Coming into work every day was different we were always short staffed and our workload was overwhelming,.Managers took advantage of employesss and refused to help at most times."
good,"I hated that job, My store manager was absolutely wonderful but it definitely wasn't the job for me. I was pregnant and one of the managers wouldn't even let me sit down and I was even in nice shoes. I got treated worse when I was pregnant verses when I wasn't, it wasn't fair because I had to go on bed rest too and that standing job didn't help my situation."
good,"I like bed bath and beyond as a customer. However, as an employee my experience was mostly being ignored by management. I assume because of all the other employee drama that seemed to be rather pervasive."
good,This could be a good place to work for someone who does not have  bills. One thing I liked was that I got to meet a few great people. Some people helped !
good,"Never a dull minute always work, great hours and ok pay. Managers was ok, warehouse was fairly new so always doing new things and changing. The hardest part was keeping up with the undecided new rules etc. I enjoyed working there the whole time."
good,"my fellow employees were very friendly, fun to work with. offered a good discounts, worked fairly with scheduling. Bed Bath and beyond are customer oriented. they always go over and beyond to make sure  # the customer gets what they need as well as  making them happy plus wanting to shop with us again."
good,"Its alright. Its more of a wildcard when it comes to retail though unless we're talking the high end stores. Management was ok, they'd have their good and bad days i guess just like us. theres room for advancement but its not necessarily worth it unless you get lucky or you just love the job. the culture varies along with the people they hire, Which kinda manifests this question mark in the atmosphere.(And also i live in new york city, so culture wise almost ever retailer is like this)"
good,You are dealing with customers all the time and have to balance between the projects you are given and being constantly interrupted. The environment is very quick paced and demanding.
good,Worked with great people. the job itself was good exercise and learned a lot about household aplliences. got to smell candles which was cool and I learned to sell
good,"Working at Bed, Bath and beyond is not a difficult job. They help you a lot with training I just feel like the management there is a little off other than that it's a very cool place to work at."
good,"Just like any other job, honestly. It gets your bills paid but you won’t leave there rich. Your experience there will be as good as you allow it to be."
good,"as a manager BBB was demanding and sometimes quite stressful. "
good,"Flexible part time job that allowed me to transfer several times due to school changes. Friendly staff, not so great customers. They did force me to become a bridal consultant without increased pay, as well as little to no pay increase for front end supervisor. Towards the end of my employment they forced on more jobs than my title without appropriate pay, and enough was enough."
good,If there was enough cover for me to watch the front end of the store I would make sure each customer was taken care of. I would also make sure the lines ran as smooth as possible.
good,It's not the worst job. Pretty easy overall. It is fast paced so if your a fast learner then this is good. There are good and bad moments but nothing too bad
good,I’ve Recently Lost My Father During My Time Working For Them a Month Before That My Brother. I Told Them I Can’t Work Under These Conditions Right Now So I Told Them Im a Need Some Time Off. They Gave Me Time For My Brother When His Situation Happened & Now My Father Just Died I’m a Need Some Space. So One Manager Comes to Me With The News Saying “ Apparently You’re FATHER HAD A STROKE “ That Showed Me The Disrespect Within The Team. I Was Furious Because You Making a Joke Out Of My Father Health..... Not Cool
good,"As far as retail goes, the job is more physically demanding than any other retail job I've had. You can not be afraid of heights, and you have to be able to move, and get work done quickly."
good,Working at this company has helped me learn more about money management and how to close the daily operations and complete the deposits.  I enjoy interacting with the many different personalities.
good,"Typical workday was 9-6 with one hour break."
good,"Strong merchandising philosophy, team atmosphere , customer centric , fast paced , ability for growth and development within the organization . Must continue to evolve with technology"
good,This company is in every way the definition of decent. It will not be the job that lights you on fire nor will it be the worst thing ever.  If you're looking for something that will just get you by this is the place.  You will be slightly underpaid for working in New Jersey and very underpaid versus taking a train into the city.  If you're just getting into your field I don't recommend starting here because you probably will not have access to a lot of the tools that other companies have and are looking for on your resume.  Great for someone who has been around the block and is looking for something more stagnant.
good,It's a wonderful job great work welcome you in like a family wouldn't trade them for anything in the world great people to work with and build a friendship
good,"I work mostly morning with a night shift here and there. I get there at 9:00 am and clock in. I set up everything at the register and makes everyone has a walkie talkie and possibly scanner before the store is open. Once the doors open, I check out customers, damage out merchandise, print bridal registries, and customer orders."
good,"Quick pace environment. Fast, innovative and able to hone on customer service skills. Problem solving from the customers as was well as the staff. You must be quick on your toes for any situation given. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete your daily tasks because anything can happen. Associates and teamwork can make your day."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a very customer service based business, however you are constantly tasking and often overlooked for loads of hard work. I enjoyed the associates, and I love merchandising. However it can be a lot to handle considering it is a large department store."
good,"It was a good temporary job, met a lot of fun people working there and got the hours I needed. They expected a lot of the employees when I felt a little underpaid for what they wanted."
good,It was a pleasure working for bed bath &  beyond. Arriving at work and creating the co workers and customers was a great feeling. The environment was great and we all had an excellent team.
good,"I like my job there’s never a boring moment "
good,"I only spent a total of about 6 months working at bed bath and beyond, but the short time I spent there, I met a few good people, and hard workers, whom I did like."
good,"Best place I ever worked when it came to my schedule. They are very flexible and worked around my full time job and my personal life. "
good,It was as a great place to work for the time I was there. It was a challenging but rewarding job. I worked with a lot of great people and had some really good customers.
good,Great company to work for.  This was a part time job for me as I currently had a full-time job as well.  Very customer-friendly environment and staff was great to work with.
good,"Show up and get my job done. I have learned how to multi task with answering the phone, helping customers make purchases, and answer coworkers questions all at once. Management is not all that great. work place culture is very stressful and is often very difficult to work in. Hardest part of my is ignoring all the negativity being thrown at me. Getting to talk with my other coworkers."
good,They don’t give you any kind of benefits. You don’t even get annually pay raises. Won’t offer any accodomations if you are pregnant. I wouldn’t go back
good,"A day working here is very stressful, constantly on call. Always standing.  I learned patience.  Managers are constantly questioning. To be a lifestyle branded store.  The hardest part is climbing ladders and stocking. The most enjoyable part is working with the other people working there."
good,"Busy days normally weekend."
good,Customer dedicated and wide variety of products and services within the store location and on Company website. Company always provides training for all new merchandise and services.
good,Cashiering and Returns handled at both Service Desk and Registers. Handling items that needed to be both purchased and returned. Dealing with broken or damaged items and putting them in the proper place.
good,"Good job for young kids starting out, but not a great job for advancement.  Pay rate is low and raises don't  happen that often.  So I would say any high school kid looking for a job, or someone just looking for some extra work this would be a good job for them."
good,i work at two stores both were completely different from each other. one was more fasted place and stressful. while the other was slow paced and more relaxed. they don't offer any paid time off for part time employees only paid sick time
good,poor management  the managers were always in the office together. seeming to be very clingy with one another. and was hard to reach when they were n eeded.
good,"Nice people, well cultured. Work at the register, approach customes restock items. In this job team work is a must moring and evening meetings called huddles here establish the days work."
good,The are only a few full time employees with benefits. The is a high turn over rate as they hire new employees rather than give more hours to the current employees
good,Little to no room for advancement but it's okay for a first job or high school kid. Work can be slow or fast at times and you generally stay busy.....
good,Working at bed bath & beyond was a fun and busy environment. There was always a task to be done with so much merchandise there was never really down time. The staff and management  was very friendly & encouraging. Customer service is a big part of this company
good,"Nice store, good items to purchase, good return policy. Company will give opportunity to new comers to the sales business + cashiering- good training provided. Store mgmnt good + departmental mgmnt all right.  Staff members helpful to each other. Hardest part of sales job was top stocking large items + positioning 12 foot ladders to shelving units so as not to move. Hardest part of cashiering was standing all times.  Most enjoyable part of Sales job was helping customers get what they wanted + for cashiering was giving customers discounts with their presented coupons + seeing how happy they were with their purchases.  All round, a nice place to work at - some very nice products - can use Canadian coupons in the U.S.A. and vice versa. Company will advance staff to supervisory position when required + well suited.  An informal atmosphere."
good,"I worked at the corporate office while I was going to college to finish my degree. This place can be challenging, and the turn over was on the high side for the accounting departments."
good,The people were wonderful to work with. The benefits were awful. Management is constantly running around. I went from having far too many hours to having essentially none at all.
good,"I enjoyed assisting customers with their online retail experience and helping with conflict resolution felt very accomplished. During the holiday rush became frustrating because there was not much we could do when expedited shipping was not available close to Christmas. However, in whole, the experience was very rewarding."
good,Se aprende Mucho de los Proceso De como Trabajar en factorías pero si tienes un problema mas allá de lo laboral Recursos humanos no t ayuda.
good,"A typical day started with store operations for the 1st 3 hours before opening then customer service was #1 priority."
good,"Because the services that are needed on the floor are so varied, the supervisors ought to be more empathetic and supportive in terms of their supervision of both the new and older staff. The job requires workers to often multi task and that could be better served by individuals (supervisors) who encourage team work and performance and who have systems in place to recognize efforts."
good,It wasn't that bad of a company its just the management was bad. I was one of the best workers at the location I was in and that's not saying much. It's good if you're a fresh High School graduate but that's about it
good,"I had expected it would have been more organized but I was wrong. Even when it comes down to scheduling, it is unorganized. And for that pay, what we had to do sometimes was not worth it."
good,"Overall the people are great. Certain departments have to work weekends and long hours. 2 buildings on corporate campus. Casual atmosphere, casual dress code everyday."
good,I enjoyed being there. I tried to stay out of the drama and petty issues in the work environment. I had my own mental demons I was fighting at the time and really had to bow out. I loved my position in recieving but I couldn't take the drama.
good,"good Stock Associate nice place and people work ..Stocks merchandise according to UPC code"
good,"""Communication is Key"" we could use this a lot in everything we do at work, at home, and specially not communicate out of anger or frustrations some people don't need to be managers in retail that's all I'm sayin!"
good,I enjoyed my job at Bed Bath & Beyond very much. I was able to learn many different things in the retail business. I had different responsibilities which made the day fun and exciting because it was never the same thing. The worst part of this job was my coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed the teamwork at Bed, Bath and Beyond. They have a nice relaxing, positive work environment. My direct boss was well versed and knowledgeable."
good,"I really loved my job and working for the company. The management was poor and standards could be unrealistic at times. They also would purposely schedule employees just shy of needing a break with their hours every day. I know that is pretty common, but they even denied smokers a 5 min break to step outside if they worked over 4-6 hours. There was also a lot of favoritism with management and some employees."
good,Management started friendly but under stress revealed unpleasant side. Time off is rarely approved as they are very short staffed however the job itself is pleasant.
good,it was a nice start up job to get exerence. they leave you alone in your cubical and they do not really bother you unless they need something or if you screwed up
good,if you like retail this job may be a good fit for you. I was young and there was a high turnover rate which led to a lot of confusion. with the right leadership this will be great
good,"the job tasks are simple and easy to remember, but the management is pretty strict, and stressful at times. the people are nice to work with. i wish the employees got a bit more from the employer."
good,It's a typical retail environment. The people I worked with were probably the bet part of any given day. You feed off the positive energy of your coworkers to get through any given day.
good,"I will start off with what I did like about the store:"
good,"Management works well and work is given clearly. The company goes through many employees which causes lack of a solid team. Flexible scheduling, safe work environment."
good,"I worked as a set crew to open the store.  We learned how to set up merchandise ..We learned how to inventory items in individual sections of the store."
good,"Low pay, not much room for advancement, no benefits at all for part timers, no vacation, no anything even after years and years of employment here.  No future in working here"
good,I enjoyed working at ed Bath and Beyond. it was a quick paced job. i loved my first manager and section manager Jellair Reese. They did reviews on your status to help you improve on your job. I was improving at a quick rate.
good,It was an easy paced workplace however the interaction with some of the employees was not comfortable. I was not there long enough to really see how the benefits and medical all were but it was enjoyable when the right people were there. I may have been there at the wrong time due to all the turnover of employees.
good,"This was a temporary job that gave me a set amount of hours a week where I acquired new skills including; organization, working well under stress, cash management, etc."
good,"Great place to work, Flexible Hours, Outstanding Enviroment and the team was exceptional. Always busy and productive. Team leaders were always on top of everything"
good,I enjoyed my time there and the people I got to work with and interact with.  it wasn't until I was told that I wouldn't be getting promoted anytime soon due to things out of my control is when I decided to make a change.
good,"It was a productive workplace with good management.  The typical work days was from opening to closing hours, my shifts varied, from working day shifts or nights."
good,"good workplace, lot of opportunity for advancement, staff is listened to and everyone works together well, great place for a job and to gain  lots of work experience"
good,"Some people are lazy but there was a lot of hard workers"
good,You are demanded to harass customers and annoy them. the hours are long and the work after closing time with shipment is back breaking. Corporate regional mangers are very rude and arrogant.
good,"I was at this location for a year.  Job security was favorable, advancement was not.  I held the same training position for the entire time and during that year no management positions became available."
good,Fast paced place to work. You do every role on the sales force from cleaning restrooms to ringing on registers. You are a sales associate and a stock person
good,"-A typical day at work is a seemingly endless amount of freight, and dealing with customers on a daily basis. Both are quite easy, however, very time consuming and you need to be quick."
good,"Worked the summer before leaving for college, hours were all over the place.  Evening/night shifts were tough, stayed most evening a couple hours after closing. Lots of walking, lots of learning the products."
good,"enjoyed working at bed bath. very busy, lots to do every day. always changing featuring different items for different seasons or occasions.. Customers are the focus . All associates are cashiers and assist with lines as the situation calls for it."
good,I work 6am-2pm. replenishment. there was always work because no one ever finished the day before. No one there looked out for each other or offered to assist to complete task.
good,"I jumped around when needed. I was hired as a cashier but also was responsible for cleaning the restrooms, helping couples build registries, stocking and cleaning as well as some customer service at the return center. I enjoyed many parts of the job just a lot of jumping around."
good,"this was my second job, and i was young and dumb. i wasn't fully committed to working here. and i actually ended up leaving the place because not only were the hours conflicting to my school schedule, but i was being sexually harassed at work."
good,"Wish they offered more hours, very little chance to get full time work at this place. Less than 10 people are full time here, they do their best to make sure you stay under 40 hours a week."
good,A typical day at work included way too much gossip and back stabbing! Always a lot of merchandising and freight handling to do daily. The management team has a huge lack of communication and team work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with most of the managers gossiping with the associates and talking trash about everyone behind their backs! I did LOVE the personalized attention that was given to each customer and being able to develop other associates to further their careers and product knowledge!
good,"Working there is fine, its fun and the people are great. My only complaint would be hours and pay. For people that want to stay, it becomes difficult when raises come so rarely. In addition, the hours offered to workers varies so it becomes very unreliable."
good,"I was young when I worked here so maybe it was just me but managers didn't seem super useful except for 1 or 2 of them. Work was boring, just making sure everything looked good. Answering questions. Place is Dusty. But its a job and you get 20% off of everything But so does basically everyone else since they get coupons in the mail every week."
good,"It was such a while ago that I really don't remember that many specific details. The coworkers were great, we had a good group of people. Most of the management team were really good to work for."
good,Just like many other retail companies they are feeling a lot of pressure. Just eliminated 900 management positions and are replacing them with part timers. Customer service will suffer greatly.
good,"help customers with everyday house uses, from bathroom accessories to window treatment, bedroom decor, kitchen hardware, and everyday use of house hold cleaning supplies."
good,While working at bed bath and beyond i had a good working experience. the people i worked with we all good people. the customers where also nice people. There was never a moment that  I felt i couldn't talk to management>
good,"Management needs to appreciated their employees more and pay raises are the worst!! Worked there 3 years and with three raises made 86 cents, yes cents, more than when started!!"
good,"My experience working at Bed Bath & Beyond has had its ups and downs. A typical day at work for me consists of working at the cash register, answering phones and routing the calls, processing damaged goods, cleaning out trash and coupons, sorting receipts, and cleaning the bathrooms. I learned how to provide quality customer service, work a register, and the differences of the small appliances in our inventory. The workplace was friendly and professional."
good,Was a good job untill they laid me off with no warning. Was a very busy demanding place to work. Could sometimes be stressful but every day was different.
good,"Working for this company you will learn many different jobs, learn many job skills  because you will be doing them on a daily bases. You will be doing customer service, cashiering, floor associate, stocking merchandise, putting out merchandise from the truck, service desk, straighting the departments daily, cleaning restrooms, doing orders for customers thru the online service, bridal registry's and more. The only thing is there are never enough employees to do all these jobs so it gets stressful for the associates because they have so much on there plate being called on the walking talkies to be in different places at the same time. From a customer stand point the online service for the company is great excellent products and getting the merchandise is quick."
good,"I like my managers and staff at this location.. pay isn't great at all for everything we are responsible for, the return policy is to leanant and customers are rude towards the workers."
good,"I got this job to make money while I was working on my degree. They were pretty flexible and worked around my school schedule. I learned a lot about everyday household things. They give you classes on all of the rooms in the store, which is cool. I learned which brands are good and should be recommended. Though sometimes they expected way more out of me than they should have considering I was going to school full time. They expect you to care about this job more than taking time to study and work on school. The managers are either lazy or workaholics. The workaholics are usually rude and difficult to work with because they only like to work their way. The most enjoyable part of this job was making friends with other associates and feeling good after helping someone find what they need. It is retail however so there are a lot of rude customers that make the job feel like you're underpaid. Bed Bath & Beyond is great to work for if you're looking for a part time job, but I wouldn't recommend it full time. This place expects you to do the work of three people. They never schedule enough people to get the job done. If you're a good worker then you tend to have to pick up the slack for everyone else."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a service culture. Fasted paced and constant learning.......it never stops. Customer service and safety are the number one priorities,"
good,need to hold management more accountable speacially the ones that are not productive and start giving more advancement to the hard working ones. To many buddy buddy with district management and store level as well.
good,There was many different hour options available to work. There wasn't long term benefits to stay there. It was mostly younger people most likely going to school at the same time. Fun and casual. Met a lot of different people there.
good,"Can only speak for myself.   I'm not the best fit to work in the retail environment.   Most managers seemed fair and willing to work with someone trying to learn.   As always, there will be a few that can come across as being more tense , high strung, etc..   Good company, good policies and customer service.   My reason for leaving was to find work that would suit me better."
good,"Fast paced environment from when you walk in the door. No down time. Run from one job to the next, but that is what made the day go by so fast even working 10 hour shifts. Each manager had their area that they looked after and for the most part that part went well. The most enjoyable time was on the floor assisting guest or training associates on how to do something or improve their knowledge in a certain area of the store. Down side was the only time you got a weekend off was when you went on vacation. And even then that wasn't a promise. If you have a family and are a manager it would be hard to plan a trip. but for me it worked out OK"
good,"The company is currently cutting many department manager positions, making the ability to move up in the company much more difficult.  However, Bed Bath is a great place to work if you enjoy working one-on-one with customers and learning new things."
good,"Consistent verbal customer abuse. Along with corporate have the customers back instead of its workers. Underpaid for the amount of work you do and the job you are assigned to do isn't just that, you work about 3-4 jobs in one with the pay of 1."
good,"asked a lot of managers did not get much support from corporate, associates great to work with, I did a lot of the hiring so I made sure I had the right team and team players"
good,Good place to be. Would be better if it was fulltime. They look into promoting within anf helping those better themselves. Good working experience. Good place
good,Great for retail. Company puts forth great efforts to train and develop staff. Store's practice what they preach by performing excellent customer service daily.
good,"It was A good environment to work in. I learned how to stock merchandise, pick merchandise and scan. Management were very nice and polite. I learned a lot in this company."
good,"If you just need somewhere to work while finding something else to do, the Bed Bath and Beyond is good.  However, the work environment can be stressful at times."
good,customer service skills are a most. everyone is nice enough. its retail. it not as busy as grocery stores. they are short staffed. customers are picky and pushy. its nice
good,A typical day at work there is like a typical day at work there. What I learned there is how to work there. Managers are great people. Workplace culture is clean and team oriented.
good,A part time college time job that became full time after graduating and not having anything lined up. I wore every hat in the store besides management and learned how to deal with difficult customers and co-workers. Built a good foundation to take to a future employer.
good,All managers have to start out as department managers. You have to work your way up to a store manager. No mater how long you have been a manager it is all about who the DM likes most to get promoted.
good,"I have no complaints"
good,"it was ok to get my buy when I needed a job, but working every weekend it gets very old and it was very hard to get time off when needed.  Discounts were great but that was about it."
good,Working at bed bath and beyond I have learned how manage my time and multi task very efficiently. The hardest part of working retail is working with difficult customers. The managers are supportive and encouraging.
good,"It's a good place to work. Job isn't too demanding. As long as your good with people and can climb up and down a Bally  Moore ladder, you should be fine. Management is really flexible as far as time off and if you work another job."
good,This is an average company to work for. I found that the company can be overzealous when cutting hours to protect the bottom line in which they can overwork the hourly associates.
good,"I had a wonderful time helping people in the store find what they wanted. Cashiering was a great way to meet new people and share my interactions. The people were friendly and management was alright, they were not alwasys helpful when customers needed something done."
good,"A lot of learning through hands on experience. Like every work environment, you need to work hard at creating a place that you and others can grow through teamwork."
good,got to learn new things and work with great people and learn new things that I may not have known how to do before. easy to work with and help customers
good,"It is about customer service from the time the store opens. The customer is the most important because without the customer you do not have a productive business. I have learned that taking care of the customer keeps the customer coming back. The customer may be able to get the product from somewhere else, but because of the excellent service you give them, they come back to you. Management is important to ensure that everyone is doing their job properly and effectively everyday all day. If everyone is doing their job well then you know that the customers will be satisfied with the service. The hardest part of the job is trying to solve some of the customer service complaints,not that it can not be accomplished because it can.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers leave happy, excited about  leaving positive reviews and the customers saying that they are coming back again.."
good,Teaches a lot about having product knowledge and learning to interact with customers on a personal level and helping them make selections on what products to purchase.
good,I worked at the warehouse so I did mostly warehouse stuff. its a cool job but I worked at night so the hours were not great. you need a car to get to port reading unless you take the 40 bus
good,"It was a great experience that pushed me to be greater at my customer service skill .it had me become more outgoing and sharpen up my sales skill. Though the expierence was fast paced some days,  I loved the job and I would go back if possible."
good,"You can move up fast if you know how to effectively communicate with your superiors. Learn everything you can from your managers and go above and beyond. You will be recognized."
good,For the most part liked working here but the management isn't the greatest and hours really weren't the best either. Not a lot of training involved either.
good,I learned a lot about being a leader with A Construction Maintenance Group. I enjoyed my time there and I will take all my experiences with me throughout my career life.
good,"even paced work environment, lots of product knowledge and product training. Monthly product discounts to promote knowledge and sales of high-end items."
good,"Turn over rate was high, Little room for advancement. I accepted a supervisor position shortly after being hired. However, despite the extra responsibilities, i wasnt offered extra pay."
good,"Responsible for duties such as warehousing, shipping and distribution throughout the company."
good,"-Work with your schedule"
good,"Some great people but not all, in need of a union. Great benefits. But alot of office relantionships and favoritism to manager. If someone doesn't like you, they can make your life hard"
good,it was very quick but i learned a lot. the managers and employees were great. aislugfasdbhbsdhfbosahdbfuybgiubsdfvbaybgoiabgihabsghbaiusfgisadbiaybsgiaibagi
good,when there is alot of people it is more fun and gives you alot of things to do. such as helping people restocvking etc. when the place dies down its a little more boring to stand in one spot and do the same thing over and over agian. my favorite thing to do was to help people and work the cashier.
good,"Fast paced "
good,"typical day at work involves a lot of sweat and climbing up ladder several times a day. There are alot of rude and unfriendly customers who  really care about the associates feelings but only the feeling of their own,"
good,I worked here while I was in college working on my BA. The hours are flexible and it was very easy to request a day off or vacation time. The management was very accommodating.
good,"Typical day is to run the Front End Customer, Have to do Multi Task Answer Phones, Ring Customer, Make Sur Lunches & Breaks all go on time,it's the Last impression the customer get before they leave the store, make sure they found every thing they came in for. order Item if not in store.Make sure the Customer Is Happy And Had a Great shopping expirence and that they will return."
good,Great place to work. Growth opportunities.  Awesome management team and nice friendly place. Everyone has the chance to be the best. Work hard and you shall be rewarded.
good,"Great customers ask them if they found everything they needed, made sure they were satifed with everything before they left, great customer service is the key."
good,The summertime was the worst when I was there.There were no working fans on the upper levels of the warehouse. The management was good. Management understood most of everybody that worked there. We got enough of hours weekly.
good,BBB is a great place to work if you are willing to forego your work/life balance.  The culture of the company can also be tough because they are never satisfied.  They pay extremely well and offer lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,Great for house building and flexible with hours. Managers well presented as well as the stores. Customers very friendly. Great coworkers and Christmas parties.
good,Clock in go to manifest when we were slow on work i would ask to go to pick mod.  I learned how to manage manifest and how to make sure products were going out to appropriate locations.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond has its management staff divided between hardline and soft lines merchandise.  The management staff spends most of their time receiving merchandise, and merchandising their respective departments. Helped interview and hire staff. Reset departments to reflect the current season."
good,It's okay. It just depends on your location and the people you work with like any other job. They company itself is great and it can be very fun working there.
good,Great company but needs work to their managerial structure.Stressful when the stores are under staffed.Some stores are smaller than others are........
good,"Like most jobs, it depends on the location you work at. I loved working at the Dunwoody location, but the Valdosta location was pretty new and very buttoned up and stricker. Both however did follow company guidelines and treated the customers like royalty. I wish I could have worked there longer."
good,The team is quite decent in size. You get to learn alot about the ins and outs of the different departments. From the hard side to soft side and to the front end.
good,This was a great experience if you are into the retail business I was just trying it out I enjoyed it to some extinct I was stiocking shelves and folding towels in the bedding sections and decorating the rooms for the arriving customers also cahiering was fun
good,On a typical day I would show up around 7am and work until 3pm. I learned how to have customer service skills as well as I learned how to work in sales. The management there was extremely organized however they lacked the ability to get a good connection with their employees. The hardest part of the job was standing on 30 foot ladders and put merchandise away. The most enjoyable part was the co workers that I had there. I enjoyed working along side everyone there.
good,"There are training programs- including product knowledge. "
good,was a very good first job. learned how to use a cash register and work well with others. they worked well with my school schedule which helped out alot
good,pay decent they will work you to the bone and a title isn't anything you do ALL the work don't be fooled. they move you around like checkers game and the stores are too congested and the merchandising has gone down hill.
good,I actually did love working there but sadly I did not like being told I was never wanted to be hired for the job and the only reason I was hired was due to me calling and asking about the job. A simple no we are going ahead with someone else would have worked just fine.
good,really flexible with hours during the week which allowed me to attend and obtain my undergraduate degree. at the end i was doing multiple job roles for minimum pay.
good,"My time in bed bath and beyond hasn't been great, for what i do there the payment is too low, You don't get bonus at all even if you do double the jod."
good,"I got this job seasonally a few years ago. The supervisor's definitely treated us like temporary help. They told us that they would hire permanently ""based on effort"" but only hired those who had worked there previously."
good,"Good first job, i wouldn't want to work there for a while. It was an alright experience just not the funnest place to work. It was very boring and if something was done wrong you would be looked down upon by all other associates"
good,"Day starts with morning verbal meeting about day/week/ or monthly changes and expectations.  Customers and safety are priority, while simultaneously working projects.  Focus on sales and Beyonds(orders) take highest priority. Management is divided by section and work pace is energetic and fast paced. "
good,"- mostly customer service"
good,"The employees and managers are very helpful and nice. I enjoyed working there, I just needed to leave because i had to focus more on school and i  felt like i didn't have time for both."
good,Most of the time you are by yourself in your department and there is a lot to be done. The location I work at is usually busy and a lot to do.
good,"Opened 7 days a week, I worked part time. My schedule was most am shifts at the customer service desk, where I did returns and purchases."
good,"If you work here, you better know your stuff out on the sales floor, the register, or just in general customer service. Overall the workplace culture could have been better but there was a lot of jealousy going on. Hardest part of the job was when the register started crashing around Christmas time."
good,I regained customer service experience after not working in retail for several years. The most enjoyable part of me job was helping customers decorate for their new home.
good,"Responsible for providing superior customer service and support for a fast-paced selling floor environment"
good,It's a nice place to work just wish they would give me more hours. My managers and coworkers are great and I love working with them. I just can't not make a living on the hours the give.
good,"require strong physical lifting, climbing , and other movement. poor benefit. work is way too much, I had to cover half of the floor, cashier, online ordering, gift wrapping and other things at the same time."
good,"I worked there for a little less than a year. They treated their employees well and there was some room for advancement. However, no one seemed to be invested in the store and management was distant and, at times, unconcerned."
good,"A day as a cashier usually consisted of standing behind the register all day. They do not let you have much freedom, however i learned the true value of customer service."
good,"Nice place to work if you are looking for a second job. The hours are minimum, but the head staff will work with you. A lot of college students work here."
good,The company Is OK. You put a lot of sweat and tears into it but advancement is only for a chosen few. Company seems stable enough but always trying to chase Amazon.
good,This was a very good place to get my foot in the door of the retail industry. They had complicated procedures and training but nothing I could not handle
good,"Good money but work life balance leaved a lot to be desired."
good,Depending on the area you work will define your average day. I worked at one near a retirement community caused for very busy days. Little to no down time.
good,"This was one of my first jobs so I tried to be great at everything they asked me to do. There is no uniform, you wear what you want but you have to wear your blue apron that they provide,"
good,"A typical day at work involves assisting customers both on the sales floor as well as behind the register/customer service desk. This job taught me quite a lot about time management, and learning how to work smarter, not just harder. Co-workers are very friendly, no complaints here. Overall a good work experience."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond Call Center isn't a bad job at all. Most of the people are great to work with. The only thing I really had trouble with was keeping up with the stats.
good,"I worked real hard @ BBB. Never late & always on time for (3) years. I enjoyed the customers & most of the employees. Management needed some training with people skills, but that's retail."
good,It was a job to have a extra few coins while I we in college. It did not work out to well with the hours sometimes me staying so late. My co workers were more welcoming then some of the supervisors.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was my first job that I had ever worked at longer than a couple months. It helped to work in retail and build communication skills with other people.
good,"When I first started I loved the job, now not so much. Like any job the joy you get from working relies heavily on the team you're working with. If your team falls apart, the job becomes a source of stress. If your team is efficient, you'll enjoy your shift. They always seemed willing to work with school schedules though, so that was a huge plus."
good,Job was good. However limited opportunities for increase.  Hard worker and results are obvious but not able to see results through pay.  Thanks in advance for your consideration.
good,"Typical work day at BBB is attending to customers and providing them with great customer service skills, management is great and easy going, hardest part is informing the customer we do not have a product in stock when it shows in stock in store, and my most enjoyable part of the day is the rush throughout the day."
good,"management seemed a bit over stringent and inconsistent. co workers are amicable and fun. hardest part was dealing with difficult customers, and i learned patience both with management and clientele."
good,"My title was a warehouse picker, it was my first time being a cherry picker so of course I had to learn & it literally took me a day to get it thanks to a co-worker who had the patience and time to teach me well. The hardest part of the job is really jus being on your feet all day but at least your walking around picking so that your not just standing on your feet. I really enjoyed the job."
good,Good place to work but not really good for advancement. Overtime was good because of the work schedule Sunday through Wednesday. Off days were available for overtime which helped alot
good,"There was always a lot to do and so much going on, time went by so quickly. The overall experience was decent, however, much like every workplace there was the odd person who knew just how to get under your skin."
good,"Very flexible job for anyone looking to work part time while going to school. Opportunities for wage changes throughout the year. Do not work here if you are not willing to work hard, it involves a lot of heavy lifting and ladder work."
good,"I was responsible for sales and department ordering, conditions, training associates and customer service as well as on line orders."
good,Working at bed bath and beyond in Wynnewood is truly a task. Some of the people we see and or deal with in a regular can be a hand full but the hours are good as long as you are a good worker. You have to work for what you want there.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond boasts being above the other call centers (Like most call centers do) but they are the same. They have a nice working environment, but the HR department is always messing up things such as attendance and direct deposit."
good,"Decent company to work for.  Has its problems like any other but great opportunity to grow if you want to stay in retail.  If you have a strong store manager to support you, you can go anywhere with company."
good,"Training and Development of associates is the key to a successful store. Employee relations and leadership go hand and hand. I push all associates to drive sales by engaging with guest. No two days are the same. Typical day would include overseeing freight put away, ordering, scheduling, managing the sales floor, overseeing cashier performance and observation of associates."
good,Some of the managers are great people to work for. The upper management for the company however does not listen to what worker needs are. They do not take proper steps to identify Who are what causes accidents. The company doesn't have air conditioning or heat.
good,"Everybody had they moments but it was a fun, friendly environment. But it could be better. It could be longer breaks. And understandable mangers that understands about the schedules."
good,Managers want you to run the department and also the other departments due to lack of associates being scheduled. Expect 8 hours worth of work to be done in the miniscule amount (4 to 5) of hours that they scheduled you to work.
good,I was hired on for a few weeks to help with the store set up.I learned a lot about customer service and receiving. proper safety was taught and everyone worked together in a team. I was mass hired with a lot of other people and not many got to actually stay and work as a cashier.
good,Hard work for little pay. Majority of the store is part-time and they make it very difficult to advance. Too many managers and not enough employees.
good,This job was really cool only problem I had was transportation I had to take 3 trains to get to work.But working for this company was always ways to move up n management.
good,"a typical day at bed bath & beyond is really busy, lot of costumer's.i really didn't learn a lot it was a simple job. Management was pretty tough to deal with at times had great co-workers, fun to work with and hard working. The hardest part of the job was getting new product in and putting it out on the sale floor. The most enjoyable part was working with my co-coworkers."
good,"Fast paced sales environment and conducive to ameliorating Sales skills including Cashier skills, aesthetically appealing work environment"
good,"I also enjoyed working for this company, I would sell customers materials for their flooring projects at home.  I down stocked product and drove around machinery."
good,They had flexible hours to work since I had kids. Everyone was really friendly. The managers were cool and help out whenever there was a problem
good,Keeps you busy always on the go interacting with customers as well as answering phones. Everyone is easy going and fun to work with on a day to day basis
good,"I was fully impressed with their part time associate training.  It was much more intensive than any other retail store I've worked at.  It was very much driven true customer service.  Although only a retail job and not anything like my usual administrative assistant positions, I learned how to truly think outside the box and to go above and beyond to get a customer what they wanted or to turn an angry customer into a happy one, and I think this is a skill that I will be able to carry forth into future admin positions and excel at more than I have in the past."
good,"A typical day at work is Greeting costumers, stocking items,replenishing items throughout he day, dealing with transactions(cash,credit/debit) Doing beyond store orders."
good,"A typical day at work is normal. Most workers are cheerful, friendly, and smiley. I personally learn a lot from this job because it do more with customers. As a psychologist being a people person is what i am and i love communicating  with others. In continuation , The Management is superb only if you are on time and do what you are asked to do. Co- Workers are either tired from their feet or they are excited because its almost clock out time. Hardest part about this job is simply being on your feet for a long period of hours. Overall it is a labor job but with the other workers who you an relate with can make the time go a little faster."
good,A typical day at work consisted of constant scrambling. My coworkers were helpful but management was not. I learned a lot about being a cashier though.
good,"The job itself is very good, but the employees tend to have attitudes, and no one wanted to help each other.  It could have been a better experience if we worked as a team,"
good,Many of the associates are just there for a paycheck. Not many care about their jobs anymore. There is a lack of trying even though you do as much as you can to help out.
good,I was responsible for keeping the store recovered as well as processing freight and stocking shelves. I enjoyed assisting customers with their needs as well as working on a cash register.The department managers were always available for assistance if needed.
good,Amazing place to work. Very comfortable and supporting atmosphere. people are very helpful and willing to encourgae. Bed bath beyond is one of the leading work places to work
good,Great place to work without having children.  Be prepared to work as late as midnight. when scheduled to be out at 10:30 maybe even 11
good,"customer friendly"
good,"fast paced work at the register, learned to handle online orders through department store guidelines for customers. Was given the opportunity to create rapport with regular customers, management was flexible for the most part. Hardest part of the job is when it is bust and as far as employees were short-handed. Enjoyed co-workers the most, and environment management created for us employees."
good,"Ability to try different ideas. "
good,"During the time I've been at Bed Bath and Beyond, it's been a roller coaster adventure. The environment is very fast, you're constantly doing something. There's never a time that you're not doing anything. My co-workers there are very friendly, they welcome to help you when you're in a certain situation, and always looking out for you. Management is very good, they're constantly asking you if you're okay, if you need any help, to let them know. The hardest part of the job would be working on the weekends. The weekends get really packed and you're constantly assisting many customers."
good,Great managers and supervisors to work for at the store I worked at. Customers at the store I worked at were mostly happy. Good place to work during the holiday season.
good,"The company use to be a good place to work, but demand on what needs to be done has increased. The company still does not know how to flow the amount of freight into the building. Company has created upper management jobs that are there to find out what is wrong with the store but do nothing to help the store."
good,"While working for Bed Bath and Beyond is fun and exciting, it is also very tiresome and sometimes painful. "
good,Been here 7+ years and ready for a change. Easy to get along with everyone. Good job for a mature person. In store management is why I come to work every day.
good,"Customer Service is held very highly at BBB and the work environment is relatively laid back depending on who your manager is. Training is pathetic for I essentially trained myself and learned everything the hard way. This is a job, not a career obviously."
good,"Fast paced environment and it is great when it comes to learn about a variety of house-ware items. Managers are in general very knowledgeable about the store, but they need more training in managing people. The co-workers are people from different backgrounds, they mostly complain about their current situation. It is not a motivational insight for a workplace."
good,the company is your standard run of the mill retail factory. Not a ton of room to grow unless you're interested in staying in a retail environment.
good,"Working part-time at this job for over 2 years (and we are working on hiring our 3rd manager since I've been there) is great as long as the floor managers can call the shots.  They know the staff better than the corporate drones who come through and make everyone's life miserable.  They seem to have to come in and manager through bullying and intimidation tactics.  Lately it has ""come down"" that we (the closing crew) has to work til 10:00 PM to get the re-stocking done.  If their current process was not broken and they got what they needed during the day (more staff and hire temps.....God forbid it takes a nibble out of their profits) to get this done, life would be better.  Only the regular managers respect the fact that most of us who work at night have real jobs during the day and might have a significant drive time home that makes having to work until 10 PM a hassle.  The reason we stick around is because generally, it is a fun place to work but when ""Corporate"" comes down with these sudden changes it puts the floor managers on the spot.  They have to OBEY but know that they stand to lose good employees over it which they don't want to do.  It seems like the company would shoot themselves in the foot to just turn their backs on good workers (associates) and lose all the training and experience they'd take with them over stupid mandates to ""Meet the needs of the Company"".  The COMPANY is only as good as those on the front lines (Associates and regular/full time managers).  I think they need to remember that and make efforts to actually LISTEN to them and respect those for"
good,Very busy store with shoppers along with many items to stock. It's hard working place but people are very nice. I have no porblme but no garantee to becomne a full time.
good,"All new employees are hired as part-time workers, would have preferred full time of course. Register check out required."
good,"Always something new and different to educate customers about and  be ready for the latest and greatest."
good,When I started working for BBB there was a lot of growth and room for advancement. Not any more. They are downsizing a lot of managers
good,"The company trains their employees very thoroughly. However, they do not staff enough employees in the store and it makes accomplishing daily tasks difficult."
good,"I love providing quality service and in a big company that opportunity comes easy. The place stays busy and lots of job activities to make a shift go fast. I've gained so much experience in customer service not just from external customers, but also from the internal customers."
good,"typical day at work is ok , mopping floors and buffing them kind of gets boring so sometimes i be needed things to occupy me other than that the job is cool. the co-workers are good , the pay isnt that much but its manageable"
good,This is a good company to work for. It is full of opportunities and room for advancement if you're willing to work hard for them.
good,"Learned a lot about Ecomm, the importance of shipping orders to customers in a timely manner and holding100-200 associates accountable to achieving the daily goals, while keeping a happy and safe work environment."
good,Each day was structured appropriately while effectively assisting customers in their needs. There is room for growth if you are a quick learner and work closely with management.
good,Its a good job. expecially if ur just getting out of highschool or your in college and you are looking for a part time job. The people there are nice. I would reccomend it to anyone looking to make part time hours and maby a second job.
good,This was my first job and I learned a lot. I didn't stay there very long but overall I'd say it was fine at the time. I mostly cleaned the bathrooms and learned how to use the register. I'd recommend it to teenagers needing a first job.
good,"late night shift overnight inventory "
good,"This job required a lot of hard work and commitment. I believe I was able to meet both these requirements. Before this job my sense of teamwork was very weak and I did not have strong interpersonal skills, however after this job I realised how important strong communication skills were. I really enjoyed how well most of the co-workers got along with each other."
good,"I absolutely loved interacting with customers. I enjoy doing team work skills, however I don't mind my alone time and learning new skills quickly."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond is great, but I really would like to utilize my certification and find a job in Occupational Therapy Assisting."
good,"Everyday we would work a lot of stock and would have to climb ladders. we would help customers, that's their main policy...the customers! we would also run the register. if you don't mind working hard then you should be fine."
good,"assisting customers with find products. "
good,"If you like to sell products, and are more comfortable with lots of customer interactions this job is suited towards you. The aim of the store is to become as close to the customers as possible and to have them leave with 100 % satisfaction every time."
good,Available upon request-prefer not to express my opinions publicly about my experiences related to the company.  I have spent many years traveling and working at different stores throughout the States and therefore have many different opinions about the many locations visited.
good,"Supervised 4 other managers  and 89 employees.  Supervised all shipping & receiving throughout the US and Canada.  Input attendance for all employees in my department and scheduled work assignments.  Trained and certified forklift drivers.  I received the ""Employee of the Month"" and ""Safety Employee of the Month"" awards.  The hardest part was working long hours and the most enjoyable part was the team effort of the employees."
good,I really enjoyed that job.They provided a comfortable work experience.  You didn't mind working hard because the company really showed that they appreciated their employees.
good,I enjoyed working here. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and making them feel welcomed and important. I would go out of my way to make sure the customer was happy. My co workers were great and the management was okay. The hardest part was during the holidays and it was super busy and I had to work late.
good,I didn't exactly understand what I was signing up for until after I was accepted the job. I don't mind hard work but everyone has to carry their own wait. Love most of the people who worked their and love what the company stands for.
good,Daily duties were performed in a quick manner must have product knowledge and b willing to work w/ good communication skills positive attitude and strong work ethics.
good,Just helping customers I learned about a couple of new products management was ok except for one but everyone else was ok to get a long with co workers was easy to get a long with hard part getting on the ladder to get thingss down enjoyed just helping people
good,"With BBBY I was able to get more into a big box management scene. I enjoyed the amount of balance required between time management, projects, and most of all customer service."
good,Assisted Product Manager to develop private label bedding and kitchen textiles. Worked on the launch of exclusive Kenneth Cole brand.
good,Typical day here was all about customer services. I also ran the stock replenishment team. I also worked in the receiving department and helped with running of the front end.
good,They are great its a fun place to work at.  But its not consistent with hours to employees as well as customers.  You can be dead one minute or whole shift then completely busy the next.  But it also keeps you on your toes because you have to keep an eye out for if there is counterfeit bills and if there is theft as well
good,"Everyone calls in all the time! Due to that the other person on shift has to complete all closing duties! Co-workers are friendly, most customers are friendly."
good,"I have learned how to register a bride, speak more to customers, helping them with orders and finding and suggesting products for them. The hardest part of the job, is being on your feet all day without any breaks except at lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping different people."
good,company was very professional and organized and also cared about the empolyees
good,fun place to work but they give no real hours they tell you you will get 25 to 30 hours a week but give u 18
good,"I personally didn't really enjoy working at Bed Bath and Beyond because they only had me do one type of job the entire time I was there. I was never able to work in other parts of the store or help customers on the sales floor, only on the cash register."
good,its an ok place to work. good at first but had to leave because of school. I learned alot working there
good,"Creating a noticeably better shopping experience for all guests is priority for all associates. Co-workers become family, the hardest part of the job is the work life balance as managers are expected to work at 50+ hour work week, and some travel over an hour to and from work."
good,I learned the different things that goes on in the world that people would never know went on. it was exciting for the most part but when the things continued  to happen it start to become disappointing.
good,"Customer service, answer phones. restock shelves. register audits"
good,"Everyday going into work I insured that my work area and store was clean and set for the day so that when customers first came in, the store would be clean and fully stocked. Being knowledge about product BBB carried was very important making the customers happy and the business profitable. That the staff was ready and prepared to help every customer that entered the door! I fully believe in making the customer first priority! I built relationships with customers to the point where they would come in and personally ask for me by name. My co workers were very important to me. Having them have a positive attitude, working as a team and not feeling uncomfortable about asking questions 9 out of 10 times will insure for a positive and successful work day. I took pride into training my staff and letting them know that they can always come to me with any concerns involving work to never feel uncomfortable to come to me with any issue they might have. Even personal issues as long as it was at appropriate time if they needed to talk I was there for them for support. Just like anyone if you have something personally going on at home it is sometimes hard to shake off by the time you get to work and sometimes you just need that ear to get threw the day to be able to do the job duties required at there 100%. At the end of day if all customers walked out the door an were happy and satisfied whether they made a purchase or not my myself and co workers would be happy also and it makes a job worth working for!"
good,It was OK. They barely work your schedule even if you do put in a change of availability. Very diverse company.
good,"•	Manage high volume location with annual sales exceeding $10M through selective hiring, effective training and quality customer service"
good,"I honestly don't remember much about this job. I was not there very long, but my co-workers were very kind. If I remember correctly, my job consisted of me keeping my area clean, neat and fully stocked. I did not work the register, but I did interact with customers frequently and that was fun."
good,Love the customers and working with great coworkers. Managed very well with great security.
good,"- put away all merchandise on floor, made sure everything was filled"
good,As depart manger it was boring and the management was like a revolving door. The pay and benefits made this job worth it.
good,"Great place to shop, high on customer service. I love working with the bridal couples who are registering with bbb. Very stressful place to work."
good,"I cashiered and helped guests, stocked shelves, and helped put where need through the day."
good,Ok place to work for. They don't pay the best but everything else was ok.
good,"over worked, and pay wasn't that great and people whom i worked with was not happy campers"
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a large company. I learned the basis of my customer services skills under BBB's motto of ""never say no."" I was able to learn shipping, receiving and inventory procedures."
good,Management team works extremely hard to keep store standards at a maximun.  Company believes in Customer Service and expanding its e-commerce.  I've learned that you cannot be complacent in today's market and that you have to stay on top of your customer base.
good,"Arrive at work, immediatly get started working on freight. Putting out new products, filling stock on the shelves, putting away overstock, helping guests locate and understand products. Coworkers are awesome and very helpful. Very very nice people. Toughtest part of the job would have to be juggling all of the tasks at once. Summer and holidays get really busy so that can be a difficult time."
good,"typical day- work out freight from shipping & receiving, cashier, customer service "
good,The job is physically demanding especially when expected to assist customers while climbing a twelve foot ladder all day.
good,"many traits i have inherited from bed bath and beyond, to many to list"
good,"The work load can be heavy as Bed Bath & Beyond has many customers throughout the US. Duties can vary from taking customer phone calls for placing orders, tracking deliveries, filing claims for lost or damaged packages or submitting customer compliments/complaints. Other functions are divided up into the different departments such as Email, Chat, Operations or eService all servicing the customer providing the best customer service experience. It can be very busy but also rewarding when your efforts and hard work help customers with their questions and concerns keeping them coming back."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond is hard work if you do replenishment, but the people that you work with make up for it.  Being part of the replenishment team means working for people that do expect a lot of you but not outside of possible.  There is a lot of ladder work so if you have a fear of heights then this isn't the job for you."
good,Company pays very but you will earn every penny. No job work/life balance. Limited opportunity for advancement in many areas.
good,An average store with horrible pay and schedules. Co-workers were cool. Great starter job.
good,Giving great customer service. Training new employees and running a busy environment
good,"A typical work day for me is simple, going in to do my job. Nobody bothers anyone and everyone was very helpful. I learned how to perfectly wrap a gift, which may seem funny but I actually never knew how. Management was kind of not organized as far as hiring people and how they terminate people. My co-workers were very nice and their really wasn't anything hard about the job. I loved going to work there. Your in your own booth picking items off the line and wrapping them for customers. I was pretty much to myself my entire work shift."
good,good retail experience. Managment builds great teams and team members have personality and great place to work while young
good,management need to listen more to there employee. but if they ask me back I will go
good,"I would mainly work nights so the night crew would have to work on freight, main goal was to greet and help every customer. I would lift heavy and light product. Climb the ladder and stock it where needed. I always had assistance because it was a big ladder and for our safety as well as the customers safety. "
good,"I was kept busy all throughout the day, rarely any time to be idle."
good,"I networked with some very influence individuals."
good,"Over all, Bed Bath Beyond is a good opportunity for most college students. As there is yearly reviews where the employee can increase wage due to optimal performance. However, this is not a buisness where moving thorugh the company is easy or even promoted. You will work more than you are being paid and will have the responsibilty that matches."
good,"Management needed showed way too much favortism....I learned alot about customer service. I dealt with things like loss pervention, markdowns, stocking etc"
good,"Typically, a day of work consisted of stocking shelves, engaging with customers on/about product in order to help them find what was needed, maintenance, cashiering, and occasionally, escorting a bridal couple to help them build an interesting a diverse registry."
good,"This company taught me more then anything else how to multitask.  As manager you need to wear many hats and give your time to any visiting district support staff when they arrive. Each support staff demanded you spend time in there specific area while still continuing to juggle the other areas of the store. Its like spinning plates while trying to balance yourself on a high wire.  Company has their favorites and should you choose to cross one of those favorites the punishment is swift and without reason. Really not consistant in many areas. District staff very demanding and belittling, showing lack of repect for their associates."
good,"Supervising floor associates, ordering product, merchandising, completing reports, customer service and scheduling."
good,"•Positively communicate and demonstrate the company’s Core Values by developing trust and respect among staff, building strong teams and partnerships through collaborative work ethics, and driving business results by taking ownership and pride in the company and getting things done. "
good,I enjoyed helping customers. They always came first. Some days around holidays were extremely busy & long but it was well worth it. Other days were just too slow & we wouldn't have hardly any customers. I'd find myself rearranging the shelves & dusting. Anything to stay busy.
good,"Interesting place to work... melting pot of personalities, it's a retail environment so that should sum it up."
good,"Busy. "
good,"I work part-time, typically around 25 hours per week. The hours vary per week. I have different tasks depending on what shift I work. In the mornings we focus on special projects such as merchandising aisles, rooms, and displays. At night we focus on zoning (straightening and cleaning up the store) and freight put-away. Customer service is always our top priority during store business hours. The management is great when it comes to training, providing additional training if needed or requested, and communicating what is expected on both a daily and weekly basis. I'm happy to call many of my co-workers my friends, which is one great aspect of this job. I enjoy being able to work with fun people who are dependable and helpful. Another aspect of this job I enjoy is interacting with customers and the ability to provide product knowledge received during continuous training and refreshers. The hardest part of this job  is freight put-away, specifically heavy and bulky items. We top-stock excess boxed items such as cookware sets and vacuums and as a small female, carrying and lifting such items up 12 foot ladders is more difficult than it is for others."
good,"This company is ever growing, and require the employees to work very hard to keep up."
good,"I learned alot while working here, and will always remember to have customer skills in every work place"
good,"The job was very reliable, also received the warehouse and shipping experience."
good,"The company has a whole is great has in customer service and products. I truly love the company in many ways and learn a lot ."
good,"Busy"
good,job was very unorganized and management was very poor due to them yelling at employees in front of customers
good,"Eh it was a good part-time job, typical customers and complaints. Though this job did help me with my customer service skills."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a upbeat, fast pace, friendly environment to work in. I enjoyed the ability to build relationships with customers and being recognized by my peers for the quality of work I executed. The downfall of the job was it was very time consuming and the hours were hard to raise small children around. Early morning starts and late night closes made it difficult to plan care for my children because the schedule changed weekly."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a fun paced company to work for. Most of the customers are nice and get along with you. I learn something new everyday at the job. Mgmt is a good staff. I really like my co workers, there's never a dull moment when working. They are nice down to earth people to be around and I wouldnt trade them for anything. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the cutomers that are rude and spoiled. The most enjoyable part of the job is the staff."
good,It was a great place to start with great co-workers. There is a lot of merchandise to stock and lift.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is an exciting and fun company to work for. I been with Bed Bath and Beyond for three years and the only reason am searching for another position somewhere else is because, I still have not become a full time employee and I have no benefits. My day constantly changes. I usually like to start off my shift by stocking and relpenishing items that have been sold. I also have to maintain the store clean and organized and take on different types of tasks provided by my supervisior. With all that I do I still have to help customers with thier need which is my favorite part of my job."
good,"You get in start running reports, then start checking issues with inventory, fixing them, slot new items, make sure everything is in the correct location."
good,I enjoyed helping customers when they have certain questions either on the phone or on the sales floor.
good,It's just another place to work.  Salary was good but not an inspiring place to work for.
good,I like the company very much. Good work life balance. Management very responsive
good,"I just started to work with them part-time. Their merchandise is really awesome. There are so many different things for the home, and many things that are advertised on TV. Everyone has been so nice and helpful with all my training."
good,"Typical day consisted of answering calls in your cubicle and incomeing emails,"
good,"Productive busy days. "
good,My days there were always busy.Management and co-workers were nice and enjoyable to work with. 
good,"I worked on the ""soft side"" which were towels, bedding, curtains, ect. I learned how to fold everything. I also learned organization and neatness."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great company to work for. a typical day started out with a morning huddle to discuss what the goals for the day were going to be. i learned a great deal for it being my first time in retail, such as taking inventory, back stocking items, and shipping and receiving. the management had a good understanding of the employees and their lives, so when a certain situation would present itself; they had it covered. my co workers were fun people; lots of good chemestry and communication between us. the hardest part of the job for me was the sales floor. between completing different projects and helping customers was quite a pickle sometimes. the most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping people find what they needed. it feels good to help someone and they come back to you for help at different periods of time."
good,"The day is non-stop and critical of planning. Organization is a key to a successful day. This is required of all managers, or other managers who be needed to fill in the slack. The difficult area of the position is finding reliable and energetic associates, willing to give as much as the managers do. The most fun I have is setting and displaying new items for the customers to enjoy. Plus, sharing the knowledge of merchandise to give the customer the ""feel good"" feeling needed for them to purchase an item with confidence."
good,"For a first job, it was a slightly challenging experience but it taught me a lot about customer service and using the cash register. "
good,The business wasnt well run mainly due to the fact that management was not properly qualified to manage the store.
good,"I began employment at this Beaumont branch of the corporation after an intense job search and an unexpectedly longer-than-planned stint of unemployment. Not having a vehicle (the reason I had to leave my previous job), the store was in walking distance from my house and was the only place hiring at the time. Unfortunately, they were hiring in early November, just in time for the beginning holiday season. So, needless to say, my first experience with the company was during a bustling holiday extravaganza, and my very first holiday season in a retail environment. I was overwhelmed, but I enjoyed the busy work. the company, received merchandise five days a week, M-F, which encapsulated a majority of our part-time days. The company, at least the Beaumont branch, did not schedule hourlies full-time. All labor was scheduled part-time hours only. I, a majority of the time, was a closer, scheduled 5p-11p, but usually working later than that, and no more than 4 days a week, sometimes 5. Duties included customer assistance as a number one priority, along with backstocking and down-stocking to fill empty holes on shelves, fronting and zoning, sweeping and ensuring the superb quality of merchandising racks and walls throughout the day and before end of shift. The store specializes in a one-of-a-kind merchandsing display, composed of a central track-like main walkway which guided customers through every department of the store. The departments were positioned inside the track, abutting each other, and outside the track, filling out the end perimeters. And, of course, each department was"
good,"Always greet anyone coming in the store. Thanking them as they leave telling them to have a nice day. Cashiering, shipping and receiving. Learned how important customer service is. The job was fun, liked all the management as well as the co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my day was knowing i did my duty's.  "
good,Not there long enough to get a feeling for the job as a whole
good,I enjoyed the outdoors and swimming. Working with children was a plus. Everyone worked together.
good,"Days are long and your always on your feet. Being a well organized person will get you far since you have many many responsibilities that need to get done on a daily, weekly and monthly time frame. Knowing your priorities and accomplishing those first are a must. This is all while taking care of the customers and exceeding their expectations of service. This company allows freedom of merchandising. You can use your creativity and knowledge of clientele to order new items to feature or find ways to re merchandise an older item and make it popular again. Management is in charge of creating a positive environment while building a team this will exceed in every area from service to merchandising and even product knowledge. Co-workers are friendly and goal focused to make their store the best it can be. The hardest part of the job is walking away everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,"Here you are always on the go! Helping customers, looking for items, and putting away stock take up a lot of your day!"
good,I liked the products that are available. They have practical things used for every day existance. I appreciated that they also made multiple discounts available to their customers and associates as well.
good,"My work days are the normal Monday through Friday with an occasional Saturday. I have always worked in Customer Service until I started working in a recieving position. I loved it. As much as I love helping people, I enjoy being able to stay busy while everything is fast pace. There is nothing very hard about a customer service job, minus the slow pace of it. I have always enjoyed the people I get to work with and some of the friendly customers and familiar faces that are always returning."
good,I learned more about bedding and cookware in the time I worked there than my whole three years in the Army and childhood.
good,Each day we would make sure that each customer had found and purchased the items they were interested in.
good,Being a housewares associate i was responsible for assisting customers in my department and stocking shelves. Also lending a hand at the cash register when needed.
good,They like to keep you just below forty hours so they do not have to pay health benefits at least when I worked there awhile back.
good,"I would start my day by opening with managment. Clean up front area until meeting. Then I would open cash register. Help any guest that had question about store location of items, sales or any of the many questions that could be asked. I learned that you have to be quick on your feet to assist the many guest that come into the store. The best part of the job was, I was able to travel with company while my husband travel with his."
good,"On a regular day I deal with at least a 100 customers at the customer service desk. I have to do my best to make unhappy customers, happy! Usually I supervise three other cashiers on the front end while continuing to provide service to my customers. I have to be aware of the security alarms and checking bags when the alarm goes off. I have to answer all phone calls and get them to the correct department. Also as an associate one has to take classes on the products that we carry and be able to sell them to any customer that walks in. I have four managers over top of me and its hard accommodating them all because they all want something different. My co-workers are for the most part pleasant and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer tells me I made them happy and went beyond the call of duty for their specific situation! The hardest part of my job is being responsible for other workers actions."
good,It was an ok job but once the assignment was over they were not able to find me a new one.
good,i needed a second job so i work here and had no problems. plus the had great benefits
good,"Register couples or individuals who wanted to register for their upcoming event. Print out registries and explain to each customer how the registry work and if need be, show the customer where the items were. Place orders for customers who would like their items sent rather than take it with them. Clean displays everyday and every 3 to 4 months change the dept for the following season. I learned about various products in the store and how to sell it. Management was not professional at all, especially the store manager. He was a bully and did not know how to talk to some of the associates. He was not fair with the scheduling if it conflicted with his or if you was not on his favorite persons list.He was not organized and didn't know what he was doing or how to run a big box store and yet through all the bad store walks and poor sales because of his lack of work ethics, the company has yet to let him go even with most of the associates that would love for that to happen, speaking on their behalf.I got along with all co-workers.The hardest part of the job was how fast paced and multitasking it is simultaneously. The most enjoyable part for me was getting to know the customers and building a relationship with them."
good,"I have learned how easy your job can be with the right management and staff. Also, how I can't do everything by myself. I need my staff to be successful."
good,Good experience. Worked well as a part time job during my full time school schedule.
good,"A typical day at work goes from assisting customers and answering any questions on products, to retrieving products from the top with the use of ladders, and also using the cash register to clear lines and get customers out quickly."
good,Overall good people and fun packaging w/no constraints on branding.
good,its all about the customer....Customer service is number 1.
good,"A typical day involved me helping customers find a particular item, stock and organize the shelves, and occasionally cashier at peak hours. It was not a difficult job overall but sometimes customers could be difficult to work with, especially if they ""forgot"" their coupon."
good,"Great job security, great benefits/ compensation. Room to grow withing business"
good,Great work enviorment Friendly coworkers. Hardest part of job was the coupons the customers had that were expired we still honor them
good,"Each store as their own routine but every store is to have one and it's help you get thru your day without a lot of distraction/or putting fires out. You start of working the entire building and develop a to do list on what needs to b completed visual(such as freight left from night before/bathrooms/stock replenishment from sales), am and pm huddles at 9:00 every day. Go over goals for the day/projects/customer service always/shrink and safety for the day.Work on t do list, projects or goal while dealing with Customers/vendors and ect..."
good,This company is highly devoted to customer service. I have been working there for 2 years to pay my way through college. I am simply looking for a company outside of retail with better chances for growth.
good,A typical work day consists of assisting customers with their shopping needs and assisting bridal registrants and guests with their registry selections.
good,This is a company thats hard to work for. Its hard to advance in this company and the pay sucks for all the hard work you do
good,Bed Bath & Beyond was able to teach me the importance of customer service. I gained confidence in my verbal communication abilities as well as cash handling abilities.
good,Working here taught me the essence of customer service and how it really builds a business. There was a lack of communication between management and employees. No one really got along. However you'll still learn a lot about how a business functions here.
good,"I think Bed Bath and Beyond as a company is a great place to work and grow with, just my particular store needs a lot of help. I enjoy working with my cashiers and training them. I dislike the management I am under as they are not very professional and don't follow policy on a lot of things."
good,"Satisfying and customers, Inquiring about any product info. they have, Delivering great customer service, Making sure that employees stay on task and focused"
good,No advancement opportunities. Good group of associates that care about the company but lacks quality in the manegement field.
good,"standard retail experience with little perks. long hours, not many shifts availabile, and lots of inconsistancy."
good,"Busy fast paced work environment during the weekends, more project orientated during week days. Offers part time and seasonal jobs only."
good,"While working at Bed Bath and Beyond you will meet some of the nicest individuals in the form of customers or employees. However, I feel there are many unprofessional people in the form of management. Furthermore, the company itself should review some of it's policies towards employees and scheduling."
good,"Very simple job, but very repetitive and management was never consistent. I felt like I was never valued and inconsistency among many other things. I never had a consistent schedule."
good,It's good experience to work in retail. Give you the opened minded about your costumer services. Being  postive and  derisive place of equality.  Product are great and usable.
good,It was a decent job I had no qualms for the first month or so. After that though it got really formulaic and outlined. Stocking kitchen supplies and such just wasn't satisfying after a few months.
good,I took the job at Bed Bath & Beyond to supplement winter income.  My Mate/Deckhand job is season.  I enjoyed working there the management and staff were very helpful and support.  I left because they could not offer me enough hours.
good,Good job I worked there for three years willing to give u a shot to learn the company from the floor up but some of the people sucked but all in all good job management was outstanding
good,"I started my job with the Shrewsbury location and it was pretty bad. The store manager there was a jerk and wicked Narcissistic. Never appreciated for all the hard work you did and always being expected to do more. Very stressful environment especially for full timers. "
good,"If you are barely starting off working then this job is for you but for someone who goes to school and pays bills this job is not for you , hardly work any hours"
good,"Not something I would recommend for a young person. A lot of standing around and it gets pretty dead after 4. "
good,The Management staff is helpful and friendly. The company under pays it's associate and does not give the best raises. The flexible scheduling is a plus.
good,"As a department manager, you are scheduled 50 hours a week but may work closer to 55-60 hours. The company is demanding of their managers but treats them very well in compensation. As a manager, you not only lead your team, but play right alongside them ringing as a cashier, working freight, sweeping floors, etc.. Every other company I have worked for has had a known hierarchy within their management staff. I like that the culture is a bit more casual and the managers are doing the same tasks as the associates at times. It keeps the culture humble and provides a good work ethic for the other employees when they see their boss doing the same things that they are asked to do. Staffing is the company's biggest challenge. They do not provide enough hours to achieve the expectations for the level of customer service they would like to have. It puts added stress on everyone that works at the store level to try to maintain the store and take care of its customers to the best of their ability. The people I worked with were definitely the reason why I stayed with the company as long as I did. Fellow managers were all hard-working and empathized with the amount of stress you had on your plate but were willing to lend a hand where needed."
good,A typical day working here involves a great pep talk in the morning by our opening manager and us providing great customer service skills to our customers. The coworkers and management are more then happy to help you and teach you how to do your job properly. The discounts are nice. But as a part-timer i wished we had some benefits.
good,"The people you work with are great, but mistakes made by higher ups in corporate have immediately run down to effect the sales force. Fun place to work because of the people and fun to be fast paced."
good,"I was able to go above and beyond with all tasks assigned, but I felt that there was a lack of communication throughout the management staff which lead to confusion with the sales team. I got along with my fellow coworkers, but was unimpressed with how little everyone seemed to care about their own performance. I felt that I had to pick up the slack of my coworkers and did not receive the acknowledgment I felt I deserved. This was not just the case for me, for there were coworkers that came and went that also did not get the praise they deserved. They have had recent changes in management, so hopefully it will be better for future employees."
good,"Day begins by making sure store looks presentable and all merchandise is in correct place. As customers come in, always approach them in a kind and friendly manner to offer assistance. If the store does not have an item they look for, always offer to double check at online catalog to order it or hold the item for them if a sister store has it."
good,Great Manager. Very flexible when it comes to conflicting school or other schedule outside of work. Hard to advance and average pay is something to be desired.
good,"Work flexibility was great. Working during The holiday season is stressful at times especially if we were short staffed, though management will try hard to get the lines down efficiently as possible."
good,Overnight stocking at bed bath. Preparing the store for customers in the morning and also keeping store clean for the employees for the morning shifts also  unpacking   Freight  Stocking it in the right  position
good,Pay wasn’t the best in its field but it was relaxed and flexible enough that most wouldn’t allow. Some of it is very fast paced and you gotta move fast but it’s nothing too crazy
good,My shift started at 11:00 am with 5 minute leeway.  But then they tried to make it where you clock in at 10:55 and had to make it to startup at 11:00 or you were considered late. We had to get corporate involved to revoke the rule. There's no incentives for your production if you hit over 100%. Also theres no a/c in the warehouse.
good,For the work being asked to do or expected to do the pay doesn’t cover it. Easy way to pick up hours as long as they don’t exceed your status whether you’re part time or full time.
good,"Christmas was a nightmare. The lines at check out were 20-25 carts deep per register. It was exhausting and stressful. The managers were great though, very knowledgeable."
good,A pretty okay place to work. They refuse to give hours and I work 15 hours a week when i’ve been begging for 30 for months now and they refuse to give it to me.
good,Loved the fast pace and people. The hours made it difficult to maintain work/life balance. There were some excellent training programs. The company paid attention to what the customers wanted in the store.
good,the managers don't know how to treat people how they should be treated. they don't care if you are sick. the one manager is so condescending when she speaks to you. they tend to pass off jobs that aren't your title to do. even though you still have your own stuff to do
good,"Worked 12 hour shifts every weekend sat-Mon. It's a very slow process throughout the day. A lot of the time there will be some sort of error withing the warehouse, whether its with your gun ( scanner), Computers, or conveyor belt. They have trainers that teach you everything you need to know depending on what department they put you in(very easy). The management sucked, they were very unorganized. It felt as if they didn't know what they were doing until we got in our morning huddle. There's two types of workers at the warehouse. The quiet hard working employees and the loud obnoxious employees that hide and talk throughout the whole day and do the minimal. The hardest part about this job was trying to stay busy. It's SO slow you run out of things to do in your department. I was in discrete/ picker I work at a fast pace so I'd be getting at least 15 boxes done in less than 10 minutes depending on the product that needed to be pulled. I suggest you do NOT work here during Christmas time! There is not enough materials for employees and there were many times where arguments turned physical. People fighting over scanners and acting foolish. So much drama, So I'd say you stick to yourself or the higher rank employees who take there job seriously."
good,"I worked at Bed Bath & Beyond for about 2 and a half years. In that time I met a lot of awesome people, both customers and coworkers. Our managers even at their worst were better than most managers I've ever worked for. The pay was definitely above average for part time (at least at the time)."
good,Had a very good management team and was very productive. I enjoyed working with them and made the job enjoyable. As a management team we had the flexibility of ordering the products for the store.
good,"I Loved working at bed bath and beyond. Most of the management was excellent. COMMUNICATION lacks as a company (from corporate down)  I feel they have way too many choices of the same item, and stuff gets moved around TOO much!!"
good,"The store did not teach everyone the same rules, did not have enough walkie-talkies for everyone. Did not have cameras until the wrong people were accused of stealing."
good,opportunities to move through out different areas of the store/company. Some benefits depending on position. Fast paced environment at times. largely a team environment.
good,It's not  hard job. The most trouble you might get out of a work day is the coworkers and sometimes customers. Best part of job is when you are getting ready to clock out.
good,"When I worked there I was a part time associate. I saw many managers leave and many managers stayed. The area managers are not friendly to associates. They do not talk to associates. As apart time associate, you had no benefits no vacation time, bereavement nothing.  I got 401 after working their 4 years.  Depending on your hours worked you have accumulated"
good,The people who worked there were nice to be around and work with. The customers were always understanding and cooperative. I learned how to stock items that we had received.
good,when i started working at bed bath and beyond it was a little boring but about a month in i got switched over into customer service. customer service was a lot of fun and a great experience. i noticed that i quickly advanced in doing what was expected and i enjoyed doing it. i liked having control over the customer service counter and keeping things organized.
good,"The job was okay at first, but once you start getting the hang of everything, everyone else gets lazy. At first, you’ll get decent hours, but then they start to cut hours. Not a good part time job."
good,"Workplace culture is cooperative, the staff is always willing to teach or help out. The days go by quick and you don't feel overworked, but it is hard to get benefits."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond has a great people and staff for the most part. Most of the employees are happy and enjoyable to be around; as are the management. The company also allows for a flexible work schedule (I was a student full time and worked part time for the company). The only thing I would say  negatively about Bed Bath and Beyond is the way that the policies affect employees. To some degree I believe that the customer is always right, but this would enable customers to verbally abuse employees at points. Also, there are high expectations with low reward. With short amount of hours and less people being on the sales floor, it is not always easy to complete your duties for the day while also being there for the customer. That can be conflicting and even stressful."
good,It is a fast-paced and fun job. Organizational skills are a must and being able to fake a smile will get you far with repeat customers. They prefer to promote from within and the hardest part is having to stand on your feet for 8 hours.
good,I am a hard worker. I perform my job very well. I love leaving a smile on my customers faces and they always come back. I enjoy making people happy i have a warm heart.
good,They pay very little know people who worked there for 4 years and barley making 11.50 they expect percentage in the 90-100 but dont want to pay their employees good. No AC in warehouse only office jobs in the warehouse gets that  luxury you get 2 mins to walk from your working area to the clock out area it used to be 5 mins bc clock out area gets packed and your 30 mins really only 15 mins but they even took that away now you get 2 mins. Unless you really ! Need a job dont work here they dont care for their employees at all
good,"Great place to start out in retail.  Long hours was the bad thing had to work over 10 hour days with only half hour lunch which was not great,  Shift work"
good,slow working environment. gave e the opportunity to learn cashiering and stock management information. management was active on the sales floor. the most enjoyable part of the job was great co workers and and great customers.
good,"Sign in, Find out which register I'm assigned to, and ring customers, along with merchandising certain products.  Also, going through many different coupons"
good,Fast pace environment with a push towards complete customer satisfaction with little regard for associate satisfaction. Long work days without proper compensation.
good,"resets, customer service, store management friendly but depends on who. Hardest part is completion of daily projects. Most enjoyable part is the friends you make working there."
good,My experience is that the company is a very good company to work for but your experience depends entirely on who the management team is that you would be working for.
good,My site was very small with not enough hours to go around for staff and then not enough staff to fill the hours. some managers have been there a long time and think they are above helping work the floor.
good,Communication between Managers and Upper management was very poor. Often times this led to associates not getting very much needed information. Wish to work somewhere more professional.
good,"Was a good experience, I was still in school at the time, I worked around 3 days a week. It was very hard to work at the store, mostly because of the way they did things regarding customer service."
good,"It is a very laid back job with very easy to carry out tasks. They seem to give certain people more hours than others and will accept certain employees to be late, or call off at short notice, when others will be written up for it."
good,"Out of all my retail bed Bath and beyond had the most wonderful people. I made great friends literally not one person I didn’t like.  But management had no backbones at times, so many employees that should be fired were kept because they are so desperate for employees because 75% of new hires quit because of the low pay and high demanding job. But I quit because I would come into work stressed because I never got enough done even though I was trying my hardest. Communication between management is HORRIBLE. They expect their workers to be a cashier, do tasks, sell products and work freight. And on top of that cashiers are expected to sell products at their register for absolutely no commission. But if you do a great job, you most likely will be recognized for it. Not a horrible place at all, just stressful like all jobs."
good,"If your looking to get your foot in the door of workforce. Bed Bath and Beyond is not a bad place to start. The people you work with are amazing, depends on the manager."
good,"At first this was a great job, great workplace, great pay. But gradually, over the course of my time there, it became increasingly stressful and emotionally taxing. Doing nothing but taking calls from upset customers day in and day out is more difficult and exhausting than you would imagine. The workplace culture is fantastic, but the company doesn't actually follow their own policies or recommended procedures and it is always unclear what you are expected to do for a customer in each situation. Different managers and supervisors give different instructions, and often those instructions are self-contradictory."
good,"Despite overwhelmingly positive feedback and that fact that the company boasted their “best year to date but there are people out there who are underpaid or who feel they could be better compensated elsewhere. "
good,its a great place to work if youre looking for a part time job!!! very flexible with hours and days off! start pay is pretty good as well. discounts are always awesome!
good,A Mangers day was 9.5 hours with a 1/2 hour for lunch .Everyone works very hard to meet the goals given however a lot of time has to be devoted to to supporting the front end with ringing which takes a lot of time out of everyone's ability to wait on customers on the floor .I loved when we got it right and got compliments on our service.
good,No Comments to give...You must create a positive work environment....Creating a positive customer service for the external/internal customer is the easiest part of this company...If you love providing customer service as an individual...
good,"Great opportunity for planning, merchandising "
good,"I enjoyed my time at BBB.  I was hired to run a specialized department, which was very much numbers driven.  I  and had a lot of autonomy in daily operations of the department."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and managers. The environment is positive. The hours they work you has been disappointing. This job is great for anyone who needs a little extra income.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to work if you're a college student needing a little cash, or an older adult looking for supplemental income. Management is very fair, almost to where they don't ensure everyone works on something. Pay rate is reasonable, and will in certain circumstances, give you a very generous pay increase. As with most retail part time positions, no benefits are offered. Although it's understandable as to why they push them, Beyond store orders are a major portion of business. They will consistently bring them up, and relentlessly push their staff to pursue them. Steer clear of here if you're trying to get Full Time or advance in any sort of way, as you'll often find that it's impossible."
good,"A typical day is busy at the location I am in. I walk over 8,000 steps a day. Customers are nearly always needing you, even when you are trying to finish a project. "
good,Not a bad place to work at for a college kid over the summer. Work was not hard and the management were courteous and easy to work with. Not the best job but not a bad place to work at.
good,"It is really good experience for people that want to develop a career on retail field. Working with clients is not the easiest job, you must have/develop great patience. Bed Bath and Beyond helps you throughout training on this matter. You received good training. Work environment is good."
good,A pretty steady flow of traffic. Depending on the time of day you will notice spikes in numbers but it is a typical thing. Fast paced work environment
good,"bed bath and beyond was a great job environment it hepled me a lot"
good,"Hard job for those who do not like to work. You are not sitting in the office, you have to work Sundays and holidays. No advancement for becoming store manager because nobody ever leaves and they are not building any stores.  If you can understand this, then this job is great for you."
good,"The company has been good to me as I have been good to them over the years.  The hardest thing is getting your routines down, but it is also hard to know when you are supposed to skip the routines to get other things done.  The easiest thing is making the customer happy and this company is great about giving you the leeway to do that.  I'm looking to leave because I have run my course here and am interested in learning new things and working my way up with another company.  I will definitely miss it though."
good,"Management made unrealistic expectations, but the culture was great, and coworkers made the job worth it. I'd recommend for anyone just starting their first job."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company.  I was offered quick advancement and only left to move out of the country.  I had a great time with my co-workers,"
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond is quite enjoyable. Most days during the week are slower but the weekends are quite busy. Christmas season is extremely busy and keeps you occupied the entire shift. I learned valuable customer service and social skills while working here. For the most part I have had no issues with management, they are very professional and understanding. The hardest part about the job is the physical aspect of lifting heavy objects or having to climb ladders while carrying objects. The most enjoyable part about this job is the relationships I have developed with fellow coworkers and the management."
good,"The company use to be great! Now because of on-line sales customers are not coming into the stores as much as they use to. Staffing is low so management has to take on more than what is expected. The customer service culture is slipping because there are  not enough associates to service the customers. The stores are not given the hours for correct staffing and training that is needed."
good,"Was a pleasure working at Bed Bath & Beyond, offers the ability to learn and grow. being nation wide the ability to relocate and move are greater with the company."
good,Company is okay to work for. Pay is not so great especially for the amount of work. If you work on the floor there is a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"If your looking for a starter job to get your feet on the ground,  this is the place for you. If you have bad punctuality, this is not the job for you."
good,Great managers that will fight for you and help you out when you need it. Always a fun day at work. They are your managers yet treat you like you are a person and not a number.
good,"this was my first job out of college and there is hardly any complaints about it. any typical retail job you might have late nights due to cleaning the store or restocking the shelves. this job was very flexible with my school schedule. when it came down to me leaving the state to play college football, i was able to take a leave and work again whenever i came back home."
good,"A typical day at bed bath and beyond in the mornings it will start off slow , around twelve noon traffic begins at both customer service and the checkout area "
good,A typical day at work is very productive. My co workers and I worked together diligently to get all jobs done. Management was lazy but friendly. Bed Bath & Beyond is a great company just wasn't for me.
good,"Typical retail job. Help customers, work cash registers, and stock shelves. Management is flexible with scheduling."
good,"As a Sales Associate at Bed Bath& Beyond, Customer Service was the Key. My main objective was to insure that every customer had an excellent shopping experience. By finding out the customers needs, I was able to gain the trust of a customer and meet there demand for quality products."
good,"I do like my job here but it is so slow, I'm use to a fast pace environment and keeping busy. Also the hours are not near what I need. The management is great and we have a friendly team but our job is too laid back for me. I come into work and help customers and 'zone' make sure everything is in its correct spot."
good,"Warehouse was maintained solely by me.  Was allowed to work alone all day, very little interference..  rewarded for rebuilding warehouse to new specs."
good,"The day would start off with a morning huddle, where the manager would review the daily tasks that needed to be completed."
good,I have worked there for four months now and I find it a ok place to work great people but the compensation is not ideal for me and in terms of my professional development I do not feel I am advancing as fast as I would like.
good,"Well to start I loved the freedom that I thought I would be given but never was. I was hired in training to learn their way of doing things. I was never allowed to take ownership in my department I was spoon fed everything that I was supposed to do. This mad it difficult for me to show what I was made of, I was never really given a chance to grow which was frustrating to me."
good,"Typical work days includes doing freight that comes in the day before, stocking them to the sales floor, backstocking the overflow of freight into the appropriate locations. Maintaining the stockroom to make sure everything is in its proper place. Pulling items that are low on the floor and filling them. "
good,"I enjoyed this job because I was able to ring up people really fast, but I did not like all of the technicalities with the cash register when dealing with coupons, checks, etc. I enjoyed talking with co-workers and I liked the manager's work ethic. A typical day at work would get me tired, and I learned that I have to stay on my feet in order not to feel too indolent at work."
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath is always focused on customer service. We have a never say no policy, to which we strongly adhere."
good,"This job has 30 minute breaks, old technology which makes work even more stressful. No benefits, and no upward mobility. If you are looking for just a part-time job then this is the place to be."
good,"Long hours, ""management time"" spent on freight and customer service. The age old retail battle between managing and labor. They pay relatively well...for retail. People working there generally a plus."
good,"the job can be stressful because some people do not pull their weight. overall its not a bad place to work at, it is extremely flexible if thats what someone is looking for"
good,consistently exhibits behaviors that properly represent the company's mission. Great return policy and customer service management team.
good,"could have been better, could have been worse. had issues with management, but the coworkers were awesome. hours were good. pay not so much."
good,The hardest part of the job was the requirements to pick up a box or a product weight 75 or more pounds. My co-workers demonstrate a lot of favoritism which in a run-way affect the workplace environment by dividing the work in unfair manner among  the rest of my co-workers including myself.
good,Providing customer service via telephone. Get the advantage of learning 23 systems. Also a great place to show team work to complete a larger task.
good,the job sucks they work you to the bone and the managers there have unrealistic work expectations at times but it was a good place to work when certian managers were there
good,It was good a job with some personal issues I had  with some of the managers about scheduling other than that it was an Okay job to start out at but not to make an career out of.
good,"The company is full of good people, fun jobs, and great learning experiences. However, much is expected of you with out pay compensation. Not much initiative to do better than self self pride. Not much of promoting with-in. Pay raises are 25 cents a year."
good,"This place was okay to work at, but they expected to much from one person"
good,Helped customers daily to find their needs and wants. I learned that you cannot always satisfy everyone and sometimes others won't treat you the way you treat them.
good,"As Bed Bath and Beyond is actually a very nice company to work for and the benefits that are give are top notch the Managerial aspect is not the best. I was Department Manager (newly employed) with extensive managerial background and that did nothing to prepare me for what I was in store for. The staff were very young which meant DRAMA and unless you have been working for a good period of time no matter your title or background you had no weight."
good,"* Involves engaging customers assisting with product info, Utilized as a cashier back-up, Personal shopper at times for Registry customers."
good,"The culture at Bed Bath and Beyond is what has kept me employed there for so long. Retail management requires 12-16 hour days, weekends and holidays and a lot of physical labor. That being said Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the best retailers to work for if you expect these sort of work conditions."
good,"Great starter company. Though not many chances to advance, upper management has a strong disconnect with the work life balance."
good,"I worled here whilei was in college, trying to balance school and basketball was tough. Working for this compnay made things that much easier due to their flexible work times. Their never say no approach taught me what superb customer service is all about."
good,"While I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond my typical day consisted of scheduling employees, conducting orientation for new employees, train existing employees on products and selling skills. Ensured customer service throughout the store. Assisted registrant brides when creating their bridal list. Sometimes I managed the front end cashiers. "
good,"pays very well"
good,A typical day at work involves moving merchandise to designated areas in the store.  Easy task but with employees who work in the different departments the task might be more difficult due to them not organizing their rooms or not taking items down to be filled meaning extra work for me.  The management isn't too bad i've had way worse. Never given close to 40 hours unless someone calls out but it's not cool to have last minute add ons in hours as you might have plans to do something else.  Less than 40 hours also means no benefits.
good,Fast paced retail where things change everyday. ealig with customers who sometimes forget who they are talking with and can be a bit rude but keep your composure and remember the customer is always right.
good,Descent place to work. Times get tuff like any other job but there are great times too. Learn new things from management and other co workers weather its current events in life or just learning about another co worker. Hardest part of the job is paper work..... but who likes paper work? Most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say would be interacting with others and the feeling of completing a hard task.
good,My typical day starts off by printing off my reports and pulling the morning replenishment. I'm constantly climbing ladders and lifting light to heavy objects. There is a lot of physical activity but that is why I enjoy it so much. I have strive to learn as much as I can and I know almost every department and will be training to do RTV's soon. As knowledgeable as I am though it is still very hard to move up in the company. When a position opens up in the store they fill it with someone else from another store instead of promoting a associates. The managers are very understanding when it comes to scheduling and availability. They will work around your second job or schooling and try to keep hours constant. There are plenty of pros and cons at any job but overall it is a decent work experience.
good,A typical work day would be stocking the shelves on the floor with any new items and existing merchandise that needed to be re-stocked. Greeting and assisting customers who came in to shop for merchandise such as bedding kitchenware etc. Also sometimes assisting customers with cash/credit purchases they needed to make. Management was constantly briefing us on daily tasks and duties we needed to perform. Management was also adamant in assisting us with anything we needed help with. Co-workers were very team oriented and constantly communicated to make sure daily tasks were completed efficiently. The hardest part was constantly climbing ladders and re-stocking merchandise because sometimes the merchandise would be on very high shelves and it was hard to maneuver some of the merchandise on to the shelves. The most enjoyable part was that the environment was very laid back. Also the working hours were very flexible and manageable.
good,"If you don't mind doing almost everything from stock to ringing sales to on-line orders then it""s not bad. I enjoy learning all positions so it was ok. If you work in a large store then that may be a different experience. I worked in a small store and we were all like family."
good,"Although the company has great customer service and for the most part value their employees, the people that you work with can make or break this job. Upper management is good but in the store I work at there an ""in group"" and an ""out group"". Its like high school all over again. The bridal leader decides who gets to do bridal and if they don't like you or how you learn, then your not in bridal. As for lower management if your not one of the favorites you get stuck at the register or doing the things that nobody else wants to do. The hours vary by as much as 10+or -. some weeks I have 20+ hours others I have only 15. The company is a great place to work but it all depends on who you work with."
good,"Through the six years of working at BBB, I have come to gain much experience in customer service. Their hours are flexible and management is easy to get along with. I most enjoyed the flexible work schedule, but did not enjoy the politics that often happened."
good,A typical day working here for me was helping customer and making sure they found everthing they needed. I learn to sales thing to custmers. Management was great but at time they got lazy. I got along with my all co-workers. There really wasn't anything hard about it. The most thing I liked about this job was interacting with people and meeting new people.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers with purchasing decisions, stock the merchandise on the floor, order new items of the company's website for the customers. At Bed Bath & Beyond I learned the value of giving great customer service, because we want everyone to be a lifetime customer. The managers were great and always assisted associates with customers when needed, and taught us how to improve customer service skills. Every associate is given a specific department to work in at all times. If one of my customers had a question about another department, I was always guaranteed that my co-workers would take over in their designated department and walked the customer until they found what they wanted to purchase. The hardest part of this job was getting heavy items that were stocked high up in the stock room. The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers told me that I had been very helpful."
good,"While working at Bed Bath and Beyond I learned a lot of important tips for working in retail. For instance, the training for BBB is intense (not fun) however, being trained for different departments helps employees become aware of the stores products. It taught me how to deal with unpleasant customers and how to cash out customers quickly but in a friendly manner. At BBB there weren't any typical days because most employees were trained in almost all departments, so depending on the department you worked in, that's where you would be. The hardest part of that job was dealing with too much product, and not having a way to store it. The best part of the job was the experience I acquired while working there."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond I think it is safe to say that I can exceed any other companies Customer Service goals. The higher level management does not like to do work, tends to hide in his office all day. Not to mention he has his favorites. Ive learned a lot about how to deal with unruly customers and how to make them happy. The hardest part of the job are the co workers who tend to get away with doing a whole lot of nothing. They refuse to fire anyone. The most enjoyable part of my job are my customers. The regulars who come back and you build a relationship with."
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was good for the most part, I was able to work with a lot of really nice people. A normal day would be all about helping every single customer that walks in the door. Weather the customer was looking for a product or just needed an answer to a question, I was the person to ask. I learned how to take inventory of merchandise as well as stock replenishment. I learned about ladder safety in the workplace and searching, ordering & finalizing sales for customers via the internet. Being staff here was really like being apart of a team, everyone helps out everyone else."
good,most of the people i worked with i got along with and it was nice to work there
good,"Managers liked to pass the work off, while the store manager wouldn't let up on no one. Co-workers were awesome but the job itself was physically demanding and you never have a set schedule."
good,You spend most of your day re-stocking and filling your department or side of store. Upper management sets a lot of unrealistic goals. Up and down 12 ft. ladders all day down stocking
good,I enjoyed wrapping the gifts and viewing the gifts. Coworkers were friendly.
good,My associates are amazing and I am able to work with and teach them. Just difficult to work with district. Have been able to work a lot in the company
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to work.  I have worked for the company for 14 years.  Management is in the building for 60 hours a week.  That is the hardest part of the job.  I loved the customer service ethics of the store. The
good,"Bed bath and beyond was a very fast paced job. The work environment could be toxic at times. We had so many different types of mangers while I was there for three and a half years, the good and the bad. Overall I was there to do my job and I did my job well until the day I quit."
good,A typical day at work was somewhat hectic because different customers came in every day. I learned how to better a customer's experience through what I did. Management was good. Work place culture was like any other retail store. The hardest part of the job was being inside and there was almost no escape from the constant customers. The most enjoyable part was probably the discounts that were offered.
good,"I worked for Bed Bath & Beyond for 3 years Part-time (15-25 Hours weekly) with some stints near 35 hours every now and then. I mainly did this to have a side income while attending University. As a guy, you may think that this isn't a good place to work unless you know sheets, bedding, and towel brands like the back of your hand but it isn't all that. They have Shipping/Receiving, ""Hard-Side"" (Appliances, Cleaning, and Kitchenware), and Down-Stocking that are main roles needed to be done. You get a solid amount of skills from customer service/up-selling/cross-selling to inventory stocking and replenishing. "
good,I enjoyed my time at bed bath and beyond. I did not like that I was making less money than the people I was training and I didn't get any benefits there.
good,"The customers are horrible but my coworkers are the reason I’ve stayed. They work with your schedule and the managers there are funny, nice but expect you to work. 98% of the customers are the worse type of people to deal with. They make you want to quit your job every day."
good,The company generally takes care of the employees. At least in my area. It’s retail so you should just expect to work the holidays and weekends. That’s when the sales are made.
good,"Great part time job for young people in school or retirees. Two of the ASM's were awesome, but the store manager was lazy and ghetto and didn't know nothing. Asking him how or about something was an waste of time and frustrating if you really want to accomplish something."
good,"I enjoyed working at bed bath and beyond, but do to lack of hours, I had to move on and look for something better for me, that way I am more satisfied with where I am working."
good,"Retail is retail, but I believe it depends on the clientele as well as the area demographic. Working here has its challenges wherein its difficult to talk to management when handling complaints or unfairness in the workplace."
good,Working at bed bath and beyond takes a great amount of patience . Some days are great while others aren’t . You meet great people that can help the day go by . They can be very flexible with schedule . There is a lot of favoritism.
good,I loved my coworkers but they do very little to properly train their employees to perform their job at the best of their abilities. They don't invest in their employees as their biggest asset and it hinders them.
good,"Flexible hours, good pay, no company loyalty, terrible training and hiring, good managers, inefficiently ran, horrible employee discount, helpful staff"
good,"downstocking, taking care of customers and running freight handling phone calls from customers taking direction from upper management, i am also a key holder"
good,"I was lucky to have awesome co-workers and good supervisors.the system was ancient,backroom wasn't what i was used to,before i put in my notice they updated the registers and it was like learning a new language for some of the cashiers.I hope they fixed the return policy because ppl would bring things that were prob 10 years old lol. Don't regret working there,just wasn't sure about the company."
good,"This company is good as a beginner job, but not to stay over 2 years. The job is pretty labor intensive as far as stocking things and constantly being on ladders. It is always busy especially on the weekends to be prepared to work either Saturday or Sunday. Bed Bath and Beyond is a good company for its customers, but not so much their employees. They have shown their employees do not really matter to them which is why so many people quite."
good,"Overall the atmosphere working at BBB for me was an overall positive experience, managers are understanding and willing to help you adapt in new positions. Everyone is pretty nice and its a chill place to work"
good,"I'm seeking better opportunities. It's a great place to work as a stepping stone, as in for a student or someone seeking supplemental income as a part time associate. Job work/life balance, healthcare benefits, management, and culture are poor. Everyone is overworked and stressed. The culture is best described as rank and file employees are part of an expendable herd."
good,Long hours 10 hour days The company is good to work for but it’s retail. Retail is tough as we all know you have to be prepared to be customer service focused
good,"As a temporary job it is fine. Nothing special about it, you learn respect and patience. A lot of customers that shop here are not very nice, usually rude and impatient and think that everything should be given to them before they even ask. Some customers are nice, but most make a mess of the store making it take a while to clean up. The management is good. Managers are nice and easy to talk to. Typical day includes helping customers find what they want, and if it is in stock. If not, where to find it or something similar, and then cleaning up area afterwards."
good,"Where i live it is a slow paced and easy job. Im doing part time so i don't get as many befefits like paid vacations and Holidays. 20% off employees is pretty good considering you can use that on top of clearance event items. Overall its an ok job, its comfortable if you want a part time job. The employees and management are very nice. Flexible with your schedule too."
good,If you're willing to work hard and work with customers then you will fit right in. this company puts a huge focus on face to face interaction with the public. there is so much focus on the customer in the store that the company is behind on its online presence. they are starting to embrace the online market but are a few years behind.
good,"Great Place to work, opportunities to advance and develop yourself.  Company is always growing from an IT perspective.  Leadership has great vision for where the company is headed."
good,"If you like to work retail and helping customers, this is a good place to work.  There is always work to do, you receive a nice discount on items in the store and as well as online.   The culture is fun and it can be stressful but it is also a lot of fun"
good,My experience with working here has been a positive one.  Management is great and they really care about their employees.  The only negative is that pay is not enough to live by.
good,"Some days are pretty good"
good,"Great place to learn about retail and moving up the chain, however as a manger to get any higher in the company they expect you to work at least 50 hours a week, and after you work 40 hours your salary is reverse overtime."
good,"I may not have worked there that long, but I enjoyed the overall friendliness. Very involved in keeping the employees accurately informed, and trained to deal with each season."
good,Very nice place to work. Enjoyed my 16 years with them. Made several friends along the way. Good employee discounts and benefits. Could have been managed better. I really enjoyed helping the customers.
good,this is a perfect entry level job full time as well as part time. very friendly work environment. also a lot a opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"I cashiered and also worked at customer service. Customer service is systemically structured to operate slow and hectic. There is one person responsible for answering phones, running the line of guests, and assessing returns. The work piles up fast because this station lacks employees."
good,"Nothing more to say than title, sorry folks. Hope you have a wonderful day and I wish you the best of luck finding whatever you're looking for, whether it be long term or temporary, fulfilling or necessary."
good,"The company has suffered with the times trying to be competitive. After eliminating many manager positions company wide, the pay is not very competitive, and the company does not have good pay increases. Salaried managers are being replaced with hourly associates with keys to the building for half the pay."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a great place to work however the company cares more about the customers than their employees. Any retail job gets busy and sometimes difficult, especially during busy season. I did have opportunities to advance, I also learned how to be a bridal consultant aside from a customer service desk associate."
good,"Relaxed company to work for. It is rarely busy except on weekends. Perfect first job.  Simple Job. Friendly. Does have low pay. It is retail, cash handling, and customer service job."
good,"The store I worked it was a high volume store, and it was fast paced and at times could be stressful. The staff is friendly and work as a team. Room for advancement but it can take a long time for a position to open up for advancement."
good,"The store has a family feel throughout the staff which can make the job very rewarding. "
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond is a fun fast paced environment. The management staff is very supportive and the culture makes it easy to be a successful associate there."
good,"Great place to work when -[I was there. We had a great team and they offered great benefits and perks."
good,Has been a good experience for me; obtained good experience/knowledge in my time there. Have been given good opportunities with company. Have had good management overall at the local level.
good,There was countless opportunities to learn while working there. They made sure product knowledge is a priority. But above all customer service is the number one prioritie.
good,"Most managers were fine, but the store manager made things so tense that it was hard to work with her. Another manager would schedule me outside of my available hours without talking to me about it first and I hated that."
good,"Very customer service driven, you must have the ability to multitask."
good,Great company with strong balance sheet. Company provides job security. Challenging workplace with many opportunities to advance. Company is currently acquiring new businesses which provides good experience.
good,Very flexible scheduling if you are in need of a job with a highly flexible schedule.  Downside is to expect new employees or employees in lower positions to be a door mat at times.  Easy scheduling and money if you can handle quite a bit of hassle
good,"Since I worked for Bed Bath & Beyond for 10 years, I was able to learn many skills associated with the retail industry.  I was able to work with many employees, some of whom I became friends with outside of work.  The company was generous in a flexible schedule, since I worked another part-time job.  They were also willing to give me time off when I needed it, either for vacation or for my other job.  They helped me transfer to another location when I had to move to another state.  Each year I have been with the company I always qualified for a pay increase.  I was recognized by the company with rewards for both my 5 year and my 10 year employment.  Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the top companies in the nation for cookware, small appliances, cleaning products, bedding products (sheets, pillows), window treatments, and bath products (towels).  And they work with many major name brands (most recently Ellen DeGeneres and Joanna Gaines).  Plus, not only do you get an employee discount with Bed Bath & Beyond, but also with Cost Plus World Market and more."
good,Absolutely loved the job and the people at BBB!  Never worked retail before and it was so much fun!  Very physical and interactive with patrons.  Just a fun job!  Would still be working there if I could have made a decent wage.
good,"I work a minimum of 50 hours a week, most of which is spent on my feet, so I get my workout in everyday. The day starts with replenishing the items that were purchased the day before by running the sales report that lets us know. Then we gather items that are to be shipped out for online orders that were sent to our store because we are the closest to the shipping address. Then we start putting the store back together to make it presentable for the customers for the day. From 9-5 is a constant string of questions from customers and associates as to where things are or where they go. We train our part time associates the product knowledge that they need to be able to comfortably sell product to a customer or make recommendations on an item that they are looking for. We do not receive commission or vendor kickbacks so we are pretty unbiased when it comes to brands. From 5-10 it is our job to put away the product that was received that day and to clean up as much as possible. The closing manager counts the safe and deposits the cash sales from the day."
good,"Employees are nice, friendly and willing to help. "
good,"I liked this job because I was able to work directly with the customers and it was fun meeting new people. However there is many more draw backs to this job. I was not paid that much and at the time I was breastfeeding and my manager told me that I needed to breast pump in the bathroom and I demanded that I would have a separate room to breast pump as the bathroom is very uncleanly. I also was treated pretty badly there, the people working there were very unpleasant. I also did not enjoy folding towels for 7 hours straight so bad to the point that my hands would be so dry they would bleed. It is a very lousy job and I would NOT recommend working here. Not to mention it is always the same thing everyday, nothing new and you never seem to go up in your position."
good,"Not enough hours and help to effectively get the job done. Not a job to retire from unless you get into upper management. Pay for management is good, but you are expected to work over 40 hours weekly. Most of the time the work is not worth the pay. If you care about doing a good job on time, it is a very high stress job."
good,Very antiquated systems and culture. Not a place to assist you in growing. Routine work. 65 plus hours a week. No vacations after 15 October.
good,"Bed Bath Beyond is a fun and somewhat peaceful environments to work in, but the management team as a whole are 1. lack understanding for employee concerns and issues as they arise 2. they do not offer hours and pay that can help a hard working man pay his rent."
good,"A typical morning at work includes putting away new merchandise and dropping and filling merchandise to maximize profits. Between helping customers and keeping up with the merchandise rotations, your shift goes by pretty quickly. I am fortunate in that I have great managers and coworkers, so going to work is more fun than it is a chore. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, as with any retail job; but when you help a customer find a product they were looking for or genuinely had a connection and helped them in some way, it really does feel good."
good,"comfortable enviornment, good pay, not too understaanding managment, low engagment in other employees working. snsus sdusjs sdsdskmw wbdbwehwe weiudwe  we. dont make me write more than i have to say to a computer"
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a very busy, stressful Every day the employees are up against  certain quotas that they aim to beat. unorganized. At times it can become very difficult to deal with hundreds of different personalities everyday. I eventually became use to the customers and the business."
good,"I only worked here for about a year, I was presented with a better opportunity that fit my life better which is why I left. BBB prides themselves on customer service and was a great place to work."
good,Learned a lot about customer service and what it is like being a leader. Typical day at work was to help customers make sure they are happy with their experience at the store.
good,This is an okay place to work. The staff is nice. It is a fast paced environment with constant product learning to be done.
good,"You focus on customer service at all times. They pride themselves on that. Routines and training are a must. You learn everything from the register, putting up merchandise, to ordering your department. The employees are nice to work with and the management are easy to talk to."
good,Not the best but not the worst place. The pay is better than expected for a retail job. The management needs a lot of work. A revamp of customer and employee friendly is necessary.
good,Overall a good workplace and management is good as well. The only thing that was pretty upsetting is the complaints we would get about the store's manager.
good,"Exemplary customer service! Productive environment, with the goal to have efficient routines in place. However, the environment  can be negative and counter- productive."
good,All staff extremely helpfully and understanding. Costumers where usually very nice. Possibility of advancement. Flexible scheduling as well as vacation after time.
good,"I loved working there the people were very nice, customers as well. I did a lot of work in the customer service are so I did come in contact with lots of happy customers as well upset ones but I was trained how to handle every situation."
good,"We are a very high paced location. A volume store. I like working as a team with my co-workers. sometimes our management team (seven people) come off very confusing, one person tells you to do something the very next shift they have someone change what was just done. NOT efficient time management. They need to figure out how to communicate more efficiently."
good,"Management is really nice, but they do not train you for all the requirements of your job. I worked as a sales associate and did not receive all my training to work the floor, but still was made to work without knowing anything about our products"
good,The long drive is what gets to me about the job. Coming in to work is easy but standing around at 5 AM when there isn't any work will drain you.
good,"i loved working there but management had horrible communication, The people in worked with were really nice even though we all had some age differences and background differences"
good,Typical retail outlet.  Good people surround you but pay is very underwhelming and raises are a complete joke.  A quarter raise for your yearly evaluation and that is considered good.
good,"Working for BB&B allowed me to experience all the facets of the company from being visible on the front end interacting with associates and customers applying various customer service skills to ensure that all employees are upholding the core values of the company, that no customer leaves unsatisfied with their shopping experience. I became a very flexible employee by learning and working different positions which allowed me to be used at any given time when the need arose. As a result of working for BB&B for almost 13+ years I have made a lifetime of friends whom I dearly miss working with."
good,"Although the salary may not be the highest, it's still a time-passing and pretty sociable job with the right co workers."
good,"Bed, Bath, & Beyond has been a great place to work. Once you learn the basics of the company, it's easy to get settled in to day to day work. The more you put out there and want to learn, the more the management team will offer you. Co-workers are typically younger, so unfortunately you come across immaturity in a work place that's less than satisfactory. All in all though, most co-workers enjoy being there and learning the job as well. The job is demanding, but rewarding at the same time. Unfortunately, it also holds out to be tough to move up into the company. Starting part-time, unless there is a position opening for full-time, there's not much room for advancement. Even when there is, you fight crowds of those who enjoy being there to move up as well. I've learned more than I ever thought I'd know from the job, and they take pride in knowing the people they have coming in will be comfortable selling and working with their merchandise by setting aside the time to teach everyone who walks in the door what they sell. The most difficult part of the job, though, resides in that. There's sometimes not enough time in the day to learn all you need to know, gather the store together in a clean and organized fashion by the end of the day while stocking and assisting customers.  Demanding, but rewarding-- the company all in all is not a bad one to work for."
good,"Great atmosphere, with flexible hours. Very fun place to work. Employee discounts are great."
good,you would help customers with things they would need. they have a good return policy and coupons help with the prices. I liked my associates but management can be more understanding and not forget we are working for them. with out us there company wouldn't be around.
good,"Check store calendar for any tasks I need to complete, or post. Read and report daily numbers from previous day of business focusing on our Bridal Business , addressing any training opportunities. Write daily break and coverage sheet for our associates. New Hire orientation and training. Follow up on previous day with associates and follow up with an action plan if needed. Assist with customer needs both in the building and on the phone. Each day is different of course but maintaining customer needs and training are at the top of my schedule daily. Planning and time management is critical in my job. My co-workers are a wonderful blend of personalities which I find a lot of fun and always challenges me to grow and stay humble. The hardest part of my job is keeping to the plan when the human factor takes you off course. The most enjoyable part of my job is always meeting new people, and the many opportunities that are in front of me everyday both personally and professionally."
good,Everyday is a new challenge and the days go by very quickly I can honestly say I leave very accomplished
good,"The company as a whole is okay. Pay and benefits are decent. Each individual store is a different atmosphere, so your day to day job and experiences will depend on management"
good,"Review trucks and merchandise coming in and make space for new items, Assist customers with purchase selections.  Co-workers are great but lots of inexperience."
good,good environment to work in i enjoyed it while i worked there
good,"very inconsistent company, work 70 hrs. a week and get paid for 40"
good,helping customers and stocking merchandlise . i worked the register and packing ;boxes in shipping
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is considerably more involved than most other retail jobs. Our main objective is outstanding customer service, so we spend more time ACTUALLY helping customers find and learn about the products that they need. Not only does this mean that we have to speak to customers, we also have to be experts on all of the products we sell, so as to be able to inform customers of the benefits of certain products. On the job you learn how to retain and recite information, problem solve, merchandize, multi-task, solve problems over the phone, be creative, and manage time. The hardest part of the job is balancing stocking the shelves with helping customers, and the best part is helping somebody find exactly what they were looking for."
good,I worked here for 5 years. It was stable and consistent and they provided me with a few raises during my time there. I was gearing up to be Front End Lead but left due to school.
good,Fun and rewarding Company to work for. Very consumer relations oriented.
good,I assist all customers in locating what they need. Also make orders for customers as well as assist them if needed when leaving the store. Print out the stock replinishment report and downstock any and all merchandise that needs to be on the sales floor. I get a gameplan on all projects needed for completion for the day from the manager. I really enjoy my job and the most enjoyable part of it would be having the hardside team leader position. I have great co workers that work hard and listen well.
good,Interact with different people everyday
good,"Be sociable here...it's an unspoken requirement. Most co-workers age range between 21-35 and tend to want to chat so if you are not the type that likes to talk, this is not the place for you. As a result, this could either become the hardest or most enjoyable part of the job."
good,we had a great attitude wghen it came to the public. we were a team putting their needs before our very own.the customer was always right at bed bath and beyond.
good,"My typical day at work would be when I arrived at work I would clock and and put my name tag onto my collar, and then I will either work customer servies or a sales associate for that day. At Bed Bath & Beyond I have learned how to get out of my shy zone and feel free to talk and interact with anyone. I have learned that its never about you its always about the customer no matter what the situation is; I have also learned alot about safety in every way there is to know. The hardest part of my job wasnt really anything, because everything was easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing how happy and satisfied my customers were leaving out of the store and saying to my Managers that she is a great employee and when I come back I will love to have her assist me, thats the greatest thing of all."
good,i learned how to be a better team player and managment is really bad they dont know how to talk or the manger dont do there job i have to pick up there lask.some coworkers are good then other are really bad make you want to quite
good,"A typical day at bed bath & beyond started with a morning meeting with the whole team, where we discussed the goals and sales within the store. From there, as a team we purged a section of the store. BB&B was really big on team play. After the purge i went to my department which was stockroom/warehouse or receiving and process. The members of managemet were decent certain members seems to have a more positive attitude then others, while others lack the comunication skills. Far as the work it self was not hard to me at all, my days went well and fast. I learn fast and get the task done"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me greeting customers, helping them find what they need in a timely manner and if I am unable to find it, I do my best to call another store or order it for them. I mainly close so closing duties consist of sweeping floors and organizing shelves and restocking many things at the end of the night."
good,A difficult place to be an operator as their were too many levels
good,the pay was low it depends on who you are and what you negotiate I was making the same amount as a cashier and I was the front end supervisor. So I was doing more work yet I was getting paid the same as a cashier. The company had great benefits and was really flexible in hours and working with me
good,"Its all about moving as many cartons out as possible. Challenging because of the high turnover. A lot of hardworking people, but also many that are not held accountable as they should be."
good,"The fellow associates all worked well together. There was good camaraderie amongst all the associates, in and out of the workplace. Management though was a whole different story. One manager would tell you one thing, then another would come by and tell you the opposite. They bickered for power amongst themselves."
good,Customer service and safety are our priorities. Fast paced environment that is quickly updating its business. Great coworkers that make coming to work everyday enjoyable
good,It's fun to work here. People who work here are helpful and respectful. I feel the management is very helpful and interactive with the employees and customers. I don't feel that there were barriers between associates and management. Very flat level
good,"Good work place  I learned to work as a team.Good work culture, nice coworkers at night. Easy job ,very easy to learn and adapt, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a temporary night job."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of climbing up ladders to put away/bring products off shelves. The store that I worked at had a high turn over rate. You're expected to ask EVERY customer if they need help/ help them find gifts off of wedding registries, in addition you're also expecting to set up wedding registries, answer phone calls, cashier, and set up end caps for new products. This becomes very tiring because they only had 1 sales associate and 1 manager on each side of the store most times due to the high turnover rate. I will say that I enjoyed working with the people there, they made the job better when it was stressful for the most part."
good,I enjoy the people I work with but sometimes the customers can be a lot. You get training before going on the floor and come to learn a lot as you work with people. It can get boring but it’s good for a starting job. I don’t find any personal benefit from it however it’s often the same tasks everyday.
good,Overall this company was good to work for. They accommodated their employees to the best of their abilities and it felt like a family atmosphere and great support from co-workers.
good,It is a nice place to work at but for part time they expect way to much. Managers stay upstairs with manager work and can't really participate on the floor.
good,"Everything was great there I got $9.50 an hour a cashier/ sales associate with no experience. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The managers were great. They tried to fire me for a family medical emergency, they said if I don't come in then I'm terminated. I'm like ""wtf"" I can't control family issues."
good,"It is a fun place to work with excellent management and fun coworkers. There is lots to do to keep you busy and new skills to learn. They have an awesome crew that works there, very supportive!"
good,"I enjoyed my career at BB&B. However, I rarely was scheduled to work more than 10 hours a week. On a positive note, it is a wonderful place to work, and it’s easy to catch on and form bonds with customers and employees alike."
good,"Can't complain really, Decent pay with a gradual raise and occasionally would get extra hours if someone couldn't make their shift. Overall it was fine to work there."
good,"Nice place to work.  In my case, easy commute.  People are friendly and casual attire is nice.  Would like to work from home more often as I'm in IT, but they like that you come into office, which is fine."
good,A lot of hard working managers who really care about their business.  It's place where you need to really own your business and make it flourish.  Growth is limited
good,"Good experience but when it is about you as an employee and customers.  They will win"
good,"They say people change. Well, I guess companies change also. Maybe not for the good sometimes but there is some good in every change. Once the company mindset was change to trying to become something they are not it seems everything went downhill"
good,it was a alright pace and relaxed job to have if your not looking to work very hard. some of the management was poor but also some of the managers were pretty cool. the most enjoyable part of the job was help and working with customers.
good,"A typical day at work can vary in pace depending on how much traffic is present, requiring you to jump right into work. I learned to be as confident and efficient as possible when working. Management varies greatly from person to person but overall they are helpful and approachable. The workplace culture is almost like a family  where we can talk and address any concerns and work  to solve them. The hardest part of the job is the physically demanding and fast paced work that may come during the day and certainly will come at closing time. There is a very steep learning curve when starting due to the cheer amount of inventory and company regulations that need to be memorized. The best part of the day is when traffic almost comes to a halt and there is time to clean up the store and possibly chat with coworkers."
good,"Good place to work however, the hours are long. Also, they are very considerate about your schedule and the days you required to take off. Front end workers must do extra cleaning jobs at the end of their shift resulting in a late finishing time to your shift"
good,Love working with people love  Learning new things and having fun  while making sure things don't get done the right way in the correct way every single time.
good,"making sure every customer is treated and greeted with a smile. I  learned a lot about coffee makers, different electronics, how to order and receive inventory. the culture of BBB was to make eveery customer feels welcomed, and when they walk out the door, feeling satisfied. The hardest part of the job was honestly doing wedding registries. The customers and BBB team was probably the most enjoyable things about the job."
good,"In Bed Bath & Beyond was one of the best experience of work. I learned a lot from them, it was hard but at the same time was excellent."
good,"Morning Shifts - Clock in, Head to the front grab the reports for the department, head to the stock room check to see if we have the product if so grab it and add it to your cart to put onto the floor before the store opens, Finish reports and then fill up the store with what you found inside the stock room, Store Opens finish putting away your reports and help and greet customers when you see them. Continue this until your shift is over, Clock Out."
good,"Good place if interested in retail sales, learning and gaining experience in stock or receiving. Teaches all employees how to operate the cash register and how to make sales from the computer to be sent to customers homes."
good,"I like working here its a nice environment, my coworkers are all amazing. You get to work with people whom have different personalities and views. As well as dealing with different types of customers, so you learn the different kinds of shoppers . I love that the management works with my class schedule really well."
good,"I learned the culture of the company, their systems, the coworkers were a little unfriendly, the hardest part of the job was the workload and repetition."
good,I loved the environment and also the co workers there. But the pay and the hours were not what i expected. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the newest products that came in every week.
good,"Learned new things each and everyday. Always on the move. Nice vibe to be around. Management is great. Cant complain, a lot of ground to cover but it works out."
good,"Can be an intense learning environment for those who are not self starters and not proactive in their own development.  Bed Bath's motto is if it isn't broken don't fix it.  They have a lot of practices and approaches they have literally used since the inception of the company.  They invest minimally in technology as needed   Training and development is important to them as you need to be the expert in your designated areas.  Merchants are successful here as everyone here has to be a merchant if you want to thrive here.  The downside is other area's of the business seem to suffer because technology and best practices are not adopted until your competitor has adopted it.  Remember it is equally important to keep your internal customers happy just like your external customer.  It takes people to run a business.  The long work week for managers leads to burnout and turnover especially in urban markets where there are options.  Clear internal application process would be great, it would give associates and managers equal access to opportunity and remove the perception of favoritism in the workplace. Consistent accountability.  If Johnny and Timmy have the same role they should  be held accountable to the same standard.  It is very demotivating to work with someone who is not held to the same standard and you find that you are cleaning up their messes on a regular basis."
good,"I only work part-time , my week consist of four (4) days off Monday-Thursday. I work morning which is more to my liking . I like to stay busy considering not a lot of people come to home-necessities stores at 9 am. It would be ""slow"" . I would offer my help to my co-workers , often very rude ,saying 'no'. I've learned how to truly make a visit to a customer quite pleasant . Always returning and becoming a loyal customer all because the one visit that made us approachable and understanding to the certain way they want their home to be presented to guests . I made many friends amongst managers , co-workers and customers alike . Always making my job more enjoyable and easier to go through on a bad day . probably the hard part of my job is that, the area in which I work is very diverse culturally though often times i do come across many prejudices customers. me coming from a family that comes from various backgrounds makes my day difficult."
good,Ok Job NIce for College Students not For Some One that only wants to work week days or want a full time position. Working For Bed Bath And Beyond Was A learning Experience. Co Workers were nice and enjoyable hardest part was folding of the towels lol
good,"This job create the knowledge of degree for bedding, bath towels, kitchen electrics, cookware, cutlery, coffee makers & K-Cup Packs, window treatments, storage items, gifts and much more!"
good,"It has been a Great Challenge, I really have liked the people i work with, I have learned alot about the retail industry, I learn something new every day, I will keep learning and keep trying to be the best i can at what i do."
good,"The shifts were fast paced and the pay is poor. The company pushes many over the top customer service initiatives, so each customer is really given the best shopping experience possible."
good,"Working here has tought me alot on how to communicate with people in finding what their looking for. In other words, I've grown to become a better sales associate and learned what it was to give great customer service"
good,"Work can be very physical and the days can be long, but I felt my opinion was valued and that there were opportunities to grow and advance quickly. Benefits were great and we had fun. The dress code is casual, which was nice."
good,"one of the most enjoable jobs, understanding management, learned regerstaer skills, ect"
good,Ok place to work if you looking for a part time job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with ornery customers
good,It's a good company to work for if you enjoy talking and helping people. Typical retail experience but I felt that the atmosphere was better here. As an employee you are trained to do what is most helpful for the customer. This could include suggesting a better item than what they may be looking for based on construction or price point if does the same thing. This could also include locating the item they searched for in store from another store close by or assisting in ordering it online for them. Although you have shorter hours based on the time of the season.
good,I was lucky to have great managers who mentored me by the overall conditions of work are not the best. Pay is different for most folks and hours vary.
good,Great place to work. Learned a lot of useful information. The staff always feels like a group of friends helping each other. Always someone there that is willing to help.
good,Working for Bed Bath and Beyond is a benefit. I learned a lot about product knowledge that enabled me to help the customers in making the best decisions o product choices.
good,"a steady work pace, I learned a lot about bridal and product qualities and their usages. the management is great and cares a lot for the employees. there was a lot of culture diversity there. the hardest part of the day was inputting outgoing and damaged items. the most enjoyable part of the job is all the lunching's catered or brought in by the employees"
good,Absolutely no room for growth unless you dedicate your entire life to the company and even then you're fighting tons of other people for a full time position. Even when a full time position is open the manager at the time would use that against employees to make them work 10 times harder even though he never actually gave the position to anyone.
good,Making sure the goals were completed. Team work was always a must. Many nights I would end up working in that area alone. Not as many workers as they should have for each working area. Always maintained busy and occupied.
good,Hardly any hours overall to give great customer service. Expectations are overall unrealistic. Managers are good but stressed out. While they want more and more they are willing to give back less.
good,Great place to work. Customer & employees are friendly. Climb ladders must get permission. Order products for customer if not available in store! Westlake is a bigger store in Ventura County!
good,I would assist w/ store organization and enforce sales plans; also helped set up displays for products be promoted at that time.
good,"A typical day of work consists of price changes, expiration walks, replenishing the shelves, putting out daily freight, organizing the merchandise on the shelves, helping customers find products and having knowledge about merchandise, and putting planograms together."
good,My job was to either open the store or close it. I didnt mind that at all. The only thing is that i would close at about 12:00a.m. and have to be back there at 6:00a.m. the next morning giving me very few hours to sleep and finish school work. Management was in complete control of this company so everything ran very smoothly. Being in charge of my own department was the most enjoyable thing about this job.
good,I've learned how to deal with customer service on a bigger scale which requires patients. My co-workers have always been nice caring. Only thing that was hard is dealing with people or co-workers who were stealing. Management training skills was on point.
good,a typical day at work would be just basically getting straight to work. i really enjoyed the people i have worked with in the past. the hardest part of the job was just getting use to work in an very hot environment
good,"Day to day you generally work in the same department, customer service/ front end. Unless otherwise instructed by a supervisor. You're responsible for maintaining front end where the cash registers are located. Maintenance of the bathrooms and office area as well as sweeping the sales floor. "
good,This company is all about making the customer happy and gain loyal customers.
good,working at bed bath and beyond was a good experience.I enjoyed the time at work.I worked closely with five other employees and they became close friends out side of work.the hardest part of the day was ending and cleaning up.the store was very big i manged to get through the day.i worked at the register most of the day being kind and courteous to all the guest.
good,Once clocked in you provide customer service. I also fixed the retail displays and worked the register. I learned about a wide range of different gizmos and gadgets that can be sold for a reasonable price. Management was on top of everything and provided help when needed. My co-workers were friendly and easy going. The hardest part was getting to work because it was pretty distant from my house. The enjoyable part was that i finally got to experience a different sales environment.
good,The job was just okay. The hours was a little crazy but other than that the people was fine. The raises werent all that good if you werent close with the managers.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a great plave to work, with hands on managers far up the chain of command. It was a wonderful plave to work until they, in my opinion, over hired staff and had to cut many already-employee's hours."
good,The schedule was NEVER organized and we were always super low staffed. They kinda ask a lot of you working a minimum wage job..... but none the less still a good job. I would just be very strict with the days you can work
good,I really like where I work but it just pays me for part time. And as a full time student I need to be able to pay for my books. Not includng personal stuff.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond has provided many opportunities to work on character building, as well as, placing me in positions where I have to always be customer friendly."
good,"I worked for BB&B for 6 years, though I loved my job my pay had only increased by $1.00 in 6 years. I was comfortable and loved loved loved my managers, however the pay no longer worked for me, forcing me to quit."
good,A full day at bed bath and beyond was a fast day full of customer service and projects. Working both register and the floors to make sure every customer received the best possible experience in our store.
good,"It's not a bad job. I come in.  Clean the garage.  Let my trucks in to drop of the days delivery then go to work."
good,"management advancement"
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a very productive and safe place to work had great benefits.  I learned various of jobs within the bldg.  Management was okay but not up to peak.  The hardest part of the job was working the schedule that was laid out for you... The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off at 2:00 pm and receiving a new schedule that gave you the opportunity not to work every weekend. Love the job, which was very easy but the pay rate wasn't suitable."
good,Opening the registers. Closing the registers. cleaning up front end of the store.
good,Loved working here never a dull moment. The customers were hard to deal with at times but I got through it.
good,The store manager at the store I work at is very rude I only recently started working there and every other coworker I’ve been with have told me to watch out for her because of her attitude. The way she talks to employees is just so disrespectful it makes me feel bad she has even scolded me even tho I’m new and still learning everything. I talked to a friend about this and she said she had a similar experience at her old job. It seems like abuse of power.Everyone one is super nice and sweet expect her and I just don’t think it’s fair how rude she is everyone is super nice and trying their best.
good,"A typical day at work= customer service, restocking sales floor, always on your feet"
good,Its a very slow-paced environment. If you would like a laid back job this one will be a good choice. I enjoyed it! Everybody there is nice and very hepful also.
good,"Very physical job with lots of heavy lifting and ladder climbing."
good,"gerat work for college students, friendly environment, great associates and understanding management. great spot to work for those who need quick and flexible employment."
good,La compañia te ofreces muchas facilidades y beneficios laborales.
good,"everyday I learned how to make my customer smile nd laugh"
good,"They train you on there products, so you no exactly what you are trying to sell to customers. Be prepared to lift heavy objects."
good,"Prepaid me to be an outstanding store manager at Crabtree"
good,"Un poco contradictorio con el pago , pero todo normal"
good,Great experience working there.  Job advancement great. The only downfall is exaggerated work hours if you are a manager. Typical day always included customers first.
good,"I love that customers were always happy because it's their policy to not say no to a customer. We were encouraged to learn about every item in the store and to help customers find what they need based on their desires. 20% discount for employees, extra discounts on clearance, promotional offers to employees for personal testimonials on products."
good,Everyone gets along really well. It's a really great working environment. It's a small work team so you get really close with everyone and you're trained in all departments.
good,"usually work monday to friday, 6am to 3pm, sometime have to stay late. a lot learned in a position, receiving, replenishment, stocking, team work, new programs, and more. sometime a manager have no communicate with me, what going on, why. Communicate is mostly important of a key!"
good,"Not at this moment, not interested in saying anything at this time. I thought this was to confidential. Great place to work for I am just looking for better paying job."
good,"BBB is a great place for anyone wanting a first time job in retail. The employees and management are extremely easy to get along with and work alongside. I would only recommend a position with this company for a temporary amount of time, not a long stay."
good,"When the store was not too busy with customers, there were always tasks to be given out, either on the floor or in the stockroom. There was never too much down time, in a good way."
good,"with the right management in place this can be a great place to work at, but not all stores have good gen. mgrs.  some store don't have enough hours for all the employees, therefore you may only have 4 hrs a week.  which in turn causes a high turnover."
good,"The management can be awful at times, depending on who is in that position at which specific time.  I could do a better job.  Different culture clashes."
good,"A typical day is working with the public with helping them look for the items they may need and educate them on the products.  I didn't lean anything new that i already didn't know.  The management was poor they did not like to give people credit or raises when deserved, they always gave the favorites the better schedules and the new employees the nasty schedules. The hardest part of the job was having to stand on my feet all day with little to no breaks. Working with the public and some of the people that worked there."
good,"I gave over 6 years of my life to this company, never got asked if I wanted to move up, new people got put into positions I was intrested in, the management was very two faced, you think you can talk to someone confidentially but come to find out they tell everyone your business & hold it against you later."
good,"With this job, i loved it at first with the different managers but they are now not working there and we have new ones that’s are very disappointing ."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great first job. Unfortunately I would try my best not to get stuck working here. They do not advance you, no matter how long you've been working there. Most Bed Bath and Beyond locations have very poor management. It is very hard to get working hours and keep hours at this store. I recommend working here if you're looking for your first job. Just make sure you leave this job if they do not advance you. I guarantee you will get stuck in this field and at this job."
good,job was my first one but management suck and so many people around me were getting paid more. i found out after i decided to leave. Shady company management.
good,Management is rude and hateful they mistreat there employees. Refusing to work around any other type of secduale u may have. The pay is not the best and no benefit package.
good,"Would restock items and help customers. was very laid back and it was in a small town. Labor wasnt bad but the pay was horrible. I did learn however, what it means to be a customer service member."
good,Company does not hire full time and hours are very minimal. Peek season for hours are only from October through December. But overall a good place to work for if you need a part time job.
good,"help brides come in and set up their new homes as one.  help collage studies pick out stuff for the year/years away learning. as a cashier I talk with the customers to make sure they found what they came in for and just little talk to make them feel happy"
good,This would be a better place to work at if they would compensate you more and offer health benefits. Everyone is part time and there's no opportunity for 401K or health or dental benefits.
good,working with customers to give them the best shopping experience 
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond would be checking out customers, assisting customers with questions, keeping work space clean and stocked. The hardest part of the job would probably be remembering all the different codes for all the functions at the register. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with new people."
good,To get the job done in a productive safe mannor. I learned to keep away from people that like to horseplay at work. I report to manangement always to let them know how my day went. Im supportive of my co-workers.The hardest part of the job is when is when someone trains you the wrong way.The most enjoyable part of work is being a vaulable employee to your company.
good,"You will do well there if you happen to work at a good location. Certain ones are better than others. Management does not care for any employees and expects that your job becomes you number one priority in life - please do not EVER expect anything else in your life to come first. If you are full time and get sick days - don't use them without repercussions. As a manager or department lead you will be scheduled 50 hours a week but it is HIGHLY frowned upon if you only work 50 hours a week. You need to be a team player and that means your life now belongs to them. If you get lucky enough to have good coworkers, the job will be fun and enjoyable, however the internal trickle down from corporate will take your soul."
good,It was a fast paced job and one I didn't expect to be so physically demanding. The other employees with whom I worked were all wonderful people and the customers were very pleasant for the most part. It was a nice part-time job while trying to figure out if I wanted to go into sales.
good,"I was limited in what I did. I worked the holiday, then my hours were cut in the springtime, and I left in the summer for college."
good,this job was very annoying and was unfair at times. would only recommend if you don't mind letting someone walk over you and letting someone talk to you any kind of way.
good,Management doesn't really have everything together. They send you to different positions when there's no work in your area. They keep calling and send you back and forth. Hardest part id say is lifting heavy items. That's about it but co-workers can help if they're willing to. I'm tiny so anyone can do it. Most enjoyable are the last few minutes until you get to go home. Its really loud in some areas. Buzzers always going off. Conveyers always stopping. Boxes that you need are never there and it takes weeks till they finally get them. Printers always jamming.
good,Productive job that always keeps you on your feet and employee always needs a positive attitude. Customers are always right and you must accommodate what they need.
good,"While being employeed by Bed Bath and Beyond I learned about so many things.  Some of the things that I learned while at Bed Bath and Beyond were:  Different types of towels, linen, china, pillows, cookware and scales."
good,"there isn't really much i can tell you about this job because i just started working here a month ago. however, so far so good. i like the retail life much more than the food industry."
good,"I was thankful for the many skills that I learned there. But we had a change of store managers to often to create any form of consistence."
good,"I worked at BBBY for a little over 7 years. My favorite part of the job was merchandising and the customers. It was fast paced and entertaining. I learned a whole lot about the products and customer service, that still helps me until this day."
good,Business is good but it is nearly impossible to get more than 20 hours a week. Also there is not much opportunity for advancement unless you suck up to the boss.
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond gave me the retail experience that I have, and it helped me to bring my customer service and the retail experience to help me become a better worker in dealing with the customers and their concerns, and seeing to it that all their situations be resolved in a timely manner."
good,Great place to get into retail and learn how customer service should be. You will learn a lot of good skills for future jobs you will get. Pay is ok and it is very hard to move up.
good,"typical day can vary from 4-10 hours."
good,"I worked there for 3 1/2 Years and never got moved up in the company. Went to numerous of managers stating i could do other positions but never got the chance they always went for the new hires.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers as much as possible. I loved answering the phones and helping the customers with the product they were looking for and giving them proper information on the items. Typical day at work was greeting the customers as they entered the door , answering the phones and directing them to the departments they ask for and assisting them with the answer of their questions."
good,"This store in Elyria needed better management and training of new employees. I didn't receive the needed computer training on the different computer programs. Most I figured out on my own. I never called off, was called in on short notice to cover for someone not coming in. I always went above and beyond and was the first to have hours cut to 4 a week. I loved working at Bed Bath and Beyond. Would live to work at different store."
good,"Retail is shortage of hours but overall it is a decent plaxe to work. You do have to climb large ladders for customers. They fross train in cashiering, departments, guest services. It shows you how to know and understand the total job. You also have online guest fullfillment orders. Thats really not hard."
good,"Terrific teams to work with, nice customers,hours were good. Management was crude, used language not exceptable. work hours were not consistence.  Hours were shortened to 5 hours a week."
good,"fun place to work but poorly managed as well as limited opportunities to grow within the company. Even the associated that have worked them for a long time, rarely get compensated."
good,"They don't train you to know all the 10,000 different unique as-seen-on-tv items that would help to know because it seems more than half of customers are looking for some item like that."
good,"Overall it paid the bills and I enjoyed my co-workers and managers. Corporate was hard to please and it felt as if nothing was ever good enough. The atmosphere was almost enjoyable, most co-workers I enjoyed working with. Out of the 5 years I worked here it was VERY hard to move up in the company and ""prove your worth""."
good,"Better training and retraining for employees that have been with a company for many years. Continuously try to improve the work environment,  spring for refreshments once in awhile,  $5 gift cards for an employee that does something exceptional,  ok just a thank you once in awhile."
good,If you’re looking for full-time work I don’t recommend this bed bath and beyond if your student and you only need part time it’s a great place to work for .
good,"Fun, social, busy. Have to be in the mood to be social and happy your whole shift. Learned a lot about bedding. Workplace culture is alright, just super fast life. The hardest part of the job is being able to remember everything that is taught in the classes and being able to catch up. Most enjoyable is seeing the happy couples once you help them. Having a rush when it's busy."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I always had something to do and was glad to be kept busy. Managers were nice most of the time, although I did have some problems with not being given clear instructions."
good,It's a cool place to work overnight. You won't be bored and at times it seems like the time flys. The crew was all welcoming and friendly which is good.
good,"Believe me the job it's self is far from difficult. The environment over all is great and a good place to work over all. There is just a limitation on how you are accommodated for what is realistic for your life outside of work, to when they ""need"" you to be available to be there at work. "
good,No job is worth being treated disrespectful..  Some managers should go back to school or training in how to respect Co workers and management should chip in and help instead of running their mouth all day and not helping.  We the employees should be treated how management wants to be treated. And not like a piece of dirt.
good,A lot of work to do with customers orders. Scanning items and putting them on a pallet. The management is really professional and respectful. The place is HUGE!!!
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is an amazing place to find all kinds of household goodies. Definetly a great place to work if you arent looking to advance in your career if you arent a man.
good,Overall job is fairly easy the benefits are sup-par and the customers are overall friendly. The communication between district/regional staff to the store is poor at best and the communication between in store management and associates is almost nonexistent. Great first job but unless you have the drive and skills to move up not worth a long term investment.
good,"Restocking, running the register, cleaning up. I learned that a job can in fact give you OCD. The management and co-workers were fantastic."
good,"It can be fun and entertaining or sometimes it can be really slow . I learned how to actually gift wrap ! My co-workers are really helpful . The hardest part of the job is when you have a missing merchandise that you have to gift wrap to send too a customer , so you have to wait several hours too finish gift wrapping that oder ."
good,"A typical day at work is basically helping customers with what they need and making sure the store looks good. I've learned a lot about the products that are sold there through the classes that they give every associate so we can be able to help the customers with any questions. The management is good, can go to them with any concerns and they will help. The coworkers are great very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is sometimes not being able to get the sale because the customer doesn't want to order it. The most enjoyable is when we can get the sale especially if it is a high dollar amount and also the people I get to work with."
good,"A lots of customers, fun managers, nice and clean."
good,"I worked the front end, customer service and merchandising the art wall.  I enjoy art so keeping the art wall neat, up to date was fun.  Management was fine, co-workers were great.  The store merchandise was very nice and the classes to learn about the merchandise was a lot of fun."
good,"It was a great store to work at if you had the right management. I loved it when I first started working there, the store manager was awesome, and we had a couple supervisors who looked out for us. After the store manager was promoted and the other supervisors either transferred or left, the morale went down and was a bad working enviroment."
good,While the management could have been better I did enjoy many of the products that we sold. It sucked that we only received 10% off for our employee discount but it was a decent retail job.
good,"Truly love the culture of the company. Unfortunately at the current moment, no opportunity for growth. Looking to expand the knowledge that ive learned over the years with BBB and be able to develop another company with my experience."
good,"I work all departments, helping stock up in the morning. Training the whole team daily in rotation, fulfilling my personal goals and pushing sales in bridal registries."
good,"Not appreciated-they do not keep up with other companies' pay scale"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a good place to work at the beginning, but slowly became a uninviting place to work. Management is not very good, and we are very understaffed."
good,Not enough training before being put out on the sales floor. Need better compensation. They don't have actuall trainers just managers giving quick tutorials.
good,"It's a pretty good store that has things you can buy at a variety of prices. Don't just take my advice on it, visit it yourself and be amazed. Word to the mother bird."
good,"I loved working here; I had a great group of ladies show me the ropes. Everyone was always willing to help and every week we had a mini ""class"" on certain items in the store, this way when a customer asked we didn't have to ask someone else for the answer. You were allowed to be self sufficient and there was very little micro managing. We had a change in store managers, unfortunately, and the new manager treated the younger girls very poorly. He was openly insulting and enjoyed making you look foolish in front of customers."
good,"Personally I don’t think the management is very good. The managers just don’t have the best leader skills, but we get through it and make sure we get all of our projects done for the night."
good,Unfortunately the Asheville Bed Bath and Beyond had management issues and was not a very happy place to work after a few years and being passed up on promotions.
good,"i worked there for  a month. I had to work during the holidays. I did not like it. I had to stay there until 1 am or even 2am.. during the holidays. also management is bad. Most employees don't work they are lazy and just talk with other employees or managers. They also let these older employees do what they want like leave work early. One employee was very rude towards me and it was very difficult to work there even though i like the job. I am a very hard worker and i tried to follow rules but i notice most don't. Day employees just walk around (""helping customers"") but they just walk around doing nothing talking to each other while i  tried to be concerned about the job. it was unfair that i was working while they just talk. The store looked bad with stuff all over the floor and placed everywhere by customers. Also no one was there to help me, i had to work by myself at times. it was horrible .The managers don' t care. they still pay them."
good,"Guaranteed a lot of hours during the week. Expect holidays to be busy. Coworkers are nice for the most part, depending on who your manager is, some are more strict than others. I was always busy while working here."
good,Overall the job is pretty easy and the management is easy going and willing to compromise with your schedules and any conflicts that may arise. There were a few hiccups but nothing that was not able to be solved.
good,"Your typical day is fast-paced and constantly stopping and starting projects while greeting customers. You'll be expected to get your tasks done, but also ring on the register when needed, and assist all customers in the building. I've learned that any advancement must be demanded or else they will let you stay there forever. Workplace culture has devolved from what it was. You can get some help if you ask, sometimes. And they do care about associate relations if they affect your ability to work. The hardest part of the job is knowing what to do. It depends on who you ask. The most enjoyable part of working there is meeting the customers and learning about the products."
good,"Fun place to work "
good,"Great for college kids, When you advance from within to management you do not get paid much. Must be able to work holidays and days and nights. Long hours at the holidays"
good,"encountered many new customers daily, the place felt very lively with the other associates and customers. I learned how to communicate better with numerous people."
good,"Very fast paced and customer oriented. Managers always pushing to do better. Typical retail experience. Worked almost every holiday and snowstorm. Good first job to have, not a great permanent one."
good,"A fun place to work, with great discounts. It is such a diverse store with many variety of products for your home life.  It is a place where you have the opportunity to meet lots of different people."
good,"I rang the customers up after shopping, helped them find whatever it was they were looking for or did a registry If Someone needed. I also tagged the items with prices & stocked the shelves."
good,Super slow paced most of the time; busy around Christmas; no job advancement; low pay; too many managers that never agree with each other. General Manager was nice and productive though.
good,"I loved working at Bed Bath and Beyond. The hours were decent. The employees are absolutely amazing. You become a family very quickly. They will work with you going to school. They hire high school students. However, the pay is almost always close to, if not at minimum wage. And the hours can get a little unreasonable. If you get a good amount of hours one week, they will have to drop your hours the next week because you have to average out for the year."
good,You have to have good customer service skills to progress. They don't pay very much but they work around you schedule. Overall it's a good part time job if your in school or just starting out.
good,"A typical day would involve helping customers find the products that fit to them perfectly and making sure they leave feeling as though they have been individually helped to their own lifestyle no matter what it is they came in for. "
good,I was hired as part time with the expectation that my salary would increase as time went by.  So far all the training I have had is minimal and the feedback is limited.  My experience and training is lost in this lost.
good,A typical day at work is boring.  Not enough to do.  Just stand at a register and wait for customers.  Hardest part of job is not enough to keep me busy.  Been there 6 months and they haven' t trained me on anything else.
good,"Great company depending on what your expertise are.  Part time job is great, however being a retail shop you are expected to work weekends witch is great.  Limits hours worked per week."
good,"No Comment about work day."
good,"A typical day at work was walking around and checking if any customers needed help, if so I'd walk with them to the item(s) they were looking for and explain the background of it to them if necessary. I usually had a closing shift so recovery was a big part of my job, organizing the shelves, sweeping and mopping the floors, cleaning the bathrooms etc. I learned how to quickly adjust to any situation, how to be responsible, how working with others can teach you how to communicate effectively, to keep cool in tough situations and to always do more than what's asked of you. Overall management was good, sometimes tricky because each manager was different and they all wanted things done differently. My co-workers were all lovely and I made friends really easily. I'm a very confident person and I love to talk, only when it's the right time though. The hardest part of my job was having to be on my feet for all of my shift which a lot of the times were 8 to 9 hours.The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely working with the people, the good and the bad because the bad just made you appreciate the good."
good,"My work day would consists of several different jobs throughout the day.  One being MOD or Manger on Duty.  I have learned quite a bit about the company over the years, through my training and training others.  Poor management and, at times, degrading and unappreciated for all the work that I do do. It is very difficult to advance unless you are within the little ""group"".  If they don't like you, they make it a very hostile work environment"
good,"-lots and lots of training, especially concerning products"
good,"Fun workplace. Upper staff treat you as if you are on the same level as you are. When you have questions, coworkers are there to help you. Sales/customer service go above and beyond to assist customers with their needs. Associates go above and beyond to provide great customer care, putting them top priority.  A place where  things get done with teamwork."
good,A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond was crazy you always come in to Chaos the last shift not completing their task and leaving it for the next shift to do double the work. I've learned to multitask in a unorganized environment and not buckle under pressure. management could have been better they did not really help even when they were short staffed. co-workers we helped each other out so that we got are work done working on the floor so that everyone can go home at night. the hardest part is dealing with unruly customers. the most enjoyable moment would be when you help a customer and they are grateful because you went above and beyond for them
good,"Great place to work as a second or part time job."
good,"If you work hard enough, managers will let you work at your own pace on your own projects. They are very trusting of their employees with set tasks. All employees are trained on the registers and they promote encouragement to those who do well."
good,"Working here was a great experience with some minor and major flaws. My welcome manager was polite, made me feel welcome and on top of all of that, he was funny! "
good,"I loved this job. It was great! Up until I started getting treated really poorly by the management. I worked as hard as I could ever day and went above and beyond to gain sales and supply great customer service, but it had seemed like all of my hard work and efforts had gone unnoticed by the store manager and when somebody else had done something good they had received a lot more recognition, when I had done better than them in sales or whatever it had been at the moment. It got to the point that I felt so looked down upon when I was actually doing pretty great and it just wasn't a healthy working environment."
good,"Working customer service is verty demanding. constantly on the phone with customers, using a multi line phone system, directing the call to the right department, directing customers, answering questions, take care of customers complaints, ensure that the best customer service was provided. Prevent theft and loss of business assests on a daily basis. File paperwork and prepare to send to corperate offices. Delagate work to coworkers on tasks that needs to be completed. Assist management on tasks that they're unsure of. The most difficult part of the job is to make sure that all custmers are happy, i find that difficult to do because, I find in general that a person asn not please everyone. I love and enjoy customer service because I love helping people."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond, a typical day as a cashier was to stay at your station and ring people out. Once I got promoted to Supervisor it was handling cash, answering phones, doing online orders, putting away freight every night, counting the drawers, and doing the bank drop every night. I learned how to be a leader and a lot about customer service. The hardest part was stocking areas and climbing ladders with merchandise in hand. Management was easy going and made working there pretty enjoyable."
good,I fun place to see the newest thongs thats come out. to help others is a blast!
good,"A typical day at BBB is one that, after almost 3 years, gets kind of old and repetitive. I have been moved around departments a few times and working in stock replenishment has been the best so far. I didn't ask to be moved; I came in one day and saw that my department had been changed, because of employees leaving and new ones needing to be hired. I went with it, and the best part of it is being in the stock room by myself in the peace and quiet. I go down a list and grab certain items, delete last ones and absent ones, and move on to the next department. I do like helping customers, don't get me wrong, but it can be challenging when they clearly woke up on the wrong side of the bed or missed their cup of coffee. I am one of those people that tends to shy away from conflict if possible, but if it's there, I do my best to be as polite as possible and do what I can for the customer. After almost 3 years, this is still hard and unpleasant, but really important. My management has been interesting. At the store I transferred to after 2 months, the boss was a nightmare. She was just plain mean, condescending, unappreciative, and I'll just say, really annoying with things she would constantly say. I dreaded seeing her red mini in the parking lot because my mood would just drop, I knew I was in for a bad day if I ran into her. Luckily, for some reason she left, and months later we got a great manager, and then I had to transfer back to my first store. The managers there currently are a breath of fresh air comparably, and my days seem to be quick and painless, and I do get recognition"
good,Although this company provides little room for stability and promotions it is a good place to realize what hard work is while staying on top of customer service.
good,Love the customers there but sometimes management doesn't always play the best role. while most is nice there are a few sticklers and safety is big
good,the workplace is very fun and the customers are easy going. you can buy things monthly at cost. the benefits are decent. they pay isnt bad considering its retail. management and the lack of job advancement is the worst i have ever seen. they always hire management from elsewhere.
good,"My 9 hour day consists of interacting with the customers with escalations or compliments while monitoring for quality assurance. Each one has different satisfaction level so I must listen attentively. I'm always coaching the CSR's to reach their maximum potential, sometimes collaborating with my peers for a solution. Job fulfillment comes when it can be seen and heard emulating me reaching customer satisfaction."
good,"On a daily basis, helping customers find what they need is always fun for me. I have learned many people are always looking for a second opinion on products and they really like to see things in person. The employees of Bed Bath & beyond a friendly, just like family."
good,"it isnt a bad place to work, is just the people that work there make it difficult for other people to work at my store. during my time at my store, i have noticed how the managers are and how some of the employees treat eachother and its not what you would expect from a well-known company. everybody will always be friendly to you in the beginning, but as time goes on you begin to see their true colors."
good,Management was considerate. Room for advancement. I enjoyed working there.
good,The main problem with this Bed Bath and Beyond was the management. Because of the low compensation your work-mates are going to be on the lower end of qualified and that affects the work environment. If you stay for more than a year you have the opportunity for a raise but all upper management are brought in from out of house. No upward mobility at all unless you quit and reapply.
good,In customer service the customer is always right and that is what was learned and enforced at Bed Bath & Beyond. Bed Bath & Beyond is very loyal to it's customers and I have adopted the same loyality. It takes a lot of patience to work at a customer pleasing job such as Bed Bath & Beyond.Even when I feel that the customer is wrong I have learned how to follow policy & procedure to satisfy the customer.
good,manager wasn't understanding when an employee has a health issue
good,"i have been there for a while so i don't it cant be that bad. I work on ""projects"" that I can work independently with little supervision needed.  It's a job."
good,"It was a good job at first and it was a job that at first I enjoyed. After 5 years with the company though, I need a change. The managers were mixed and the culture it was very relaxed"
good,"You had to do a lot of heavy lifting, I'm a 4'11 petite woman that had to lift a lot of things with almost no help all the time. Holidays are insane! And that putting it nicely"
good,Management has no idea what they're doing. They give very little hours with little pay. There is no room for advancement. There are no raises except for full time and managment.
good,"This company needs a lot of improvement if I'm being honest. Especially the store I currently work in. I do enjoy my job and the responsibilities that come with it. I especially enjoyed working as a part of the renovations team because we would constantly be on the move and doing different things all the time. I would love to a part of another renovation and if you get the chance I suggest you do it. Also, if you work less than 8 hours you don't get a lunch break, and if you do work up to 8 hours you only get a half hour break. Management is tricky to deal with but overall it's not a hard job at all. My coworkers are great and the company does allow you to have two different positions. (ex: cashier & overnight stock)"
good,There were Code violations manager ignored. Little on the job training. Great employees but not all did there job. Others had to do their work plus lazy employee. Complaints to manager sometimes helped situation.
good,It was a fun atmosphere to work for until one manager came on. They started cutting hours and customers started to notice that there was barley any employees in the building.
good,"I stocked on the floors, I have done customer service and register their. They put you in all locations in the shop. Basically,  the online ordering was a competitive thing it felt like.  There was a manager there (not sure if she Is still there) and she basically had favoritism. If you are with a customer she would ""what are you doing?"" With an attitude. When I worked there pay wasnt good. It was as literally minimum wage, 7.25 an hour left making 8 an hour."
good,"The managers are not college educated and are usually just people that have a few years of retail experience. There is no full-time potions unless you're management and they work 50+ hours a week for a measly 40K. Turn over rate among employees is relatively high. Its not a bad job for someone in high school or college, they do work around your school schedule and people are always calling in sick so you can pick up tons of hours."
good,"Greeted customers, cashiered, processed returns, helped with bridal registry and gift wrapping, stocked and clean counter area. Answered phones, paged and answered questions and gave directions.  Cleaned and stocked the front bathrooms."
good,"It was fast pace and really busy especially on the holidays. Very nice co-workers, and had very flexible hours. Learned how to do RTV's, and how to do all kinds of payments."
good,"I loved my coworkers, the customers weren't usually very mean or angry, if you followed the rules and did your job you were just fine. All of my coworkers were friendly and supportive. The hardest part of the job was doing tones of stocking and zoning which got tedious. The managers were like every other bunch of managers, some were a pain sometimes, other times they were your best friend."
good,"BBB was good at keeping associates current on training.  BBB provides flexible scheduling, but 25 hours per week is the maximum allowed. It would be nice to give associates full time work, not just management."
good,"I think bed bath and beyond is a wonderful place to work if you get full-time. If not then it's pretty hard to live and pay bills. Don't get me wrong. I love the company whole heartdly, but they have been very adamant about cutting hours back. Even for full-time employers."
good,"A typical day for me, is printing daily reports, I look at ending and beginning promos that will be starting or ending. I print out upcoming promos and do all signing for current promos and removal of signs for ended. I also research price discrepancies. I pull replen for day prior sales. I do pricing of increased and decreased inventory. Some merchandiseing. Customer Service is first and foremost for all employees.  I create online orders & direct ships for customers. I am a bridal consultant for couples coming in to register. Office supply ordering."
good,"A good company to work for, excellent with customers but weak with management team. There is always good and continuous training. A place where I was able to develop even the supposedly weak associates. An enjoyable place to work while dealing with customers."
good,I love what I do just don’t feel appreciate I feel there a lot of favoritism I feel in order to be promoted will never happen and the managers don’t care so the employees don’t
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Bed Bath and Beyond is that not only did I get more experience working a register, but I also made some great friends."
good,The plus of this job was that I knew quite a few of the people who had worked there. It was a fun job but I didn't have time for it with balancing school.
good,"Career advancement is very slow. "
good,The job is fun but very stressful  sometimes you just don't know what do do next customers after customers and it's just a fun experience because nobody wants to be broke
good,I was just a kid so I really didn't know any thing about to job world I really can't remember any thing about it since it was 27plus years ago and can't remember
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a decent company to work for and a verifiable income of financial responsibility. The store itself is wonderful and the corporation itself is wonderful. The lower  pay and the lack of benifits are my only qualms with this employer.
good,A good job for the money as log as you stay hourly. A good place for building experience but not for a career. The benefits were good but it takes getting full time status to get benefits.
good,I loved working there.  They closed the location where I was at so it did get  bit stressful at times. I worked at a different location for a bit and it wasn't the same so I had to find something else and it also was far from home for me.  But I really enjoyed working for BB&B.
good,"It was a decent place, hours worked. The amount of downtime i felt to be the most exhausting. I spent alot of time walking round after filling my dept looking for things to organize or straighten. They dont put alot of trust into hard working employees which i thought was weird. Didnt give opportunity for advancement"
good,"Its really easy to get bored here"
good,"A typical day would be a short staff meeting in the morning and then pulling items we sold the previous day and restocking those items. Once we opened for the day I was typically a cashier and rang up customers, and assisted them with wedding registries. On a closing shift I would sometimes be a cashier, other times I was out on the floor putting away freight and assisting customers. Night shifts also included cleaning desks,break room, bathrooms, and all trashes were taken out."
good,"Not much to say....it was a busy holiday season. I like that they have very quality & innovative products, I like how they will stack coupons any day, and I like that they care about their products & returns, but have a no hassle return policy."
good,"The inbound department has wonderful managers that get the job done with the employees in mind. It's fast pace and the work load changes regularly. The facility has been up and running going on five years and has come a long way since day one. It's a fairly new facility so there are changes that  occur on a regular basis, adapting and learning new methods of change quickly are a must."
good,I liked this job but the pay is at a stand still to long. You was able to wear several titles and no pay raise for what  person was worth. The job was very interested and there was a lot to be learned. The feeling to be able to tell a customer about an item and the customer is very satisfied and happy while making their purchase was a joy.
good,I loved this job just not enough hours. great discounts that was really nice.i loved working with people. Staff werefriendly.no benefits because was only part time. management was really bossy.
good,"customer service, cash handling, returning and exchanging product, stocking product, assisting customer with higher stored merchandise, back stocking product, cashier, answering phones, maintaining cleanliness of the workplace."
good,"Management didnt work as a team, they just barked orders."
good,"Overall, I appreciate what this company stands for in theory. Working somewhere where making the customer happy is never the wrong option makes my job much easier. As long as the customer is happy, even if that means bending any number of policies, then the right decision was made. My biggest wish would be for this company to apply some of that forward thinking to their staff as well. Associates are not given the same benefit of the doubt that customers are. If they could find a better balance between the two, there would be next to nothing negative holding this company back."
good,"typical day at work includes: stocking the store, assisting customers, and going on cash when called."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. I learned how to deal with people and it was a nice learning experience. I liked my managers, however, I do think they could have been a bit more timely."
good,"A typical day was a good fast day when many guests are coming."
good,"As a receiving manager my tasks include: unloading trucks, ensuring all merchandise is received correctly, all bills are filled out correctly. Maintaining a clean and safe work environment. I manage two people under me. I also held other positions throughout the company and worked at every rochester, ny location. 13+years of customer service, inventory control and receiving experience. Hardest part of the job would be the physical tasks, lots of heavy lifting. The most enjoyable helping customers, and working with great people."
good,fun place to work at when u have co-workers that are awesome.
good,A typical day at work was stressful. It was alot of wanted to be bosses. I learned alot at this job. I learned how to run receiving take in trucks do the correct paper work. i learned how to keep the inventory correct in the store and etc.
good,"The manager was a jerk! But every other employee was great! The job is fast paced and I was always busy, which was a good thing!"
good,"Culture includes constant training."
good,"With in the four years i've worked there, i have learned customer service, i have had cashier training, I learned how to work the floor as a sales associate, I have received product knowledge on items within the store and I made orders for customers via the internet."
good,"Cashier dealing with all kinds of transactions, customers, staff, management, products and policies. I learned how to deal with all kinds of customers, resolve conflicts, promote sales, and product knowledge. Hardest part of the job was unsatisfied customers and the easiest part of the job was satisfied customers."
good,Busy day challenging to do many tasks on a daily basis. Supervisors strived to get things done. I learned to get the job done to get the right people involved to maintain customers happy.
good,"Working at Bed, Bath and Beyond was a great experience. I believe they helped shaped the work ethic I have today."
good,came in as an assistant work to become an ops manager. able to merchandise new products
good,"This company has one of the best customer service philosophies I have ever seen. However, the payroll is very tight and workload is very extensive. I didnt have the opportunity to manage as much as I would have liked due to the limited staff. No real chance for advancement within the company."
good,I worked for Bed Bath & Beyond from 2012 until 2019. I was hired as a lift operator from the start. This E-commerce warehouse had just opened up in Pendergrass Georgia.
good,I was let go at the end of the season which I don't think is fair. We were told as long as we had under a certain amount of points we would be able to stay. Well that wasn't true. I walked into work one day and the told all of us seasonal personnel to go home. That day was our last.
good,fun place to work. Management is pretty dull and strict though. You get to meet new people and the customers were pretty nice. all positions start as a cashier.
good,"nothing special, but also nothing awful. pretty standard complaints for a part-time retail job where you make minimum wage at a big chain company. not much else to say"
good,This was a perfect first job experience. It taught me a lot to become a better person and good at customer service. I was fortunate to have worked here for seven years.
good,"Easy going place to work for a part-time job. Good for students, retirees, of just part timers.  "
good,"As a part-time associates, this job requires much of you physically. "
good,"Retail is fast paced and physical. You must be able to climb ladders and be active on your feet. It is a benefit to be self sufficient while providing excellent service to the customer in a timely manner. Working on a register, merchandising product, stocking the shelves, and keeping your work area clean, are some of the many tasks involved along side of your most important role, which is taking care of the customer while they are shopping in your store."
good,"Although being assigned a specific section of home products in the store, there were many occasions where the knowledge of other sections could be learned. If not aiding customers, you could keep yourself busy with restocking shelves, creating new displays, or backing up another employee. The workplace culture is a little on the looser side but work is definitely completed in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of this job was the recognition and small parties that were thrown for employees by the managers that created a sense of inclusion for all."
good,Great place to work depending on the location. Stay away from the smaller stores like Bronx terminal and 125th street if your used to working in a face pace setting. Aside from that cool managers great co workers great place to grow if your in the right store.
good,"I took this job as a summer position in between high school and college. The job was good, but they didn't offer as many hours as I needed. I enjoyed my coworkers and the management was pretty good."
good,I do admit I miss t their I liked it. Maybe it just wasn’t the right place for me though. Most managers that are their though have been their a long time and aren’t going anywhere. Everyone is pretty nice too.
good,Hardest. Computer and registers are archaic. Need an upgrade.  Most enjoyable. People.  Pass the buck good policy for handling difficult customers.  Employees do not have to deal with people with attitudes.
good,"Very good employees easy to get along with everyone helps everyone in a timely manner to get things done. Management is friendly very knowledgeable and their training process is paid and very thorough, covering all safety precautions and knowledge on merchandise."
good,I loved working at BB&B!  It was a great part-time job and helped me get back on my feet again.  The hourly salary was good and employees had discount perks.  There was a team mentality for all to succeed.  You were cross-trained from cashier to stock-shelving to ordering products online for customers and more.  You got to do a bit of everything which made it fun and never dull.
good,"BBAB was my first job. I was at first put on the registers to work out common transactions. that was fairly easy but I kept doing all I can to exceed the common expectations the managers had, and after about two weeks I was moved up to customer service were I stay for the rest of my time at BBAB."
good,The managers play favorites. They don't work around your schedule either and rather cut people's hours and higher new people. Those who need the hours wont get them and those who ask for smaller amount of hours will get lots.
good,It was a nice environment to start out in for a first job and an easy transferring process when I moved states. I was taught and trained to learn the required things and not pressured or expected to learn or know how to do everything about the job right away. It took about 7-8 months to get everything down when I first started working for the company.
good,"This was an exciting, busy environment. The customers were great.  It was fun getting to know about the products.  A clean environment. A place that has many useful products."
good,"Working for the company in the beginning was good ,but as with all retail currently they are hard pressed in trying to be  competitive with other online retailer's."
good,Nice place to work. Great co-workers. They have very competent managers and flexible schedule. Unfortunately no real area for improvement or advancement.
good,"Worked in various departments.  Bedding, Bath, Beauty, cashiering. Was demanding at times, but enjoyed assisting customers where needed. Assisted in stocking shelves, zoning before closing."
good,Workplace culture was difficult at BBB due to the amount of hours management was expected to work.  This did however allow me to manage and enhance my time management skills.
good,Enjoyed working with some of the employees I worked with. Management was difficult to deal with but mostly their system of operations is incredibly outdated.
good,"Average retail, no special pros or cons. Observed 0 internal promotions in my time with this company, several external hires. Willing to work with your schedule, unwilling to give adequate hours to make a living."
good,If you have no car or definitely transportation its a bad idea catxhing the bus .Going to work on the bus will take about 2 hours getting off at night sometime the bus come after hours sonetime the bus never come ! But overall working is easy and fun
good,"overall standing was great, positive people with career goals. great hours and great break room. great environment along with challenging tasks through out daily assignments"
good,I thought the company was pretty good the stores were very neat most times employees were good people just wish the pay and career advancement was better
good,"If you're looking for a part time job with not many hours than this is the right place for you. The management isn't the best. If you need time off they are pretty good about giving you days off. If you change your availability who knows if it would get approved. You also get the same discount as the customers get, 20% off."
good,I feel like I would have enjoyed the job more if my coworkers were nice. One manager was mean but most of them were nice. They are understanding and are willing to work with your schedule.
good,"- Typical day at work consists of helping customers, stocking, and cleaning."
good,Good first job. I liked most of my managers. At first it was a great job. I got promoted but didn’t get any type of raise so basically i did more than i was paid for. Towards the end my scheduling manager and i had many problems.
good,"I did enjoy working there and as I said, I didn't plan on leaving,.  I was thinking of stepping down due to a growing family, but i never got the chance.  My work day did vary from day to day.  Whether people called out so other departments had to be covered as well as my own.  Everyone usually was up to helping and staying late or coming in to help if that was the case, but other times, when we had call outs, it was not an enjoyable place to work.  I felt many times I was asked to do too much and i don't think paid fairly for the amount of knowledge I had and the amount of help and dedication I would put into a work day, everyday.  The reason that I stayed for so long was because they were very good when I needed a day off here or there.,  They would do their best to accommodate when they could.  I also enjoyed the people  I worked in 2 stores within my time at BB&B, and in both places what has kept me there were always the people."
good,Like I said the benefits aren't good and so the work isn't worth the pay. Everyones for the most part super nice but it gets stressful at times. Once one person is having a bad day it seems to linger but I try to work my absolute hardest at the end of day.
good,A typical day at work is productive and energetic. You learn how to assist customers with purchases on and off line. The working culture is relaxed yet quick paced. The hardest part about the job is putting up stock climbing ladders. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers.
good,"its a great first job, you learn about customer service and flexable scheduling for college students. I had alot of fun and met someinteresting people."
good,"You just do a lot of returns and take a bunch of complaints so there is that. I don't know but it kinda is an easy job, they don't drug test they pay you every two weeks, sometimes they bring in food for everybody. Idk its just great."
good,I was hired to help set up a new store for the grand opening. It was not a hard job but it was very fast paced to get everything done and in place for the slotted grand opening date. Worked with a lot of good people and had fun in the process.
good,it was good woeking there.  if i didn't have to move i would have stayed there longer.  it was a good working environment. i had a great team.  and everyone was really friendly.  i would recoment woeking here.
good,"I worked for a bed bath in tampa for 2 years. It was a rough start seeing as I had a manager that just didn't like me for unknown reasons. Started off as a cashier seasonal hire. My willingness to learn as much as I could earned me a position as a part-time hire. I kept learning and asking other co-workers to teach me what they did in their positions. Soon I was no longer only a cashier. The best way to describe it was a jack of all trades. I learned enough to work the customer service desk, the sales floor on the kitchen and furniture side, as well as the bedding and bath side. I also requested to learn the stock rooms and receiving. In doing so I made myself available to fill in for practically any position needed in the event they were short handed and needed people to allocate in certain departments. When we got a new Manager in charge of scheduling she realized my versatility and proceeded to give me more hours. I liked the job. I liked helping people and doing whatever was needed to make a customer happy. Would definitely do it again if given the opportunity."
good,"Great job to work at, easy and fulfilling when assisting customers.  Some of the management team is fair, how ever there are some that should have never been hired.  Great community of people to work with."
good,"The biggest con is that it is demanding physically. You are on your feet all day up and down ladders carrying heavy objects, when you are not interacting with customers.But there are pros, it is a very good job, they have very flexible hours, you will meet great people not just employees but customers as well."
good,"My typical day at work includes, chatting and emailing about order issues and questions about products that we sell. "
good,"Fun, great energy overall. Very competitive, a lot up selling skills I learned from working at Bed Bath & Beyond. Steady and fast paced workplace. Friendly co-workers, and happy customers."
good,"Bed, Bath & Beyond is a good employer.  But be careful of the store you work in.  A typical day means coming to work on time, assisting customers, working freight, and making sure the store is ready for business at all time.  Some managers do not give you enough time to accomplish tasks that are demanded of employees.  Other managers are very easy to work with.  "
good,"This was a good workplace for a while, but then they started focusing too much on the corporate needs while disregarding the needs of the employees. If you're looking for something on the side to pass the time this is the perfect place to work, but it will now completely pay the bills. The lower level management staff was amazing they really considered your needs and listened to your input, but were usually over-ruled by upper-management."
good,"There are a lot of people who work here and that number is still growing. Rush hour is extremely congested. Overall environment is enjoyable. Campus type environment, with many amenities. Great job if you have proper management. Experiences vary due to how different departments are managed. Some, experiences are negative with management due too poor assignment of duties. Hourly employees do not benefit as much as salary. Hardest part of the job is having too much responsibilities and not enough people. Most enjoyable part of Bed Bath & Beyond is lunch hour when you see the whole campus come together. Dress code is business casual, Jeans and Sneakers are allowed."
good,"Had my managers been better, I received more hours, and there been benefits  this would have been a fantastic job I would have stayed with for most of my life. Bed Bath and Beyond is truly a company I will continue to shop with for a lifetime though due to their fantastic customer service, which is a trait they instill in their employees from day one."
good,"Great for a first job, or a job for a teen. Not a lot of hours, and management isn't on top of there employees who aren't doing the right things. No benefits."
good,Overall of this work place it is a decent job to start with as a college student. They are willing to work around with your work schedule but the down fall is they schedule you on days you can't work without letting you know.
good,Fast pace with many reposipilities lots with lots of work involving you to constantly be on your feet.  great pride in the best customer service  a great company and concept.
good,"I never had an overtly bad experience at Bed Bath and Beyond, but it's not the greatest place to work. Especially in this specific location in Miami. The customers are extremely rude sometimes and have no consideration for the sales associates. Sometimes management is hard to deal with as well. It's a lot of work and effort."
good,"The job task is simply and repetitive, a typical day rarely changes from one to the next.  Management was decent but as with most managers, can be better"
good,Working for the Bed Bath and Beyond Distribution Center was a great learning experience for me and the pay was great with lots of overtime opportunities. I learned a variety of new skills and most of my co-workers were great people to be around. Only downside to the company was that some days management was not on there P's and Q's and did not seem to care about increasing production or wanting to be great each and everyday as group and as a company as whole.
good,"Very fast pace environment, kind friendly staff, great pay especially if your a student. Great work and training program.only down side its an at will company."
good,i absolutely loved working here! the only reason i left is because i moved... they teach great customer service skills and how to sell products... i would encourage anyone in the retail field to work here. they teach you great skills you can take with you anywhere.
good,"I love the interaction of different types of people, the good and the bad ones. Learning from every experience that came my way. Just learning to adapt with anything that was thrown at me."
good,Bed Bath And Beyond has a very strong culture of customer service and safety that they take very seriously. They have a great promote from within strategy to identify talent and help develop them into future nanagers/store managers. Overall my experience at this company has been a positive experince.
good,"Many conflicts with upper management that seemed to carry over into the stores causing chaos. "
good,"Overall good work experience, key management team operates well. However, the lack of consistent hours was hard to manage,i need more."
good,"Days at work can vary from because managements moods."
good,"need to have more training for the employees, and all team members should be willing to jelp each other out when needed. there should always be more then on person running the customer service station"
good,"Each day is different yet the same.  Greeting customers, and engaging in conversation while ringing them through the check out.  Making sure their needs are met while answering the phone and sometimes solving other problems that might arise.  I've learned so much about myself and what an incredible multi tasker I am.  My co workers are incredible.  Always dedicated to the customer and putting people first.  They always go above and beyond to make our clients happy.  The hardest part of the job are the hours.  With three kids it's difficult to work varied hours.  A set schedule would be wonderful for planning other activities for myself and to meet my children's needs."
good,Low pay but good people to be around and a good customer service attitude. Pretty good decent management as well. you have to move up in management in order to get paid more.
good,Good interpersonal relationship with co-workers. Working on the floor most of the time. Also greeted customers and took care of their queries. Organize shelves
good,"each day brings in new products to the store as well as many days where one can get a great exercise with all the walking, lifting and day to day training."
good,The opening manager determines the work cadence for  the morning team. What ever is the opening manager's assigned  area of expertise will determine the work flow for the morning hours.
good,Love working here.  Pleasant co workers and management team. Everyone willing to help to get tasks done.  Enjoy helping customers and getting them what they are looking for.
good,"Good starting job, plenty to do to stay occupied, only allows part time work, quick learning possibilities, very flexible with other jobs and or school/home life."
good,"Being paid minimum wage to do way more work than was expected wasn't fun. I was the only associate in my section who was physically able to do ladder work, which there was a lot of. Initially I was told all the stock would be done in the morning before the store even opened, but that wasn't the case. Carrying large, awkward boxes up and down ladders can be really hard. And setting up displays with minimal space is exhausting. "
good,"I think it's a great company. I have had my share of not so nice employees, but overall, I had fun while working there."
good,"keeping the lines down at the register, greeting everyone they walked in and out"
good,"I enjoyed the managment, they really tried to make it a fun place to work. They would have monthly competitions."
good,Very fast paced office: I have had to pleasure of working out of all three locations of this company. I excelled with the experience.
good,"A typical day at work is approaching customers every two songs, asking if they need help, bringing products to the front of the shelf, filling empty spots and putting away the returns. "
good,"Cleaning all day. would have loved to moved up in the company but they always had no advancemets because of thier budget. Wonderful co-worker, every pay day Friday someone will bring lunch. Hardest part when bathroom toliets where stopped up. Loved when the sun went down."
good,great place to work if your in school. good pay but hard to get benefits and full time position. corporate managers act funny with hourly workers. managers are usually young but some are older.
good,i learned something new everyday. The management was not to good. Could have been better. My coworkers were so cool. The hardest part of the job was doing a beyond store sell. The most enjoyable part was meeting each new customer and learning new things.
good,"working for bed bath and beyond...."
good,"daily routine was to greet every customer and offer assistance, maintain a smile, go above company expectation, learn cashier script. very friendly working environment. downfall about this company is that managers don't understand the time order of things just like any other retail company. After helping a customer find product the smile on their face is pure joy."
good,My typical is very busy and active all the time and learn new things every day and I'm willing to learn new things. Management is very up to date and active as well. My co-workers are very friendly and we all work together as a team.I must say I don't have a hardest part of the because through out the day its all about customer service and make sure the leave happy and I don't find that hard to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is going to work and do my job and do it where everyone leave happy....
good,"I have worked there for three years and each year they give you another bogus excuse as to why your getting basically nothing for your yearly raise. Not flexible when it comes to schooling, they expect you to give them every hour of your life."
good,"Fun work environment, with plenty of opportunity to learn different task."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, I learned the aspects of customer service, co workers were great, the hardest part of the job was keeping the customers happy, the most enjoyable is when the customers leave with exactly what they came for."
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond, is to make sure the customers are happy, and satisfied as soon as they walk in the door, and until they leave. We have to keep the overall store in order as well, by recovering, and at night time we do freight. The staff and management is a lot of fun to work with, and they are very accommodating, and willing to train you if your ready to learn something new. Since I have started working at Bed Bath and Beyond I've been trained on the cash register, and almost everything on the Bath and Bedding side of the floor. I have learned a great deal of information, that I plan to take me everywhere I go. The management and the co-workers are one of the best parts at working at Bed Bath and Beyond because they make the place enjoyable. Also, the management is very good about training, they take it seriously if you are willing to learn new things about the job in order to move up in the position. The hardest part about the job is honestly remembering where everything is on the floor that you work on. Since, the floor is so big and we are always getting new products in and sometimes is hard to remember where to put everything, but learning is part of the process of a new job. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the customers satisfied and I love learning new things everyday."
good,"Started off each shift restocking my assigned section of the store all while looking out for customers with whom I provided excellent customer service to immediately no matter what project I was currently doing. I learned a lot about the product in the store, it was vital when trying to upsale the consumer who came to BB&B for a reason, their amazing selection of quality products. The management was the best ive had at any job, they knew the fine line between good managment who inspire productivity and the type of management that no one really likes. I believe it was the nightly team meetings that encouraged employees to feel that we were part of a team. Co workers were awesome they were all nice and very friendly. The hardest part of the job was when we had to do topstock, at any given time you could find yourself on top of a 20 foot ladder with about 70lbs of cooking equipment on your shoulder and you had to lean out and try to put it on top of the topstock, just a little nerve racking. Most enjoyable part of the job was most definitely the team spirit attitude and dealing with the public"
good,Its what you make of it. You can learn from mistakes or you can let the frustrated customers get to you.
good,"very demanding , mostly likable co-workers and managers, loved the physical work."
good,"Setting up registrys, taking orders, answering phones, emailing, assiting customer."
good,Managed nationwide software roll outs.
good,I was hired as a temporary associate working during their wedding season for customers who ordered products online. After wedding season was finished I was laid off.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team with your coworkers and getting to know the different people that come into the store. The hardest part of the job was probably putting up the freight every night.
good,They need to work on attention to work ethic between employees and show more appreciation to hard working honest empmoyees. Not much room for advancement.
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company and have met some very special people.  There is no typical day in retail-it may be ringing a register, placing an order, stocking shelves or helping a couple get their wedding registry set up."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is not a bad company to work for the only problem I had was pay. When the company did pay increase across the board I was not included and never was giving an answer to why I was not included
good,Making advances in the company is hard. I am a good employee and I have tried seven times to advance and were turned down that many times. I work hard and do my best but I don’t feel appreciated.
good,"I enjoyed most of my experience working at Bed Bath and Beyond. When I did have a problem I always knew who I could go to, and I even still keep in touch with them. I did have a problem with a manager, and she was moved to a different store, but she was mean and angry towards customers and coworkers."
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for, but need more pay and growth. The company also needs to have managers willing to embrace the growth. I enjoyed working with the customers."
good,"The job is fairly easy, just answer phones and provide a noticeably better customer service but the lack of promotion and raise is high and if you get termed prior to receiving your raise then they legally don't have to pay you but other than that..good people and their heads are in the right place"
good,I was grateful to work with this company in Texas they allowed me to contribute and help them with everything I could. They were very flexible with scheduling
good,"Good place to work.  Fun, motivational. Management takes employee constructive criticism on policy, procedure and merchandising standards. Overall employee satisfaction rate at work is good."
good,When I walked into work I would always be greeted by other workers with friendly smiles. It was a simple job and it got easier the longer I worked there. Great job and great people.
good,"Great managers and easy to work around your schedule."
good,"1 dollar above the minimum "
good,Customers were friendly and management was decent. Got a promotion within three months of working here. I enjoyed working here and got a lot of support.
good,"it was okay wasnt the greatest experience the way they run things needs to be improved, the bosses are unfair on some workers a lot of favouritism with in the workers and bosses other then that i gained alot of experience from this job"
good,Very great a helping me learn more about the work environment and keeping the work space clean and comfortable for the employees. An amazing opportunity.
good,"The peoplw who work there are amazing, i have only had a problem with one associate but we work civially. flexable with hours. Working on the floor you have to be okay with climbing latters and top stocking heavy items"
good,Benefits are discounts and flexible schedule for important events. Its a typical retail job with more stocking in higher places that require a ladder.
good,Stock every weekday morning. Stay 1 hour after closing for clean-up. Quite busy with weddings and back to University. Christmas has lots of extra hours and everyone knows cash.
good,It's a good place to work and very Laird back. Everyone is friendly and is willing to help out when needed. If I wasn't hired for temporary work I'd be willing to go back to work there.
good,"Training skills"
good,Good place to work. Nice place to start a career and grow easily. Paid training. The work environment  is excellent. The Benefits are good and on point.
good,"When I clocked in I usually grabbed my walkie, did a lap around the store to make sure everything was in place then headed to the front for a store meeting. After that we unlocked the doors, started putting our stock away and checked on any customers that needed help, answered any phone calls and placed orders both in person and over the phone. At the end of my shift I cleaned the bathrooms and went home."
good,They had me working nights and weekends and I couldn't do that with a family any longer. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with and really miss them.
good,Those who I worked with were friendly and easy to work with. They took the time to listen and understand directions. Sometime it was hard to get them motivated to perform tasks without being asked.
good,Fast paced work environment that focuses strongly on customer service and creating a customer experience  . Not any room for advancement the does not do a great job of promoting their people .
good,Could work on inter company communication. There were many situations where things occurred and the employees of the company were blindsided by the changes.
good,Is helping people around the store and also me learning new things from other people around me. And also satisfy the customers making them smile and  happy.
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a well-established company formulated with a day by day detailed routine.  Working with different personalities made it easier to comprehend the different types of ideas we can offer to help improve the company.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a good environment to work in. It attracts good, genuine workers; However, I think employees do much more work than they are paid for and the company is stingy with raises and promotions."
good,"Typical day would be clocking in 2 hours before opening and helping stock shelves, then once store opened help customers on floor then be called up as back up as cashier during rushes."
good,This business is fast paces and CS and sales oriented. Can get stressful around Christmas ect. but generally a good place to work with friendly coworkers. Its hard to get a raise and hard to move up the corporate level has restrictions on hours for employees and its tough to get approved to Full time unless you're going to be a Department Manager. A lot of people who work there have been there for several years but the pay it the worst draw back.
good,"Worked shy of 4years, loved the workers."
good,"I remember the store I worked at never had a slow day unless it rained or snowed. I started as a cashier and I got hired close to thanksgiving so it was busy the people I worked with really knew what they were doing because any problem was handled quick by a manager and transactions at the registers were quick and handled with care. But when I started to work on the floor I dealt with customers up close and personal helping them with looking for items, comparing items so that I could get them the best deal possible. The customers were friendly and so were my fellow associates by the end of the day it was a great experience."
good,I would recommend the job because it is definitely a good place to start off work as a first time job. The system is easy to understand and the team members are all like family to one another.
good,"The store itself is nice, and the quality of their merchandise is usually above par. Work-life balance is pretty reasonable, and the tasks required of employees are always easy enough to complete. The logging system for top-stock is somewhat organized. Management is okay, they are sometimes hard to get along with but will still get things done that are required."
good,"Friendly co-works and managers, if I needed anything they were kind enough to help. Store was always clean and the environment was good. Working there was never stressful and I enjoyed my job a lot."
good,typical day of working involves picking specific items and putting them into a specific boxes and are moved to a specific location. it a temperature control environment and the human resources department are people friendly.
good,A typical day is normally taking care of customers and recovering the shelves to make it look nice. I've learned how to handle customers with all types of attitudes as well as being cordial with coworkers whether or not I like them personally. Management has been all over the place because I have worked under several different managers and assistant managers. My previous manager was very controlling and loved to micromanage so I never felt like I could learn how to do things myself as much as I could have. The hardest part of my job was my previous store manager. His attitude and the way he ran things made it really hard to enjoy coming to work. The most enjoyable part was definitely my relationship with the majority of my coworkers as well as my relationships I developed with some of my brides.
good,"Typical Day: Consist of customer service, daily training on product and services, freight put away and put back merchandise. "
good,"A typical day in my position at Bed Bath and Beyond included unloading freight, stocking inventory, and assisting customers with their needs. "
good,It is a great place to work however management is switched out quiet often. The employees are great but communication for projects and in general needs improvement.
good,"I was cross-trained to stock and also do the register. Seemed that I was constantly being pulled between different sides of the store. Meanwhile, it was a wonder why I wasn't able to get some things done faster to some of the managers. I liked that it kept you busy, and I liked the team. Seemed to me that this place runs well."
good,"I had a mediocre experience here. I liked working here but I didn't like stocking, replenishment, and folding towels for 8 hours straight until my hands cracked and bleed because they got so dried out. Definitely not a place to work if you have back problems, there is a lot of lifting and bending and standing/walking involved. I signed up for a cashier position but ended up stocking 95% of the time. The manager was nice but they were going to make me pump my breast milk in the bathroom which is not right. They made me pump and eat my lunch at the same time. It was also all about competition among other stores and people in the work area."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with amazing people. A typical day at work is learning and trying new things to do and also showing people how to do things they don’t know that you know.
good,"When working with this many people, it is good to have rules and regulations that everyone can adhere to. Some managers are more strict than others, but everyone is on the same page."
good,I was a sales floor associate. I was in charge of making sales on the sales floor and also making sure the floor was fully stocked for all of the product that we had.
good,"Very fast paced work place, employees very helpful and friendly. Management team not always on the same page. Opportunity to be promoted into diffrent departments."
good,"Good part time job for a student or elderly individual.  Not for someone looking to advance professionally, necessarily.  Not a huge area for that.  Nighttime hours were awful, store was open late. Not alot of opportunity to collaborate."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun place to work. All employees work as part of a team and are willing to help whenever needed. Employees are always friendly and the customer service is outstanding.
good,Working here is great it comes withe great benefits and compensation. The team is very supportive and will help train new employees very well. They are always open to feed back. Overall good experience.
good,"Great place to work "
good,"Good place to work if you like household items like linens and bathroom outfitting. Decent hours, good departments, great teams to work with. Awesome employee discounts."
good,Fast paced place to work. The most enjoyable part about the job is dealing with customers and helping them find what they are looking for.  I have learned a lot of product information to pass along to the customers.
good,"A fun, quick-paced job with multiple opportunities for advancement. Started out as a part time employee but continuously requested more hours and took over shifts for other people, and after two months was promoted to Inventory Control. After six months of IC, I was promoted to Customer Service Manager. Hard work offers you the opportunity to move up in store."
good,"I enjoyed the contact with public. Atmosphere was usually pleasant, but fast paced and demanding on employees.  Many interruptions of assigned duties to help at cash registers. Managers were accessible, hands-on and working right along with the other employees. Learned a great deal about retail sales and working with a large team of people compared to past working experiences."
good,Hours change often and the pay is low with little room for improvement. The manager is fair and requires a professional work environment. Some heavy lifting.
good,It would be a great place to work if the company hired leading managers instead of behind the desk managers who don't want to work. Don't over work employees just to meet your numbers.
good,My typical day at work is scheduled tasks that my manager set or tasks that I set for myself to do throughout my shift. This job taught me great customer service skills and how to handle difficul situations. I management at my store is good but can always use improvements.
good,"Every shift I found was always busy and I had plenty opportunities to learn new things about BB&B. The management was poor, I noticed a lo of inconsistency with the employees and managers which was stressful on busy days where we were short staffed. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this store."
good,It was a good job and easy for the most part. Everybody who worked there was easy to get along with. I was just a temporary job for me. They are all about the customer.
good,"I appreciate the opportunity Bed, Bath and Beyond gave me! I was hired on the spot, by a team of great managers. They worked with my school schedule and allowed me to pick my hours; which was awesome. The coworkers there are like a family, if you need anything they’re there to lend a hand. The dress code for this store was jeans and a top during the week, and dress pants and blouse on weekends. You also get a 20% off employee discount! However their will always be a rude customer here and there as well as it can be stressful at some times. But I would recommend this job! "
good,Lot of opportunities to learn and improve development skills as there is always work load. Good opportunity to implement latest technologies and explore new features.
good,"Works around other job/school schedules. Co-workers and management all very easy to get along with. Training provided for store products, you'll learn everything you need to know to sell the best product for the customer."
good,"At typical day at work: We had truck everyday and replenished all day and every night. The department manager must have multiple and daily walk-throughs to keep the store picture perfect. I've learned a lot about products knowledge; an employee should've been able to educate any customer of any item in the store to convince him or her to purchase it, which was also beneficial to us. We also learned about merchandising, bridal registry, ordering, and much more. Workplace Culture: It was a bit hectic to socialize with each other even during breaks because we'd always be too tired or hungry, or breaks seemed short. the salary employees were paid Chinese overtime after 50 hours. I liked the company's yearly raises and boxes of chocolate  during Valentine's day, the employee discount, and the exclusive merchandise discount."
good,"It's a nice place to work, they were really flexible with my schedule while taking classes. Starting pay was $10 per hour which is okay, but not competitive for the area. Similar stores are starting employees at $11, which is probably why it is so understaffed. "
good,"When working for this company most positions are part time. If this is your only source of income and need to live off of the income you make here then you will not be able to survive. Hours and schedule are very inconsistent. Some weeks I can have 25 hours and some weeks I could have 16. If your availability is open they will schedule you wherever. You will definitely work at least one weekend day because weekends are busier days for retail. I did like that you get a 45 minute lunch which was a nice transition from a 30 minute lunch that I used to get at my job before this one. You do accrue sick time each paycheck I believe but it’s not a lot and they don’t pay you out for it when you resign if you haven’t used it all up prior to leaving. They are really great at accommodating your school schedule or work schedule for those people who work 2 or more jobs. You will work pretty much every function they have except for leader roles unless you are a lead or management of course. Some days I would work in receiving, stockroom, morning freight crew to even helping out on the sales floor assisting customers to even helping up front on the registers. You have opportunities to be a part of the inventory team each year and get more hours for 4 weeks. When working inventory it is all overnight shifts and you driving your own car to multiple locations every night. You do get paid for mileage and gas. For some locations the company will provide you a hotel but that is not guaranteed for every location. I think this job is best suited for teenagers looking for their first job to gain experience,"
good,I enjoyed all of the customers and you can build a bond with them to make them want to shop there more. I was an email representative and enjoyed the emails back and forth and being able to get to know people.
good,"Did not allow us to get benefits. Usually when you were put in a certain position, you were stuck in that position the whole time you worked. The people were fun to work with, but they did not keep it interesting enough."
good,Work hard for very little and slow promotions. There wasn't much room for growth with the company. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep associates.
good,It’s a good job that has a good work environment for employees. Management is stupid however with new rules and schedule it’s turning into a laughingstock where no one wants to work
good,I worked her during college and they were great about working around my class schedule but there is very little room for advancement. Management is fair but was told it was my responsibility to request a review each year in order to seek a yearly increase.
good,"-Day would always start with all clocking-in employees being huddled up and informed about the their daily tasks and what the daily budget, safety and customer standards were."
good,"Loved that I was always able to reach for a higher position.  Managers were always willing and able to take time to teach me new things in order to better ourselves,"
good,"A typical day is helping customers and engaging by suggestive selling and interacting during transactions. The hardest part of the job may be to deal with angry customers, but if you are able to sympathize and understand it will be just fine."
good,I like to work there because the manages and the staff are really nice. They took care of me when I was in college by matching study scheduler especially during my finals.
good,"Great working here. Good job culture and environment. Friendly colleagues. Had a great time working at bed bath and beyond, Union, New Jersey, U.S.A ."
good,Bed bath and beyondo has a flexible schedule and easy job. Sometimes it is a lot of work but never something that can not be done. They are understanding at times but other than that is it easy.
good,"I was able to advance within the company and yet my pay did not go up with the promotion, it was a fun work environment but there seemed to be some immaturity within the staff as in people not calling in to work when they were sick so it was a hassle finding someone to cover a shift.We were given incentives every month which was nice."
good,"This was a great opportunity for growth and development in customer service. The best support and family driven, its a big family of coworkers who support one another. The process or training and promotion needs improvement. But over all a great learning experience."
good,Very fast paced. Always in a hurry for everything. It was competitive with other coworkers. Managers were always on the coworkers. Very nice coworkers that you could become like a big family.
good,You are on your feet all day and you are required to climb up and down ladders on a regular basis. Upper management is not in check with how a store really operates. They give long lists of things that need to be done without consideration to how much face to face customer service is actually required.
good,"The whole company is behind the times ... Need to update software and the plan of action "
good,"I enjoyed working here mainly because of my coworkers. The store is nice and the job can be easy or difficult depending on your product knowledge skills. Customer service skills are definitely something you need to work here. Part time, schedule every 2 weeks, nice bosses. They were usually willing to work with you if you have any issues."
good,"The employees I worked with were always willing to help when needed. The management never undermined other employees, and was always welcoming whenever help or assistance was needed."
good,"Working at BB& B can be difficult  depend on the flow of business ad numbers of employees on hand, Obtaining help from the floor depends on availability of associates one to be in position and length of time it takes to respond.  Making completion of orders longer and stressful for customer and cashier. This location of the store has a strong New  York influence and can make customer handling more of a challenge. The hardest part of the job is the inability to prevent long waits in line causing more stress to the customers and resulting in extra conflict with the customer. Management takes measure to pull people from other ares of the store  but that further prevents coordination with store associates. I enjoy contact with customers and in our store you meet all kinds of people, Yes it can be stressful but you have to deal with that a lot in life."
good,"Get in early, to put away too much stuff with some help.  There's always something to do so time goes by fast. Worst part is the rude/ignorant customers. Best part is the co workers."
good,I started at $10 an hour entry level.  The managers are professional and incredibly efficient at their job.  Workplace culture depends on all employees and are expected to carry your weight.
good,"I feel that it is a great job to work and very nice people but I also feel for most people there’s no way to move up in the company unless you’ve been in there for 10 years plus , you get less than a $.25 raise every year and living in New York it’s not possible to make a living off of A biweeky check but other than that it’s a great work environment"
good,Worked there more than 6 years.  Was able to get promoted within company and move up based on hard work.  Left job to find work outside of retail organization
good,"Although at times shifts got long because not many customers were coming in, Bed Bath and Beyond has a cooperative environment that wasn’t very competitive. Everyone was trying to help each other out and there was a healthy work environment."
good,"many departments to work in and learn about, get to learn about amazing products and also have discounted prices on make up and a great employee discount"
good,the work was good. I wasn't always supervised. the managers could try to work together more. their schedules are way off. barely any time/ hours. haven't gotten a schedule in about 3 or 4 months. But yes I still work there.
good,"Constant movement and communication with trainers, managers, and corporate. Main focus of this position is the new hires and onboarding of all systems and providing the hardware for the trainees as well as the floor."
good,Pay isn't great compared to other stores at a similar level hours are good they have a good amount for part timers. Management is ok however very corporate not many things can be changed at the store level very policy oriented. Overall a positive experience but some things can be annoying. Leaving for more $.
good,"•	Work closely with engineers and senior technicians to communicate problems encountered and implement temporary and permanent corrective actions"
good,"Fun environment, good teamwork, management was always pretty flexible with my school hours and tried to schedule me to fit around that rather than the other way around."
good,There's always something to do.  Sometimes too many things.  Customers come first before tasks.  It's fun and can be a bit overwhelming.  Not for people who like to stand around do nothing.
good,"A changing work environment is enveloping the Company as a result of stress and pressure from online retailers.  The urgency to remain relevant as a financially and culturally viable retailer is primordial.  However, change is encumbered and hindered by the traditional sense of doing business and change seems to be randomly directed, lacking a true focus on addressing base issues.  This has led to straining its already dwindling human resources, to half-baked efforts to maintain the store, and the lack of customer servicing on the sales floor."
good,"The company is decent to work for, standard benefits. If you can get over living in NJ, I would recommend working here because there in room for growth."
good,"I enjoyed working at bb@b. its not the job for you if you don't like ladders tho, lol. it was a good job and they had lots of training classes to keep you informed on products."
good,"Its easy to get along with everybody, management is really understanding with school, and is able to work with your school schedule. They are understanding that students are a part time."
good,"I enjoy working for the company, unfortunately, it's too bad that I can't live on the wage that I am earning.I enjoy the compliments and helping customers with their coupons and saving money as well as going the extra mile for them and they appreciate that."
good,They where kind to their employees and the customers. They had good hours. their pay rate was really low but the company is a good company to be part of
good,"It was a basic job, checking customers out, and making sure products looked neat. Schedule was always random yet i mostly worked nights. Good for someone who likes customer service."
good,I did the work I was asked and I wasn't stressed out about it. not that I got to take breaks while not on break but the work wasn't too taxing on my body unlike some jobs.
good,They really prepare their employees to sell the products. It is just a run of the mill basic hourly job that doesn't pay much otherwise. They are nice to their employees but don't offer much else.
good,It is a professional environment kept well organized and safe by the employees daily. The management is great and very helpful for every problem and tasks.
good,At my time here I was the front end lead. I was responsible for facilitating customer questions to the respective associates. The best part of it was seeing customers from different walks of life.
good,"I have met a lot of nice people while being here, and it is a fun environment to work in. It teaches marketing and sales skills as well. I would recommend this job to anybody"
good,employees are empowered to help drive results. their input is heard by upper management and often implemented. flexible hours are available and training is very helpful
good,"There's not much to say. I love my coworkers and the managers are good in my store, but it takes too long to advance anywhere. The managers constantly plan to train you in different things. For some of my coworkers, this goes along to plan, but, for many of us, it gets pushed off due to said employee being needed to stay where they're at. The managers expect a great deal from the lead cashiers to the point that it's highly stressful. The reason the rating is so good is because my coworkers are amazing."
good,The job is great if your looking for a low income job that is flexible with your schedule.It is great for any young person looking to get hired for their first job.
good,"Checked out customers and stocked shelves, assisted customers who were in need of help wit specific items, i learned about certain products that were better than those in other places and found that educating to not only the customer but me as well"
good,very fast pace. I have worked every dept of this store can work all area of the store and have learned to manage my time.Learned how to create a Bridal registry as well as assisted at a bridal event.Hardest part of the job was having to be taken away from my job to do someone elses and not having that in return.
good,"Fast paced, it will certainly take you out of your comfort zone. This is a place for you if you are willing to work independently and use your abilities."
good,"I worked at Bed Bath & Beyond on two separate times in my life.  The first time I was employed I was the Office Manager, I helped open several locations in Michigan, however at that time I was working 50-60 hours a week for a salaried position.  They have since changed the way the pay managers.  The second time of employment was as an hourly associate part time.  I enjoyed the fact that you were busy."
good,Depending on the day its fast paced and busy. I like working there just some employees are not as friendly. Customers are nice sometimes but some can be annoying.
good,"I learning a lot, it was my first department store job so the learning curb took a while but once I got the ball rolling it was fun times. The hardest part was climbing on the ladders because I'm scared of heights."
good,Really enjoyed working here just didn’t like my pay nor my scheduled hours. Felt like I️ worked my bit off each day and there was really nothing to show for it pay wise.
good,A very great place to work with flexible hours. Their are managers for every department which also makes things a lot more easier for other staff and employees.
good,working with the public helping them redecorate their homes was fun and exciting. I learned about household items which ones are good and bad. The hardest part of the job is working on holidays because of being in retail
good,"At Bed Bath and Beyond I've had the opportunity to exercise patients and better customer service. Anyone can answer a question, but its important to hear the need of the consumer, show concern and interest as well as your knowledge on the topic/item. "
good,"I've worked for over 15 years with BBB and only recently have a really felt like this company was going in the wrong direction.  It used to be fun, and now it's just stressful for the majority of it's employees.  You do everything, not like just a cashier or stock or sales.  Our receiving dept rings on a register if we need them... hard work, but doesn't pay accordingly anymore."
good,Fun place to work. Great discounts on merchandise. Various roles within the organization. Room to develop. Great learning opportunity.  Enjoyed atmosphere.
good,"greeted customers when they came into the building"
good,this was my second job at 16 and i thought it fit me well. it set me up with many valuable skills that i will carry on for the rest of my life. i would recommend working here
good,"Great discount of 20%.  Managementwas ok, learned physical labor, we put in way too many hours.  THey let us off at 3 am  and expected me in at 8 am the next morning"
good,"I like to work at BBB, I'm not quitting, just need more hours different enviromment, I would like keep working there and a different place. I would recommend this job for friends and collegues"
good,this was my very first job and i will be forver grateful and humble for this reason i learned how to handle cash i learned customer services skills through training and i learned how to be a cashier
good,"Properly ordering, assorting, and presenting all departments within the store.              "
good,"Only bad thing about this job is the awful customers that come in, but overall good work experience with good managers and good pay. Hours are very flexible and they take your life outside of work into consideration. I started working there in high school, and when I went to college they allowed me to come back during my breaks from school."
good,"To be honest, Bed Bath and Beyond got amazing benefits!!! Their very hands on, and they don't mind teaching!!! The only problem I would have to say is the time that we clock in and out on a regular work day!!!"
good,"I never really had a problem working for the company. Just had an awful experience with a manager, and lack of advancement and pay opportunities. The co workers were always decent people to work with, and our customers were mostly friendly and appreciative of our work."
good,Good place to work. Requires hard work and dedication. Enjoyed working with customers and training new employees. Very rewarding when your trainees get promoted
good,"Typical day at work consisted of learning about a new product, classes every month, safety/sale reviews, fixing store, balancing cash register & the floor."
good,"I enjoy working at the location that I am in, the downside is that their is a high turn over rate which means that we are understaff sometimes, leaving the remaining associates forced to pick up the slack."
good,"I have enjoyed my time working for BBB. It is mostly taking care of customers, recovering, making online orders for our customers and restocking items."
good,I say a good starting job because its not a place you would want to get stuck in. Its a good start to basically learn the ropes and get a good feel of how an 8 hour shift is going to go in most places.
good,"Coworkers are nice. Management is respectable. As far as retail goes, BB&B is one of the better places to work for. The hours are flexible and vacation time is generous."
good,Great company when it comes to customer service. The people you work with are all fantastic for the most part. The only gripe I would have is the hours will sometimes be out of your favor if you are a part time worker. But other than that it is a great place to work.
good,Fairly good working environment. I enjoy working my co-workers. At times it can be overwhelming depending on the task at hand and the amount of time given to work on said task.
good,"It has its good and bad days depending on how the managers are feeling, if they are in a bad mood then everyone will have a bad day if you let them get to them, some days its really fun working due to everyone cracking jokes with each other but it just depends on the manager working there, some managers will get on your case with everything like if you don't know how to do your job even if the person who is getting harped on has been working there for years. Sometimes it feels like the managers picks favorites in the store."
good,"You learn a lot working at bed bath and beyond, but the pay is not too good. Sometimes you do things that is not your position to do, but you get introduced to it."
good,"When I worked there, they were very flexible with scheduling, friendly environment, I was able to promote, positive feedback and work with you on training to ensure you knew your job well."
good,They are not bad but do not treat associates equally at all . Have everyone a rake excep is office clerks and ic . Will pick and choose who the rules apply to.
good,"Typical retail but big on customer service, constant product training. Very helpful employees and management. I'd definitely consider working here again."
good,Great atmosphere. And great people. I would recommend job to others. The management always gives alot of hours and they are really nice to their staff.
good,My work days are always a surprise. Every day brought something different and I was able to learn new aspects of the store. I learned how to listen to customers about their needs and concerns and be able to find a solution. Management ranged from micromanagement to very hands off. They either were very detailed oriented or would give a task and see how you interpreted the task. I worked in a very fast paced environment. If I wasn't helping customers I was busy filling empty shelves with products or reorganizing backstock. The hardest part of the job was if I ever needed a shift change my coworkers seemed unresponsive. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I'd get a new bridal couple and we just finished creating their registry and the look of relief on the couples face was so rewarding. That look represented one more task the couple could cross off their wedding to-do list and it was awesome to be able to be a part of that process.
good,Great company with opportunity of flexible schedule to attend school and work. Very fast paced during busy days but very easy to handle. Every associate was friendly with customers and each other.
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing optimal customer service, maintaining store quality, executing merchandise presentation, and implementing product knowledge. As a registry consultant, creating and managing various registry types may also be part of a typical workday."
good,"I worked as a cashier on the front end of the store. I was quickly appointed to customer service due to exemplary performance. However, even though I performed well at the job, all cashiers were treated differently by the employees and management in other departments. I was often condescended for asking simple questions like where something was located in order to assist a customer. You're usually forced to ask over a walkie talkie which can be heard by every employee throughout the store, because as a cashier you are obligated to remain at your register to assist customers. I could not tolerate the disrespect, particularly when it was made public to every other employee in the building. "
good,"I worked in the receiving dept. it was a good job, workplace is relaxed and management was helpful, for the most part. good benefits and good discounts."
good,"this is a good place to work have good distribution center and good benefits for the employees "
good,went in at 3:15pm until 1:45am sun-thurs I was a picker. hardest part was driving to jefferson and the hours I worked becuse soon as I wake up I had to be back at work the pay was ok (11.00) and it involved a lot walking had the be above 70% by end of night
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond has a great attitude towards their employees.  They are empathetic to any problems that their employees may face within the company.  However, they do not have many full-time options for custodial work."
good,"The culture at Bed Bath and Beyond is Customer service, safety and our people . At Bed Bath and Beyond you learn how important customer service is, while making sure your working in a safe and friendly environment. Bed Bath and Beyond cares about their people."
good,this place taught me how to deal with different kind of people and i thank it for that. some managers were nice others not so much but that comes with every job
good,A good company to work for they truly Believe in making sure every associate knows the benefits of the features of every product they hit their floor and that will leave any company to soar.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to work as a summer college student looking to make money while home.  The people are nice and the atmosphere is fun.
good,standard job of selling and providing customer service. easy days and long nights. can get a little overwhelming at times with the amount of stock and busy holidays.
good,"The job is good but inconsistent hours every week (unless you work full-time) and not enough training on the floor, we had days when we were very understaffed."
good,Easy place to work for a part time job. Great while attending school. Were always accommodating with school schedule while in college. Taught the basics on products.
good,Very laid back work environment. Almost too laid back where it felt like the sacrifices the employees would make would ever be acknowledged nor appreciated.
good,"decent place for a college person or maybe even high school depending on age. they don't pay very well, but most of the people there are fun to work with."
good,"It gave me the tools I needed in order to get work experience. Though there were some days I dreaded working long shifts with no breaks, I overall enjoyed my experience as an employee."
good,"Clock in, go to your desk see what task you have to complete around the store. Put up merchandise, and help customers. I learned how to talk to people more. Management is ok could be rude."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond has created a focused culture of Customer Service over the years and seeks to continue it into the future. They use large company resources and a neighborhood feel to meet customer needs in store and online.
good,"As time has gone by of me working at Bed Bath and Beyond I've learned about the different safety tips and importance to what retail is really about. Working at Bed Bath and Beyond I've learned the difference from a duvet color and a sheet, why the thread count on sheets are so important, and what certain tools and objects in our everyday lives are so important. Much like other stores not every item is sold in store. I've learned how to do online orders which helped me with my computer skills and the process of doing online orders and shipments outside of the store location itself. The culture within this environment is very diverse. I've seen Russian, oriental, Indian, white, and even black people walk in our store as a customer and employee. One of the toughest parts of this job would have to be trying to make sure that every customer leaves the store satisfied as well as trying to complete one task at a time when you have tons of customers asking for your assistance all at once. Lastly on part of the joy that can be very enjoyable is the wonderful people that you meet at this job you make a lot of connections and you get to network a lot when you even communicate with customers as well not just the employees."
good,"I was hired here on my 16th birthday and remained with them through very instrumental and influential years. They gave me the foundation and tools for everything I know about not only working in retail, but personable relation communication skills that cannot be taught from a book but only gained through experience."
good,"My first job as a cashier and I couldn't be any happier. The management was awesome. We was a little family , if anyone needed help it was never a problem to help or ask for help. Pretty great job !"
good,"This was my first ""real"" job. I started as a cashier and worked my way to a management key holder within 2 years. The people who work at this store are all friends and get along really well. The employees get the job done and have fun while doing so."
good,"Working here is a great experience  especially for students,they work with your  School schedule,the team is lovely and everyone works as a team even if it's just helping a customer"
good,"every day something new , learn something new, I really like that job it was just the place it self , I would work there again , management is ok but they can do better"
good,"hi, never faced a typical or hard days at work place or with the team"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company because it was a very fast paced environment, I would recommend this to many people! Great hours with good pay"
good,The company was fair on the pay. The company was stable and the hours were good. The management was good and organized and carried nice merchandise.
good,"My experience at Bed, Bath & Beyond was great. The people there are super friendly and helpful. They helped me every step of the way. I would do it again."
good,"On a typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond I would be responsible for taking care of customers, merchandising, Bridal registries, and product knowledge. There was never a dull moment in my career with Bed Bath and Beyond."
good,Really don't like how they don't care about they're employees they don't give praise when do or give u yoUr required raise after 6 months very hard work place
good,"got the work in every department of the store and widen my knowledge, and also helped me gain experience with customer satisfaction. Also was a great part time job when i was in college"
good,Wonder ful place to work. Everyone was knowledgeable and fun to work with. The autmosphere and culture were remarkable
good,"While I was working at Bed Bath and Beyond, I was the front end supervisor. As the front end I was in charge of all of the cashiers, the registers, the customer service and all of the returns that would come through during my shift. Now at the close of my shift i was in charge of balancing all of the registers too the right amount. While I also would be in charge of doing the daily deposit of sales cash into the ""bank"". While I was working on the daily deposit my manager would be closing the rest of the store. The management at Bed Bath and Beyond was great just had a hard time, sometimes with the employees who worked on the floor. As so did I as i was the front end supervisor. Yet over all I did enjoy working at bed Bath and Beyond."
good,Productive and fun workplace company to work in. Would recommend anyone to work at this company. Good company to start in with well-balanced work and life.
good,"Able to use math calculation."
good,The store is always packed with customers and can be stressful. Quality customer service and patience is needed for this job. Maintaining displays and merchandising are done once customer service is done. The hardest part of the job is juggling all the tasks.
good,"They were willing to work with my schedule. A typical day at work was easy and organized. I learned how to build registries in the bridal department, and ladder safety. The people I worked with were wonderful, I never had a problem with any of my coworkers. Management could've been more organized, and communicated more often. The hardest part was taking the security tags off items/product. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my coworkers and customers, especially helping brides make registries and walk around the store."
good,"very professional management, I was able to learn a lot , and they always took the time to make sure I understood my job title,  I was able to move up quickly, however after a while the staff became quite negligent of their duties."
good,A very professional environment. Exercises both Waterfall and Agile methodologies. I learned a lot about merging with another company from a technical point of view.
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was a positive experience. Besides them not being able to work with my school schedule, it contained a positive group of people along with a good system of management."
good,Its a good company to be with. People will love the company when they join. People are good and cooperative. You wont be disappointed after joining.
good,This store has great training that is ongoing as the newer product comes in. Having product knowledge makes it fun to interact with customers.
good,I spent most of my time training cashiers. These reviews are getting ridiculous. All I want to do is place my resume on here. I really don't understand the importance of this.
good,"We receive the merchandise every night, and lay out a plan to systematically sock the sales floor in accordance with the current promotions expectations. As a team we pay plenty of attention to detail to maximize the customer's shopping experience."
good,"A typical day starts with tasks being lined out and given and maintaining constant communication with associates and management until tasks are completed.  Along with learning invaluable customer service skills, I procured knowledge in placing orders, creating schedules, and good organization skills for work and personal life.  Co-workers were great to be around as well as the management, with the exception of a couple bad apples here and there. Dealing with the occasional difficult customer was the hardest part of the job, but everything else within the workplace i enjoyed an appreciated."
good,Typical day at work is busy. I learned a lot. I like management. Good co workers. Hard part of the job is unloading trucks. Enjoyable part of the job is sales / talking with customers.
good,"Showing customers where to find products"
good,"Always above average,exceeds expectations. Leads by example.  Goes above and beyond.  Enjoy working there, just looking for something different."
good,This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company.I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive.
good,"The best part are the coworker are good personel."
good,I helped with training the employees and assist with designing the window treatments. Great benefits. But not enough pay for the employees to stand on.
good,My time here at Bed Bath and Beyond was amazing because it was the over night crew that prepared the store each and every night for a new business day.
good,"Company has continued to grow and expand into new divisions.  "
good,"a typical day helping customers prepare for marriage. i learned about yankee candles , the thread of sheets towels and hand cloths. I enjoyed my management team they all helped one another and gave great advice. I don't believe any part of my job was hard , it was a great experience and i'd love to do it again."
good,Weekends were busy but the job was pretty much fun to me until I had to attend school as a full time student. The best part about it was being at the register because I like to play with numbers.
good,"Helping maintain a clean store as well as helping all customers in a timely manor along side being able to work registers as needed."
good,"Very fun environment"
good,"Every now and then I'd be on the cash register. Most days I'd work in the bath and bed areas. I would help customers find the items they were looking for, do online orders, restock and make sure everything was in the right place. I learned how to handle customers. I loved my coworkers. Working there gave me lifelong friendships. The hardest part of the job was when customers would get angry over things that I had no control over. I'd handle it well, but it would be difficult. The most enjoyable part was probably being able to work with such great people."
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond included opening or closing duties, assisting customers with bridal registries and stocking the sales floor.  I learned how to solve problems with co-workers and customers in a positive manor.  There was a big range in the quality on management.  One of them was very disrespectful to employees, but most of them were very hard working and gave appropriate feedback and training to employees.  Most of my co-workers were great and communicated well with me about what was happening that day in the department I was assigned to work in before leaving for the day.  The more you work as a team, the better your experience will be!  The hardest part of the job was climbing 12 foot ladders and retrieving or storing merchandise in top stock.  After doing this for years, I still got nervous!  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the regular customers find items for their homes.  Once you get to know them it is so rewarding when you learn their styles and preferences."
good,Customer service oriented company and very fast paced  which I enjoy I learned that I have way more energy than most people.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a fast paced, always changing environment that makes the day fly by. All in all good people. A team driven business."
good,"-A typical day for a sales associate would be to stock shelves in the morning with replenishment from the previous days sales. Continue with minor floor projects such as changing of displays. After the morning activities you would focus on customer service, assisting customers on the sales floor and as well as help customers with a speedy check out by getting on a register. Maintaining the sales floor by cleaning up messes, adjusting products on shelves is something that is done through out the day. "
good,"go in and do daily routines which included: cashiering, re-stocking  the shelves, departments, and customer service. Learned patience on understanding others and their opinions"
good,"*daily tasks given and expected to get done by the end of your shift."
good,This is a great job for a college student looking for part time work.  Flexible hours to fit around your school schedule. Friendly environment.
good,"With this job i learned how to do shipping & receiving, and very good customer service so i am very thankful for the experience"
good,"Fun fast place to work. All employees and management were friendly kind and helpful. it was more like a family environment. Top stocking was the hardest part of the job, and so were the holidays but overall work atmosphere was awesome."
good,"I enjoy working and helping others when situations take place coming up with a game plan."
good,"The customers are a joy to serve on a daily basis.  Of course, there is always one or two whom are difficult, but most are easily persuaded to be positive."
good,good work environment..Always something different to do and giving the different style of customers an excellent and exciting experience that they normally dont get at other stores.
good,"wide range of products and product knowledge with excellent customer service. great workmates and quality products, benefits."
good,start as a call center rep and work your way up to manager or supervisor. if they keep you there. i was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work there. promoted to team lead. pay was good in the beginning and you are given a raise based on your performance
good,I love my job at Bed Bath and Beyond. The issue is not the job the issue is that they work on a hourly system for the year. It is the end of the year and almost Christmas. I am a single mom trying to get back on her feet after a divorce. It's not enough to help me in my life right now. I have nothing bad to say. The people are great and the customers are great.
good,"➢	Work directly with management to promote customer services and maximize sales "
good,"Specs given are considered just guides, you get to be yourself and have your own opinion."
good,All the time you spend away from family makes it hard. The no weekends off unless you are on vacation than only one allowed.
good,Quality company enjoyed the environment and I would work there again.Friendly atmosphere as well as competent managers
good,"It is a good student job for the pay and you do meet good people. High turnover rate though. New management in Athens, Georgia seems to be rude and unprofessional at times"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great job to obtain, especially if it is your first job or you are going to school. They were great about working out scheduling."
good,I enjoyed my work enviorment and the flexibility to be able to attend school while working.   I started the job while in high school and continued my employment through college.
good,Working in retail prior to this job I found working here similar to other retail positions. I learned a lot about the true meaning of customer service.
good,Friendly environment where co-workers and managers will provide help for any questions that appear. Climbing ladders every day can present many challenges.
good,"I made great friends, and enjoyed the variety of projects and helping people find what they're looking for. Every day is different and there's always something to learn."
good,Working until closing is the worst. You have stay until the entire store is clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was having people return product thats had been throughly used and claiming that its breaking.
good,"Super fun place to work, family environment.  Work is a challenge but worth it.  Downfall was retail hours working over night, but that is what is expected, especially during the holiday season."
good,I had the honor of learning how to sell our merchandise to the customers. Working there was a great experience for me because it helped me enhance my sales and customer service skills.
good,"A typical day at work is to make sure all freight and replenishment is worked through, and work on any projects that are assigned. The main goal is to welcome customers and make sure all is satisfied. I learned how to make use and manage space, because there is a lot of things that has to be top stocked and very little space. The management are cool, they try to do the best they can. The hardest part can be getting to every customer on a timely manner, because sometimes it can get really busy, and everyone usually gets tied up at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can leave the customer satisfied and appreciative of your help."
good,You can find more specialty items then in other locations. Brides can complete registries to help get items for their new homes.
good,"You will give supervisory assistance to the daily administration of company’s operations and such hiring and firing of individuals, constructing work schedules as well as finalizing sales transactions."
good,"I enjoyed this job because it allowed me to help people with things they need efficiently because that's what I like to do, it gives me a sense of accomplishment. This was not a difficult job because I enjoyed doing it and your constantly learning new things and new products and services."
good,"Great place to work and wonderful co-workers. Management could learn how to better treat their employees. Not a very organized place to work, not enough space for all of the product in the store."
good,People are nice at work. Typical day would be helping every customer you see and merchandising at the same time. You help couple's with building gift registries and also help people buy gifts.
good,Good company to get knowledge of retail and customer service experience. Product knowledge was a must and their was always healthy employee competition which was fun. The real drawback was the low compensation which was to be expected for a retail job and lack of benefits or hours.
good,"Depends on the shift, for a manager which is the position I held, I would start with any morning paperwork, filing, printing and pulling old promotions or hanging new promotions.  Opening the main system and the registers.  Organizing the freight team for the day with their plan, hold a staff meeting in the morning to cover new procedures, new products and game plans for the day.  Open the back for the receiver to start receiving trucks for the day.  Monitor customer service levels in the store as well as productivity levels and reassess if changes needed to be made as far as staffing. We are required to learn the basics of selling/up selling and product knowledge.  The differences between the products and be able to operate the product it's self.  The management works long hours, required 45 hours a week minimum.  The associates work at several different levels.  Floor associates have a little more flexibility as far as extra assistance on the floor.  You typically have more coverage to get stuff done, than anywhere else.  All though on some days, the extra coverage gets shifted to other departments to help out, so it seems like it's even busier than it really is.  The to do lists are always there, so there is rarely, if ever any down time to get bored.  There is never a day that there is nothing to do.  The associates that are mainly cashiers handle more responsibility and multi-tasking on the front end.  They are required to some projects, answer phones, check out customers, call for assistance when needed and where needed and delegate break schedules for the store.  The"
good,"Fun a great place to work."
good,"My work experience will usually pertain to ringing up the customers and making sure that I am greeting them as they enter. I handle transactions such as checks, cash, debit and credit . My co workers are great people and I get along with all of them. The hardest part of the job will be when a customer ask me a question and I'm not sure where a item is . Overall a great place to work at."
good,Fast pace.  Middle management is also the salesfloor coverage.  Payroll is extremely tight / forcing management to fulfill both management and entry level employment roles.
good,"During my past year with Bed Bath & Beyond I have had the privilege of learning many new skills that will increase my effectiveness in the future. These skills include how to properly renovate the display fixtures for a sales floor as well as how to most effectively merchandise product. I also had the privilege to learn many new techniques to most accurately control inventory, and provide customer assistance. I was typically responsible on a daily basis for addressing customer needs while ensuring that inventory was properly stocked on the sales floor. In addition to that I was frequently called upon due to my knowledge of display renovations to remove and add displays to the store floor as needed. Management overall is very supportive of any associate that displays the desire to learn more. Unfortunately there is limited availability within the immediate company structure for promotion. The lack of a foreseeable future with the company has been the hardest part of the whole job experience thus far. The job is not unbearable though and positive co-workers and understanding managers have made a difficult situation into an enjoyable one."
good,"Very challenging when working with over 900 employees, much to learn and lots of patience required, however an ecommerce facility provides limited advancement opportunities."
good,I loved working here I met alot of wonderful people alot of new people friendly faces. I enjoyed it very much I would recommend this job to anyone
good,A typical day was coming in stretching in a group and then off to unpacking boxes and loading the merchandise on the shelves for the pickers. I learned that you must pick u the pace to keep up in the game. Co-workers was easy to get along with and fun to be around. Hardest [art of my job was to pick up the heavy boxes by yourself (80LBS and more). Most enjoyable part about this job was meeting new people (Employees) and learning new techniques from them.
good,It was a fast paced environment with everyone chipping in. I made friends quickly and got along with just about everyone. overall is was a good experience.
good,"Organize shelves with products"
good,Great beginning job. You get to see the fun side of retail here and help and meet parents of different types. Interesting to say in the least!
good,"A typical day of work at Bed Bath and Beyond requires full team work and customer service. Some days are slower than others, but there is always a task that needs to be done if you're not attending to a customer. It's a great place to work although everyone needs to work on working together more as a team than an individual. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and being able to give them an excellent shopping experience. The hardest part of the job is completing a task on a busy day while dedicating all of your time to customer service."
good,"Is a very fast paced company with a lot to learn at the very start. It does offer you many ways to pick up both product knowledge and customer service as you grow in the company. It taught me quite a bit about customer service! Management and co workers can always depend on your location, but at my store we worked quite well as a team. Dealing with the public in general sometimes can be a tough, but it also has it's benefits as well!"
good,"I really liked my job. It was fun to go to work everyday. Everyday was different. I liked my co workers. You have to be able to wear many hats. Management was always pleasant. They had an open door policy. It was hard making each customer happy, but that was the best part of the job . I liked that because it was a challenge."
good,A regular day that I would have done at Bed Bath & Beyond would be to help costumers find what they were looking for and also do the register if they needed extra help. Once it got closer to closing we would have to work freight out that we got from the truck that day and make sure its all put away or top stocked. I didn't learn too much from this job considering it was the same as working at Pier 1. The management was very friendly and I have no complaints about none of them or how they managed the store. The co-workers were very friendly and also helpful if i needed any help. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the freight was put out before we left for the night. The most enjoyable part was being able to experience a new environment with new people.
good,"Restock the shelves, open the store, help costumers with questions. Management is ok as well as the co-workers. Its not that hard of a job to do."
good,"Received truck orders, shipped transfers and completed general maintenance. Stocked and priced inventory as it was receved. Supervised and coordinated the transfer truck, and headed up inventory teams. Monitored inventory loss for the Loss Prevention Team."
good,"This place was a great first job. I learned a lot about customer service , how to cash handle and product knowledge meant. As well as how to tackle difficult customer matters."
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond was an interesting work environment.  I learned many things about different products that I was not aware of before."
good,"A typical day at the store is very busy, it's a very hands on job. I loved working one on one with customers. There is always so much to be done."
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond is a place that was full of life and so much to find.  There was always something to do.  I learned how to be apart of a team even just as a cashier where most tasks are handled individually. Always a fair and open work space between managers and employees.  I also trained as a bridal consultant being able to walk around and get a soon to be married couple registered for their new house is such a joy."
good,"I was a department lead for the bedding and bath department. On a typical day I was responsible for making sure that all the new merchandise was set in the correct places. In the department we had to make bedding and window displays. I was also a bridal consultant. This meant that I helped new bridal couples create their best registries while still completing my own tasks. "
good,Fast paced and fun environment to work in.  Managers are encouraged to take risks and step out of the box.
good,Stock merchandise. Loved working with customers. Hours to late with a small child
good,"I learned so much while with this company.  They provide extensive training on product and practice what they preach on Customer Service.  Also, empowering employees to handle issues in store is a bonus! You must be a worker to survive though - a lot is expected from all levels."
good,"No real room for advancement"
good,Fun workplace and friendly co-worker at the location I'm in
good,"Good place to work."
good,Many responsibilites to ensure store mdse. is received and placed.
good,"Typical day starts at 8 am, the first hour everyone helps open the store, stock shelves that are empty and work any left over freight from the previous day.  After the doors open, i head back to the office and do my Inventory Control job.  Ive worked just about every position there.  Inventory Control however involves using the computer and looking up all the different reports and task for the day. Price changes, price updates, sales updates, GWP updates. I also audit the front end by going through the price over ride reports from each register and try to figure out why they used a certain code and if there was good reason to use that code.  My co workers are great, fun and enjoyable people,  The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all the task that need to be completed and it is very on your own and detail oriented (which i like) But everything else in comparison to my job is easy.  The most enjoyable part of the day is making a customer happy and feeling appreciated by my co workers and customers, to really feel like i'm doing something and helping others is a good feeling."
good,It is a productive work environment. The down side is that the managers play favorites. As well as during summer the hours get cut down to an unlivable amount of hours.
good,"It was a retail job. And they had so much product training it was ridiculous. "
good,"Alpharetta store is the best. Great Team and Management.... I love it"
good,I enjoy working with the upbeat co-workers and delightful customers.
good,"Stock, and organize shelves for the convenience of the customer. Cash out customers with a smile, help customers find a product and answer questions about products. Explain coupon policy and provide them with an excellent shopping experience."
good,"greeting customers, stocking items, and customer service."
good,"nice environment to work its quiet, workers are friendly and always working on something, the customers are easy to help with, they petty much know what they looking for at the store."
good,"A typical day at work is cashiering, customer service, helping customers find what they are looking for and promoting the item of the month. Management and co-workers are fun and very nice."
good,"work was always fun, music is always playing, however the employees had a little bit of an attitude towards others. the manager Tabitha was always willing to work with you and talk to you if there was ever a problem."
good,"I worked at Bed Bath & Beyond for three years and it was overall a pretty good job. I leard lots about what I believe to be the best customer service around, and I really took it to heart. Majority of the management was great to work with, very willing to help and and gave good critisim to help move us all forward. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep all of our customers happy, especially when we would be understaffed and extreamely busy. Best part of my job was when a customer would remember me and ask me to help them again, it felt totally rewarding."
good,"the most enjoyable its the people working there."
good,Taught a lot about products sold. Very customer service driven.
good,I worked as a cashier and sales associate. Made sure the inventory was stocked at all times. I moved to the shipping and receiving and my responsibility was to return the damaged products back to the companies. I also helped received the trucks when they came in with merchandise.
good,"Over all, BB&B was a good place to work. A typical day at work was coming in and discussing the general plan for the day, such as sale signs and what needed to be dropped from top stock."
good,"Well managed team oriented environment.  A typical day required organizing store room and placing merchandise on floor displays.  Working on the night shift to organize and shift departments to make space for the 2 new departments that would be situated in the front of the store.  Organize the team effort to get the job completed in a timely and productive team manner.  Merchandising, labeling, pricing, scanning and shelving items as needed.  Working in shipping and receiving and organizing, scanning, pricing shipments as needed.  Follow planograms to merchandise items on shelves."
good,"My night starts with unloading,and loading trucks in a timely manner.The overnight managers worked hands on with the employees in order to build a strong work environment. The coworkers made sure to train a new worker when ever it was needed."
good,"Inventory Control:"
good,"Was in charge of the bedding and bath department within a store. Had to deal with customers, ording inventory, setting up displays, plan o grams and putting out the freight each day."
good,"They say work is a place for work but at BBB, it was like working with friends. The atmosphere is very positive. The only downfall is in the slow season, like any retail business, that hours get cut."
good,"After spending over seven years with this company, I feel confident saying that BBBY is a great place for employees looking for P/T work while juggling other things in life like school. Co-workers and job culture are wonderful, very nurturing and caring. However, the growth opportunities are slim to none. Hiring is external, and internal promotions are very hard to come by. I am happy to have spent my time with the company, but know that it will not be a career for me."
good,the job was very easy. the managers were tough but they cared about there employees
good,"Typically a day at work has me managing at least four different cashiers, up to 8 at a time, as well as assisting customers with any help they may need, restocking shelves, delegating tasks for the cashiers, and helping the front of the store run smoothly. I have learned to multitask better than ever, as well as increasing my positive interaction with people. over the last year management has changed a lot, but I have always been able to incorporate their help when I need it. My coworkers have often changed more than the management, however those who have stayed as part of the team make working fun and very productive. The hardest part of the job is trying to be in two places at once, a cashier might need help with their customer, but I might be with a different customer trying to help them. the most enjoyable part is the interaction with the different people, my coworkers included, and I enjoy the returning customers and building relationships with them."
good,You learn so much about different products in the store and about what BBB has to offer in-store and online.
good,Keep good customer rapor. Everyone has a different opinion of you so be yourself. Best foot forward.
good,"It's not a bad place to work. Sometimes, mistakes are made with the schedule. Also, your place in the store may be switched without being asked. Otherwise, it's truly not a bad place to work in."
good,"Over the years of employment there, the skills I acquired will last a lifetime.  Very nice work environment to be around.  Unfortunately did not  continue longer. Co-workers were very helpful when needed. The days were spent on a constant flow of tasks to accomplish."
good,A great place to work. We try to always have customers leave happy.
good,"A typical day at work would normally consist of our morning meetings, which involve everyone coming together as a team and picking out a product to get a better understanding of for customer purpose. I learned that a job should not always be about the money but for the enjoyment and being able to help customers of all kind. The management was okay because there was alot of favoritism and judgment but overall things got done. "
good,"Worked here for short time as a second job, did not enjoy working here."
good,"Great, Fun place to work. Great for students or a second job."
good,Stayed busy everyday as the receiving manager in charge of bringing in every piece of merchandise and getting on the salesfloor
good,For busy company. Keeping the customer first was the live and die by motto. Assistant management was great. Co-workers just as awesome. I've learned how to keep the customer in a happy shopping experience. From product knowledge to the correct signage visible for the customers to see and know what they are paying for.
good,"Stock – Cashier – Frontend Supervisor"
good,Bed Bath and Beyond gives workers the opportunity to learn. They make sure workers are trained proficiently in all aspects of customer service in order to provide good service to all customers.
good,"I generally started my day by helping open the store. I had to count the drawers to make sure they were correct. Merchandise was put away daily. I really enjoyed meeting new people like tourist and first tome college students, and soon to be mmarried couples. I learned to do registry and even better communication skillls. The Managers were very understanding considering i was just now starting my first pregnacy. The hardest part was leaving but becoming a young mother and school was more important at the time. "
good,Decent pay for retail. All about the customer. Great training for the store. Friendly place to work
good,"Bed bath and beyond is a good place to work, if you don't mind starting out part-time. It is a fun place to work because the store employees strive hard to maintain friendships by helping each other. The rate of pay is low and there is little room for advancement. "
good,Very busy most times. I manage the front with entails customer service
good,well i started at one of the warehouses in las vegas really enjoyed it. in as few as 6 months i was promoted. learned how to operate a order picker forklift and was certified on it. managment was excellent and very helpful co workers were great at store and warhouse. i think the hardest part of the job would be the learning everything at the begining. But after learning everything its wonderful enviroment if a hard worker can be promoted all in all was one of the favorable jobs ive had
good,Great place to work and I would refer others to Bath & Beyond.
good,"bed bath is a good company.  I would never work there full time again, but for parttime they are okay."
good,"A typical day at work would start with sorting the go-backs to the appropriate sides of the store. From there, I would then either work Soft Side or the customer service desk. Working on soft side, I would assist customers in selecting bedding, window treatments, and bath items. At customer service, I would process returns and sales as well as make damaged item slips and put items in the bins for go backs. I would face the area around customer service to make sure that it was presentable at all times and to make sure that there was no expired or near expired foods on the floor. I learned a lot about items for improving the look of the home in this position as well as more about kitchen utensils. I also learned the skills necessary to be a cashier and customer service representative. My management was usually very helpful and provided feedback for where I as an employee could improve. The only problem I had with management was that my  approved time off requests weren't always honored nor were my original schedule limitations. I had requested to not work on Sundays because of church obligations and even though management said this wouldn't be a problem they still scheduled me more Sundays than not by the end. I absolutely enjoyed working with my coworkers. I worked well with all of them and enjoyed learning from them. There was a pretty quick turn around so I met and worked with a lot of people in the time I was there. The hardest part of my job was making sure that the customer was always happy especially in processing their returns or searching for items that they didn't find"
good,"Great work place , Great employee's and managment .Flexible with hours. "
good,A nice place to work and everyone is nice. Needs better pay but it is still a great place to start in retail. 
good,"Large store with many different products, always busy with customers and projects, which made the time pass quickly.  Fun work environment with many new things to learn."
good,Provides a great sociable environment that works as hard as they play.
good,bb&b was fun. hard work. good hours. communication errors with management sometimes complicated things. positive people. enjoyed working there. 
good,This is a great company to work for. A typical shift is about 5 hours. I am a front end cashier. The management is very understanding and my co-workers are like family. 
good,"Hard but rewarding job, enjoyed the staff, and enjoyed running the recieving dept."
good,"BB&B strides to provide the best customer service possible in the business, which it does. I have been a manager for the company, and have expressed interest to move into a higher level, which is the reason I am interested in another position with another company. I have learned amazing skills as a Customer Service Trainer and Manager. I have been uplifted in teaching the product knowledge and customer service skills to the hundreds of associates and managers I have trained. I have worked at 6 different stores during my tenure with BBB and have taken levels of customer service higher in each store I have worked in. The success of the increase in customer service is due to the team I worked with and their energy and knowledge to help the customer. I enjoyed working with the customers and helping to make their experience the best possible."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun place to work for. Room to grow if you choose to do so.
good,I had a really good time working there. i feel like i learned a lot. i learned product knowledge and customer service.
good,"I learned a lot about time management, multi-tasking and dealing with customers."
good,Enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers and the management was great. A typical day I would receive and ship the incoming produst and stock the products.
good,"Working in retail is hard, customers can be unpleasant, etc. But in this environment there are many opportunities that arise that allow you to take on extra duties and expand beyond just the customer-associate interaction. Strongly enjoyed working for them, I only left because I wanted to work in healthcare."
good,My focus for all my shifts were the customers.
good,Taught me how to really work hard. Instilled the work ethic that I have today. Took pride in the looks of the store and its merchandise.
good,The company is a fast paced environment that challenges employees to think outside the box in the retail industry. I've learned the value of customer service while help to the company reach it's daily financial goals. Co-workers worked great together and management got in the trenches with it's employees making sure day to day operations ran smoothly.
good,During the typical day I would count all the registers as well as the end of the night to ensure the amounts were correct. I would return any items needed or approve any returns from my peers. I would make sure the front desks areas were clean and worked in other departments.
good,"If your okay with not advancing in the company, go for it. All you do is visual merchandising and customer service. Your hard work is not rewarded."
good,Was a good place to work other than the long hours. The management team was very good one.
good,Very enjoyable retail environment to be a part of. Great opportunity to be a merchant in a retail environment and know everything about ordering and emrchandising.
good,the days are filled with great custermer service while working with energetic co-workers and management. Loved the product information that was taught their.
good,A typical day at work was very productive.
good,i work in the bath department keeping the area clean and assiting customers when needed i also worked the register when needed.
good,Reinforced all facets of Loss Prevention and Safety daily. Implemented training modules for new team management.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun energetic place to work for, however, you will have to stand for long periods of time. Besides having some marvelous products and having a generous discount, BBB has their coupons giveaways! The management is really nice and true to their word of great customer service. They are incredible respectful to their customers which I like. BBB promotes great customer service and I think overall, they also promote great care to their staff as well. I remember, the management always being flexible with my schedule and I respect that and thank them for that."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond was a really good store to start my career off with.
good,"For an entry-level job, I feel like I learned a lot, but there aren't many opportunities to be promoted within the company."
good,i loved helping people find what they needed they may have had a bad day and me helping them at least put a smile on there face.
good,Meet some great people. Customers were always we taken care of and it was a wonderful work environment.
good,This job was another way for me to gain experience in a different work environment with other people. Everyone was very given and open to any questions and helpful
good,"Being a customer service supervisor, I handle purchases and returns on a daily basis."
good,"· Created store developments sets for assigned projects.· Created fixture plans, floor finish plans, power/specialty lighting plans, lighting plans, furniture plans, and low voltage plans.· Researched, planned, designed and administered building projects, applying knowledge of design, construction procedures, zoning and building codes and building materials.· Documented architectural revisions as store development progresses.· Designed department layouts per size and volume merchandise."
good,"Helping customers, climbing 12 foot ladders , shocking shelves. All fun and enjoyable."
good,It was a very fast-paced environment with really fun people who nade the work day fly by.
good,great job every employee helps you learn in every department if you ask for help they wont bother to help you.
good,"Every day there was something to be done. Management definitely jumps in to help when backup was needed. Everyone knows how to work the registers but, not everyone can work the floor. Sometimes you're thrown out on the sales floor with no help."
good,Schedules allow an option to enhance your work/life balance. With new leadership we are interested to see how the company plans to regain its retail status.
good,Mainly interact with customers and straighten up around the store. Can be fast paced but can also be slow and feel as though there is not much for you to do.
good,"Great place to work, managers are nice and understanding. HR works with you when you have personal situations going on. Guaranteed to work your hours, no matter the workflow."
good,"Staff are friendly, Some days can be very busy while others may be rather monotonous, Management was decent, The job was not that difficult rather just doing the same tasks over and over."
good,"working for BBB is not unlike working for any retail establishment, but the combination of culture and employee incentives makes working there better than other places."
good,"Good experience to work at Bedbath."
good,"All race of people working together as a team, it was very exciting.  Management team was great. The pay could’ve been more. The location was perfect for the distance to where I lived."
good,"Very fast paced environment when busy, management is great but there aren’t many opportunities to move up in company have to be able to relocate if you want to move up"
good,I really like working for bed bath but it is a retail job so there are the usual pitfalls but over all a good experience. I like my coworkers and managers.
good,Some managers had terrible attitudes. Associates called out a lot. You get calls all the time to pick up shifts. People quit often. It felt like it is the associates job to keep their doors open. We had to place online orders for customers when the items weren't stocked. We were forced to push a product on every customer at check out. It just felt like the fate of the store was on associates.
good,The industry has changed a lot with more people buying online.  Traffic has slowed down but the bottom line is to make a sale.  Staffing has been cut.
good,Had the pleasure to work and learn from some great mentors. I had worked part time and was able to get promoted several times during my tenure. I learned a lot about managing as well as customer service.
good,"fun place to work, nice people and good management but iffy health policy. pay is above minimum wage but does not offer to many opportunities for raises."
good,"Good benefits and descent hours for regular shifts. During the retail sales seasons many hours and little help for each department.  "
good,"I have got so much experience on Customer service , and i really enjoy working in front desk as Customer Service Associate. My Managers are very good. I work in a team."
good,The staff is great and usually very helpful. Very rare to find a rude customer here but those people do still exist. There’s a lot to learn here because of how many different items are in stock but if you stick it out through the month there should be no problem!
good,"I am a college student now and I need a bunch of hours. they wouldn't give me the hours that I needed even when I asked for more. I love the people I worked with, I still have contact with them. If you are looking for a good high school job then work here. some grumpy people do come in and think they are the special ones there. The policy doesn't apply to those who yell and get what they want."
good,Work was good. Somewhat flexible hours. Work was fairly easy as long as you can pick up 25+ pounds. Staff was friendly and easy to work with. Management wasn’t the best.
good,"A typical day at work was smooth and very fast paced "
good,"Productive work atmosphere on a daily basis. Good working conditions, good employee relations. For management positions, you work ten hour work days. Learned mostly, logistics and operation details."
good,"I like working at Bed Bath and Beyond, I've learned a lot about the retail business.  I love interacting with the customers, and new products come in."
good,I have enjoyed working here. I love my coworkers and I mostly have fun. I just don’t think that I am getting payed enough for all that I do and for the amount of time I’ve been there.
good,This isn't a bad place to work. It's not really easy to move up in the company but if that's not what you're looking for then this is a good job. I have no major complaints.
good,I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond for only a short time.  I enjoyed interacting with other employees and the customers.  They have great products.  The manager was always willing to be flexible with my schedule.  He was very understanding when I had to quit due to my husband's health.
good,We were doing the Windows 10 migration so it was stressful at times. Training users daily that did not know Windows 10. Sometimes images would not be completed. But all in all a great place to work.
good,My experience working at bed bath & beyond  overall was good. My only gripe working there is that there should’ve been commission based. Management pretty good
good,It is a great place to work. Really liked the people I worked with. At times very hard to balance work and life. A lot of work to do but no time given to complete. Expectations are tough to meet
good,"you become not only apart of their team, but apart of a family."
good,The company was able until recently to provide a stable environment. Business was difficult brick and mortar retail business. Did not react quick enough to change.
good,"gives you great experience with working with customers .. and organizing. there is some team efforts as well that help make the store a success. As a receiving manager, I hoped to get more time to work through what needed to be done... but poor management at the time restricted much needed maintenance that was desperately needed. Towards the end, it was a struggle every day to get what needed to be done. They have hopefully sorted out this shortcoming."
good,It’s not a bad place to work. There needs to be better communication with management members and more upfront and direct feedback. With the right people in the right positions it can be an excellent place to work.
good,"depending on the day and time work can either be really slow or you can be rushed with customers. each manager is different but super chill. the hardest part of the job is getting through the rush the best part of it is working with your co- workers, everyone is super welcoming and nice."
good,Very straight forward place to work. Maintain a clean sales floor and help when needed. If you like to do the same thing over and over again and be organized its a great place to work for minimum wage.
good,"A typical day at bed bath and beyond is working with customers getting connections. I learned a lot about different areas of bedding, basic needs in life and different kinds of curtains, bath essentials, pillows, lifestyle. The management is okay, not to bad. The culture is nice very diverse, different kinds of people with different connections."
good,"A typical work day at Bed Bath and Beyond consisted of very long hours on the floor, stocking shelves or putting items where they needed to be. It was very busy."
good,"Conducive working environment, with great team members. But the retention process by managers is highly manipulative, partial and sentimental. HR should look into better ways of choosing who to retain or not."
good,"fun work placed and very enjoyable when its slow, holidays sucks when you are being pulled every direction . It gave me retail experience. Wish I did more actual work."
good,"I was hired as a cashier and enjoyed the friendly interactions I was able to have with my customers at that store. I enjoyed seeing customers who visited frequently. The discounts that were available to customers made the interactions a joy.  There was no maintenance providers, so I became a frequent resource that was utilized by this business."
good,At this job i was in the shipping and receiving department. I learned how to scan in and out merchandise. Management here was fair but could have been better. It was a very diverse work place and had great people to work with.The hardest part of the job was when we got too many shipments in at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we got our work done fast we had time to relax or not having to be so fast paced for the rest of the day.
good,it starts off nice but as you become more accustomed it becomes more stressed . you definitely have to be committed to your job to work there so dont plan on much down time .
good,Bed bath and beyond always kept you busy. If you weren’t on the sales floor helping customers then you were on the 3rd floor restocking the sales floor. The employees there are all super friendly and very helpful.
good,Istarted work at 7 a.m. and was usually off by 4 a.m. One good thing about the managers is they let you make time in on Saturday if you missed a day. Fast work environment MADE THE DAY GO BY QUICKLY.
good,My typical work day would start off by putting products from the day before trucks way. Then we would have our morning meeting. Then I  would start the truck.
good,I enjoyed working at Bed Bath & Beyond.  I would have liked to stay as a cashier as I was hired as that.  I ended up be put on stocking shelves a lot.
good,"Been working at this location for years, it was my first job, learned a lot about customer service and registry programs, as well as some backend knowledge. Hours are flexible but don't count on getting a regular schedule or consistent hours, especially with management continuing to hire new people and not giving more than a few shifts a week to people who have been there longer. It's fun, and I do enjoy working at the Keizer location, but it's not something to look at for a long-term career."
good,Overall the work wasnt hard to do and it was very relaxed vide in the store. Just got a little slow at some points. I was a cashier so i was always standing in the front and greeting customers. didnt really learn anything from this job.
good,Great company to work at.  Understands family value; Great working culture and enjoyed working with some amazing individuals.  I would recommend to work here.
good,"A typical day at work starts out with me grabbing my walkie talkie and my customer service device and heading to my manager for my department so she can tell me the day's mission. I've learned how to do a lot of things with P.O.G which is back stocking extra items so if a customer wants something and it is not visible on the shelf, we can type it into our scanner and see where they are and how much of the item we have. The management team is good and the workplace culture is even better. BBB made sure to welcome new employees, show them the ropes and made the atmosphere very inviting. The hardest part of the job is actually trying to get offer our membership to customers because majority of our customers are given 20% coupons almost everyday and they are willing to use that than to sign up for our membership. Our membership is also 30 bucks a year. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day when you're recovering your department and have it looking neat for the next person who comes in to work the next day."
good,The company is behind with times in terms of technology and work life balance. The people are great and that is what makes most employees stay longer than they normally would
good,"fun work environment, always had games rallies and team completions, easy to advance within the company. "
good,A typical day at work consists of me completing tasks but putting customer service as my top priority. I learn multiple facts about various products. I commonly navigate the company's data base when searching for products for customers. I enjoy assisting customers to find the product that is the best fit for them. The hardest part of the job is the high demand for assistance on the floor. We are often time short staffed and the high demand for customer service creates a hostile environment when the store gets busy.
good,Having total customer service is a way to sum up BBB. Always smiling and being productive is basic. If your on the sales floor besides verbal sales. The employee will have to make online orders as well.
good,"Depends on where you work at the company, however I found the work to be enjoyable when there was work to accomplish. I found the managers to be incredibly fair, and my employees competent."
good,"They just kind of throw you into the deep end expecting you to know what to do, then get angry when you don't know whats going on. They pay well and get pretty busy, it's a good job just not right for me."
good,"Typical retail job, but when it was busy, it got BUSY. There were a lot of moments where I felt we were understaffed, but this mainly happened to poor scheduling. It was a great experience for my first job; the job taught me so much about the day-to-day operations of a retail store."
good,"The store I was at didn’t offer advancements regardless of how long you had worked there, it was more of a “you gotta know a guy” to move up. Some parts of management were not good at all. Other than that great company!"
good,"Very great place for a first job. "
good,Offers great opportunities for associates to excel and understand how to run an e-commerce operation. The opportunity is there to take as long as your able to understand the process.
good,"I worked at the customer service desk at Bed Bath & Beyond. It was very informative, but became very stressful at times when we had to figure out how to have items returned with no proof that the customer bought it themselves. It took over a month for me to finally reach the hours I wanted to work each week."
good,"good starter job. they train well and managers defend you from customers, unlike some retail stores they stand with you if something goes wrong and are willing to jump into the fire with you and do whatever job or task needs to be done."
good,"I have a soft spot for Bed Bath and Beyond. This was my first job and I worked there on and off for three years. Overall I think this is a good place to work for someones first job. I worked strictly customer service and over time became customer service supervisor. There is a lot of things you will need to learn but once you learn them it's so simple. I think the hardest thing for me to learn was coupons. It's the hardest thing for most people to learn there. I believe all the Bed Bath's are getting new systems though that apply the coupons for you automatically though so it should be even simpler. I think the only  downsides are that sometimes management isn't great, but that's a hit or a miss, and they also expect your life to revolve around the store. Like if they ask you to cover a shift and you can't they will hold a personal grudge against you and I've even had my hours cut because of something like that. It could have just been my management though. Also be prepared to really be a team. You will have to work together to get through the day."
good,The one thing I loved the most about working at Bed Bath and Beyond was the family atmosphere. I felt right at home and your co-workers were always there for you.
good,"I enjoyed my time there for the most part, being able to work and develop my customer service skills, while also being very active physically, including climbing ladders, lifting boxes, etc."
good,"Bed bath and beyond was a fun place to work because the people are awesome. There is drama between co workers sometimes, but that’s normal for any workplace. The managers treat employees well."
good,"Manager is great, however the assistant manager was unfriendly majority of the time and smelled of weed all the time. Left work numerous time for poor excuses and was late to work also for poor excuses. Working at one specific spot at day was boring and not pushing my abilities and made me feel as if i was just a customer service person. Overall my experience wasn't the worst but it definitely wasn't what i was excepting due to it being a large company."
good,A typical day at work would include collaborative work between employees to accomplish specific tasks for more effective ways to accommodate customers day to day. The management team was readily available when necessary for employee help or customer support. The hardest part of my job were the early day shifts at 6am that I worked. The culture was very friendly and respectable. I thoroughly enjoyed every workday because we all contributed to each others success.
good,"This job is perfect for college students who are working part time and going to school.  I applied for this position while I was still in school due to they work very well around your class schedule. However, I would never recommend this job as a career choice."
good,"Running Register, filling stock and assisting customers. placing orders online for customers and lots of cleaning of the store. the hardest part were back to back shifts. the best part was being able to help customers."
good,"I learned better customer service, very fast paced job, a lot of heavy lifting, sold merchandise to customers, learned how to analyze customers, did early morning stocking."
good,job can be trying during the holidays. as a manger you will spend half of your day doing tasks normally assigned to hourly employees due to payroll restrictions.
good,Great place to work if you do not need many hours. the managers work really well with your schedule if you need time off. i really enjoyed helping customers find items in the store and also ordering merchandise on line.
good,I started here to help pay off my wedding and its been a big help. You have to really know how to work hard to stay on top of the workload but its not a bad job
good,"Tasks were doable, management was understanding and worked with you on any issues. They are always willing to assist you with any endeavors you have, especially trying to advance in the company."
good,"a nice place to either re-enter the work force after some years off. or a great place to start for a student looking to earn cash."
good,"Rang up customers and helped with finding products on the floor, including items off Wedding Registries. Also wrapped Wedding gifts for customers if they wanted them wrapped."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a great company, they gave me my first job. It is a very quick-paced yet easy job. I would recommend to anyone looking for just part-time."
good,Work hard just keep focus on what you need to accomplish to better yourself in the future and never give up work towards your dreams and if this is something you see yourself doing go for it.
good,"I liked working here but I wished they paid and gave out more hours. I like working with the customers,I was very fun and the management was always doing something for their employees."
good,"management at my location could be better, and not single out the new workers, also follow protocol by making sure ALL employees do not check out anyone they know"
good,"After you get your employees started on their task it allows you to complete your daily task as a manager to keep the company organized and running smoothly."
good,"Most days are fast-paced. The store I worked in had many snowbirds as customers. They were all moving into new houses and needed everything. At times it was hectic but always interesting. You were dealing with people from all walks of life. People standing in line was unexceptable. Every employee was trained to run a register, even management. I worked with a great group of people who made the hours fly by."
good,"Its a great place to start off with , I enjoy working there because the staff there is very friendly and inviting , and also lots of things to do to keep yourself busy . Overall I like working there and I have learned many new things from there."
good,"It was a part-time retail job. Those aren't easy. But the managment was very good over there and very respectful to its workers.  The pay and hours were average for a store. But the store was organized, clean and they worked with you."
good,A typical day would be very fast paced with your focus on providing great customer service. You will learn many different ways of merchandising and looking at fixtures thru the customers eyes. It is a fun company to work for and has many opportunities available if you are desiring to achieve them. The management is beyond fair and operates with an open door policy. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job can be the customer.
good,"A fun fast paced place to work, people were good to work with and hours were flexible, liked my supervisor and coworkers, company is a nice clean place to work."
good,The department I worked in had time limits that were sometimes difficult to meet. Otherwise over all it was a pleasant place to work. I would recommend Bed Bath & Beyond to others.
good,"Its a fun place to work depending upon your location and management team.  Mgrs work 10hr days with one break which can be tedious at times.  You learn alot about people, customer service and thinking outside the box"
good,"The workplace culture is team based and sales oriented, with a focus on customer service. You are there to persuade customers to make purchases, whether in store, or online. Online orders are just as important as in store purchases. Suggested add on sales are encouraged. The coupons can get confusing to both customers and employees. They can become a point of contention with customers."
good,Always projects or customers to keep you busy. Customer service skills were definitely improved from working there. Management really depends individually on what location. Hardest part of the job is the constant customer interaction but the best part is that BBB tries to do their best by their employees.
good,It was a temp job so i did not stay with them after the holiday. I like the people there and the managers were nice to work with. I would go back if I had the chance.
good,This is a perfect first job. They teach you alot and prepare you to be a pro-active salespaerson. I'd go back if they had better paying jobs available.
good,The company has efficient scheduling and training procedures. Stores are well kept and overall treatment is great I left because of lack of hours and my own anti-social tendencies.
good,"If you love interacting with customers and talking about products, then this is the job for you. Although, like you sometimes, customers get grumpy and impatient so you have to deal with their bad attitudes but overall, it is a relatively fun job. If you work the customer service desk, you get to print registries be it, bridal, college, baby showers, etc. Also take returns and make exchanges and damage out the returns."
good,"Great training program, the customers are the best, fast paced, overall pretty good environment, for part time hours are broke into 5 hours each day, longer hours on the weekends, till you reach your max, flexible scheduling nice factor."
good,Best benefits package in retail. Better than average company to work for. Like any company it has it's pro's and con's. Vacations are always paid. Christmas is a tedious time
good,overall its a great place to work if your younger and going to school or older and just want something part time.  Its harder to get a full time position or to move up in ranks.  I've been working there for almost 2 years and every time something opens up with a full time position they would rather outsource hire then promote from within even though they preach about promoting from within all the time.  The raises are not great. you have to work for an entire year before you get one and when you do you have to pull an arm and a leg just to get something decent.  Do not expect to make a living on part time employment.
good,i love hotdowgs and fat girls with no hair i also love my i phone it gives me things to do and people to talk too. in addition to my love of phones and fat women
good,"I worked as a sales associate and cashier.  With my previous sales experience in kitchen appliances, I was easily able to increase the products that customers bought as an add on sale."
good,"-Great customer service"
good,"I worked at two different BBB's. The first was for one year and was fantastic. Plenty of younger people my age with a lot of energy mixed with managers who are were extremely experienced, helpful, and personable."
good,"Typical shift includes customer service, running to the registers when needed, stocking a lot of merchandise, customer service and various other tasks."
good,"Loved working at bed bath and beyond, best job ive had yet, wish they gave more hours and bigger wages. the discount is awesome! better than anyone ive worked for yet."
good,Bed bath and beyond is truly one of the best retail customer service jobs out there. They work with you if your lacking experience.  The hole team is fun and laid back.most interactions witb customers are friendly. The hardest parts is the work hours and back customers.
good,"It is a fun job and I love the people I work with however, the management leaves a lot to be desired. The work is interesting but very tiring at times. I rarely work more than 6 hours at a time and wont get home until 11:30 on most days."
good,"BB&B is a great place as long as there's strong supporting cast. I mean that quite literally as no matter the position  (manager or associate) you're lugging heavy items up 12 foot ladders. It can be rewarding and the customer interactions can be fun but if you're not up for the physicality of it, you're probably not going to like it."
good,Gained experience in many aspects of the store while working all the areas. Everyone worked well together. Would either work 8 to 430 or 1 to 930.
good,"The typical day involved a lot of stocking and facing mingled with helping customers learn to read the back of product boxes."
good,As a Bridal Consultant on a daily basis I get the chance to work with so many wonderful couples and get to experience the excitement with them. As an associate I get to help my customers find the things that they need the most and there is never an unsatisfied customer.
good,"This wasn't a typical situation, as a new store was being set up, but it was fast paced for the first few days, and then slowed down. "
good,"A typical day is assisting customers by helping them choose the best products for them and ringing up customers all while providing excellent customer service. "
good,"Great employees "
good,"No comment. Store location closed, other locations available. Great place to shop. Discounts given to employees are the same as available to patrons."
good,There was some downtime here and there but the days went by easy. The customers were nice. Also i learned alot more about handling money
good,The management is poor and the hours are awful. The company itself pretty much refuses to give full tim now because of the medical insurance so we are constantly under staffed and the management is the definition of awful. Not all of the managers. But the big one.
good,"The job is not very rewarding in a lot of ways. A lot of the sales goals and pressures they force unto their associates don't really affect anything, but they are insistent on meeting them. With improper management this dynamic could be problematic. However, the job security and knowledge that are gained are irreplaceable."
good,"Overall Bed Bath and Beyond was good place to work at. However, their turn over rate is ridiculous. This may be in part with their lake of adjusting to their employees needs while still meeting the business needs."
good,"As soon as I got to work I would begin helping customers with whatever they needed.  Whether they required a cashier, sales associate, or consultant for bridal I would be able to switch roles and assist them with whatever they required. I would continue to help all guests that passed me or I would put out the products and do it in a safe and timely manner.  Customers were the number one priority though."
good,"not too much hours but very accommodating managers.. it is fun until closing time which closing staff have to sweep and mop floors which is big.. other than that, pretty good place to work at."
good,"Helping customers with finding merchandise, management and customers are great team players. Everyone helps everyone. My job isn't hard.. The customers is what I enjoy most."
good,"Great environment, Friendly people, flexible, Big place to work, promote within, big store many departments. hours are great for someone who's in school."
good,"I enjoyed working there because the majority of the managerial staff and most associates were strong, resilient and dependable people. It was not always easy dealing with the stress of overnight work but the people who work there are understanding. Most of them will try their best to work with your issues with the job."
good,"Be at work on time, all gather in early morning to figure out what the daily plan is going to be."
good,This being my first job I learned to communicate with customers and work with other associates as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming very confident in my position and being able to assist the customer with anything they needed. The management was great because they were always there and willing to help with any problems that myself or the customer had.
good,Nice environment to work.  The company is very flexible with scheduling.  I have been very rarely denied requests for vacation or time off.
good,Good store to work at they have everything you need and more. You will defiantly learn a lot from bb&b. Some people that I worked with was not so great but other than that it was ok.
good,"service and safety in always first, work smart not hard, follow the program. Always think of service and how everything else you do can effect service"
good,I enjoy this job a lot. The hours are dependable and the management is a fun and lively crew. You create a special bond with your coworkers to keep you sane on busy retail days. You will go crazy at times when customers ask you for an extra coupon and then get angry about you not magically having any but you'll forget about it as soon as the next nice customer comes along. People are always interesting and you always have something to do.
good,"This was my first job while in high school, they work great with your schedule and provide great training. They train you to provide great customer service. It was an all around perfect job for someone fresh out of high school or even still in high school."
good,This job was demanding but I enjoyed my time while working there. The customers were great and you also had opportunity for growth.
good,BB&B's management was no understanding at all. They pay you minimum wage and require you to work with as much intensity as a full time job.
good,Good place to work. I loved the people including the managers. Just not enough money.
good,"really clean work place, nice customers to dea with, great coupon for customers"
good,Providing customer service when guests need help. I learned how to work as a team player. Management was one of the best things about the job. Managers are understanding and help you be the best associate you can be. Co workers are like a family with eachother. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I work with.
good,It was very enjoyable atmosphere. A very organized store with awesome items !
good,"Manages sales associates on a daily bases. Creates and maintains merchandise presentations and window dressings. Orders and prepares product for placement. "
good,"Overall working for Bed, Bath and Beyond has been enjoyable.  I am currently learning different classes associated within the store.  The training at the store has been very helpful in helping me to feel confident day to day.  I make sure stocks are up to date and that the customers needs are met.  I enjoy helping customers find the things they need most."
good,"Not a bad place to work in retail management, need to be very customer service orientated."
good,"A great company to work for.  Customer service was world class, and so was the merchandising."
good,Management needs a little bit of a break more often to which they will better react to employees. Regulations and Rules should be upheld but more research should be available before making sudden decisions.
good,"A normal day would start with restocking the store to ensure all the shelves are fully stocked. Once that is done I would help with whatever is needed by management. Then in the afternoon I would work the receiving section. During this time there can be between 100 to 900 individual packages. Each one must me scanned and inputted into the system then have a price sticker placed on each individual item. As for management, to me they seem well, and really friendly. Great customer service with the customers. But what I noticed is that they would tell you what you want to hear (about advancement, promotions, etc), and the situation that happened to me is that I was working two jobs at once and at first they were ok with it. Then right before Thanksgiving I noticed the change, and my schedule started changing and conflicting with my other job and then my manager started to schedule me for hours that were during the days and times that I was unavailable. And when I asked about the conflict of schedules he made it out to be my fault. So I had to relieve my position there. But he co-workers are amazing there. Hardest part was learning how to do a receiving position without really having good training. My favorite part of the job was helping customers. To make someone happy is rewarding to me."
good,"I enjoyed working here because the customers were great, always happy and the brides were always great to work with too. "
good,"Being the detailed and organized individual that I am, I felt this position was exceptionally enjoyable. I really liked that I would get reviewed by the district and regional operations managers at the same time, and both of them would be surprised by how much I excelled at the position. It was a disappointment to me that the upper management was constantly getting switched around"
good,It is a quick paced multitasking work place. This company really believes in customer service. It challenges you to keep your portion of the business going while maintaining the highest level of customer service. I love customer service.
good,"My days are typically nine hours where I am superwoman and then some. Focused heavily on customer service tasking is always secondary. Being a retail environment, staff are hard to keep but the ones who do stay are fantastic and enthusiastic. It is still a young company in Canada and is working out the kinks of their operations but overall a wonderful company to work for. "
good,"Work day consist of stocking shelves with merchandise, greeting every customer, assisting customers with any questions or concerns they may have and maintain a clean work environment."
good,"I enjoy this job, it is very physically demanding but fun. I work a lot more than normal hours as a salaried manager and it's expected not requested. I have learned a ton about products but I feel some of my skills as a manager that can develop others is being lost. Daily we have tons of freight to be put away which I feel takes away from our ability to aid customers and develop others."
good,"i learned how to wrap gifts ready to be shipped, also how the warehouse works, great customer service practice."
good, Supervise and motivate staff and ensure compliance with sales and security procedures.
good,"The best thing about Bed, Bath, & Beyond is that they are so dedicated to going above and beyond for their customers. I am a front end lead, which means I am the go to person when one of my cashiers have a question about policies or if their is a dissatisfied customer. I also work out on the sales floor so I have a wide variety of product knowledge. I also do bridal consulting, which means that I get couples registered with Bed, Bath, & Beyond. While I'm consulting a bridal couple I walk around the entire store with them and help tell them features and benefits of what we carry. The hardest part of my job lately has been juggling both working on the sales floor and contributing to my front end responsibilities, because each position has a large amount of responsibility I sometimes get overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part of my day at work would be helping and talking with customers. I just enjoy helping them and talking with them. I really enjoy when I am there just to make someone's day to just get a customer who is having a lousy day and to be able to talk to them for a few minutes and make them smile makes me feel like I did something right."
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond is a fun place to work, but if you are hired for part-time your hours are not consistent. Some weeks I would work 30 hours and some only 10."
good,Bed bath is very intresting its almost like a khols i loved the work place.
good,"Productive,fun and Wonderful management to work for. No opportunity of growth in position or salary. Work may get monotonous during certain periods of a year and the volume phenomenally increases during holiday season. But no growth in any direction for a long time and no hike in salary. Poor pay. But the best part are the managers. They really work hard to make the job feel fun and educative. They are amazing people. Very approachable and humble."
good,Nice place to work. Busy corporate HQ. Lots of good people there make it feel like a smaller place than it is. There are lot of conveniences in the area but lots of traffic too.
good,"Great for a job during high school, and if you move up in the company it's not so bad either. The people are great and the company wants you to be better."
good,Stretch keep a steady pace and stay hydrated. Dress for the weather as the temperature  varies due to delivery of products. Team work is vital to both time management and organization.
good,"Normalmente faltaba personal en piso y se descuida un poco a la clientela no por que no se le quiera dar el servicio, sino por falta de personal"
good,"A good retail job, no high stress, and a small, efficient staff. Management was overall easy to contact. The most important responsibility throughout the store was customer service, helping people find the item that would exactly suit their needs, using the on site equipment to reach items they couldn't, and making online orders. Otherwise, regular duties included organizing stock, keeping the store clean, and operating the register when needed."
good,"For someone that is looking for a first part-time job, this is the place that I would recommend. They are understanding when it comes to your work schedule, provide training to help prepare you for the workplace, and an associate discount for you as well."
good,"A typical day for me  assisting with freight and replenishment in the mornings before I start implementing my price changes. I have learned quite a lot while working here because this is the longest employer I have ever had. They taught me time management skills and how to be more of a team player. The work place culture is service first before task or projects. The hardest part of my job was how to prioritize my projects especially during the holidays, The projects need done in a timely manner, however customers have to come first so you have to determine how to manage your time in order to get your projects done, but also deliver great customer service."
good,"Good coworkers, comprehensive pay, respectable management. It was a relaxed environment and the work load was tolerable. Working for Bed Bath & Beyond was beneficial."
good,"I loved working at Bed Bath & Beyond; they have a great team of customer-focused staff who work with you everyday to help you hone your customer service and retail skills. I enjoyed my time working there and getting to know customers as people, relating to them and helping them with home improvement/renovation projects, and overall learning more about it myself. My only complaint would be that they need to pay more, especially for those who work at the customer service desk. The job is very fast-paced and you must think on your feet and be ready to help with complicated orders at any given moment. It can definitely be very stressful at times."
good,"Very customer focus and team driven. Always seeking better ways to create a unique customer experience. Bed Bath and Beyond has a fast paced environment were I would lead my sales team to take care of customers ,increase sales and maximize profits."
good,The interview was pretty easy as long as you look clean and can communicate well. I basically had two interviews back to back. Everyone was very friendly and made you feel comfortable.
good,I have learned to be extremely flexible and open to changing my work hours. I sometimes work 8 to 10 days in a row with how the schedules get done. It is extremely short staffed so every person who works there is invaluable in their own sort of way so I have learned that help is hard to come by and how to not lose that help with improper treatment.
good,"This was my first job and I have to say that I did enjoy my time here. "
good,"I worked there for nearly 7 years, and tried to advance but the training wasn't great. I believe since I left there have been several positive changes but I'm unsure. It's a decent job for the younger generations."
good,"It's an ok business to work for, it's a shame there's not that much availability when it pertains to promotions/advancements. The one upside to working for them is how work day scheduling is done, they are very flexible."
good,When I started we were a team with a very well informed and educated manager and supervisor. When I decided to resign the management was poor and so was the supervisor skills and knowledge.
good,"management is good they're not bad and everyone is genuinely friendly "
good,Bed Bath is going through a transformation of Executives and trying to move the company into an innovative business to be more competitively inline with the Targets and HomeGoods that are taking over the industry.
good,"Typical day was the same as any other day."
good,A lot of learning of product knowledge to help better identify and target what customers are looking for. Fast paced environment along with close knit workers for a friendly work place.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is good. Compensation/Benefits are not bad. Job Security/Advancement are best  Management more than average."
good,"This job was fairly easy but at some times it could get very stressful and very fast paced. Especially during holidays, that is the most hectic time to work there."
good,Work is productive and has a well managed work environment. The company has well planned out work schedules. the company focuses on the relationship of customers and employees
good,"The individuals and environment that they provide at Bed Bath and Beyond is lovely. It's incredibly hard to get fired from this job if you tried, as the managers don't blame you for chatting occasionally during downtime when there are few customers."
good,"Had many great managers and coworkers over the years. Hours were to variable. Some weeks you could have 4 some weeks 35 without notice. "
good,I actually liked working here but the customers got very mean at some points. If you plan on working here make sure you have a backbone because these people will do anything to use their 20% of coupon.
good,They let go of their good Employees to pay a new employee less money. They rather expend more time training than paying. People come and go except those that have been there years more than 9 or 10 years.
good,It was a great job with people i enjoyed working with we ALL had a great time working there once we did and followed what was suppose to be done it was a good atmosphere
good,"Job was pretty simple. Some days are busier than others, but overall not anything you cant handle. As a floor associate, you just put up freight and tidy up the different rooms. You make sure that the customers are finding what they need and if not, you order the items online for them."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond has been a great experience for me. They have let me grow starting from the back in receiving to Management. Bed Bath and Beyond is a wonderful place to work nothing wrong with the company . I was just wanting something different . I am very great ful for them letting me work for them, for showing me all that i know."
good,Customer service is key. You have to be a multitasking person as there is a lot to do and help customers at the same time. You have to be a self starter and have a good sense of urgency.
good,A typical work day feels as though you are doing a lot more than they pay you for. The hardest part of the job is to have to pick up the slack since there are not enough workers.
good,This is a very fast paced place where you interact with many different people. You get to learn about a lot of the products they sell. Make sure you have comfortable shoes.
good,"Working here wa sgdsat hen it started , there were one fr if hours and long shifts , then as the store started not making enough hours were cut and I had to seek employment elsewhere "
good,Bed bath and beyond gives you a place to grow your management skills and lead skills and people skills as well. It helps you learn how to manage your time wisely and be organized and how to prioritize.
good,"I do enjoy working here for the most part, it has a great many perks and there are a lot of fun and interesting things to learn."
good,"Be prepared to get thrown straight into action"
good,I loved everyone I worked with and management was great. I just needed to leave to take time for my family. But they where very flexible and patient with me and I very much appreciate them for that.
good,fast and quick pace somewhat competitive if you work on sales if you work the pay is decent the hours are terrible .  if you work  stocker you switch between night and morning.
good,It is a great place to meet people-friends. Most everybody gets along. Management can be a bit laid back at times. The work pace on a normal day is steady to fast.
good,"Alright job for part time employment. Not many opportunities for advancement, but they will work with your schedule. Great for students. Essentially, you will get out of the job what you put in to it."
good,"Relaxed culture, Great co-workers! The pay is fair! Hour lunch break is greatly appreciated! I would recommend this call center to anyone who is looking for a career in call center management."
good,I loved working there. It had a great feel about it. Everyone that worked there were very genuine people. The management never made me take the heat when it came to irritate customers.
good,"I enjoyed the learning process at BB&B. You go through Bed Bath & Beyond University, where you take classes on different products and how to sell them."
good,"BBB has a great training program in place, with opportunities to grow and move up in the company. Its customer service policy makes it so that every associate is empowered to help customers."
good,Career advancement is easy. Management isn't the greatest. Always busy working. Cheap company. Doesn't start out enough pay. Employees are taken advantage of by district.
good,"i worked in the bath dept. and i basically folded towels rugs and straightened up shelves. easy work, and when it gets slow and things are all done, you just wait for people to come."
good,This company is a great place to start at if you are just starting off in college or a senior in high school. If working retail is what you want to do this is also a good place to come to. Although I do not like that they do annual raises cause you grow and learn more in 6 months and I believe that should be something they change. They have a good discount fro employees but if they would change it that would be a plus. Hardest part of the job for me is when a customer gives you attitude about something you have no control over and then they get mad at me for no reason and all I can do is smile and say I'm sorry. But there are a few customers who make the experience enjoyable like they say you are doing an awesome job after someone has just insulted you or when they understand that sometimes stores get busy and they might have to stand in line for a few minutes.
good,It's alright if you want to get a feel for customer service and sales. The job can  be overly difficult at times for what its worth but its not a career. It is another stepping stone job is all.
good,I worked for Harmon for 5 years. I learned alot and I was able to provide customers with top customer service. I enjoyed going to work every day and I liked seeing regular customers!
good,"Days at work begin slow but always pick up. Weekdays include fixing and making displays or working on various projects around the store. Recovering the store from the previous days, storing and stocking shelves with new merchandise. Culture is very fast paced, detail oriented, customer service focused. Requirement to know how to use a point-of-sale register, make change from cash transactions and know merchandise around the store. Require good communication skills, patience, ability to type on a computer, climb ladders and lift upwards of 75+ pounds occasionally."
good,"Working at bed bath and Beyond was a very easy going job. Basically only had to pick out items, scan and box them up . Management could of been a little better but overall not a bad workplace."
good,"Day start with freight forward to floor and top & back stocking"
good,"Fun place to work. Great atmosphere. Opportunity to work all different positions so as to not be stuck doing the same thing. Flexible scheduling . Only down fall is the pay. I have worked there for a year now, and have moved up to receiving and as a key holder and I was only given a $.20 raise. I'm 43 and don't even make $10 an hour. I can always leave, but I enjoy the people."
good,"It is a very customer heavy environment, you must be outgoing and friendly. There are a variety of things that an employee may do on a given day from stocking to cashiering."
good,"Good company to work for . Some very talented people with good work ethic . Have to be able to change on a dime and consistently change direction . "
good,"A typical day is the routine to follow "
good,"Typical day at BBBY is putting replenish away and helping customers. When it's slow we're zoning or working on projects. "
good,Ive worked here for almost 2 years as a sales associate and as a receiving associate/freight handler. A lot of good experience helping customers and learning about products. Good management and co workers. Easy job to learn and good salary.
good,Schedule fluctuates a bit but overall a nice place to work.Managers are friendly.Most things are learned by repetition so easy to pick up on things fast.
good,Lack of communication amongst employees they do mot pay you what your worth some managers expect you to do your job and there job and you can never get help when you need it.
good,Pay was pretty good for this job. Lacked on raises. Organization and procedures were strong and reliable. Cleanliness was very good as well. Incentives for employees was great.
good,"It's a fast-paced environment; however, because of everything being home related, its easier to relate to customers as of what product(s) would look nice in their homes."
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond has allowed me to move forward in the retail industry.  I was given an opportunity to take charge of an umfamiliar role.  Being a lead at Bed Bath and Beyond is rewarding and challenging.  Like any store, leads, managers, and supervisors alike have different ways of doing their jobs.  That allowed me to push myself to become a better person and leader.  Anyone who works for Bed Bath and Beyond have equal opportunities to use their skills and gain new ones in a diverse environment."
good,On average I processed customers purchases and helped direct them throughout the store. At time it got very busy and other times were spent organizing shleves.
good,Most days where normally  non stop . i would load the trailers with packages for 7hours a day. every once in a while there would be some down time but for the most part it would be extremely busy. overall i think it was an ok job .
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond is only easy once you've been working there long enough, as it is with any job. Retail is horrible, especially when you don't like people. As for the experience, you learn quickly and easily but a lot of management is very complacent about whether or not you know something well. It's one of those learn on the job jobs. It was exhausting, but I'm thankful the journey they gave me even though I only worked there a couple months. It showed me what I do and do not want. Moreso do not want."
good,I only worked at Bed Bath & Beyond for 7 months while I was a freshman in college but it was a nice first job. They worked around my school schedule very well and the customers were friendly almost all of the time. Granted it’s srjll retail so it’s never perfect but I always recommend people to work there.
good,"Fair pay for hard work."
good,"Working at bed bath and beyond was great because for my first job it got me experience in dealing with people, and learning how to work with others to keep a company going. The people were very nice and my coworkers made every day a blast."
good,"Very easy to work with the people who were already working there. Many nice people. Relatively slow paced job, even in a fast-paced marketplace.  Lots of enjoyable people."
good,Management and Scheduling are very reasonable and understanding.  Moving up in the company is very possible.  Customers will always give you a hard time but in the 2 stores that I have worked at I have never had an issue with any management staff or other employees that I worked with
good,"The job was pretty easy, although they were always under staffed so i had to do a lot of different jobs through out the store. My favorite part of the job was helping customers find what they were looking for"
good,"Good company to work for if you reside in Lewisville, Tx area. Don't approve of the point system in place used when absent or tardy! Must be willing to be cross-trained in different areas because of hig turn over rate at company which creates understaffed shifts. Diverse work culture with multiple nationalities as well. Hardest part of job is during peak season or holidays."
good,"Management was very understanding of any situation, as long as there was a notice ahead of time and the quick paced environment was great experience as anything could be asked of you to be handled quickly and efficiently."
good,"Helping customers find their products, taking out the trash, stocking, store assistant. I learned how to interact with peope, how to answer a phone, how to use the online website. My work place was open and comfortable. The hardest part of my job was trying to help all the customers at once. I enjoyed talking to people."
good,Its a fun up pace job to work at all mangers are fair and deal with things the right way. Works are also great helpful when your coming into the company as a new hire.
good,"A typical work day for a cashier is to make sure that the guests are leaving happy and with a good last impression."
good,"Laid off in August company kept it very quite , I"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a nice company to work for, managers work as hard if not harder than associates. Product comes in daily helping to keep you busy. Training is mandatory so associates can better help customers find the perfect product which is greatly appreciated by most and they are more than willing to let you know if you are doing a good job."
good,"I love the job there but it is physically exhausting and the pay does not meet my needs."
good,"The workplace was a lot to work with but it eventually got simpler and was easier to understand. It is a great work environment. Great management to work with. Flexible with hours as long as you put in requests. The hours were easy and shorter shifts except for on the weekends, they were longer. If you worked a 7 hour shift, you were given a paid lunch."
good,A typical day would be making sure the store is in order and neat. Helping customers as they approach me to ask questions about a certian item.  Hardest part of the job was the slow pace work enviroment.
good,"being able to work efficiently under stressful enviroments, productive. great team work, great management. getting along well with co workers, fun environment to work in."
good,"Cashiering, up selling if we can. Sometimes they would have gift card give away for who ever up sold the most. Basic cleaning on every shift. During busy seasons help put anyway shipments stock shelf's."
good,"the culture is relaxed, you work independently without supervision which is great because who wants somebody micro managing over your shoulder, right? Just get your work done in a timely manner and they will love you. Great team to work with, upbeat for the most part, very helpful if you have a lot of work on your plate. It can get boring sitting at your desk all day if you finished all of your work. The caf sells okay food but there are plenty of places to order from. I would prefer more PTO. You have to wait a year to apply to other positions in the company."
good,"Good part time job which allows for flexible hours, where the customer always comes first.  Team work is a definate must and customer service is number 1."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was an interesting experience and taught me much both professionally and socially. Speaking to supervisors and customers helps with developing interpersonal skills. I would recommend this job to someone who is strictly looking for part time work or students in high school or college looking for an after school or summer job. Depending on availability there may be more or less hours for some to work.
good,Generally stayed busy for most of the time I worked there. It did sometimes get pretty slow but you can always find something to do. The hardest part of the job is standing for long hours and occasionally lifting things but nothing too heavy. If it was too heavy you would have help of course. Once you start to remember the layout of the store and how things operate it isn't a hard job.
good,"Schedules constantly change. If you don't check your schedule daily, you may miss a shift. OPs only posts changes by highlighting the name on the printed board."
good,"Very enjoyable work place, nice colleagues and customers, You get a joy out of helping the customers with cool products. Very good benefits and a great company! Thought about going back truthfully."
good,"All daily operational activities were all based on having everything ready to give our customers the best experience possible. This allowed all managers, and associates to focus on driving sales through service."
good,Asks a lot of their associates but give the tools needed to be successful. It can be hard work but you leave feeling accomplished. The company is generally really flexible with their hours and are willing to work with your schedule demands.
good,"Results driven culture."
good,"I have learned a lot from the customers, as well as my managers in regards to using coupons, and how to properly decorate a home. The most difficult thing about working there is trying to please everyone but since that is impossible, I do the best I can and that seems to suffice."
good,"Very high-paced, need to be able to multi-task. They are very customer service orientated but sometimes very hard to meet those goals with payroll hours and tasks."
good,It was a fun job fast paced sometimes and was a helping community if someone needed help somebody will come over and help and the hours they give are flexible if you need it to be.
good,They work well with students that are in school and parents. You get to work with new people every day. The staff and managers are very understanding and help in every way that you need them too.
good,Fun place to work. learned basics or ordering from multiple vendors. Management in some cases was unqualified for position. Enjoyed helping customers.
good,"Wonderful work experience. Cross training in most departments gave the full persecutive on how each department works, and comes together to create the store experience for each customer. Managers were knowledgeable on all products and would assist without hesitation; which in return allowed for each associate to learn a new lesson each day as products were constantly evolving. At times the hours were long, including over night inventory team. Some times may have put a strain on the legs when lifting, but it was all part of the job."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a good place to gain customer service skills. I learned a lot about how to communicate with customers in store and over the phone. They provide cross-training which means that you will spend your work days cashing out people, placing online orders, and being on the sales floor. I love my bed bath family and working with them. The work culture is great which makes it a fun job to show up to every shift."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of checking out customers and doing returns and exchanges. During slower times I would make list of items to pull from the stockroom, go get and refill those items, and order items we needed. If there were any customer conflicts I would help the cashiers to solve those issues and take care of the customers. Upset customers are the hardest part of the job. You must remain calm and professional no matter what the customers say. The managers are all very good at their jobs and take care of the employees the best that they can. Another difficult part is not getting too personal with the managers and other employees. I do enjoy the people i work with and I like the job itself. I enjoy being so knowledgeable and experienced since i have worked there for several years."
good,I found this a very enjoyable place to work with many friendly and helpful coworkers. I felt that this business was very well run with helpful managers that were always willing to give support to their employees.
good,"I worked both sides of the company floor, you learn  a lot  about the products so you can help customers with making a purchase choice. Opportunities for advancement is high."
good,"The staff, including the supervisors are friendly, supportive and understanding. "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, customers around the clock and their is always something to do."
good,"Great people, not great compensation. Very dependent on teamwork,especially closing staff. They're good about cross training. Helpful when you need it, and have good communication."
good,"Nice people to work with, It's an easy job that most people think they could get away with. Can get pretty busy during the holidays.  Customer service and safety are their number 1 priorities"
good,You would clock in and check to see if any cart's needed to be brought back to the floor. I learned that coupons never expire. The management is ok it can be a lot better. The environment is ok some workers can be very negative at times. The hardest part is dealing with the rude customers. the most enjoyable part is walking out the door at closing.
good,Working for a chain like Bed Bath is a very stable place where an entry level worker can gain various fundamental skills of the service industry. It's great for college kids trying to make some part time money.
good,but it is not the best career. Not much room for growth. The better at your job the more you stuck at it. You before a position of need so poor managers can focus energy elsewhere.
good,"Was always busy at this job, always had work to do had good team members to work with mangers help out when they could and help train me pretty fast  wish I had more hour but other then that was a cool place to work at"
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a good place to work you can meet a lot of good people and it is a very good place if you want to do networking causer you never know who you are going to meet when your  working. Bed Bath  and Beyond has a great staff that is always wiling to fulfill all customers desires and expectations and is always open to help any and everyone.
good,"Most of the locations management is qualified an fun to work with, team motivated. Pay is bad, raises regardless of performance are bad but the people you work with are great."
good,"This was a nice company to work for.  The pay was not great, but a good experience for part time work. I enjoyed assisting the customers, who were always grateful for the help.  They really stress customer service here."
good,"very kind staff, welcoming, work well with schedule but hard to change availability. pay well, crazy during holidays and customers are horrendous but they paycheck makes it worth it"
good,Retail is the job I am most familiar with. Although I am too experienced I can learn fast and I am great with people and love to get to know them and like helping customers with what it is they're looking for.
good,"Tight knit group of employees focused on service, great place to work, always something to do, great place for newlyweds to shop, reasonable expectations."
good,"Retail jobs are never easy. A corporation tends to be more difficult. I loved the customers and the merchandise. I loved the days when the managers who could be productive and polite worked. That being said , there were managers who seemed to relish in upsetting the workers. This inconsistency led to stress for me. I ended up leaving due to my moving, but in all honesty having multiple bosses give you contradicting instructions was tiring and I don't know how much longer I could have done it."
good,Great atmosphere. Good structure and team building. I enjoyed working! Some tasks got you exercise  which is always a bonus.
good,Working at Bed Bath and Beyond is a great working experience. Customer Service is something that I get too partake in on a daily basis from the moment I clock in until the moment I clock out. I work with some awesome people and the management team is cool.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was a fun place to work. They were very accommodating to my school schedule. Managers and employees made it a fun environment to work in.
good,A typical day at work is usually just helping customers with what they need to find. The turn over rate is usually pretty high because most people think its just going to be an easy job that you do not have to do much.  The hardest part of the job is picky clientele that anger easily. The easiest part of the job is the sometimes laid back environment. The management are some of the hardest working people who do not just sit in an office and delegate.
good,"Maintaining and managing small group of employees, making sure that all daily tasks are completed in timely manner, making sure customer is a number one priority, learning features and benefits of new item and teaching the team how to sell it..."
good,Same as before I need an office job with more hours. Management is great. They have worked well with me and my schedule needs. I am hoping for full time.
good,A once wonderful place to work that has digressed over the years to no longer care for it's employees. I learned a lot over the past 16 years. I have advanced from sales associate to management.
good,"Overall, Bed Bath & Beyond is a great place to work for as a college student, but has no room for advancement. The co-workers are great to work with, everybody is very friendly."
good,"No matter which location you work at, you will always find someone who you will get close to that makes the day go by faster. Bed Bath & Beyond is flexible with schedules. Depending the size of your store, you can experience a very high traffic of customers. You have to be able to stand for long periods of time and come in with a smile on your face. I love the culture and family of workers. However, it can be draining when working at a big store."
good,This is more of a customer service oriented work  that requires  a lot of communication with guests and customers . And I work with a group of people who who believe in team efforts which has been really great.
good,"I would answer phone calls, be in charge of all cashiers, open and close the store, do paper work and money orders. management could have been better."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a company with a family oriented culture. They work together to accomplish daily assignments. The atmosphere if very welcoming and all members of the staff are very supportive and encouraging.
good,Manager is very accomadating with scheduling what u can work.   There is lots to do in very little time.   Customers come first.  They have a person for training people to help u learn.  You need to work hard and do your job to move up.  Managers recognize those that do their job with little complaining.   Never a boring day.  Lazy people don't last.   People that listen and pay attention are successful.
good,"I was thrown into the mix I wasn't given proper training classes that were supposed to be given. I learned that customer service is key to retail, and management is important keeping everything organized and professional"
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond LLC in many ways is much better than the average retail environment but at the same time no better. For first-hand experience in dealing with the general public and a good discount on all merchandise, I would highly recommend anyone who either needs experience and/or is of college age to work here. You will learn a lot, meet a myriad of interesting people and learn how to deal with the general public. In doing so, you will ideally not only have more compassion for establishments that are rather busy and it *seems* like you are not being attended to but you will also be able to empathize. Again, great for the experience but not necessarily for career growth. To each his/her own."
good,Great place to work with helpful friendly and diverse associates and managers. Overall customer satisfaction is the main Objective!! I really miss working there  and I consider cedar hill store employees as family...I honestly probably still would be there if i would was advanced to full time and better pay!
good,While a decent job management doesn't really take into account the skills of their employees to match them to a job. Also it's a fight to switch to another job in the same store (almost impossible to make any advancement whether by title or pay). But it's a secure job and they're flexible with employees' schedules.
good,"I had a customer service position, so it seemed pretty easy. But I think the amount of extra chores and tasks they want you to complete is hardly worth only 8.50/hour."
good,"A typical day at Bed, Bath and Beyond consists of managing employees to provide amazing customer service, managing merchandise, providing training and follow up with the goal of selling.  There is continuous change and re-prioritizing tasks and duties, which I find challenging, but exciting.  Management deals with the same ever-changing priorities, so effective communication is key.  The hardest part of the job for me is balancing work and life with the extended work schedule."
good,"My time at bed, bath and beyond has introduced me to the funnest people and given me a great knowledge of products I love, SHOUT OUT TO BEDDING!!! It was no place to make a career, considering the pay and the small amount of hours. cooperate is also constantly looming, but if you can deal with that, than have a blast :)"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to work, if you're okay with ladders! The managers are great and make you feel like you're part of the family!"
good,"What I usually get to do is in the mornings we pull freight out to the floor and put away what needs filling and put away that is over stock. You learn plenty from the safety of the store to the guest needs. Management there are all friendly and easy to talk too, so are the coworkers there. We all learn to be a big happy family."
good,I had a good experience at Bed Bath & Beyond.  I was being trained and would need to transfer to Seattle to become a District Audit Manager.  My spouse had just purchased 3 Hallmark store in the Boise area and couldn't move.  I left BB&B to go to work for the family business.
good,It was a great environment to learn a lot about retail. Friendly associates and managers. Flexible hours and competitive  pay
good,Co workers are very friendly. We have fun events like contests if you dressed up on black friday with a christmas ugly sweater. If you are working at the front desk it can be a little stressful because not all of the time you can call people up to help.
good,"A typlical day for an ALPM, is to managing multiple retail concepts under the Bed Bath and Beyond umbrella. Created and implemented shrink and safety awareness programs for all four retail concepts. Gain by end from management and store employees to lower shrink and cost associated with general liability and workers compensation claims. Analyzed exception reports to investigate company employees. Partner with District Managers to implement company policy and programs. Investigated and interviewed store management and organized retail crime activities for theft, fraud, embezzlement."
good,"A typical day at work entails several different tasks, objectives and goals, ergo always having a ""plan of action"" and a solid routine is a must.  On average, I work no less than 50 hours per week.  I have many many roles in my position at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Here are just a few examples of what I do on a day to day basis- albeit, no one day is the same- "
good,You get overworked and under compensated day in and day out. But they wont fire you just cut your hours until you quit. Would not recommend
good,"Easily felt like the big fish in a small pond as coworkers frequently skirted responsibility, and leave me to pick up the slack. Though management did well to motive and reward hard work, I ultimately had to leave for another opportunity elsewhere."
good,"The work environment was kept very professional, and organized. The management could have been more respectful, and kind to employees. Fair hours were given to all employees each work week."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond isn't too bad to work at, but the management kind of sucks. Also, if your a floor associate you get paid as much as a cashier which sucks in my opinion because when your on the floor you do way more work, and they usually only give you a raise yearly, so like I said that sucks. I do think Bed Bath and Beyond has great customer service and they do take pride in taking care of their customers, but when it comes to their employees I wouldn't say the same."
good,It was a fast paced environment. The co-workers were nice. The management met with us before work began and after the lunch break. I learned how to work in a warehouse atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at work involves restocking the floor, interacting with customers to answer their questions and resolve their problems. Co-workers are easy to work with and are willing to communicate. The Hardest part of the job is learning to work with different managing styles within the same place. The most enjoyable part for me is working with the customers to solve their problems."
good,The people are very friendly and easy to work with.  It was a great workplace where I learned a lot more about selling techniques.  We also provide excellent customer service!
good,"A typical day at work is stocking shelves, assisting customers find the products they are looking for and working the cash register. The coworkers are great and management can be fun too. Feels like a close knit family."
good,This company was a strong customer service focus with the customer always being put first. They had great training programs and made sure their associates knew about the products they sold through continual classes on merchandise each day.
good,"can be over whelming. Managers on site tend to be passive agressive and rarely helpful. Tend to change and swap out mangers frequently. Sometimes the swaps are good, sometimes bad."
good,Working at cold stone was a high paced environment. it was fun and is a great place work if you are just entering into the work filed.
good,A great company to advance. The management respects you and it's an environment in which you can interact with a variety of people due to the wide demographics.
good,"Overall a good job. Hours were usually scarce, the wonderful customers that would come into the store everyday made all of your problems vanish."
good,"A Typical day at work is very fast paced. As you come in to work there are customers waiting to use ur assistance. I learn alot of new things at work such as new products, how a certain product machine/gadget work, and i also learn new things on the registers and the system software. The co-workers are very friendly and helpful we carry around walkie talkies to get help from others when we need it. Example if I had to get a high box from the top shelve in a stockroom i would call to the nearest associate that can assist me. My job was not hard at all. I love helping the customers find anything there looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the customers would return and tell you how great that product was and how great the service was, It makes me feel good that I really helped that person out."
good,"very tough on your family, very fun work place.........................."
good,was a team player during job with other co workers. and positive
good,"A typical day was very fasted paced, i learned how to assist customers in what they needed, co-works were great, the hardest part was putting away all the boxes but i managed, enjoyable was being with co-workers"
good,"I worked about 20-25 hours a week. I learned different computer systems and different ways of customer service. I had to answer pones and check people out, do returns, stock shelves, fold towels. I was all over the place. Management was very flexible with the schedule and making sure everyone needed the days they wanted or needed days off. Again, the hardest part of the job, because it was such a big store was finding items and making sure they were in the right spot and easy to get to for the customers. The most enjoyable was participating in the team skill building exercises we did before each day or when we had team meetings. Everyone got together was able to help everyone else out."
good,A normal day at work is pack & busy. I'm always learning new things around the store and where things are and how they work or where there been moved. and whats new to the store. There's a manager in every department. you have co workers that like to work and ones that don't. you have your day when you feel like you work way more then they are but its be like that sometimes. The hardest part of the job was when the lines were long and i mean long and making sure they found everything and keeping that smile on there face. but the hardest hardest part was the suggested item for the month and try to sell it to the customers when you know they don't want it. but the best and joy was the smile on the customers faces when I helped to the best I know.
good,"I enjoy working there. i go to school and work there and they work with me, which is great."
good,Good place to work and advance. Focus on customer service and safety. Learned what true customer service is and how to deliver it on a consistent basis. Lots of physical work on a daily basis moving up and down the ladders and moving large amounts of merchandise all throughout the store.
good,Great Company. Great Benefits. Hours are long and work/life balance is challenging. Overall you couldn't ask for more out of a retail company.
good,"Productive, very busy workplace.  Never the ""same day"" in a week.  "
good,"The job could be fun and everyone was nice most of the time.  The way the store is managed is completely unorganized and chaotic so everyone secretly hates eachother, which is annoying.  But, if you are seeking immediate employment with decent pay and overtime opportunities, this is a good job."
good,"One of the better employers in retail. They at least try to be fair to their employees, and the work day is varied. Never boring (barring that cataclysmic snow storm this place stays open for). "
good,Work hours were longer than expected ad inconsistent.  Lunch breaks were short.
good,"Depending on the time of day I am scheduled to work; in the mornings I would clock into my shift and prepare the shelves or registers ready for the store to be opened. Throughout the day if I am on the sales floor I would continually replenish the shelves while greeting and assisting customers through out the day. I also do Beyond store orders which is a process of ordering items for customers if we do not carry a product in stores. When we get in a customer that is interested in creating a registry with us we do everything we can to assist them promptly to make sure they get everything they need on their registry. We also tell those who should shop off of their registry about our free complementary gift packaging they can do themselves. And also let them be aware that if they should need any help with it then we are available to assist them if they need it. By the end of the day once we make sure every customer has left the building by doing a security walk we go on to cleaning up the floors, restrooms, customer service, close registers, clock out of shift and prepare to go home for the day."
good,"Overall, Bed Bath and Beyond was a good place to work. A typical day consisted in a lot of customer service, and going out of our way to make sure the customer is 100 percent satisfied and leaves the store with everything they need. There was also a lot of selling involved in every work day, which I was very good at. I really enjoyed working at Bed Bath and Beyond, and I really enjoyed all the loyal customers I obtained through great customer service."
good,"I was a cashier at bed bath and beyond for a summer. It was just a seasonal job for me at the time, before I continued my education. While I worked there I enjoyed my experience. I assisted costumers near the front of the store, as well as greeting them upon entry. As a cashier I was the last person the costumer spoke to. Costumer service was our number one priority."
good,"Get a lot of customer relations experience, enjoy my co-workers and have made new friends, really long or short shifts and work most weekends, enjoy most aspects of my job."
good,"Busy most days, everyone is extremely friendly and helpful throughout the day. Especially managers; it is extremely refreshing to be surrounded by managers who are able and willing to help all coworkers. The only downside about the job are the coupons!!!!! The customers lay out all of their coupons and ask you to figure it out, however at the same time they want to instruct which coupons go to what. CONFUSING!! Overall experience pleasant.. "
good,"On a typical day at Bed, Bath & Beyond, the energy is productive with customers flowing in and out of the doors, along with great team members such as the department managers who are willing to assist you in every obstacle necessary. I recieved alot of product knowledge and customer service tactics to ensure the needs of the consumer. One of the hardest parts of the job is inventory, with so many items and gadgets that BBB merchandise it can be a swirling world of issues trying to track every piece of merchandise. Now, the most enjoyable part of the job is qualifying a satisfied customer and basically walking them through their shopping experience at BBB. From fulfillin wedding registries and baby showers, down to e household items."
good,As a regular associate you are pretty much going to get bossed around all day until you get some seniority. It is a great place to work when you are in college because they teach you hard work.
good,"Over the years you will learn how to adapt to stressful situations and will learn how to become more efficient.  Typically, you spend half your day reviewing bridal, sales and customer service results.  The rest of your day you deal with HR issues, conference calls and walking stores on a predetermined schedule."
good,-Best job I had yet.
good,I enjoy helping people find what they want or need. It is personally rewarding to be a customer service trainer and bridal consultant for BB&B. I have interaction with co-workers and guests daily which really fulfills my day.
good,"really fun workplace, managers and co-workers are all really really nice and fun to be around, we have little contests sometimes and well it's really busy all the time so you're always doing something which is also really good."
good,Strong company that is debt free. Great associates. Good culture. Very hands on
good,"A typical day at work involved reviewing quantities sold and ordering goods into the store based on an ordering schedule. Then determining with department managers, their take on the business and how to capitalize by ordering the right product at the right time and place. Then, coaching how merchandise should be presented for the customer. The hardest part of the job was always being required to do more with less. Of the 4 city stores, the general company philosophy is to always be mindful of hours and payroll."
good,"clock in and go to my customer service desk and check out customers and help with returns,answer phones, help customers with complaints or issues they may have."
good,"Working for Bed Bath & Beyond was a wonderful experience. The customer service the company upholds is outstanding. The training of the merchandise definitely increased sales, and worked hand and hand with customer service. I recieved the most satisfaction seeing the customers walk out of the store happy and pleased this their purchase. Just to know you helped make a customer for life makes my day."
good,"Fantastic place to work! Great part time employment, great people, fantastic products and just overall fantastic work environment."
good,"A typical day at work would be me checking the work calandar to see what project I have to do for the day. Doing some training on a new product, refresher class to the associates who have worked for 6mo/1yr. Covering a side of the store if we are short of coverage.I have learned time managment.Management are a good group of people the try to do right by the employees and the store. The co-workers are hard worker you have the bad apples but it doesn't stop the store from running. The hardest part of my job is getting the training done because of the amount of employees we have. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,I learned how to merchandise and to set up displays according to planograms.
good,Was a good Job for me and I liked the pay.
good,"Bed, Bath & Beyond is an interesting work place where there is a personal involvement in both customer and employee (especially the managers or MODs). Employees are encouraged to learn as much about the products and interactions with customers to improve the quality of the store's experience and somewhat to the employee's personal development."
good,Fun places to work for a colloge job. Managment was fun and so where the co workers.
good,Constant organizing but similar routine day in and day out. A place to make friends but also work hard.
good,"First off, if you're going to work retail, virtually of the stereotypes apply. There's some minor adjustments, though."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was my first job and it is one I will always remember. On a typical day I would report to work and check out all customers. I eventually moved up to customer service where I would process returns and handle customer calls and complaints. I learned a lot about the retail environment and gained essential cash handling experience. My coworkers were the greatest. The whole team formed such an intense bond and friendship and I still keep in touch with most of them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry or rude customers and maintaining a warm and pleasant demeanor. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and meeting friendly customers everyday and meeting their needs
good,When I worked at Bed Bath & Beyond it was amazing. I loved the environment and I even loved the customers. Even though customers had complaints it was ok because the customer is always right. I felt this was the best job I ever had.
good,"A typical day at work involes answering phones, cashiering and assisting customers for about 8 hours a shift. The management is very good, they do what they need to do to keep the store at its best, and they will go out of their way to accomodate you if needed. The hardest part about this job is being on your feet for 8 hours at a time."
good,"A typical work day consist of daily scheduling, accecpting and planning freight, asstisting customers, coaching and training associates, daily audits, planning for weeks ahead, calanders task, communications with management staff, e-mails, following up with associates, supply orders, inventory control, price management. The management team and co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job, they become your extended family, the hardest part is not completing your job duties daily."
good,Great co workers and great management. If working the opening shift then its unload freight and assist customers. If you work nights its assist customers and restock and clean. The great thing you get great product knowledge
good,"Get there at 9:00am and open the doors and check new emails and voicemails. Not much, is regular office work. The owner is a wonderful person and a hard worker, as well as her husband. None. Being myself. The paycheck pretty much."
good,Working with the customers was the high light of my day. The people that came into the store had very good personalitys. and they made if fun going to work everyday.
good,"A typical day at work is to insure that the store is properly staffed, store is stocked, clean, and organized for customers, ensure that the incoming freight is received in a timely and accurate manner. Help customer needs and process transaction effiectively, make sure inventory in replenished and reorderd, make sure we process returns and damages that need to be returned to vendors, and at the end of the night make sure all closing procedures are being followed."
good,Overall good comapany. No complaints I had an good experience working at Bed Bath & Beyond.
good,I enjoy working at this company. I mostly enjoy the customers that come in because they are so pleasant and its nice to know our customer service keeps them coming back again.
good,The larger the company gets the less it cares about its employees
good,I quite enjoyed working at Bed Bath and Beyond specifically because of the customer service values. It was the one company I have ever worked for that truly puts the customer first. There wasn't really anything we couldn't do for our customers to ensure they walked out our doors completely satisfied.
good,Great pay. Mostly overtime pay. Great nd helpful people to work with. Large amount of space and areas to have break and lunches. Management is motivating and helpful.
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond has shown me to appreciate have a calmer job. Working there is very fast-paced and there is always someone to help which did make the time go faster and I met a lot of good people.  Management is always there to help you, no matter big or small. Workplace culture is somewhat segregated because working at a place this big, there is so much to do that we employees pass each other and just say hi because that is all we had time for. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting someone what they have been looking for and making sure they left with the coupon added to their receipt."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is going through management changing. The company is closing several stores and downsizing.  If you do not love providing customer service and attending to  customer needs, do not able."
good,I worked here for years. I didn’t make a lot but something about the company just made me feel good about working there. The customer service was excellent and there was no arguing with customers cus they were always right. I liked it a lot.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a fun place to work at as long as you have a flexible schedule. Not the most ideal place for a high school student, but a good choice for a college job or out of school job. The work environment was demanding and fast-paced and there was never a dull moment. The staff was welcoming and friendly to new team members. Managers were strict on taking days off, but if you have more availability it shouldn't be a problem. The best part of working there aside from meeting wonderful customers was the free coffee in the break room."
good,The location I worked at was pretty decent. Upper management changed hands multiple times while I worked there but the other managers were steady. The hardest part of the job was the entitlement of some of the customers but any customer issues were easily solved with a positive and empathetic attitude as well as readily available managers to pass the buck to. I loved my coworkers and the regular customers I would get but my favorite part of the job was the discount. I really upgraded my household while working there.
good,Challenging environment and can get very hectic at times. You have to be fast and agile and should be able to work long hours.Need extensive knowledge in household products
good,A typical day was good and was pretty easy. It was usually busy. The managers made sure that we always had work to do. Everyone got along with each other well.
good,The hours aren't consistent the manager never has the schedule right always last minute changes and overlaps the schedule so the days that you have off you really don't
good,Excellent space provided for breaks. Provided water coolers and ice. Clean and organized. Detailed one on one training with attainable goals. Flexible work schedules.
good,"I love the environment and the staff"
good,"Typical day at work - Have morning coffee. Read up on emails. Plan the work day ahead. Work in agile teams with short 15-minute daily status meetings. Progress in monitored and measured in 2-week sprints. Take lunch for an hour. Continue work until the end of the day. Cafeteria is available for coffee/tea breaks."
good,"good team work environment "
good,"If you're a local, and looking for part time money, this is a great, and comfortable, job."
good,typical day at  is we punch at 7am  and receive the truck process the merchandise and stack it on cages or u boats to push to the floor to be packed out.
good,The work load wasn't too crazy... I've gotten along with everyone smoothly. It's a fun and busy place to work. There's never a dull moment at Bed Bath & Beyond.
good,Resolving highly escalated customer issues. Process tax-exempt forms and refunds on tax-exempt orders. Place new orders and process refund replacements on an order that was lost/damaged.
good,"I worked at Bed, Bath, and Beyond part time to make extra money. I liked many of the employees and customers. It seemed like they went through part timers because the pay and hours were not ideal."
good,It’s an ok place to work but the managers are so rude n I feel like they don’t care bout us new hires they have there picks ... so I’m willing to come work for you guys company
good,the atmosphere there is welcoming. All of us work fairly well one another and management does their best to keep things running smooth and time efficient.
good,Flexible hours and easy to get time off if you give an advance. Mandatory breaks are given. Easy pace and realistic goals set. Management is nice and very friendly.
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond was greeting the customers frequently, make sure to help anyone who needs help and making sure the floor is cleaned and neat."
good,The people were kind and the environment was inviting! The pay was very good. It was the first job I’ve had and it was a very good one. I would recommend applying here.
good,it was a good and fast pace enviroment. meet some great people while working there and overall a easy work experience. had a great group of regular clients and they still remember me to this day
good,"The work load and responsibilities required were very reasonable. Employees and some management were friendly and inclusive. Unfortunately, the store manger at my location was not understanding whatsoever and clearly played favorites."
good,"Daily routine is focused on customers and bridal registry. Shipment and merchandising are completed as time allows. This is not the job for people that do not like physical labor. There is lots of ladder climbing, lifting and top stocking of product. Merchandising and analyzing items that sell well is an all day every day job for supervisors."
good,threre is alot to learn when it comes to working here my advice would be have some experience in retail before working here cause they kinda just throw you into the fire.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find items, restocking items, and answering any questions about the items. I also had to balance taking inventory and being available at a cash register if needed."
good,"Good place to work. Some overtime every week if you wanted it. Management easy to work for, and treated everyone with respect. Safety a big issue. They were very safety conscious, which was a good thing."
good,"I enjoy helping customers find what they are looking for, as well as being bridal trained I enjoy helping newly engaged couples to create their wedding registries. We are one of the few places where while there may not be as many of us, we seek to actually help our customers versus just being there to stock merchandise. We want to help as that is part of our mission overall, to provide the best in person experience of customer service as well as being the experts for life related events such as weddings, college registries, baby registries, and so on. The workplace culture can be the tricky part as each person has their own personality and finding the right mix of people can be the challenge more often than not. Also having enough people on staff can be challenging as this is not exactly a lifelong career opportunity unless you are interested in business management or sales. For the most part, this is a great place to start working and gain valuable customer service experience, but it also is more of a stepping stone by providing generally stable part time work while searching for the next career move."
good,This job is a decent one to have while in school. The schedule is flexible for hard working employees.Most of the managers are easy to work with and are very understanding.
good,Nothing really to complain about but also nothing to praise decent job all around. Just go in do your job and you shouldn't have too much of a problem.
good,I worked for Bed Bath and Beyond from 2005-2007. I enjoyed working with the company but needed to work closer to home. They are a great company though.
good,"After a few weeks of being a stock associate, they asked me to be in receiving. Then a couple more weeks go by and my boss made me safety/shrink captain."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was a fun learning experience for me cause I got to learn about a couple of things while I was there the people were amazing to work with.
good,"Was a big focus on customer service. Always able to help a guest shopping. I started as a department manager, moved to an ASM role after 6 months. Worked soft side, hard side, operations. Traveled to Edmonton and Ottawa to do special projects for store. Became store manager 6 yrs ago opened a new store in Ottawa. Moved back home was store manager in newmarket. Then went back to operations for 2yrs in Barrie and now store manager of Vaughan Woodbridge location for 1yr and 1/2. Been with bed bath 10yrs now."
good,I have worked at bed bath and beyond for going 9 years. I have enjoyed working for this company. The hours and shifts are  flexible . Can be stressful. Every customer  Service oriented .
good,Working in bed bath was difficult to say the least  not because of what the job entails but because of the work politics that are inevitable to encounter
good,"Maintain the shelves clean and straighten up, help out customers to find what they are looking for, always have a smile on your face, keep busy. While I worked in the Customer Service section I helped customers return a broken problem etc."
good,"i had to work 10 hrs for 4 days, so my days went by fast, is a nice place to work, almost everyone are nice, i liked it there because i got along with everyone i was the youngest one in my department which it is called ""warehouse""."
good,"I enjoyed being the CSM because I knew that I did whatever was within my abilities to make sure the customer felt appreciated and that their concerns were addressed. The BBB accronym L.E.A.D! I worked in a very stressfull position especially weekends. I was allowed to do my job as far as making the front end ran efficiently. Management did not always take my ideas to make improvements in work flow so at times i felt I didnt have the support I needed. Frequently customers would write comment cards about how well I handled situations as well as contact corporate. My managers usually listened to my concerns regarding the cashiers and how I felt they could use further training, The problem came with new management not letting me know their expectations thus I did not work to their standards and i could not help my new cashiers to be successful either. Other than that I really enjoyed my job at BBB!"
good,"Basic retail experience: crazy customers, okay management. it can be fun at times. Management favors customers almost all the time like every other retail establishment. Coworkers do make work be a little bit fun."
good,"Fast paced, very competitive and very busy. Good hours and good pay mandatory overtime, management was cool they stayed on task made sure everybody was doing their job keep us organized very helpful. The workplace was cool everybody got along everybody mind they own business and did what they had to do the best part about the job is when the season started we were busy we always had something to do"
good,as a whole i was pleased working for Bed Bath and Beyond. the culture of the company made it easy to assist and meet new costumers and make them returning ones. the only thing i would offer as a suggestion is tighter focus on management meeting structure to promote a better communication network between them.
good,"I enjoyed working for them, and loved the products. I learned customer service very well and it helped me get ready for school. I learned how to give a customer what they needed and how to really apply a coupon in the best way. If your good at math, you can do very well there."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"There is always work to do. Process returns, Sorting the hard side and soft side carts. sweeping the cue, Fixing the welcome mats or towels at the front entrance. "
good,"Okay workplace, sometimes it can be busy. Most of the time it was boring and slow. Not really much advancement in the company other than it being a part time job."
good,"Great Company to work for prior to the past few years.  Enjoyed and benefited from substantial growth period of organization throughout the nineties and early 2000's.  Company had been slow to react to changing customer buying habits and got caught behind other retailers who kept up with technology and customer facing trends.  Company is now attempting to transform, but may to late."
good,"On a daily basis, many items had to be restocked and/or found homes for. Many customers coming in everyday. Have to wear comfortable shoes since you are on your feet all day long. Employees for the most part, helped each other out."
good,They are a good company to work for in general.  They are having a tough time adapting to compete with competitors. Because of this they have eliminated a lot of previous positions and reduced pay or put pay caps on positions and benefits to try to reduce expenses to make up for the lack of revenue growth.  Sometimes that is not necessarily a bad thing but due to timing it feels like an over correction to a failing business model.
good,"The hardest part of the job is that a sales associate works on commission, which makes the work environment competitive. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the seasonal/annual discounts the company offers!"
good,"I started Bed Bath& Beyond when I was in high school and I loved it, it was such a great job to have while in school and I also got to learn about each department in Bed Bath& Beyond which was helpful in so many was in my day in day life also many years later."
good,"Being my first job, I got to learn lots from my then manager whom I wish all the managers would be like him. He was the best and made the place fun and entertaining."
good,Good place to work.  Variety of duties and responsibilities. Fast paced and lots of interaction with guests.  Great opportunity to learn about a variety of products.
good,"When 2working at a job its good to have people around you that you like. I enjoyed the people around me. The managers were nice at times but when things weren't done right, they were upset."
good,"Overall the atmosphere working at BBB for me was an overall positive experience, managers are understanding and  willing to help you adapt in new positions. Everyone is pretty nice and its a chill place to work"
good,Love working at Bed Bath and Beyond you could really grow with this company the draw back is the long hours mandatory 48+hours per week but the only problem for me
good,"The Usual retail environment:  "
good,I liked the staff and most of the managers.  They were flexible with hours and dress code wasnt too strict. However as part time i had no benefits only a slight employee discount.
good,This company is a great work place team work room for growth everyone is very polite. Flexible work hours you meet a lot of nice people The Manager are more then willing to help.  Only thing I disliked about this company there pay rate are low and the benefits. But if you looking for a fun easy stress free work place apply
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a great company and a great place to work.  I worked there before much of the restructuring and their focus on service was top notch!
good,"Its work non-stop but management was great and fair! The store was kept very well and the management made sure you knew what you had to do always so it was easy but at the same time, a lot of hard work anyways"
good,Responsible for creating the first and last impressions of the store experience for all customers by providing outstanding Customer Service. Maintain a clean and organized work environment.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a very good place to work.  I started there in 1997.  I had jyst been downsized by my previous employer, MTV Networks/Viacom after 15 years of employment.  I never thought I could wok in an I.T. department.  After a few years, BBBY gave me the chance to show that I can do the work for them and their employees with much independence."
good,"So much fun to be able to prioritize customer service over other tasks. To be trusted as the experts in home and special life events."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great company to work for, minus the salary. I worked there for two years and only got a .20 cent raise. They are very understanding about hours. Happy to help out with any work issuses."
good,Workplace culture is fun ad fast paced while still not being too difficult. Management was nice and accommodating with hours. Co workers were very friendly as well.
good,Always busy. Never bored if you work in the mornings. Worked here for 3 plus years. Learned about every department. No room for advancement. Loved working with my department we were a very strong team and always communicated.
good,Working here is fun in terms of things to do but it can get information heavy and customers are mean. You learn a lot about product knowledge and customer service.
good,I love working at Bed Bath and Beyond. the environment is friendly and relaxed. management is nice and willing to help you get the job done. I would recommend working for this company.
good,"I have been working here for almost a year and a half. I have great managers at my store that I currently work at, but I know not all stores do, so. Any way I work on soft lines, its a nice job I learn alot of new things, meet some interesting people, and close up and go home. It's a good place to work for part timers in college."
good,I recommend bed bath and beyond to anyone though its not an amazing place but its a good first job. Teaches you how to work with other people and how to deal with customers.
good,"Our store always ran with a skeleton crew, so there's always a lot to do with little time but management is great and its a nice environment to be in."
good,"The work atmosphere was fun. Everyone worked together as a team to get the tasks done. I learned that if you greet every customer within the 10 foot rule and are willing to go the extra mile in assisting them with what they were looking for, the customer will leave satisfied, which made my work day successful. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes and comforters up an 18ft ladder to top stock merchandise. Management was fine with overseeing and ensuring everyone was satisfied. The only complaint I really had was scheduling. They switched schedules too often without confirming it with the associates."
good,"BBB Is a breath of fresh air when it comes to retail stores. The company really values it's customer, safety and product training. There's a significant amount of training to insure you feel comfortable on the job. They are typically very flexible with days off. Great return policy for customers, but us as the associates we see some pretty gross stuff come back. My biggest thing I dislike about this job is the management, they like to power trip."
good,If you enjoy retail you will enjoy this job. The management I had was great. Pay and benefits weren't the best but that's to be expected when working retail.
good,"Management is professional. They are flexible with you for the most part. If you can get a full time position there, it's a good place to be. The pay is okay and benefits are pretty good."
good,The quality of management and the great culture made it easy to work within Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't recall having many difficulties at the workplace. The most enjoyable part of my job was collaborating with other team members to plan out projects.
good,its was an okay first job. i learned customer service at 16 and how to be a cashier. i told myself i would never be a cashier again tho like its for if your really young or your really old nothing inbetween
good,"I worked here while I was in college. They were very accommodating towards my class schedule. Training is great! You get a lot of product knowledge, and they are very customer service oriented."
good,"You will not get time to look at your watch. This store always has a flow. If you like consumers' product and like meeting people, this is your company."
good,i was a manager. The culture at Bed Bath & Beyond was diverse. Interacting with people from different parts of the world was great. The most difficult pert of the job was managing associates personal issues.
good,"A very productive job yet fun and interactive, employees were every nice and welcoming to new people. Customers always came first and everyone tried their best to make sure each customer left with a smile on their face."
good,I was victim to a corporate layoff of 900+ department managers. I would still work there to this day had this not happened. BBB is customer service driven and likes to promote from within. Customer service and safety are the company's priorities.
good,Company culture is fun and works well with people. Customer service is a lot of what is the driving force. Training is good and they work around my school schedule.
good,Typically get 4-6 hour shifts on the weekends which fits perfectly into my schedule as a full time student.  Working mainly customer service and register shifts.
good,"the people who worked with you is what makes this store fun to work at. the hours aren't the best but they are steady, every week you get about 25 hrs."
good,Working at bed bath & Beyond wasn't difficult for me personally. The problem was floor mangers and store mangers changed too often. With constant changes made it harder to settle into a routine.
good,"This company's culture revolves around customer service. All employees are encouraged to ""take care of the customer"" by any means necessary. Every employee must greet and engage every customer in the store and help them find what they are looking for by asking the correct qualifying questions. Everyone is given product training classes in order to assist customers."
good,"Very flexible hours and /or schedule. Fun atmosphere and great employees and management. Fun, competitive, rewarding, and discounts. Always room for advancement"
good,Dealing with customers can be stressful at times. The company holds team work and customer service above all else to make sure things get done and done right.
good,This job is great for teens just starting out and need work experience. They are very reasonable with hours. This is where my cashier experience began. The only thing I can say I didn't enjoy is the drama that came with the employees. Other then that the job was good.
good,"Bed, Bath & Beyond welcomes a friendly customer service to ensure that the customer is always satisfied. Team members will do everything they can to help a customer as best as they can."
good,"Fun, creative, busy and fast paced . Customer Service driven. Always something to do. Presentation/Displays sell alot of the products. Bridal registrations are fun for the couple and you can develop a great relationship with them by showing them the different department's."
good,"Kitchener management is very harsh, complete lack of employee recognition, incredibly unfriendly/rude managers and upper staff. Focus on negative comments and bring down the employees. Work is less customer service and more cleaning. Very vigilant. Others I worked in were very nice, had friendly staff/managers and good work environment."
good,"A normal day at work is going in the back and receiving after that stocking things on hard side and soft side in Bed Bath and Beyond. Workplace culture has always been friendly and helpful when ever I had questions when I didn't know how to do a certain thing on the cashier. Management has always been great. The hard part of the job was remembering where everything was put when things needed to be back stock to its initial spot. Most enjoyable was the people that worked there they were helpful and taught me how to use scanners, cashier, and how to look up products that needed to be bought online."
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job is the people you work with. Also, the new cultures you come across with those traveling through. You learn new meanings through different languages."
good,It was a good place to work. A lot of times vendors would come in so that we could try out new products. And if you did well with customers they would give items that they were selling.
good,"It is a very standard job, only problem is it is almost impossible to advance past a ""lead"" position. Which isn't to bad if you are looking for something to fill your time. But it is had to make a living off the pay from here."
good,"I enjoy working here however, I do not think it is a position I would like to be in as a permanent career.  As long as you are willing to work, advancement is possible and our particular store has excellent management,"
good,Bed Bath and Beyond as a job has kicked my butt more times than i can count. But my job at bed bath and beyond has been my favorite job ive ever had. Theyve set me up with great skills that i will use in the future.
good,"Even when you're a new employee, the managers and superiors will always make sure that you are not put in a position that you shouldn't be in.  Very helpful and positive-minded individuals.  Great temporary job!"
good,I originally started at BBB to only work a few months I ended up staying a few years because I enjoyed my coworkers so much. I will be leaving shortly in order to pursue career advancement in an industry that utilizes skills I have that weren't needed at BBB.
good,If you are a person who is always on the go and loves to multitask Bed Bath & Beyond would be the perfect fit for you. The managers are super nice and helpful.
good,My review went well because I love working with the public and it’s a great company to work for. Because there’s lots of departments to learn different things.
good,"Learned alot there  "
good,"very decent job. Not too fast paced, and the managers ensure everyone is on the same accord. Loving customers that make your day go by even faster. Pay isn't bad compared to the minimum wage."
good,"This has always been my fun side job.  Not much to say except the work and the hours suit me.  It would be great to get more hours per week now that I have the availability, but that is my only issue really with working here.  Managers are ok, pretty laid back, same with co workers.  Customers are demanding at times but also tend to be nicer and friendlier than your average walk in retail guest."
good,"Who doesn't love BB&B?"
good,It is great to work with qualified individuals who are passionate about Company's future. Also workplace culture is relaxed and campus is beautiful. Team efforts are appreciated and initiatives are encouraged.
good,"They promote a culture of customer service.  Very challenging at times, but they give you the freedom to make a lot of your own decisions.  You need to work a lot of hours at times."
good,I learned so much from the customers.  It was like shopping with my mom plus I was getting paid.  Yes there is lots of stocking and shelf filling.  Working with the customers and learning about the products that they are looking for and how they work.  So much fun!  Your time is what you make of it.
good,"Very busy "
good,The hours are flexible and management is understanding of associates' needs. Ample opportunity to learn and improve on product knowledge and sales skills. Fun environment. Store is clean and customers are pleasant. Great team environment.
good,Healthy work environment with a lot of skills learned to walk away with. Willing to work with your schedule and lenient about time off. demanding on work ethic and ability to engage and interact with the customers. High demand for excellence.
good,Customer friendly retailer with a focus on employee development in order to provide an exceptional level of service. fast paced work environment yet still maintains a family type atmosphere. the hour are long but the work can be rewarding.
good,The staff was all very friendly and willing to work as a team. The workload is what made it so stressful. There was never enough staff to accomplish was what needed. Then management would be upset when everything wasn't finished.
good,"Easy to get training in. very relaxed environment. Very supportive management. Been there for 8 months now and the hardest part of the job has been trying to get all scheduled tasks done because thres usually so much, but that just keeps me busy which is completely fine!"
good,"There are up times and down times at work but overall it went by very fast and the other employees were very kind. On the weekends it can get very busy and some customers can be rude but it made the day go by faster when we were busy. Also, during the week it could get very slow so it would feel longer but the other employees made it fun. There is always something to do plus the discount is good."
good,"Have been working for the company for a year and a half while in school full time. My location is extremely flexible with my schedule which I am very grateful for. It's a good part time job. The only major con is the workload for more experienced/different shifts. The newer employees are not trained like we were, so we end up doing a lot of the work. Nice managers, will be sad when it's time for me to go."
good,Great place to work and great managers. The atmosphere is an enjoyable one. Coworkers are friendly. The discount is great. All in all i would say this is one of the better places i have worked.
good,"Working at BBB is fun, and quick pace. Employees are nice, an cooperative. A typical work day consists of assisting customers with purchases, exchanges, and returns. Also helping customers find items on the floor, and place orders for them."
good,Lots to do and friendly staff but limited hours and position mobility. Lots of climbing ladders. Sales Operating system was easy to learn. Hours are definitely based on how many Beyond orders placed.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was a fun and exciting experience for me. The one thing that I enjoyed the most doing was helping the customers and being a help to other employees also.
good,Doesn't require any prior knowledge. Just show up with a smile on your face and the determination to provide. If you show you are willing to learn and grow with the company you will be hired.
good,"I worked here for a few months and I had little to no issues while working there. Most of the managers were really helpful, but some not so much. Set hours from: 3:15pm-1:45am, second shift, thursday-sunday. Made pretty good money also."
good,"Great place to interact with customers and utilize"
good,I worked here to supplement my way through college. It was an ok job... until my current employer hired me. They worked around my school schedule and gave me health benefits.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a good company to work for especially if you are a student as they are extremely flexible where your school schedule is concerned.
good,"This job is not for the faint of heart.This company will have in working hard from the start but is will teach how to balance responsibilities,goals and ambitious."
good,"Typical shifts were quick paced, smooth, and routined. "
good,"It was a nice place to work. The people were good to work with.  The normal day was to stock your department and prepare for customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment whenever customers would thank me for helping them find what they were looking for.
good,Lots of hard work; plenty opportunities to be creative and learn different ways to do things. Great ways to improve your social skills through customer service.
good,"Standard cashier job, customers were mostly nice, coworkers were always willing to help. Hours varied week to week and averaged about 15-20 hours a week as part-time."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was one of the best jobs I held. It was always great to see returning customers and to help them find exactly what they wanted, either in the store or out of it. Management could have been better, but the employees were always fun to be around."
good,no day was ever the same. loading and unloading merchandise making sure floor was neat and stocked. making sure customers were being greeted and helped when needed
good,"I learned a lot of thing with that brig my first job. I learned how to handle people in hard situations. My co- workers were a couple years older than me, and our bosses were in their 40s. So it was nice to have people I can relate to but still learn from!"
good,"job positions not limited, tends to go by fast time wise, fun environment, not to stressful, but a lot of work always busy. It's all in what you make it."
good,"The day that I be working it's usually fast paced day"
good,"Can be a great place to work. It is very hard to advance within the company. Yearly raises on excellent reviews are 20 to 30 cents. I have worked at three different stores with very different ways of doing things. It can be very high drama or very relaxed depending all on management. The customers for the most part are great, but also very needy because that is how we've trained them to be. It's nice to able to take care of customers and we bend over backwards for them. That said, the corporation does not go out of its way to help employees. The company is very frugal and raises are ridiculous; people will often get hired that make more than I do, and I'm a keyholder. There is a lot to do and its hard to get bored if you have a good work ethic."
good,Love working with the brides at the registry. Love the co-workers. Nice atmosphere. Management helpful in some areas. Interacting with the customers was the greatest.
good,"Overall, Bed Bath and Beyond is a very simple retailer.  Their focus remains two things, exceptional customer service and keeping the store full.  There are very few reports that are utilized, sales are rarely discussed, technology is limited and the pressure to hit goals is virtually non existent.  "
good,Go in to work see how the store look and where i am placed today. Count the draw or start stocking my items in my area. I learn all the different and new products out there and that the customer is always right ! Management was okay they can be down your back at times and not accommodate your time requested off months in advance. My coworkers i enjoyed working with alot and we always made the day go fast. Hardest part of my job was memorizing where everything was in the store. Most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,A typical day at work depending on where you are on the floor determines how busy your day will be. Usually as a cashier you will stay busy. Customers can be rude a nasty when returning items but your manger will always back you up. I have learned teamwork skills and as well as communications. there is defiantly room to grow.
good,"long work hours, but very productive always stayed busy, easy place to work for the most part. Good schedules. Very big workplace alot of employees which caused problems at times. But overall god place to work for."
good,"people who work here are excellent and the work conditions and pay is not that bad either for a small corperation. The online system however is very outdated and hard to work with, often leading to the issues that occur during the day."
good,"Throughout my two years working for Bed Bath & Beyond I formed a family.I would work almost every day and the people such as managers were so sweet. I leaned many new things, I started as a cashier then upgraded to a customer service representative based on my potential. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with customers who disagreed with the rules. I most enjoyed when all of my co-workers joined in as one to help each other. I think Bed Bath & Beyond was a great first working experience for me."
good,Typically assist customers with finding merchandise along with keeping the department clean. You will learn proper sales tactics and social skills. Management is friendly and understanding along with professional and unique. Co-workers are friendly and always willing to help. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional customer with a bad attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day and seeing the appreciation on a customers face.
good,Got to meet lots of different people and learned a lot about thread count and cookware. I was limited to just one area of the store or just my own department
good,Great people at all levels of the company- joining Bed Bath & Beyond is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Bed Bath and Beyond due to its friendly nature, flexibility and hard working atmosphere."
good,"I worked different positions at the store including cashier/sales associate, over-nights/stock, and receiving.  The staff was friendly and stayed on task for the most part.  Management was really good at explaining task, assigning duties, and helping out whenever they can.  The hardest part was organizing and cleaning up the back stock rooms and the most enjoyable was working the over-night shifts being able to complete task with no distractions."
good,I liked working for this company. The only thing is the not lenient about taking off even if its a family emergency it still counts against you.
good,There is always something to do. I learn something new daily. I belive that if you enjoy your job then its not just a job and the possibities are endless. I work with very tetermed hard working people who take pride in what they do and are very welling to teach me and I love every minute of it.
good,"Atypical day at work was busy, but never the same. I would meet a lot of different people and learn a lot of different things. I had the opportunity to be chosen to do assignment outside of the store,to represent the company. For example, I attended Bridal Events, Back to College Events as well as Inventory at other stores in other citys and states."
good,"Fun and Friendly environment. A typical day at work including assisting customers i, cashiering, delegate, restocking and answering the phones. I've learn a lot about retailing. Management was strong and direct and co-workers was super friendly and helpful. Standing for a very long time, but my most enjoyable part is meaning new people and assisting customer."
good,Extensive customer service and inventory stock counts are a  regular part of your job. But this is a good way to interact with people and build experience. We go above and beyond to assist customers. There is always a healthy environment and management and co workers are very friendly and helpful.
good,Great place to get customer service training.  Easily worked with school and other job schedules.  Wonderful people to work with for coworkers.
good,"There was always something to do at BBB. First off it was to get all the stock that was received that day before out on the floor, that was the main priority. After that it was filling to wood walk, followed by order done for that day. I learned that you have to plan your day well and time had to be efficient. Management, well things could have been done differently, the main reason I left there to begin with. The co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was to get all the tasks done on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I worked replen and the partner I had was amazing."
good,"A day at work is never dull. There is always a long list of tasks to complete. It makes for a quicker day, because I stay busy the entire time. I have advanced within the company and have had the opportunity to advance as a leader in the work environment. I have learned to work with the associates that I oversee. Where it may be difficult to go to your manager with concerns, my associates know that it's okay to do just that with me. It is important to have that open relationship with your associates. I have been with the company and at the same location for nearly 4 years. Where the turnover rate is high amongst sales associates/cashiers, the turnover rate has been much higher than one would expect amongst the management. I have seen 4 store managers in my 4 years. I've also seen periods where we had no store manager at all. It is for that reason that keyholders, leads, and other branches of management that have been constant over this time work so well together. We have had to learn to manage the store in a way that no one can tell that there is no one person leading the team. The toughest part is not having enough hours or associates to man the store. It takes a toll on our customer service when we have to get tasks done with just one or two associates in the department. It leaves both customer service and necessary tasks left lacking in sufficiency. While it may weigh heavy on my mind to know that a customer didn't leave completely satisfied with the service they received, it makes me feel twice as thrilled when one of the associates receives a compliment from a shopper."
good,"I worked as a cashier at Bed Bath & Beyond and it was really fun! There was a great mixture of people and a fun, stress-free environment."
good,My first time working in retail. I realized very quickly how much labor is involved in a place like bed bath & beyond. There is never a dull moment. The managers as well as my co-workers are for the most part very nice and friendly people. Very outgoing and willing to answer any questions I have whether its about the store or about the company. The hardest part is drop stocking heavy items. The most enjoyable part for me is the 20% off i get because there are a lot of neat things we sell that i had not known about previously!
good,Moved to different location's as needed had fun but the turn over was 72% . The DM was really tough and went thru a lot of people
good,"A typical day consisted of 10-11 hours per day of freight/product stocking and merchandising."
good,"Normal as any company, some departments do not promote within the department, if promoted it depends on no merits, higher upper management need to check the behavior of some managers, as their attitude is very much like a dictator"
good,"I like the fact that I'm not just doing one thing, I am in multiple places. I am constantly helping out customers and leading them where they need to be. I offer ideas and thoughts to what they may love more as an opinion and don't pressure them."
good,"I've been working at Bed Bath & Beyond since July, it's a non-stop working environment that encourages me to do better. Moreover, it enables me to learn different procedures within a retail company such as basic knowledge about products and daily duties of employees."
good,"Researched errors in invoices and helped trainers resolve and pay vendors in a timely manner.  Created searches that helped to make the process faster and cover all stores.  Company keeps growing, acquiring companies with new vendors.  Processes need to be updated and IT has been working on several key improvements."
good,"Enjoyable job in a comfortable, encouraging workplace.Very friendly and helpful coworkers, created great workplace compatibility and enhanced personal communication skills. Everyone was flexible when it came to things such as covering shifts and vacation time. Managers were easy-going, a couple were a bit stiff but overall quite pleasant. Management encouraged productivity and always ensured all employees were satisfied with their job. Although mostly all employees were energetic and maintained a positive attitude, there were a few who caused issues. The most enjoyable part was working alongside highly experienced coworkers and being able to learn workplace techniques from them that I can apply to my work."
good,"Placed special orders and called other stores to find desired items. "
good,"Customer service duties include check out, answering questions, placing on-line orders, answering phones, pricing merchandise, making displays and maintaining candy section and drink refrigerator. I have gained a lot of product knowledge. Work environment is fun and friendly with great management team and co-workers. I have made many friends there."
good,I was a stock boy at this store for almost a year. I would come in in the mornings and pack away new stock from the previous night onto the floor and pack away whatever there is no room for on the floor into the stockroom. Once in a while I would get on the cash register when it was very busy. I learned how to work with others as a team and also how to become a team leader working here. The management was very fair towards employees. My co-workers were people that always wanted to get the job done. Hardest part of this job were during the holiday seasons when it gets hectic. Most enjoyable part of this job was working as a team to get things done.
good,Daily routine is easy to remember but some times difficult to get through in a timely fashion.  Being able to help the customers can be a great and rewarding challenge.  But the best part of this company is being able to control the inventory and where it is placed to increase sales.  Watching the sales numbers grow due to what you are doing on a daily basis is an amazing achievement!  The hardest part of the day is the long hours and the long drive to and from work.
good,This is a steady pace work environment so you have to be a fast learner. The co-workers are great but its the costumers you have to worry about. They are particular and sometimes rely on you for things. The day goes by fast because you stay busy and having co-workers to chat with helps.
good,A normal work day is laid back and straight forward. In the mornings you restock shelves from the night before and then assist customers however necessary. Closing shifts involve working new freight and assisting customers.
good,Great place to work with employee benefits. Learned a lot about different products in the store and the company provide you with updated changes of a product.
good,"Co workers are fun and easy going the store manager is really nice and reasonable, the hours are good and the department managers are very nice, but the operation manager Dolly is really mean and rude. She doesn't take reasonability, She always judges people and she cusses sometimes."
good,This is a company that expects only the best performing employees. Customer service is the number one task for all employees that work here. The appearance of the sales floor along with the stockrooms are kept to a high standard. Safety for the employees and the customers is extremely important. safety meetings are held every week to educate employees on keeping themselves safe at work.
good,"A grand work day was all due to team work with my fellow co-workers for the best of the customers experience. It was most enjoyable when  the customer would comment on our service while wearing the biggest smiles. I did not have a smooth journey while working, customers can be indecisive about materials. Luckily the management staff is along side for assist. Overall, I learned to be prepared, be punctual, wear a smile."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond was a great company to work for with many opportunities for advancement. The manager instilled good integrity in the co-workers and modeled what excellent customer service means.  The most enjoyable part of that job was interacting with the customers and learning about the company's many products and merchandise.
good,"The workplace is very fun. Employers and employees are very friendly. This job has taught me that both the quantity and quality of our customer service is what makes the shopping experience an A+ experience. Bed bath and beyond has helped me to bring my customer service skills from great to excellent! I am more confident in my customer service skills, as well as basic sale skills. The hardest part about my job is room to grow. All manager and supervisor positions are filled. However, the most enjoyable part about my job is the job it-self. I love working with people, making their day and making their shopping experience, fun and fast paced. I also like the team i work with. We get along very well and although we take the job seriously, we find time to make it fun."
good,"-Pleasantly greeted customers upon entry into the store"
good,"As a manager, you are given the ability to really take care of your customers and make your store a neighborhood location.  A typical day consists of managing the store team that does the merchandising, customer service, and overall operation of a retail store."
good,I always enjoyed the staff with whom I worked.  We came together well as a team while working very long hours.  There were great opportunities for promotion.
good,That was my 2nd month in the company when I learnt about the new coffeemakers and blenders. I have a cordial relationship with all the workers and the management.The hardest part was when I had some problem with the American culture since I was new in the country.Customers love me because of my accent and my great customer service experience.
good,"A typical day at work includes clocking in going into your department recovering, filling in helping customers meeting sales such as home delivery are promo items for the week being able to being place in any other department and understanding each department duties such as the register are customers service home delivery are scanning."
good,most of my co-workers had good and welcoming personality. they upper management were always supportive of me and wanted the best of their employees.
good,"I have learned a lot about diverse culture and more."
good,"A typical day consists of, working hands on with customers, creating online orders over the phone and in person. Working freight and down stocking when needed. I am one of the Bridal consultants so I create Registries when a bride comes in. I am full service so I help them with all aspects of there registry."
good,"Busy Company. A typical day required a lot supervision, data entry, production. As a administrate assistant i had to make sure all production were in the system and all deliveries  arrived on time."
good,"Worked 7-4 everyday had every other weekend off.  Learned most of my management skills there, great training loved my coworkers, travelled a lot with company.  Hardest part of job was reseting other stores when we had to work overnight.  Every other part of the job was enjoyable especially the family environment there."
good,I've learned to deal with multiple customers at once fulfilling all their needs. Having to deal with different personalities and growing my knowledge as well on many products and vendors.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bed Bath& Beyond. My co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. The managers were okay, some were helpful some weren't. Overall my experience there was a good one."
good,"On a typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond things get a little crazy. Everyone helps out everywhere,or should. You may be running all over the store to help a customer or you could be up at the registers checking customers out. "
good,I really enjoy all the people that I work with. The company really strives to be the best at catering to customers.
good,"Company is all about customer service and their experience.  If you apply yourself, you can make a difference in any aspect of store operations/merchandising."
good,great place to work in the retail world. treated people as people
good,They worked really well with my schedule. It was a fun environment.
good,"Like most retail jobs, it depends on the staff. I was lucky enough to have decent managers, and I did have a pretty iffy store manager before I left. But the people that are hired as your coworkers are generally nice most of the time, more so than other stores. BB&B's policy for having above-average customer service shows even when you're at work, from my experience. If you're looking for a full-time retail sales associate job, look elsewhere. They only hire full-time managers or assistant managers unless the store is large-sized for their scale, then maybe some extra full-time associates. If you aren't a manager, you're not likely to move up or get full-time. A good part-time job, however. Not minimum wage, though if you work for a year you get reviewed-- get a good review and you get around a 10-cent wage increase. Shoddy pay increase, albeit decent pay."
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) was a very interesting experience. Each day was filled with new challenges and trials. With guidance from the exceptional management and support from dedicated co-workers, I was always able to complete each assigned task and those that just popped up as well. Working with this organization really molded me into becoming the person I am today."
good,"Started off working in the ""soft-side"" department. Folding, helping customers, some stalk replenishment and making sure things were tidy. I also worked the main stock replenishment. Lifting heavy small kitchen appliances, trash cans, and a lot of ladder usage made for a productive day that went by quickly. My co-workers and management were great, fun and teamwork came naturally when needed. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms at night, and the most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,It was a pretty straightforward job. Go in work and go home. People were amazing. Hardest part of the job was not being to help a customer sometimes.
good,"Working was enjoyable, co-workers were friendly and nice to be around as well as most of the management team."
good,"I had fun working at Bed Bath & Beyond. The managers I worked for were good. I loved being part of making displays and working with all the things in the store. There were some hard parts of the job like climbing ladders in a small space to refill what was on the shelves. Overall, it was a great job."
good,to work here you must be ready to deal with a wide range of people at a fast past ..you should know how to deal with money  and customers at the same time
good,"-Growing company"
good,"It really depends on the management staff, but the culture of the store is to micromanage the daylights out of their associates. All employees, salary and hourly alike are expected to do more than is possible in a typical shift. Along with the long list of tasks, associates are expected to provide a high level of customer service as well as be a cashier and work freight. The owners of the company are cheap. Hours are constantly cut and it's hard to keep new associates due to the low starting wage and the high demand of the job. However, it is a stable company and some of the people I have met there are genuinely some of the best coworkers."
good,"A typical day consists of working at the customer service desk, which means I handle complaints from customers, phone calls, organizing the registers, and working as a cashier. The management is spectacular. They know the store very well and are excellent at teaching employees how to do things properly. Scheduling is always consistent and they are considerate to days off and requests. The hardest part of the job is that it can feel stagnant at times. The most enjoyable part is working with customers and getting my work completed."
good,It was good. Friendly environment. Good customer service. Good hours. Short breaks.
good,"Retails is known to be a very busy place. Having customers troop in every now and then and as an associate its my duty to make sure every customer is satisfied on a daily basis. Being a team player is a greater and better advantage in order to be able to work proficiently in this kind of environment, Jobs are done much faster and better when you work and ask your co workers for help when the need arises. Great management. Working there is fun"
good,A typical day at work includes sweeping the floor before opening to ensure a clean facility aiding customers with enquirers and purchases and loading the floor with merchandise. I learned an excellent amount about the proper approach to sale how to engage the customer through every step and always ensuring the bottom line. The hardest part is being on my feet for 8-10 hours but the most enjoyable was helping the customers.
good,"I am currently there on a temporary project that will soon end. My time there has been rather enjoyable. It's a bit sedentary though, with your workstation being an office or a cubicle and your main tool is a computer. I do enjoy that people there seem to want to get to know their co-workers and never fail to celebrate birthdays within the departments. However, I am technically still a store associate (I unfortunately still get paid as one as well) and being able to make the permanent shift into corporate as proven to be all bu impossible. Since I got there in May, I have seen plenty of new faces come in to join the corporate team, yet I have been told repeatedly that there are no available positions for me to continue to work there permanently. You would think that they would rather pull in people from within their own company, who already know the products very well than have to teach everything to new people. Luckily though, this is my only complaint. The offices are beautiful, there is free coffee, and you are able to order office supplies for free if needed. I have learned a great deal about the behind-the-scenes side of a retail company, and I would love to work with another. I highly recommend this place- if you can get in."
good,"I've learned a lot working in this department, it was overall a great experience"
good,Amazing managers to work with.  Building a relationship and customer service are the main goals.  Fun atmosphere to work in. Keeps you busy all the time in a good way.  The co-workers are great and always helpful.  Emphasis is paid on teamwork.
good,"Helping Customers find what they are looking for. working as a team and ""passing the buck"" as we would call it if we are not sure 100% as to what they are looking for, meaning seek help from a fellow co-worker who is in that department "
good,"Managed over 50 associates in the front-end area including checkout, customer service and shipping.  Responsible for two departments, Bedding and Bath, with over 40 associates and four managers, making it the largest sales floor in the store."
good,"Running a register, cleaning, stocking, camaraderie among coworkers."
good,"Great work ethic"
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond provided many challenges for me. I was given responsibilities over the front-end of the store in order to alleviate some stress from store managers. I was required to help customers to the best of my ability and make judgement calls based on store policy regularly. Although many companies do not appreciate their employees, this company was constantly rewarding its employees for their good work. The most rewarding part of this job was helping customers who came in with a problem that no one else was able to solve and solving it by working as a team. "
good,Hardest part of job is trying to balance a schedule when sometimes you would be the only one on the sales floor.
good,Customer service is top priority and the ability to always find a solution. Lack of growth and opportunities are the downside to this company.
good,I have been working at Bed Bath and Beyond since the first week in January of this year and it has been a great experience so far. The manager is efficient and hardworking and the other employees are fun to work with and put a great deal of effort into their jobs.
good,"I would get to work clock in and head to my department , which was bedding. I would than fix bed displays and make sure all wall displays were neat and ready for customer views. I would walk around floor and look for any customers that may need help for any reason. I would get a shopping cart and walk around the wood for a hr or 2 zoning and offering home deliveries. I would sometimes head upstairs for cashier backup when things would get busy. At the end of my shift i would make sure that my area of depatment was neat a fully stocked for the next shift coming in. I would than head upstairs to clock out."
good,"The Management staff is wonderful, the company's values are top notch. I was seasonal employment-just ending yesterday (1.28.13). I will be returning for the next holiday season."
good,"1st person to open the store with the manager. Read reports. Excute task for that day. take a lunch. Clean up befor I depart the store. What I can take for the job: Merchandising, ordering recieving, Bridal Registry, how to develope relationship between associates and customers a little of many things that I can carry to any job as a manager. Hardest part of the job: Making sure you have the right fit of individuals to build a team. The enjoyable part is merchandising, excuting a display to catch customers eyes."
good,A typical worked day was greeting and helping customers. The co workers are awesome to work with. The hardest part was working with the different managers and having to adjust with the different managers being switched in and out.
good,"Fun place to work, and great coworkers. Had a great crew at this location and we genuinely looked to help and inform our customers. Store manager was a good guy looking to follow the company method of getting to know your customer. Made for a better environment."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers on the sales floor and re-stocking merchandise. Co-workers are generally very friendly and helpful, but management was another story. Some managers (mostly at higher levels) tended to be very rude and unapproachable, and if I asked for help I was likely to be scoffed at or given a dismissive answer. The hardest part of the job was helping customers find exactly what they wanted, but doing it successfully is rewarding and enjoyable."
good,Greet customers.
good,"I loved working here all my co-workers worked very hard and so did most of my managers and if there was a problem things were handled right away. they cared about their employees as much as thier customers, they were also very understanding about working around other schedules. But the company is for college students its very rare that someone advances."
good,"a typical day at work for me is running around like a chicken with my head cut off. i learned about every product category they carry. management was cool except for when it came to asking for raises. the hardest part of the job was getting everything done, but the cool thing is that customers always come first so even if you have a mile long list of things to do its okay as long as the customers are happy your list can take days and you wont get into trouble. the most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping customers and teaching the associates new things."
good,"Everyday was different, never the same thing. one day slow and alot of cleaning and the next is non-stop with things to do. I learned about management and customer service, The management was wonderful worked well with you and showed you how to do something new everyday. The co-worker are always a good treat when you work with the same people everyday you know how to have fun and get a job done. The hardest part of my job was nothing everything was well organized and made life easy"
good,It was a after school job. I worked there for a year and a couple months. I would open and close the store along with a manager
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a fun place to work. I learned how to give the best customer service possible. My co-workers was easy to get along with and work with. The hardest part of the job is holidays because on holidays the store is busy.
good,"I took this job at night. I would assist custmers on the retail floor with their decisions for purchases always offering add-ons. I learned how to listen to a customer regarding their needs and wants. Management was always prepared to guide us. Each shift started with a team meeting instructing us what the product for purchase would be for that month. As co-workers we would par up at the end of the night closing the store. Restocking and cleaning shelves. Spotting one another on ladders. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with great team of people, assisting shoppers and helping the economy."
good,Good job if you have school. Willing to train to advance in the company.
good,"But I didn't work there long, but is has great pay and excellent benifits and is a good place to work."
good,You can learn and teach other people things that you know as well. The customers are experiences and from all over the world. This is a very diverse place to work. The products that are here will amaze anyone. There are so many things that you will never know even exist in this world. The managers are good and help with what needs to be improved and even more your co workers are amazing. Great personalities and know their department area well.
good,"My experiance with this company is that its management is very proficient at what they do. Their employees are they're top priority and that they aren't as pushy as many retailers have become. There aren't any minimum amounts of push items that need to be sold, although they do encourage the sale of those items through positive reinforcement. From my roommates who have worked for other retailers, this is definately a step up."
good,"BBB maintains high standards when it comes to customer service and trains there employees well to maintain high professionalism. My overall experience at BBB was great, I developed many great friendships and the pay/hours are great as well."
good,I mostly enjoyed my job at Bed Bath and Beyond and felt my pay grade was appropriate. I was able to take classes on each section of the store so that I could help customers find the product that was best for them.
good,"It was an okay job. Definitely heavy lifting depending on what your job is. The managers are okay, not always nice. Sometimes they can be hypocrites. It's kinda a fast pace job."
good,This was my first actual job at 17 years old. I would recommend it for college students as myself due to the flexible working schedule. This job has taught me to improve my customer service skills in a short amount of time along with being able to manage multiple tasks in a short amount of time.
good,I like my job I would love to work in a hospital I'm a people person I get a long with everyone  . I'm very dependable I'm always on time at work  I keep a smile I'm very friendly .
good,"I do not regret working here as my first job. The training is excellent and thorough and my co-workers were amazing, communicative, helpful, and overall a blast to work with and I became friends with almost every single one of my co-workers. There is literally nothing negative to say about the internal environment; however, it is a retail positive so expect a lot of good and bad customers. Some days I felt very degraded but I had a team that helped me remain positive and chug through the rest of my shift. My managers were overall amazing until my last two weeks where I did feel that I was getting treated differently by a manager and there were many complications and broken rules when it came to receiving my last paycheck in which I had to complain to HR about. Other than that, I never hated this job and heck! Even holidays and Black Friday were a blast and I never regretted working those days."
good,I enjoyed my time overall working here. I became very close to some people and I felt comfortable with the environment overall. They also managed my schedule pretty well
good,"The goal was customer satisfaction. We would greet customers, and assist them with any help they need throughout the store. We would advertise certain products for possible upscale. After they are done shopping, we would check them out."
good,A typical day at work was helping multiple customers with their purchases and returns and answering phone calls. I was always busy which helped helped the day go by faster and for me to be more productive.
good,"Working here is good, I love the managers besides 1 of the night managers, customers bring in a lot of coupons so its kind of hard for them to sign up for electric ones because they rather use the paper and I was told if we don't get the phone numbers or emails at least 50% we could be Fired which is crazy but overall this is a good company to work for."
good,Great place to work just not enough hours and no 3rd shift options. Its good for college students or people working two jobs but not good for people who want a career
good,good company. made my work and school life easier. If your a good worker then you can advance in the company. Within two years I was doing more jobs within then anyone else.
good,"I work in support center ,  main job roll is taking calls all day. In addition to taking call i also take care of 2nd level ticket, handle complicated calls and reports all updates to supervisor and manager. Train new analysts."
good,"Love the quiet work environment."
good,The company was a good place to work. The district managers are great at supporting the store. Like all retail job to are asking to do more and with less.
good,"Lots of freight and working your plan. As you have to literally map out your moves for making space for product. I learned a lot about CA labor laws and OSHA standards. Management was hit and miss. There are some great leaders within the company. The culture varied to location but, was generally good. Hardest part about the job was having a balance on Time Management as it is very demanding but, can be seen as challenging in a good way. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with the team."
good,"Love the customers and hours are very flexible. Co workers are very helpful and they will answer all your questions. I am mainly a cashier, I work with customers and help them with all their questions."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a nice company to work for. They key is understanding your metrics. Know what your expected to know and make sure to do them. If uncertain please ask for this will determine your success.
good,I love the people I work with but the company higher up has lots of issues. It’s not great pay for the expectations. Lots of promises to get what they want and don’t follow through.
good,It is a good place to work but pay is low. You get a nice employee discount. It is hard to stand on your feet for an entire 6 hour shift. The customers were nice and it was easy work.
good,Like it’s a nice place to work but the management was a little off. If u needed help they won’t really answer for you. But over all it was a really nice job. The employees were very nice and welcoming.
good,A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond is great. Most of the employees are really sweet and they treat you like family. Never is a Grey Day in the building
good,The experience was great. I learned how to interact with customers more. I gained a lot of confidence in myself. I was able to start retaining more information. It was fast paced so it never felt like I was there all day even when I worked a double once.
good,"The Bed Bath & Beyond I work at is smaller than most I have ever been to. I have been working for the company for almost 2 years now and I absolutely love it. Something that makes a huge difference is the managers though. The Manager and Assistant Manager of my store are two amazing people who are great at what they do and they truly care about us, the employees, and our customers. They are what help me enjoy my job. I am a merchandise specialist at my store as well as I float around to various other positions. There is never a dull day as there is always something to do to help improve the shopping experience in our store. The hardest part of the job for me is how much emphasis the company puts on associates to get Beyond orders and to sign people up for its Beyond+ program. I do however enjoy some of the perks we get like an associate discount at all of our concepts and the associate incentives, as well as when our store manager gets us lunch on holidays or long days. Overall I am very satisfied with the company and I love my job. I am excited to see the future of Bed Bath & Beyond as we transition into our new concept and continue to enhance our stores for a noticeably better shopping experience for our customers."
good,"I start the day at 6 am most of the time but often it starts earlier. I get the office organized by printing daily reports, working with the opening manager to getting the keys out and distributed to the sales floor. Then I go through my daily task list: Are there any promotions to put up or take down?  Are there any price changes to release?  Are there any price changes to do for the day?  Are there any Gift with Purchase signs to put up or take down? Then I print all signs that are needed,anf match it to the paperwork, plan the day and sign out a scanner and a remote printer. Then head down to the floor.  I alert the assistant managers when a promotion is starting in their area in case they want to display it differently or move it.  We have a team huddle right before we open the store to review goals for the day and anything employees need to know from any department.  I interface with every dept on how they want products moved, signed, etc.  In case you haven't noticed, I am a dept of 1! "
good,It was a job. Everything was cool. I don’t really have anything positive or negative this was just a passing threw job and I didn’t hate it so it is ok.
good,Working as a team making sure all products were correct for the costumers. making sure all merchandise were not broke or destroyed what i learned from there it was how all products were found by computer
good,"Bed Bath & beyond is like any other job it has it pros & cons but it’s a great company . I love dealing with all the customers that shopped with us , I always try to provide outstanding customer services"
good,"I started working at my local store during the summer after my junior year of high school. I was able to work a few hours a week during the school year, and when I went off to college, I was able to communicate with my managers and get hours in over my summer and winter breaks."
good,The company provides opportunities across all concepts. They promote from within. They allow people to develop into their potential. The culture is focused on associates and customer service.
good,I work in call center. There are 40 hours guaranteed every week if you're full time. The schedule is strict and you will be penalized if it isn't followed preciously.The pay is nice and quarterly bonuses are available. Discount is 20% off and they do offer employee incentives that are discounted massively. Friendly work environment from leadership and below.
good,The vibe in the workplace is energetic.  You're never bored and constantly busy working with the customers or setting up various work areas to make it presentable.
good,"A typical day fluctuates. Some days are really slow, some are nonstop fast paced. There is not much that I learned from Bed Bath and Beyond since I have prior experience in retail. Management is great. I have very understanding and accepting bosses. The hardest part is trying to help customers who aren't as cooperative and understanding as others."
good,"fast paced"
good,"Received different vendors throughout the day and at scheduled times. Was left mostly alone to receive stock, price, put away and stock as necessary. Management was always available to answer questions and suggest other ways of doing things. The hardest part of the job was not having enough personnel at key periods to assist in other duties."
good,Working for bed bath and beyond has been a fun experience and all of the people I have met have been very nice. After a while I started to lose motivation because of no sense of growth.
good,"•	Full-time point-person for coverage in all departments, including supervisor of cash registers, trainees, and store section"
good,A fun but sometimes very stressful work environment. A lot of upkeep and demand. Short staffed 90 percent of the time. Sometimes can’t meet demands given by corporate and or management
good,"Organizing merchandise, operating cashier, positive environment for customers and coworkers, dusting and cleaning the store,  customer assistance, completing online orders."
good,The company takes care of customers. There is a 'never say no' to a customer policy and they live by it. However that loyalty is not passed down to employees
good,great place to work spent a lot of time with the crew teaching them and learning from them on how to handle the product before the boxes were ship to the right customer.
good,Has a great structure in the workplace. If you work hard you can advance in the company pretty easily. The atmosphere in the company is great and more like a family.
good,"The work place is great because of the variety of goods they provide.  Some times it seems overwelming as a cashier, but it fluctuates depending on time and day."
good,I have worked here for over 4 years and I love the atmosphere. Being an outlying store makes it a bit difficult to reach out for any type of assistance. It’s a very customer based company that is constantly changing its store expectations. They give you the flexibility as a merchandiser to drive items and increase sales. If you like retail you’ll love this company. They have very close relationships with their employees and you always feel at home. They promote from within is one of my favorite aspects. It helps show that they believe in their employees. I was promoted from cashier all the way up to the GM of the building. I’ve promoted all of my managers from the bottom up and loved watching them grow with the company.
good,"Management worked with their employees on everything. Staff was amazing. Good when it comes to training, very thorough. Money was decent. Flexible hours."
good,"I like working here, it's a good job and the people are respectful. A typical day at work would include greeting guests as they walk around and try to help with their every need, then I work on projects given to me or closing my side of the store. I learned a lot about retail through this job and more about customer service, I am a college student, so this isn't my end goal, but I enjoy the workplace. The hardest part of the job would be running around completing multiple tasks around the store. The most enjoyable part about the job would be that one person you helped and they somehow made your day better before you knew it."
good,"There are many roles in one store so there is room to grow and they will relocate you in necessary"
good,"Retail environment is difficult for all, but BBB is doing its best to adapt.  They preach a lot about culture and there are strong relationships between the buying office and field partners.  That said there is A LOT of communication  traffic to deal with since all 1000+ stores have email, phone, and instant messenger access to the buying office.  However the company is currently setting up teams to help filter what comes through to buyers and planners.  "
good,"The management is great, they are very understanding and flexible with hours. However, not many hours are given. You can move up within 6 months. Get along with coworkers easily. Most customers are friendly and reasonable."
good,"The shifts were typically at least 8 hours long, which was nice. I usually worked the morning/mid afternoon shifts.  I was able to learn about the entire store very quickly, including becoming a cashier, sales floor associate, and service desk associate.  Management was always there when you needed someone to talk to and was always on the sales floor."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with questions about products, recommending products, and ordering them products. I also restock shelves with freight that comes in everyday and also ""recover"" or make the isles look presentable. Another part of my job is going up to the cash registers and customer service for backup. From working here, i have learned many skills but the most important ones that I feel that i have gained are leadership, responsibility, problem solver, and creative thinker. I have been lucky enough to have great managers. Each and every one tries there best to work with the employees and make working an enjoyable experience. The work place culture is always customer service. Customer service is the most important thing to Bed Bath and Beyond right behind safety. The hardest part of the job is having to do all of the jobs i have listed above at once and in a certain time period, especially with little coverage. The best part of the job is working with great people and helping great customers. There is no better feeling than knowing you made someone smile and that their day is better because of you."
good,"the day is spent entirely handling returns from the previous days processing them, along with any transfers, shipouts or internal returns to be handled. it is fast paced and you must be able to multitask. I enjoy a job that is busy and the time goes by quickly. I enjoy an earlier morning start."
good,"Bed bath and beyond was a good experience at the time unloading merchandise and helping the customers with any questions they, the only hard part was is the fast pace."
good,Enjoyed working with the people there in assisting unloading trucks and restocking shelves before the store opened. Enjoyed assisting customers to find the best product for their needs.
good,"the days are busy. i have learned each guest require different attention.the management is very good, work place is excellent.the hardest part is dealing with a rude guest that can you can not please   relating to guest.greeting guest.doing my job"
good,"Typical day started with stretching. Filled with different positions that needed seasonal help."
good,As this being my first job and my first to face reality it was a great experience. I began as a floor associate positioning to a customer service representative due to my outstanding leadership skills. Being in customer service it taught me how to be professional.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is actually a fun place to work. I have learned a lot about all the products that they provide, as they have quite extensive training. The only draw back of Bed Bath and Beyond is the limited chance for advancement."
good,"Operationally staffed to a minimum, however this allowed for a lot of cross training with other operations than just Floor Sales Associate."
good,"Stay working; don’t too nothing and talk all night"
good,"daily objectives"
good,During my time with BBBY it grew from 200 stores to over 1000 stores.  They are huge at promoting within. The training could continue to get better instead of no one to cover to attend training.  They are like a lot of companies for a person to do more with less help.
good,I enjoyed this job a lot. I had just moved to the area and needed to find a job quickly. Helping brides pick out items for their registries was fun. The discounts also were great.
good,Focal point is customer service training. Lots of oppourtunities to pick up extra shifts. Exposure to all departments in the store. Managers more than willing and welcome questions when a staff member is uncertain as an answer
good,"Great place to develop organizational skills. Great Managers who are helpful and great coworkers. everyone works as a team. Great environment, they carry so many things;"
good,"customer service, sales. Help customers with products understanding the product getting products down finding a product. learned all about the products in the store. Had great manager,very understanding and worked with me on my schedule,i was going to school. Hardest part being on your feet many hours a day,bending,lifting heavy stuff,climbing ladders. it was great store had good people to work with and great manager."
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond is a great company with great benefits, flexible schedules, pleasant environment in the workplace opportunities for growth is unlimited . Fast pace environment."
good,"I think if you're a student or retiree and you need a little extra cash on the side, its cool. Management isn't terrible, it's just changing so much though. In the past year we've had countless managers interchanged. Pretty lenient with scheduling. If an issue arises there's always someone to talk to."
good,"If your needing a first job this is the place to go. It shows you how you need to work, and this can be applied to other jobs. Also this  teach kids responsibility."
good,"A typical day at work: customer service, cashier, returns, recover on the floor, replenishment/freight, back stock, merchandising, displays, signage, markdowns. "
good,This job was my first retail job and I had to be trained in many areas before I was ready to be on the job officially. There were a lot of specifics and training that was crucial to remember. The hardest part of the job had to be looking things up on the stores outdated computer system.
good,"It was good job experience, fixed hours. Can be busy or slow just depends on the day. Good managers. I was very happy with the pay considering my past jobs payment."
good,"- Positive Customer Service Culture"
good,"The managers here are in tune with their employees. If they see potential in an employee they will work with them to advance their careers to meet their goals.  Fun atmosphere, and great co workers."
good,"I worked at Bed Bath & Beyond contract (More than a year)"
good,"I liked the team that I worked with. "
good,"dealt w/ customers in customer service counter such as returns, purchases and registries. the workplace environment was very relaxed & fun w/ co-workers"
good,"I loved it there. I probally would still be there if a certain manager didnt have different rules for different people.They shove safety down your throat on a daily basis, climbing up and down stairs, watching videos, lifting, yet one of the managers always allowed one of the co workers to wear her high heels and tight dresses, which im pretty sure, isnt on the dress code, Wasnt quite safe with 6 inch heels , made for a difficult work space. I miss the company alot, but it wasnt worth all the drama"
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working here. The managers and employees were a joy to work with, and it made coming into work easy. Flexible hours were an added plus"
good,"Couldn't be a better first job especially for a retail store. I've worked here for a year and some change now; coming up upon 2 years. Management will give you opportunities and push you to do your best to complete the day's task(s) solo or as a team. The culture of the store is phenomenal it's like a family which, you have a broader spectrum to see if you're invited to go on inventory. Advancement in the company is possible, just talk to management team about the steps."
good,"Ive worked at 2 stores both on morning shifts. At the first store everyone was relaxed, Helpful and a really great community to work with. The second store it was more business then fun. other then that it is a great place to work for."
good,enjoyed working here but I also have a few days where I had to rethink working there due to issues with bad management. there was a lot of times where the days were great though due to friends and also the customers.
good,"Typical job if you like assisting customers, really flexible hours and days. Management is professional work environment is very family oriented. Fun place to work."
good,i enjoy helping people fine their desired items. My staff is great to work with and then environment is good. I've learned a lot about retail during this position.
good,It is a fast pace multitask environment which make my day go by quickly. What I like about my job is that there are always so much to do . I'm never bored. People I work with are nice. The manager I work with is nice. I learned so much working at Bed Bath and Beyond. The hardest part of my job is prioritizing my tasks because there are so much to do. I like merchandising new products and assisting customers with their needs.
good,"awesome customer service we give to all our guest"
good,"Great customer service orientated store,the crew was awesome and the store manager appeiciated what you done in the store at all times to improve moral."
good,"BBB is extremely customer service based, putting the customer and experience if the customer first. The staff is trained in every aspect of the store. The best part of the job is working with wedding registry guests and is the most fun. All product is ordered in store by the management team. I've learned a lot about supply chain, ordering, merchandising, seasonal rotations, operational skills, interviewing etc."
good,"Although I only worked here for a short period of time, the team was very pleasant to work with and the atmosphere was rather calm. The management staff was very nice and everyone was willing to help each other no matter their department, task, or position in the store. Great place to work for a part-time job."
good,"The job provided me the chance to move out, I learned how a corporate office worked and got to make new connections with people. The people were friendly and the office was large."
good,"competitive pay, great benefits, lots of opportunities to advance. free soda. hour long lunch. lots of activities every month, such as crazy hair day, pie bake off and others."
good,Bed Bath And Beyond is a fun fast paced work environment where the customer is number 1.  They pride themselves in the fact that they treat the customer so good and treat their employees pretty good as well.
good,"skills learned-cash register, time management, receiving, interview techniques"
good,"I love the store and love the benefits. In my particular store half of the managers are good the other half is very passive aggressive. That’s just my store though every store is different. Advancing career wise is difficult and competitive and you pretty much have to be in a high volume store to stand a chance for promotion. The customer service trainer position is very demanding and is NOT paid enough but if you do not plan on advancing, if this is just a need for the paycheck then this would be a great job for you. There is great benefits it’s just difficult if you are trying to move up. Honestly the reason I am leaving is because I was just told that I should’ve been promoted a long time ago if I weren’t seeking a better career outside of BBB. I am currently in college. I understand why they didn’t want to promote me, but the thing is I was lied to for years about getting “promoted soon” when really there was no intention of promoting me. I had been working so hard and hanging on to this job for the “upcoming” promotion. This store has wasted my time and prevented me from advancement even though I deserved it and I’m not saying that because I’m bitter. I was literally told I deserved it a long time ago. With that aside and out of mind I did enjoy working here. It is very service oriented and everyone was kind except for just a couple of managers. This was my favorite job yet but I have to move on knowing that I’m not worth their time promoting."
good,"Always busy, no down time. Management are great to work with and had met a lot of great friends for life. Great benefits and pay is good. Management is always willing to work with your schedules if you are a student or have another job."
good,"The company in a whole is a good place to work.  My manager was not very good to work for, but has been replaced shortly after I left.  The company is very easy to promote up levels."
good,BBB is a great place to work. My supervisors and upper management were very accommodating  with whatever an employee might need help with. Overall warehouse environment was always kept clean and neat. Employee morale is high. Learned how to drive 4 different types of forklift there. Its very fast paced and youre always busy and because of this i was able to thrive.
good,"A great company for young people who are looking to gain experience in the world of retail/marketing, or even just to earn some extra cash through school. Either way, working here will force you to hone your interpersonal and time-management skills"
good,Working with customers in retail can always be stressful. When your team is supportive and open minded makes a long day worthwhile. Learned how to multi task and relax in hectic environments. As well as patience and how to look forward to adversity as a challenge.
good,Great place to work. Good People and great customers. A place that gives you pride in your abilities and satisfaction in knowing you can really help customers. There is no better feeling in assisting customers and see the appreciation
good,"There's always people you don't care to work with, it's all about who you work with for the most part! If you're favored you'll move up in pay and position....I apparently wasn't as favored as I thought I was! Though ALL my customers loved me and I'm a perfectionist"
good,"Bed, Bath, and Beyond is a great place to work. I gained a lot of experience through my time there and I got along with everyone. It was my first retail job and they trained me well."
good,"It was a decent job while attending college, great people, and pretty good company to work for. I learned a lot while working here. I would definitely recommend working at this company."
good,It was an okay place to work. Store manager was just annoying.Other then her the employees and other managers are really fun to be around. Never a dull moment.
good,"I made a lot of money in the little time that I did work there . Benefits were great , it's just the management is not fully behind you when it comes to certain stuff ."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is much different from what I have known the Retail experience to be. Maybe it was my previous job, but I am more work oriented, and look to get my job done as quickly and accurately. People work, it's just that the emphasis seems to be more laid back, ""it will get done"" is the attitude, not that that is a bad thing."
good,"I liked this place, I worked here just after high school. I think it is one of the better places to work for retail. "
good,Usually a 5-8 hour workday with lots of product knowledge training and sales experience. Management was always easy to talk to and easily available on request. Culture was top notch and everyone got along with each other without any drama. Hardest part of the job is balancing out customer sales with job responsibilities within a time frame. The most enjoyable part is very little to no supervision needed to do job.
good,"I would walk departments daily, ensure that department merchandising was correct, check sales on individual items that I had ordered to chase sales in the store.  Friendly competition and cooperation between store managers to get the most profit and sales."
good,"I worked with a great group of people. The work environment is very fast pace and on the go. There is always something to do rather it be projects around the store or coaching of the staff. I really liked how working as a team and customer service were very important. The hardest part of working for BBB was the ladders. I'm afraid of heights, which made carrying product up and down the ladders unenjoyable."
good,"This company will allow you to run your department(s) as you see fit as long as you're adhering to the basic guidelines for department standards, this is a great place to learn how to run a business. This company does NOT invest in technology so the systems here are very old."
good,"While a lot is expected of you without the proper coverage or people to help, this is a good company to work for. The culture is to provide the utmost level of customer service to the shoppers. The hardest part is finding the balance of accomplishing your job duties and helping customers."
good,"nice enviroment the poeple there are very friendly and kind"
good,"Fine, nothing real exciting there is a good work life balance. It does get to be a bit like ground hog day a lot of the time. You do pretty much the same thing."
good,"When you come to work you must look presentable, be friendly, and open to additional tasks. I learned that everyone is different and you can not mistreat the next person because of the last person behavior."
good,"Good company to work for. Great benefits with medical and retirement. Training programs, management involvement, open-door policies. Positive work environment."
good,Constantly busy and there is always something to do. great for career advancement. Lots of training and product knowledge. Fair compensation for the work put in.
good,Very high paced job.  Forever changing and versatile.  You sell on the floor as well as help customers shop on line.  There is room for growth such as being responsible for a segment of the store or ultimately management.
good,"Very fast paced, if you worked hard you were compensated well.  Great chances for advancement. Very productive days, made day go by fast.  Worked with a great management staff."
good,"I worked at the College station location and the woodlands one both great places to work. The managers at the college station location are amazing, the store is a team work environment."
good,Was hired through a staffing agency and their communication was not good. Bed Bath and Beyond was a great place to work offering many challenges and was very fast paced. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"At the BBB it was a customer first environment, at the management level you are always expected to protect the company culture and ""Never say NO"" to the customer which lifted any stress from other retailers policy driven culture. Once in Sales floor management level you always are driven to build sales with revenue focused ideas and guidance from seasoned management level employees. The hardest part of the job would have to be the ability to get training to successfully on the operational side of the business. For example getting timely answers to questions important customer questions and getting an answer that says, Check the portal or next day being called into the office to explain why you had to reach out to peers to get an answer"
good,"A typical day at work consist of coming in early, printing the reports for the day and pricing the newest markdowns of the week. Since working here I have learned time management, how to do conference calls, timed productivity, and doing the best I can. The management for this facility is nine times out of ten the best, the managers care about you learning and growing. Everyone has bad days and occasionally that gets reflected onto the employees. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with understaffing, and not properly scheduling enough people for the project. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment they are very welcoming and all in all a great place to work."
good,It was a great place I liked working there; the people were nice and the work flow good. I liked going to work because it was a great place with good people.
good,Typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond was pretty cool. I learned a lot while working there. I became a Bridal Consultant which was great. Got a chance to help brides and grooms scan for their registry. With that came so very great knowledge. I got to learn about good cookware and cutlery. I also got to learn about good place settings and even learned about Fine china. The workplace was always good with the managers. probably the best management I've ever worked with. Very understanding and always willing to help you with anything you were unsure of. The Hardest part of the job was picking up slack from others and not really getting the credit for picking up the slack. I just believe its important to remind workers that they are doing a good job when they are going out there way to help. It shows appreciation and motivates the worker to do even better. The most enjoyable part of the day is always being able to help out a customer find something they were looking for. Or even giving the customer some knowledge on things they didn't know about.
good,It was a fantastic starter position. I would recommend working at Bed Bath and Beyond to college students. They have a flexible work schedule perfect for students.
good,"Enjoyed my time there. Management I worked with were good to very good and reflected in the results. Only criticism is they need to get back to what made the company stand above the competition- more floor coverage to assist customers. Spend some money on that, it's well worth the investment."
good,Great place to work with possibility for advancement. On the spot training for all aspects of your job. Great management program. Great culture. Amazing customer service
good,when it is busy everyone is crazy around you. managers sometimes raise their voice a little. Each customer is a challenge that you have to deal with in a way that is very good customer service even if they are rude to you.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun place to work, depending on the co-workers. The work is fairly easy and it keeps you busy to make the time go faster. Most of the management is awesome to work with."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond offers flexible schedules that fits your life style.  Positions can be very physical but fun.  It has broaden my knowledge of the retail arena.
good,Good for those who are full-time students and living with parents. Great to have for a second job as a part-timer folks. over all it's a great place to work.
good,"Overall I love working I love people, there is always a few customers out there that make the day not go as smooth as it should be but in the end knowing that pleasing the customer and having the company and/or business make a good profit in the end makes everybody happy."
good,"This job keeps you on your toes and is always a exciting day, Meeting the customers and being able to help them is exciting. I enjoyed the great team I worked with. I was sad to leave, but my work injuries could not be accommodated. I could no longer climb ladders and that is very much part of the job. I would love to be able to go back to working at BBB if they could accommodate me."
good,Typically slow paced but can get quite hectic but not too much to handle.  Enjoyable job if good management is at the site.
good,It is relatively slow paced easy going job that is enjoyable.  Typically great work envionrment from top to bottom levels of employees.
good,"usually good days, learned how to work in warehouse, good management, hardest part was lifting heavy objects, most enjoyable part of job is working with the people"
good,Great company to build a career with and the people are very friendly.how ever not enough hours but it's a great part time job
good,"A well established place of trade, primarily of housewares, goods to enhance well being, or quality of sleep. esthetic of job is of constant providing of customers with the utmost service."

good,I love working at Bed bath and beyond. Everyone is really nice and you can learn a lot. The pay is not to bad. For me it was the best job i ever had. I only left to go to college. I miss it tho.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a wonderful place to work. The sales associates take you in as one of your family. The customers are quite agreeable too. If you are looking to hold down a part time job, this is the best place to do it. However, if you are looking to go up in the world and acquire full time, your efforts are fruitless. If you are lucky your manager will tell you you're doing a wonderful job and that full time is just around the corner. It wont happen. With luck you may move up the ranks in 10 years. Payment and raises are a dream too. A BBB employee gets a .20cent raise yearly, but that really isn't enough to actually call it a substantial raise."
good,Es una buena empresa más para personas con más experiencia o recomendadas
good,Management is easy to deal with and quite friendly. Most of the staff are friendly and is a good environment to work in. The company is big on knowing about the details of each product and there are multiple systems that are used.
good,"I enjoyed my time working here, I moved from sales floor to cashier and I prefer the cashier position much more. All of my coworkers were awesome and provided a fun work environment"
good,"A typical day of work was assisting customers, stocking products, and zoning,"
good,"became an opener every single weekend since i started and enjoyed it. lunch parties sometimes. great people to work with. not too hard, but not to light either."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a great place to work in retail as well as a good entry level job. The activities of a typical day at work include helping customers, selling items, down stocking items, working the cash register, restocking shelves and walls and using ladders. Its a nice work environment because you really get to know your coworkers and the interior is not as big as most other stores such as Best Buy or Target where the different areas are much more spread out. The job is on the same level of difficulty as any other retail position, however, sometimes your patience comes into play when you have to deal with rude customers, especially at the register. The most enjoyable part in my opinion is working the floor and being able to move around while doing my job. Overall, I would say that the job is enjoyable and is worth applying."
good,"Great people to work with. Management who help you through a hard day is a great place to work, will recommend to anyone. When you work hard, they will recognize it and most likely promote if the opportunity presents itself."
good,A typical work day at Bed Bath and Beyond consisted of qualified individuals helping customers with any needs that required assistance. The friendly atmosphere at Bed Bath and Beyond allowed us to feel comfortable working with one another. We had enough freedom and trust from our managers that made working at Bed Bath and Beyond enjoyable.
good,"In my experience, Bed Bath & Beyond is full or wonderful, organized, and professional employees. Both their practices and policies always benefit the customer as well as the team members in a very practical and sensible manner. However, after being here for almost a year hours have been drastically cut and the raise I was promised after my review never went into effect, therefor I cannot afford to stay with the company much longer"
good,"Workers are encouraged to keep developing new skills and knowledge.  Management is not consistent from store to store.  Team Leads have a wide range of personalities and styles.  Movement within the company is fairly easy, if you're willing to travel for work."
good,"BB&B sells a range of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories, such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories, such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and juvenile products."
good,a typical day a bed bath was picking all day I learned how to locate and select stores our management wasn't very appreciative but my co-workers made the day easier.
good,the working environment is great. it is also very neat and very organized. the people are great as well. The hours are flexible and has great opportunity for growth.
good,"Great environment to work in, return policy is phenomenal, you can return just about anything even if its damaged , because company provides great warranty on their products"
good,Working in the Inventory Control branch was very rewarding. I learned a lot in the short time that I was there. The co-workers were great and the job work was fair. The only downside was the work environment was very demanding. There are no air conditions only big ceiling fans in the warehouse. But overall there are plenty of water fountains located throughout the warehouse. Therefore always keep yourself hydrated!
good,The managers are the ones that need the most work. They do not appreicate the employees that work hard and reward the ones that do not work as hard or hard at all.
good,I started working at BB&B after moving to a new state and within 24 hours of being in the Ohio I had gotten a call from BB&B for an interview. i enjoyed the job. The co-workers were awesome and the overall feel of the store was very laid back. I will say that management did slack a little and some of the BB&B policies are crazy. But overall it was a good job!
good,I picked up a lot of experience from working at Bed Bath and Beyond. They not only helped me to become a better sale associate but they also helped me become a better communicator. Giving customers better value of any item in the store.
good,"It was a retail job. Very VERY stereotypical one. However, the employees, management, and even customers made it seem very unique. There wasn't a bad employee or manager. Favorites? Yes. But everyone pulled their weight and worked hard."
good,"half of the day on register/cashier, other half restocking sales floor, i learned about different appliances for your home, for traveling etc. management was cool, not fussy at all, co workers were funny as ever, great to work with, job was very easy nothing hard about the job. most enjoyable part was that i was full time lol."
good,"A fast paced, customer service focused company that keeps good employees. Like most retail, it's influenced by seasons and hours scheduled may vary greatly. Even upper management is usually pleasant. Different management styles can cause confusion."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a good place for young professionals to learn about the industry and possible career paths to explore
good,"The short time that I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond was certainly enjoyable. I would still be employed with the company if I had not had to move out of state. I wish that I could have kept my employment, however it was necessary for my moving from MS to NC."
good,"I learned how to offer a good customer service. The managers were great and committed with the customers and workers. In conclusion, the work environment was good and professional"
good,I really enjoy the people I work with. Its hard work. The labor is pretty intense and the pay is not very good. It's a good job for someone out of high school.
good,"At Bed Bath & Beyond, the job culture is awesome, but it has the moments where it can be difficult. The management can confuse you to do a lot tasks at once."
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee and for two months I worked there. The work environment was really positive. For the most part I enjoyed my time there
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to work!  I think the biggest and most important lesson that I have learned from Bed Bath and Beyond is how to give excellent customer service.  What I mean by that is by ""not saying no"" we always give ourselves an opportunity to please the customer, whether it be searching for an item from the shelves of the store or providing the customer with help doing an online purchase through the beyond store.  That level of customer service is rarely seen in today's major retail stores.  The look on people's faces when you find that long searched for product or tell them you can order it for them free of a shipping charge is really the most enjoyable part of the job, and the reason I wake up excited to go to work each day.  The management structure that is in place only helps us to be more successful as individual employees and keeps the high standards of excellent customer service consistent."
good,"Opening the store, getting team members on their task for the day. I learned everyday knowledge about different products. I love learning. I had great co-workers, team players. I never really had hardest parts of my day. I enjoyed each and everyday. My most enjoyable moment is getting to interact with  different customers."
good,"Great place to work. Clientele and associates were great. I thurougly enjoyed working with everyone there. Management on the soft-lines side was not as good as my management staff. The store manager was a great guy and very down to earth. He understood how to communicate with people and understood that they had obligations to attend and they allowed them the time off. "
good,"Sometimes you put in some late hours during closing to also be scheduled for opening the next day."
good,"A typical day at work would start with helping & advising guests on different products and conducting cashier duties. This was my first job so I learned an immense amount of customer service skills, along with time management, and inventory skills. The co-workers were practically like family. They took time to teach me everything there was to know about the business.They actually wanted me to succeed. "
good,My day consist of reinforcing packing in order to deliver packages with out breakage on glass oreders.
good,I handle all packages that came into the store and stock the merchandise
good,"My typical day at work: I clock in and start all my responsibilities and tackle all task given to me. "
good,"Over all this company is highly customer service oriented.  Sometimes to a fault especially when an employee serves the company well and attempts to protect the companies assets, only to be scorned, ridiculed and belittled by upper management in front of the customers."
good,"I work 7-3 sometimes i come in earlier or stay longer, depending on work load. Very busy productive day. Some days are not long enough to finish up tasks. Retail is very stressful and working in a high volume store, there's a lot that is expected. I've learned you have to work very hard to be noticed and sometimes your hardest is not enough for advancement. Management can work a bit harder and be better leaders. My co workers are the best part of the job. We all work together and is a family. Amazing team. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to finish projects, not being able to finish what you have started."
good,"It was rewarding to have knowledge of the products sold here. They would often hold events to help gain this knowledge and even offer deep discounts if we wanted to buy said products. I also enjoyed being able to merchandise my department. Although they were often short staffed, I liked that I could work other ares of the store including the front end. Shortly after being hired I was trained as a front end supervisor."
good,I genuinely enjoy my job. I work with great managers and awesome co-workers. I am ready to transition into a career with more stable hours and a retail environment can not provide that for me.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of lots of running around. Whether it be merchandising, customer service, ringing or a project, there was usually a way to keep busy. The managers were supportive and helpful. The hardest part of the job was maintaining consistency. It can be a nuisance completing the same tasks again and again every day. Another issue is the fact that corporate dictates things like payroll and promotion, which would take some convincing from your managers. The best part about the job was the family vibe to it. You gain familiarity with most of the people their and build plenty of relationships. All in all, if you can get past the politics, it is a decent job."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond had excellent training programs,and tools to  keep active updates to products and  skills to benefit the associates. Their focus was the customer, and the engaging with the customer for  quality experiences ."
good,"I enjoy working with everyone there, we all help eachother out if needed. management is great and its a very up beat work zone"
good,"I was quickly ""promoted"" to the Fine China sales/ Bridal Registry department shortly after being hired as a floor associate. It was a fun, fast-paced job."
good,"This company is a great place to work if you choose a retail career. The company has a clear focus of what they are and what they want to do in the future. When the say that they have a strong customer focus, they actually do mean it. They will go above and beyond to make sure each and every customer leaves happy and the customer aspect of the job is relatively stress-free which is somewhat unheard of in this industry. I would recommend working for this company if you are looking for a successful retail establishment that runs as if it were a small business. It really is a one-of-a-kind store."
good,Long hours but the job itself is fun and mindless. You are always running around. Be prepared to climb 12 foot ladders and be on your feet your entire shift.
good,Customer service and safety are main focus.I like the culture of the store but long hours for management.This company taught me great customer service skills
good,"Cash Room, receiving and inventory Control."
good,Very busy store customers are very knowledgeable and will test your skills to see if you know about the products in the store.
good,I would have to say this is a very strong company with great opportunity to those who do not mind spending  the time to learn the company culture. The hardest part is balance as with any retail management position. Overall this is a great company for a young professional or seasoned person who does not require a lot of family time.
good,"Working at BBB is typical when it comes to retail work. The customers are priority, so it reflects in the way you should work. If you can not successfully satisfy customers, don't expect to work here too long. "
good,"i was able to learn alot of customer service skills, learned about different products,"
good,"Bed Bath and beyind is a great place to work, if you dont mind hard work and able to multi task. The Management team is very flexible as well as reliable."
good,this job was too easy. i really was bored most of the time.i enjoyed driving a cherry picker to pick orders .
good,"Typical day would be maintaining cleanliness of the store and scanning customers items."
good,I had a great experience working with this organization. It gave me full opportunity to develop me as an effective manager.
good,"As a manager, a typical day consists of overseeing the operations of the entire building as a team. It is every manager's responsibility to validate all tasks are completed, customer service is in place, and coaching and training associates as needed. You must be self-motivated and have a plan in place in order to execute all weekly & daily tasks. It is a fast paced environment and there's no time to slack. Every minute counts towards productivity. Everything is a mathematical equation in order to find the most efficient way to accomplish your goals. I enjoy working with customers and establishing a relationship with them."
good,A typical day working at Bed Bath & Beyond was fast paced and demanding. I learned to use a more numeric version of the UPC system and how to handle home deliveries. My co-workers were all friendly and unique people who helped through every step of my training. The hardest part of working at Bed Bath & Beyond would have to be closing hours; restocking and reorganizing sections of the store. But their were enjoyable parts of the day; socializing with customers and   achieving home deliveries.
good,This company really tried to educate its employee's about the products they sell and services they provide.  I learned a great deal about quality cookware and bedding.  I was given a permanent schedule of early morning shifts and this eventually caused problems but I was a single parent and could not work nights.
good,Good job you'll get a lot of customer service experience and sales experience.
good,"A typical day at work for a sales associate involves greeting customers throughout the store and assisting them in anything they may need for as long as they need help. Setting up online orders is common, as well as explaining the nuances of store policies on discounts and other practices. Employees must know the inventory and locations of all items in the store. Recovering the store to be sure all shelves and displays are clean and organized is another important part of the job, as is pulling out new stock from the stockrooms and fitting it on the shelves. New stock is a daily occurrence. All employees are also trained as cashiers to assist when it gets busy in the store. For a bridal consultant, time is also taken to set up gift registries for new couples who are getting married. This involves friendly conversation with the couple, determining their unique needs and areas of focus through conversation, and a comprehensive escort through the store to help them build a complete registry to accommodate the number of guests they will expect to be shopping. "
good,I have no complaints about this company.  I personally am just not a retail person.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers, answering inbound calls, and directing patrons to proper locations in the store.  I learned that customer service is of high importance and a no for an answer is not acceptable.  Our mission is to satisfy each and every customer as much as possible.  My co-workers are team-players and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of this job is dealing with extremely difficult customers here and there, but at the end they leave happy.  The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing customers satisfied.  "
good,"A typical day at Bed Bath Beyond was busy and fulfilling, there was never a dull moment and always something to learn. We were constantly having classes over products and team building activities, one of the most demanding parts of this job was keeping up with all of the product and knowing the facts about them. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the customers. At Bed Bath and Beyond our goal was to help the customer, in any way necessary, to make sure if they didn't leave the store with what they were looking for then we either found it for them and ordered it from our on-line store or knew where they could find it. Customer service was our number one priority."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond has great customers. Good company to learn the core values of Customer Service.
good,"A typical day at work involved assigned tasks involving training, inventory management and ordering products. Tasks required time and resource management."
good,In charge of the Customer service desk. Come in and sort through any left over issues. Learned how to deal with upset customers and help them leave with a smile. always work with at lease one other person at the desk but interact with all of the workers on the sales floor and the managers daily. Management is a little unorganized and your requests usually do not get met. If they do it takes an extended amount of time to do so. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers. This is also the most enjoyable part. Being able to change peoples minds from being upset to being happy is the best part.
good,"Bed bath & beyond was a overall wonderful place to work. A typical day would be opening in the morning, greeting the regular customers and meeting new ones. I've learned that I can't mix work and friendship in most cases. Management was quite well. Some were a tad bit under qualified. Co-workers were fun to work with. However, looks may be deceiving in many cases. The hardest part of the job, customers committing fraudulent activities."
good,"I worked at Bed bath & beyond for a year, this company was a great place to start off my customer service skills. They really helped me grow and also mold me into a great customer service rep"
good,"A typical day at work normally consumes of me and a few other co-workers reviewing the store to see what has to be done. Once that is done, we normally get freight in and we start on filling shelves that need to be filled or back stocked. Ive learned from this job to have patience. You need it especially dealing with impatient customers or just people in general. Good customer service gets recognized."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal temp at Christmas time. They take much pride in pleasing every customer (within reason), in store cleanliness and are considerate of their employees. My coworkers were friendly, nice and fun. Management was excellent. They are very appreciative of their help and thanked everyone at the end of the night for a great job. Would definitely work there again. Thank you for the opportunity."
good,"I worked the Service desk, I answered phone, printed wedding registries, waited on guest, and cleaned and organized the area. I stayed busy even when not busy. I made a few live long friends with this job. The hardest part was some of the grumpy people that could come in from time to time, and I love the customers and I had several regulars."
good,Great place to work at but some managers were not to great to work with while on shift...But when job needed to be done we completed it. Some of the workers were getting wages that were to low for the job duties that he had to do.
good,"Well i would come into work at 7am, I would have to put up freight no matter how much there is for that day, usually have about 4 people helping on my side, would fill what needed to be filled on the floor and what was left over would either be top stocked all the way up top, or put into our stock room."
good,Very involved articulate work that was the most important in daily operations.

good,dealing with the public is fantastic.call for more details
good,"A typical day at BBB involves assisting customers with purchases and returns. Other tasks include printing and explaining bridal registries, special orders, stocking and inventory. Most of the people who work for BBB are great and service oriented. The hardest part is probably working during Christmas and the most enjoyable part is working with other good workers."
good,"As a cashier, my day usually consisted of assisting customers with their purchases. When I worked on the sales floor I learned a lot of product knowledge which ended up to be useful for myself as well as helping customers choose the right item. My co-workers were great and the entire store was like a big family. Our store was the closet to the district managers house so he was in all the time which made the store manager stressed and then co-workers got unnecessarily stressed."
good,"I loved working here, it was a lot of fun. It was just hard to advance to higher positions. There wasn't alot of room for advancement."
good,productive fun place to work competative salary....great training program
good,A typical day at work allows meet to interact with various people and get the chance to work with fun outgoing coworkers.
good,"The part i enjoyed the most was helping the customers. Just knowing the product and to answer simple questions, about merchandise or questions about store. The Harmon dept was a fun place to work.It was like having a CVS in the store."
good,Overall a worthwhile place to work and enjoyable. Stocked store prior to opening. Learned nothing. Nothing was hard. Management was very good. Each day was similar. I assembledd items and opened freight boxes.

Training is not as great as best buy, but you do alot of hands on training done that i have not seen in other retailers."
good,I would say Bed Bath & Beyond was a place that was great to learn alot more about retail. From opening a store to receiving merchandise to working with the customers. Its a grea place to wrk if you like getting down andreally learing abut the company.
good,"I had never worked anywhere else for the amount of time I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond. In the three years I was there, I could say I was efficient and knowledgable in every aspect of the store.

good,"I know that my experience at the Bed Bath and Beyond Pendergrass Processing Center was my best work experience. For most of the year I worked 3 days a week plus overtime sometimes. When I worked 4 days a week it was the same."
good,I think BBB is a good company to work with. The hours are very flexible. Working with customers and gaining product knowledge was my favorite part of Bed Bath and Beyond
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun and friendly work experience. You learn a lot about the products within the store and will learn how to sell the product to the customer.

good,"Bed, Bath & Beyond, like most retail environments, has its fair share of stress. Sometimes the store can become crowded and customers will become irritated. Despite those difficulties, Bed Bath & Beyond is a very comfortable environment to work in. Once you get the hang of your responsibilities and your role in the store, whether it is front end, sales floor, or any other type of associate, it is a very enjoyable job. My coworkers are very kind people. My managers always try their best to make us feel heard, and besides the handful of upset customers, many of our guests are calm and kind people. It is a very quick-paced and energetic environment."

good,The most enjoyable part was when I got to work in the stocking part and not always do cashier. I learned how to better myself with money and how to close the store.
good,"Working in a call center is not for everyone but if you have an eye for detail, great customer service skills, and can multitask you will do a great job."
good,"My location doesn't have the best management, however, the environment is enjoyable and I learn many skills that can aid me in my career search. It provides a good experience in talking to customers and fulfilling their needs."
good,"Its retail so its not glamorous. You feel like there is never enough hands on for the day or there is far too many. The people are great, most of the customers are reasonable, its fun to help people solve their problems. The work itself is not particularly fun."
good,"Provides customers with services related to store products. Conducted cash, credit cards and check exchanges for products. Cleaning register areas, and restocking items."
good,"Muchas veces hay presion,y hasta mal trato verval,tal vez por que tienwn competencia con otras compañias,pero creo que un buen lider es el que enseña no el que manda"
good,I had excellent coworkers and management team at Bed Bath and Beyond. A typical day at work usually involved lots of interacting with customers and making sure that they got what they came for.
good,"Hardest part of the job is coming up with creative ways to solve a issue but you cant give up. "
good,Had a fantastic time working at Bed Bath & Beyond but . There was no room for advancement I had plateaued my position. I am currently looking for another place to work where I can advance and learning and the place where I can have a career.
good,"Great job and management got along well with all of the staff and was a great job to have and even in a rush was fun to work, had a lot to do and did a lot of neat things and learned a lot."
good,It's fun to work here. People who work here are helpful and respectful. I feel the management is very helpful and interactive with the employees and customers. I dont feel that there were barriers between associates and management. Very flat level.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a great job and work environment. Everyone is friendly and try their best in making it a good day at work. The management and employees are helpful in assisting and understanding.
good,Managers are nice. They try to stay consistant. The store is clean. The hours are flexible. They have a nice loyalty program. The coupons and staff incentives rock.
good,that was very good place to work and i did so many different  type work and they have good leadership they give me the opportunity learn operated forklift machine and learn how i work doing clerk in the computer
good,"Typically if you're just hired you'd work at the customer service desk and your job description revolves around keeping customers happy and assisting them with returns and checking out. Everything is very organized which makes being the ""face"" of the company pretty easy."
good,I enjoy working the employees at Bed and Bath.  I also like working at Bed Bath because I could walk to work.  I like my work Schedule.  I loved meeting new people.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond can be a fun place to work, you have to be able to  multi task.  Putting up stock, stopping to assist a customer, ringing at register.  You make the job what you want it to be."
good,I truly love the work space and Bed Bath and Beyond. The managers there are very understanding and they try to be flexible with pope employees there. Especially the ones whom are parents. Great place of business.
good,"I have to say working at my Bed Bath & Beyond was probably one of my favorite jobs. I had amazing management and wonderful coworkers, and it was a no pressure environment. The only downside to this, which it is with ALL retail not just this company in particular, is the lack of full-time hours unless you want to be management and I have no desire to do that."
good,Great place to work it’s unfortunate they are closing stores though. I had a blast working there and would still be had they not closed the location I was working at.
good,Retail is tough but the crew I worked with made it enjoyable most of the time. I only left because the industry was wearing on me and it was time to move on. My mom loved my discount.
good,There was good and bad things working at bed bath and beyond. They had good hours of working I liked working first shift and it was from 5 to 3:30 I was able to do other things after
good,It was a good starting job. I had just graduated High School and was starting college soon. So I decided to try looking for a part time job to cover the costs. And This job covered it.
good,this a very nice place to work at. The managers are always aware of everything and that is very helpful. The main focus are the costumers and they always seem happy
good,"While I worked for BB&B, I really enjoyed it! The people there are friendly and since there are so many managers and supervisors walking around at  any given time, (1 manager/supervisor for every 10 employees) it's just about a 100% guarantee that you will not be left alone without a helping hand, a little push, and friendly advice regarding the issue. The job I had in particular was on a whole other level of different in which I was more than willing to learn something new. It was a combination of physical labor, which is basically man-handling packages that could weigh up to 50 lbs and placing the correct weight/size of said box onto the appropriate conveyor belt, and computer skills,mainly Microsoft Word and web browsing. Overall, it is monotonous and some departments are more tedious than others, but have to say that I would go back if given the opportunity."
good,I liked the staff working for bed bath an beyond . the daily work wasn't bad at all as long as you were working an getting the task done for the day. I would recommend  this job to associates of mine
good,"I enjoyed working at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  I valued the relationships I made with management.  Fun, fast paced work environment.  Room for advancement."
good,"I loved working here. a typical day would include coming in, having morning meeting, organizing the shelves in my work area, making suggestion to customers locating items, greeting customers, checking them out. the team I worked with were mostly level headed."
good,typical day at work was dealing with costumers and cash and cleaning and taking orders. i liked working at bed bath and beyond because the training was great they didnt just throw you on the floor after two days of training like other jobs i had.
good,"A typical day at work I would help customers find the items they needed, I would ring them up on the register. I would also stock shelves with new inventory or old inventory. I mainly worked in the curtain section. The hardest part of my job was learning about curtains. My manager gave me papers to study and learn about certain rods and curtains. The most enjoyable part of working there was helping the customers and decorating the gifts for customers."
good,"I started in the Bridal Department, was responsible for helping Bridal Couple with their Wedding Registry, was very knowledge with most products in the store, each couple would have to register for over two hundred items, which is great because they can use that registry for house warming as well, there was alot of info on the products, you will have to take classes which I also helped out with.  There were incentives as well, you would get certain Items at 30% or lower.  Had a great time working there."
good,"Every day you were faced with the opportunity to learn a different aspect of the various products sold by Bed, Bath & Beyond. The training and general support that employees receive is unmatched."
good,Great place to get your feet wet when it comes to advancement opportunity. fine tuning ones people skills and the ability to work with others is a plus
good,Good company to work for. You are never alone as there is always someone to help you and to partner with. Training g is outstanding and is taken very seriously.
good,"working at BBB was one of the best jobs I had. the customers we amazing, managers we very professional and committed to the workers and building their knowledge of the companies products."
good,"Worked there 11 years. Worked my way up from part time employee to store manager.  The pay is better than most, however due to soft sales, management tiers we reconfigured and 900 dept.managers and keyholders were laid off.  Still would recommend as an employer."
good,This company was interesting because they recruit most of their management rather than train internally. It was a nice experience to be exposed to managers from other companies.
good,"Fun work environment with great bonus program for representatives. Wouldn't change nothing at all. Schedules become flexible after the 90 day period. Once you have cleared 90 days, let the fun begin."
good,Steady paced position.  Friendly staff/coworkers. Difficulties would include if systems are down as it slows customer assistance.  No day is ever the same.
good,Absolutely love working for this company! They are usually great with working with your schedule . We all make goals and motivate each other to meet and exceed those goals
good,I was always able to accomplish tasks even if I wasn’t able to on my own because all of the employees are very helpful and outgoing. It was like a family where each person helps to teach and help each other grown within the company.
good,"associates must know products in their departments at minimum"
good,The company was very flexible with hours and I learned a lot of skills from sales to customer service. Overall the managers and employees did their jobs very well and the managers made it easy to learn with patience.
good,"Assisted customers on all issues, complaints, returns, refunds, exchanges, product dissatisfaction, out of stock product. Oversaw associates with customer issues, when associate misled customer. Always going beyond to assure that customer's request/complaint is heard, having empathy, rectifying the issue to do whatever to go beyond to ensure a returning satisfied customer."
good,It was great working there just as long as u do what do you have to do it was fun everyone there is so funny an fun and so cool when you need some of them are there to help u
good,it is not too demanding when busy it is very engaging and can be an enjoyable however when it is not the work can sometimes be boring overall it is a very enjoyable job and the company is very good to their workers
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun place to work, the advancement opportunities are excellent and the company allows you to be creative within guidelines.  I enjoyed my time there."
good,"I started there on a cash register. Then worked the sales floor, stocking and helping customers. Then was moved to shipping & REC. An also did RTV,s then moved to online orders. The hardest part of the job was trying to help rude or unhappy customers. I also did not care to count money and night when closing. that was stressful to me."
good,"very fast-paced environment, customer service based. I learned a lot from fellow employees that would trained me. Management encouraged employees on moving up in the company. Employees here always help each other out."
good,customer service and safety top priority....freight put away working together as a team...merchandise resets....the most fun...customer interaction daily and helping the customer get the right items
good,"Pretty relaxed work environment with flexible hours.  Just like any retail job, you are expected to wear many hats throughout your shift and be knowledgeable in most areas of the store."
good,I was trained for multiple positions by the BBBY HR teams.  I was able to perform all of those jobs.  There were many good days and aome bad days as well.
good,"Great fellow employees, great customers, and an all together great job! I looked forward to working there every day that I was scheduled. No two days were alike."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond has provided me with a safe place during my hardest times in my life. Management never gave up on me and so did the awesome co-workers.
good,I worked with a company while I was looking for employment elsewhere. It was enough to get the bills paid for and it was similar to the career field I worked in while I served in the military. I would recommend this job to those who are looking for a quick paced and flexible employment.
good,"bridal specialist and customer service, went to bridal shows and help customers with gift registry. I enjoyed my job and did learn many other jobs within the store too. We also got the opportunity to purchase products at almost cost if we signed up for demonstrations by product reps."
good,"Always had a task to complete as it was a very busy workplace. Helped me learn key skills like, time management, how to order products online and how to use a cash register."
good,I found this position very interesting. We had to stock a store and prepare it for opening. There was very much to learn and a very upbeat environment.
good,This is an all hands on deck work environment. Everyone is required to do labor work including the Store Manager. Something different to do on a daily basis.
good,Enjoy working there. Excellent  customer service training! It is very busy during Christmas time and back to school season. It is really good experience.
good,"Working here is okay, it can be frustrating but all that comes with customer service. The hardest part to me about working here was fitting in everybody was already very experienced seemed like I was a bother when asking for help otherwise everything was great."
good,"I would suggest working here in college, like I did. But I would not expect someone to make this retail job their career. The training took about 2 weeks and was very intensive."
good,"While I enjoy working at BBB, there are some issues with upper management. They are took disconnected from what the sales floor staff deals with. They don't allow our store enough man hours to fully cover the sales floor and registers during busy hours leaving customers unattended to or waiting in long lines. There has also been decent amount of moving of managers to and from this store."
good,"The management team was very friendly and knowledgeable. Very patience with a new worker. They take the time to teach you about the register, front end, and all of the departments of the store. The working environment is enjoyable with the sense of still getting a lot of stuff done in the store. They are very good about giving people breaks and being considering of any emergencies that may or may not happen."
good,"The company and its atmosphere is pretty decent. Good communication is available, as well as good attitudes. Overall, not a bad place to work, but not for those who cant handle retail work."
good,"I am a cashier here in Tigard, OR and work part time whenever I'm scheduled.   I enjoy my job because I know a lot of people in this area.  I make sure everyone leaves with a smile on their faces."
good,It was a fun experience to learn about people while helping them the staff are some of the nicest people you could meet and it’s all just caring for one another and the hours are reallly flexible
good,"This was one of my first jobs and it definitely made me more comfortable with the idea of working. The management was incredible and all of the employees were so encouraging. They even continued training me throughout the whole year i worked for the company, always furthering my knowledge of the company, products, and selling techniques. One of the greatest things about the company is that they always encourage you to ask for help when you don't know something. The managers were also very flexible with out schedules always being sure to work around school, work or other schedules."
good,"I enjoyed working at Bbb, but the hours were only part time, I would have preferred  full time. Customers made job fun when  they came in to register for a wedding, or housewarming party. Management  was fun to be around, and got work done with us if anyone was behind. Building displays for different products or new products that would come in was fun to build."
good,Very team oriented very nice and well put together store. leaniant for the most part when it comes to needing time off for a good reason. very clean environment
good,The people were friendly but besides the little bit of training the do for cashiers you kind of learn along the way. Some supervisiors keep you way over your leave time because if “everyone isn’t done” you can’t leave . I used to have to stay till 1 am most week nights
good,"Every day was a challenge to be my best and get any task done, even if I had to ask for help every time I needed it. The management was patient and thorough with my work learning experience."
good,They work a great company to work for excpet they wouldnt work with me. I got sick and was out a few days brought a doctors note and they said it was not aacceptable.
good,"I would show up to work on time for an 8 hour shift, have my break and lunch, then go home. Overall, just a typical job I would expect anywhere. All my coworkers were friendly and I got along with my managers. Super laid back, but in a good way. When there was stuff that had to be done, it would get done."
good,"I really enjoyed being apart of the Bedbath and beyond team. The employees were great and the work was very hands on and very occupying. Additionally, I worked very hard to satisfy the customers and Increase sales in the company."
good,fast past job that require multi-tasking skills to be successful. employees need to be knowledgeable about the merchandise sold in stores and website to better help customers.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond had a fun environment to work in. I enjoy movement, and there was a lot of it! Climbing ladders to put items away, inventory, helping customers find what they need. I worked in busy store so my days always went by so quickly!"
good,"No one is hired fulltime however after working for some time you may be able to advance to full time. Its a decent part time job, if you're looking to make extra money"
good,"I dont know what to really say. The work is fine, but there is a lot to take in. And if im telling you the truth I dont have a passion to be selling bed stuff to costumer all day. And half the time you'll be either helping someone or being the cashier."
good,"I dont know what to really say. The work is fine, but there is a lot to take in. And if im telling you the truth I dont have a passion to be selling bed stuff to costumer all day. And half the time you'll be either helping someone or being the cashier."
good,"This is a good company to work for, however there needs to be more communications and training among all management and associates to better the work environment."
good,"A day of work for me having a great start with great co workers knowing what my assignment is or my job duty so that I can get straight to what I have to do, steady work well focused and always willing to do cross training to learn new things, I have learned new task along my jobs where it cant be help me in future jobs. the hardest part of a job would be bad environment where the company doesn't have things under control and the most enjoyable would be getting threw the day and accomplishing my tasks on time and accurate to my knowledge."
good,"A typical work day starts with me restocking shelves with inventory rolled onto the floor at closing the previous night. Sometimes the shelves get too full, in which case the remaining inventory gets top stocked or back stocked. These may be done with the assistance of another associate but are more frequently done solo."
good,"It was a good job, but it wasn't fit for me. The job was easy, but some of the staff was hard to work with, I didn't feel comfortable with my manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was the department I worked in because is was somewhat related to something I'm interested in."
good,I really liked the environment that I worked in. Everyone was great especially the general manager. My lead was great in training me. I love the products.
good,"Usually a day at work is very unpredictable but you have to be able to adapt to all changes. very busy during the holidays but its worth your time. you become very attached to customers and care for them personally. everyone that works in the establishment is treated like family and you feel like you can talk to the manager about anything. the hardest part of the job is being able to meet bridal and wedding goals, which is sales sales sales!!!!"
good,"Great company. I've been there over 17 years and started as a temp hire.  Great culture and people."
good,"Management there seem a little racist and favored there. They worked me for long hours even when i was pregnant, i really wouldn't recommend anyone working here."
good,"Worked as a cashier, which was pretty easy. Using the coupons could definitely be confusing, because you had to input them at a certain time in the transaction process. Also, there wasn't much training on the floor, other than training for the cashier."
good,Greet Customers and allow them to be comfortable in the environment. Check out customers items and inform them on the products offered that month. If not busy organizing work space would be mandatory to make sure the enviornment was nice and clean. After hours would to stock shelves and help with cleaning.
good,"It's a good place to work , have good benefits and employee discounts  and incentives."
good,very friendly place to work. atmosphere smells wonderful. good interaction with customers. going home smelling good all the time. free lunch. flexible hours
good,"If your like working with people and have a desire to give the best customer service possible, like fast pace environments and willing to work hard, advancement is possible.  This Company is for you."
good,Lots of movement from end cap to end cap based on sales.You learned lots of product knowledge to be able to pass on to customers. Very friendly workplace environment.The hardest part of the job was climbing the ladders to retrieve product. The most enjoyable part was satisfying a customer and their leaving happy.
good,Job was very detail oriented and fast paced. The management was never on the same page and there was very limited communication. There are a lot of opportunities to learn about the products you are selling.
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving early and doing a department walk.  Having a plan for what needs to been accomplished this day.,  Sharing the plan with the employees and checking on them to see how they are doing or if they need some help.  If I did not have enough employees for a daily project I could go to my direct report and see what we could come up with to get the job done."
good,"nice place to work,good managers,ready to work associates and i love their mailing discounts and as is.is one of the places you get good and cheap prices"
good,"There is always something to do at BB and B. We are required to learn product knowledge as classes, and were also trained in online ordering. Employees are constantly moving and rearranging the store while helping customers and setting up displays."
good,Showed me how to handle management when managers didnt agree with one another. They taught me how to properly stock and place items into a computer system.
good,"Well when I started working there the company had a lot to offer to it's employees. But some had a hard time getting there holiday pay  that was promised to them. I felt bad for them, but I really couldn't say anything about it to the people in the office cause it really was not my place. But the job is good, the work is not hard, but it's fast paced and pretty easy.  The items you need to pick to fill the orders are pretty easy to find. But as long as someone is willing to put in the hard work into, the company is willing to take good care of it's employees."
good,At first it was a little intimidating to be told to go up the ladders but as long as you stick to your comfort zone and don't go crazy it honestly became a fun job.
good,"At Bed Bath and Beyond, all employees and management wear many different hats. Job details can be ambiguous which leads one with difficulty determining where his or her duty ends and begins. However, this also allows for a large degree of autonomy in completing work details. Self-starters and individuals with a high need to achieve tend to do well here. That beings said, compensation leaves much to be desired especially when compared to wages in other, similar retailers. This is especially evident in the new Department Supervisor position as details of the position almost exactly mirror that of the former Department Manager and even Senior Manager position with less pay and hours to compensate."
good,"Retail is retail, but Bed Bath and Beyond ads a fun and unique twist where the customer always comes first. Ability to create a neighborhood store atmosphere and offers entrepreneurial ordering/chasing opportunities for displaying merchandise focusing on duplicating successes of peers and being a merchant"
good,"I would go back if I could but do to my own situation, I am unable to return. I know they would love to have me back as well. The coworkers were nice and helpful, as well as the manager's."
good,"I've only been with the company for a few months now but so far I enjoy it. Environment is pretty relaxed and everyone is relatively friendly- you can wear jeans/sneakers to work if you want to but everyone still relatively dresses well. "
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers locate what they're looking for, placing orders for online items. Responding to customer inquiries on the phone. I've learned to interact with customers, learn  how to meet their needs an create needs for them. My managers have always been helpful in assisting me to learn about the products and the customer service that is required to make every customer's experience a success. We are motivated to be successful employees as we learn and grow with the company. The hardest part of the job is  being alert every time and must be ready to deliver unparalled service at every point and time while being called to multi task. The most enjoyable part of the job is going beyond the call of duty to meet and exceed the customers needs."
good,Its a cool place to work at. Staff is mostly friendly and they welcome you as you come in to work. The manager is cool too and they make the job experience to your full benefit. They work with your schedules if you go to school or have another job and whatsoever and they make the environment calm and cool.
good,"Job duties were easy. Really did't lean much from this place, most all of it is repetitive. No brain stimulation what so ever. This is a great place to work of you are really not looking forward to move up. Management was okay. Hard part of the job was lifting too many heavy things."
good,I enjoyed working at the customer service counter with my coworker it was fast paced never boring and the shift went by very quickly. All in all a good place to save up some money to go back to school or get a car.
good,"Good company. Managers wear all hats. You have a job title, but it is all inclusive. You merchandise, cashier, inventory control, loss prevention, coach and counsel associates and above all customer service is job one. Exceptional soft skills are a must."
good,It can be a little stressful when putting away stock and also helping customers at the same time.  The culture focuses on safety and helpfulness which comes in handy when you are new and need help getting the hang of things.  The people there are very helpful and welcoming.
good,"Attending customers with whatever their needs may be.  This includes returns, purchases, adjustments, and college and new mover purchases.  The only stressful part is the rushes of customers without enough staff to help everyone at that moment.  The work relationships are what make working there worth it. The fellow employees are very helpful and understanding."
good,"Love the company, the employees and my job.  I worked in the registry department.  The only reason I left this job was because I had moved out of state."
good,"It was ok, steady until new management arrived.  The company paid decent, did not get too many hours over time and limited growth options available.   Ends to a means"
good,"Taking care of Inventory Issues and doing price changes. Taking care of customers and helping to cover Breaks. I have learned great customer service skills.The management team there is great. "
good,"My typical day included: •	Unload trucks, sort merchandise, bills of lading, load trucks, make sure shipments were verified, clean and maintain back stockroom, stock floor with merchandise, inventory."
good,"It was a typical retail job when I was in high school and college.  It was my first retail job and this is where I learned how to work with others, complete tasks in a timely fashion, manage the customer service desk, working cash registers including closing out the deposit, and scheduling."
good,"The Job was pretty straight forward. You come in put away merchandise, refill merchandise, help customers, keep areas clean, and go home. There was room to move up and the benefits were good."
good,Never bored and worked on register. Co-workers were friendly as well. Customers enjoyed my customer service. But did not give me enough hours.........
good,I actually looked forward to going to work everyday. We had a pretty great team and you always had help if you needed it. Very balanced and the management was outstanding.
good,"Bed bath and beyond is a great place to work at. Great customer service, excellent  policies and procedures  and people friendly. Bed bath and beyond is proud of how well they merchandise and our great return policie."
good,Very easy job to have. It stinks because it is a retail company. So it is always open 7 days a week. Very understanding when it comes to scheduling. Great benefits
good,"Working for Bed Bath and Beyond has definitely taught me a lot about working on your own. Management was there to help, but only when they wanted to help. I felt as if I had more upsetting and angry calls, over anything else."
good,"it was a very nice environment to work in all the supefrvisors  were great at teaching new things, they were very flexible on your hours if you needed some time off"
good,"I like working with this company , even though it was just seasonal I really like my supervisor he was really cool with everyone, he was understanding"
good,Great company to work for.  Very well managed and maintained.  job enhancement potential. learned a lot about household goods and products on the job.  Learned many valuable skills about customer appreciation.
good,its a very busy workplace and customer service is the number one priority management is great they work with you and teach you things. everyone is very nice.
good,Great company too work for wonderful people great location. good on giving you hours. Benefits are nice. Training was a little hard because its a lot of information to know but they help you very well.
good,"It was a great place for a college student . Really fun work environment , a lot of cool things to interest you in the store. Management were really professional."
good,I enjoyed working at Bed Bath because they worked with my schedule or school and it was a great place to work. I work off and on for a few years. I worked at two locations.
good,"BBB has been wonderful to me, they have been very flexible with my school schedule.  As soon as you start working the other employees make you feel at home, and apart of a team.  I love this part time job."
good,You can learn a lot work at Bed Bath . In any room of your house or even your apartment . All managers are very helpfully and knowledgeable  in any store work in .
good,"Worked for the company part-time and full-time for about 10 years.Loved the fact that Customers were always #1. Some companies say that, but Bed Bath MEANS IT! Everything comes second to the customer and their immediate needs. They also try to work around your schedule..be it school or another job or even family. Also loved that they teach you about the products and how to effectively assist the customer in selecting the perfect product."
good,"Even in today's retail climate, Bed, Bath, and Beyond strives to invest training and development into management and associates.  The company posesses a decent operational infrastructure, and provided that management follows it, the stores will run with optimum efficiency.  There is a bit of delusion that customer service expectations can be met alongside visual standards with the payroll allotments, but it seems that is the way of things in retail as a whole.    The company operates from a place of integrity and common sense."
good,"I loved working at bed bath and beyond. Its a laid back environment. It only gets hectic during rush hours and big sales, but besides that, you are not doing much. The people who work there are really nice and friendly."
good,Busy and efficient. early mornings and late nights.  easy and Rewarding helping in customer service. Enthusiastically provide excellent customer service at all times. Trained new sales hires to advance from cashier to Customer Service Representative
good,"it was fun when I got to do inventory and  travel to others stores, the pay wasn't the best but it worked tell I could find something better, the Managers we good and helped out when needed and so did some of the other assoistes"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet people  from diverse background. The hardest part of the job was having to climb ladders. I learned about different bedding and pillows.
good,Nice facility and kind supervision. Its has a decent hourly rate for college kids and starter positions. Decent hours and career opportunities fun atmosphere
good,Very fast paced customer service based company with many things to do throughout the day as well as options to grow and advance in the company from within as well as good life skills learned there as well
good,"good place to work, good schedule and hours. pay rate could of been better. clean place to work for. HR was helpful at times they need to care more about the employees."
good,"A typical day would be working in the customer service station, as a cashier handling all customers sales but also handling exchanges,returns and angry customers. The management was great and very understanding when i had to leave due to living situations and the fact that i was moving back home. One of the best parts about the job for me was the people i got to work with, they were all wonderful people and so fun to work with."
good,The environment is very pleasing everyone's so nice to each other its a multicultural  place. The work is easy and they don't require you to go to unbelievable pace.
good,"I enjoyed working there. if a customer needed assistant in any department I would help."
good,"Starting as a phone representative, I often dealt with either placing orders for the online website, or angry people due to an issue with their order or registry. I learned how to handle all the computer systems and how to manage and calm down angry customers. I worked to be on the Chat and Email team, and learned how to better handle the systems and how to portray emotion through written words. Management works to take care of their people, but the customers can still be nasty, just like with any call center. At least it is inbound calls."
good,"This was a demanding job but I was compensated fairly well, employee discounts were great, and the people there are wonderful. They do extensive training, and make an effort to teach you new things the entire time you are working there. The biggest problem I had was the short (five minute) breaks."
good,Our days consisted of making the customer happy and selling the product. Management always made sure everything was done right for the customers because customer service was our main priority.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of doing online orders for customers, helping customers locate items, being a back-up cashier, doing returns at the customer service desk, answering the phone, helping managers do certain tasks, and recovering the floor at the end of the night. I learned about all different products in the store. I got along with all my co-workers, and some i'm still good friends with. The most enjoyable part was seeing customers satisfied and knowing I was able to help them."
good,I worked in many different positions and got many different perspectives while working at Bed Bath. This job taught me how to work effectively and how hard I had to work to achieve my goal. Lots of multitasking was required but the customer interaction was what made it worth it.

good,"a typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond actually is not bad at all. walking the sales floor making sure things are being put where they are supposed to be. as you walk the sales floor you want to make sure customers are satisfied while being there, greet them, check up on them from time to time and find out what is needed. the co workers range from being in high school all the way to being a senior citizen so there are a lot of people you will learn to get to know. what i learned within this job are better ways to sell, and better ways to work with customers. the hardest part of the job was staying later, while the store closes at 9:30 pm you will be working till almost 11. but it wasn't bad. the most enjoyable part was the holiday, the season will put you in place and make you feel a lot more comfortable."
good,"At Bed Bath and Beyond I enjoyed being able to dress casually and being able to communicate with my co-workers around me. Everyone was always really nice and helped you out whenever you needed. I learned how to use bar codes and find items through a small electronic device. I enjoyed being able to guide customer through the store to help them find what they were looking for, it really helped me to open up with customers."
good,"Management is always helpful, although the vetting process for managers hired from the outside and inside alike is lacking. Working at BB&B has helped my customer service skills skyrocket to the level of advanced, in my opinion. Customer reviews and general satisfaction of other at the workplace prove this."
good,"Learned a lot from the experience there, had the opportunity to advance in a decent time frame. Co-workers were all college age, so environment was fun and easy going."
good,"My hours varied at Bed Bath and Beyond, depending on how big of a shipment we received. Everyone in receiving got along and we knew how to joke around while still accomplishing our tasks. While some days were 8 hour days and others were 12 hour days, it was a great place to work."

good,"Fun environment, though sometimes overwhelming when we are busy and short handed. Always keeping busy with a wide range variety of tasks. Learned how to deal with customers the right way, we treat or customers very well. Caring management but it is difficult to receive credit for the things you accomplish. Much is expected, but hardly anything is rewarded. Difficult company to move up in. Great group of people, very thoughtful. Your colleagues are like family. Great benefits and steady hours."
good,Everyday is always different projects to do.  Always engage with customers and try to solve their problems.  Working with different and new people most of the time.
good,"This is a very family oriented store, they are more then helpful when it comes to adjusting hours for school. The managers are incredibly helpful and the coworkers help replenish the store as well as completing daily projects. The hardest part of the job would be ensuring all of your projects are done to corporate level but the most enjoyable part of the day would be interacting with customers seeing as we get all sorts of characters in our store."
good,My day would start a 5pm right after my other job. Management is always willing to help you fix any issue. Co-workers enjoy talking a lot when its slow. People are friendly and easy to talk to. Hardest part is letting the customer leave unhappy because we did not have what they where looking for. All around enjoyable
good,I worked in many different positions and got many different perspectives while working at Bed Bath. This was my first job so it taught me how to work effectively and how hard I had to work to achieve my goal. Lots of multitasking was required but the customer interaction was what made it worth it.

good,but it keeps making me do it I hate doing this typical day I would go to work and actually work while others worked working here was fun
good,"Working the customer service desk/cash registers at Bed, Bath and Beyond was a helpful learning experience. I learned a lot about working in a team and getting the job done under pressure. We had a very supportive and hands on management at my branch which was a plus. Everyone was friendly and was there to assist you if need be. You really had to learn to become a multi-tasker because the job could get pretty stressful. Over all, it was a satisfactory working environment."
good,At Bed Bath & Beyond I have had the opportunity to learn many new things pertaining to customer service as well as retail in general. As I work day to day different customers enter the store and have various needs. By having management train me and answer any questions I had I'm able to excel at my job as a sales clerk. The hardest part of the job would be having to balance out assisting multiple customer needs at once. But once the customer leaves satisfied I find that the most gratifying part of the job.
good,"Compensation really depends on the location but despite that, Bed Bath & Beyond doesn't feel like the typical retail location, more engaging with customers. Management is always looking to motivate the team and keep the ball rolling. This is a place that will be here for the long time and you can feel the comfort and stability you can have with the company. Many employees have been with the company for over 10 years."

Current location I work at, makes sure you are trained in majority of departments: Example-Customer Service Desk, Sales Floor(for both Hard lines and Soft lines), and Bridal office which is extremely helpful when assisting customers with products. Down side of the job is that the location is about 20-30min drive to and from where I live..(Oshkosh)"

Its important to be a self starter and take initiative. "
good,"Fun place to work, relaxed environment"
good,Working in the back keeps you busy at all times. Pulling packages out of trucks and stocking them. Then taking them off the shelves in the back and bring them out to stock them on the floor.
good,"BBB was a great experience, first hired as a cashier and three months later front end supervisor. I loved my employees, at times of the day we wouldnt have many customers so we would start helping each other with chores that needed to be done so we could leave on time. The mangers were awesome and funny, never dull moments!"

I enjoyed helping and assisting guests at all times even the difficult ones.I loved working with my co-workers because they were always in a good mood.I wanna say the hardest part of working there was getting on ladders and down stocking. The most enjoyable part of working there was the people I got to meet and know. I enjoyed making sure my guest got the best customer service and got what ever they came in for.
good,"A typical day at work included of greeting each and every customer ensuring  a positive entrance into the store. Recovery, which meant that each label of every product was to be facing the customer and aligned with the edge of the shelf. Assisting customers with questions regarding if we carried a certain product or the whereabouts of its location in the store. I also personally dealt with exchanges, returns, angry customers and complaints on a daily basis. However, all the staff at BB&B are easy to get along with as long as everyone does their part."
good,my day would consist of performing excellent customer service and ensuring that all customer who enter the store was able to be quickly accommodated and had all there needs met. Upon my employment at bed bath and beyond I learned the importance of team work and also how to manage my time.
good,"If you wanna learn the basic skills of sales and customer service this is the perfect company to do it., they will put all they effort to teach you the bennefits, difference,benefits, etc of every single item sold in the store, you just have to be a motivated worker, every store has they wierd and fun co-workers,the hardest part of the job was keeping your calm and nerve with aggresive customers, (not every day, not all the customers)"
good,"- Fun and Productive"
good,"Working at Bed Bath and Beyond has brought a lot of great experiences. I am able to work with a group of amazing people like my co-workers and customers. The great thing about working at Bed Bath and Beyond is that there isn't a ""typical day"". Everyday there is something new, new customers and new orders. Through out the years I have learned many new skills like how to work under pressure from customers and how to communicate with co-workers. The hardest part of working in retail is that sometimes you can not satisfy everyone. But the important part is trying your best and learning from your mistakes so you know how to better handle the problem next time. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure the customers have a great experience at our store and would want to come again."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Bed Bath & Beyond, loved the managers, co workers, and my job. I worked as a RTV & Receiving Clerk. My job was a fast pace job and I learned to work in such a fast pace. I loved what I did. The only thing I didn't care for was the job security/advancement. I wanted a more challenging job and a job where I could grow and here wasn't the place."
good,"my job is very busy, "
good,People are friendly and always wiling to help. They teach you howto do things on your own but are always there to help when needed.

good,Bed Bath & Beyond was a learning experience dealing with various customers u learn how to approach diffrent people and sell a product tht appeal to the customer
good,"The culture of the store is fantastic. The main concern is for customer satisfaction, and I highly appreciate that. The management and co-workers all strive to achieve this, and will go out of their way to make things happen. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer is surprised about how much effort we would put in to ensure their satisfaction."
good,"Would recommend company for those in retail. The hours are long, but no more than most management positions. When negotiating pay ask for an outrageous number. Their pay scale is higher than the average retailer."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond has great policies which allows for pleasant work and shopping experience.
good,I clock in at 7 a.m. and go to the receiving dock and open the truck that is waiting to be unloaded. Then once the freight truck is delivered I begin to process the freight until completed. After freight is processed I close out the truck and do the correct paperwork and file the paperwork into our files. I learned how to manage a group of workers under myself and get objectives completed in a reasonable time. I learned how to open and close trucks and be a team player by helping out other departments when needed. My co-workers are good workers and have been pleasant to work with. They are part time so they usually work in 3-5 hour shifts. The hardest part of the job was just being able to complete my tasks when others would call out and I would be forced to complete by myself or just short handed. The most enjoyable part would be my co-workers. They are fun and easy going which makes work a lot easier and pleasant.
good,Cashiering maintainning the store and my area re stocking and re shelving 
good,Great place to work and help customers. Managers help build you if you are willing to learn.

good,"Nice place to work for, get to wear jeans. Also the management staff is well rounded. Good pay"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond has a very comfortable work environment with a knowledgable managing staff who takes the time to make sure you acclimate well to your new job. I learned how to manage time more efficiently since I worked and went to school at the same time. The hardest part of the job was working overnight shifts where floor workers would have to reorganize the store (or at least our assigned area) for the next business day. It required a lot of time and focus to make sure all areas were neat and accounted for. I enjoyed working during the store's College Season where it would host special events and bargains for new students. We got to interact with each customer and ensure that they had a great shopping experience, so customer service skills were always being utilized."

good,On a typical work day I can assist up to 30 individuals who are within out store searching for merchandise. I can educate them on almost all the products in the store and find them something that will compliment their needs. I have learn a lot about a variety of products that I use on a daily basis that I did not know before holding this position. My co-workers are all on the same experience level as me and most are college students as well. My management is excellent they will not hesitate to help me or another customer on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job would have to be top stocking heavy merchandise due to the fact that I am on a fold out ladder and there is a chance of falling. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with an array of customers and to build registries for brides.
good,It was like working with a family. Everyone is close there and management is very observant of employee needs.

Packed and unpacked items to be stocked on shelves in stockrooms, warehouses and storage yards"
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a better than average retail store. The managers there rarely asked more of you than was reasonable and if they did, they generally stepped in a helped with the work. The pay was low, but there were reasonable expectations required for advancement within the company. If you have a fear of heights I would stay away from the company because you are required to use ladders to bring down heavy equipment from the tops of shelves."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of coming in early, clocking in when suppose to and grabbing my walkie-talkie and getting started in my section. Which was either the Bath/Bedding section or the Kitchen/Hardware section. I learned many things such as all you can know about different types of bed sheets and bedding accessories like thread counts and bed bug protectors and i could answer anybody's questions. My coworkers were all fun and happy to be at work and enjoyed being there. The hardest part of my job was learning everything we sold. Not because it was hard to remember, it just took a long time because we had so many different items and constantly switched them around seasonally. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all the people and the managers.They were always happy to be there and very nice to they other employees and the customers."

good,"I worked double shifts at this occupation, all shifts, and I enjoyed the experience."
good,"Typical day at work was customer service, merchandising and delegating tasks to other employees."

good,the management and employees were very friendly and nice to work with
good,I learned how to work a cashier and stockmerchandise. the management staff was very good and precise
good,"a positive and fulfilling place to work a typical day consisted of helping customers locate and purchase products as needed. also , shipping and receiving products."
good,"A typical day was versitale and energetic. There was always something different to do, the job was so fast paced that the day would slip away without warning. I learned good customer service skills. I also learned how to tender money. The mamngment was good they actually got down and joined you in the dirty work, they were very good with team work. My co-workers were also great teamworkers and also fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was cleaning after the store closed. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and having different task to do."
good,"Punch in, get your notes for the day to plan out what is going to be done, Each day we had out day planned out in 3 hour increments projects, po notes, restocking/dropping, recovering, and freight. MGT is very layed back but on your case to get things finished as well as continue to wait on customers and meet your numbers. Co-workers were good to work with and everyone had a get it done attitude. The hardest part of the job was ballancing the customer service and project mgt as to not neglect the people and finish up on time to move on to the next part of your day. I loved the interaction with the customers who shoped at the store and being a Bridal Consultant it gave a different prospective into what people are looking for and what they acutually need."
good,"BEd Bath and Beyond was one of the best jobs i have had. It is hard work, and you sometimes bend over backwards to make customers happy but it is definitely worth it. If you take advantage of all the learning tools provided you can go far. Some days can be longer than others and as management you are required to work a 45-50hour work week."
good,"Growing company. Believes in promoting within and rewarding hard work. Sets industry standards, puts employees first. Demands a 60+ hour work week from management/senior management. Does not offer the same benefits packages to all managers."
good,May have only been temporary but the overall experience was good
good,"Benefits at Bed, Bath and Beyond are awesome and pay is slightly better than competitors. The company was undergoing a change in CEO as I was leaving and some better changes were being made. Company is all about Customer Service"
good,They expect their employees to work all the different jobs but get paid minimum wage which is not fair to the employee. They are although understanding about having to call out every now and then and do work very well with your availability especially if you are in school or not.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond strives to be there for every guest that comes in the doors or calls on the phone. They expect employees to help guests find what they are looking for and work with them to find the right product for them keeping their interests in mind. It’s an expectation that every guest be greeted and made sure they find what they came for regardless if they purchase anything at the time.
good,I learned several skills from this job. I learned how to better my customer service skills and how to deal with customers.The managers were very organized with breaks for the employees and helped assist if needed. I really enjoyed the teamwork from everyone I worked with.
good,"As with any company, job satisfaction depends on the group you work in at the company.  Overall, my experience has been positive and I have been fortunate to be part of a good team where my colleagues support each other.  The pressure of online competition is forcing the company to re-evaluate its marketing strategy and vision in the retail marketplace, so downsizing and outsourcing has, and will continue to be part of this effort.  The company has a diverse workforce, and particularly notable is the presence of many older workers.  It remains to be seen if this trend will continue in future downsizing efforts."
good,"A typical day as a bridal consultant contained product escorts, scheduling appointments and making phone calls. Working on the sales floor was a relaxed atmosphere. Helping customers locate items and restocking shelves while gaining knowledge of our products."
good,"Management can be a little over baring because they are pressured due to the company's financial state. Other than that, the company is relaxed and a nice place to work at. The ladder to promotion is a little steep and the learning curve is higher than most retail stores due to the vast amount of products with over 12,000 SKUs per store."
good,"Displined and very structured.  Great organization.  Management well trained. Good people, but not very personal. Solid job with good security and benefits."
good,Great people. The manager was nice. The hours were fair at times. Probably could have paid more but the starting pay was not bad. Was well cleaned. That's all.
good,"This is a fun place to work! Believe me this company is about teamwork, and it is invaluable to making sure you complete what needs to be done. Management is friendly and always willing to help."
good,"Had a really great time working for BBB. All the employees I worked with were great people...although there are always a couple that you don't see eye to eye with. Very fast paced location that I was at. Stressful but rewarding. Management went from lackadaisical to tyrannical to really benevolent! It is a true statement that people generally do not quit ""jobs"" they do however quit ""managers"". The training was not the greatest. I did do a few days of ""Register Training"" that was more listening to words read off of instructions. I never got to shadow anyone nor did I shadow them. I was thrown into the fray and left to sink or swim. Luckily I am a good swimmer...lol No one should ever have to be trained that way. it is bad for the employee, bad for the customers, and bad for the company. All in all, it ended up being a really great place to work."
good,"The people there are nice when the work is not too stressful, Management itself is well balance on face to face interaction. if it may be, management needs improvement on communication when it comes to the freight team."
good,"Fast-paced retail environment where many of the decisions are made by store management and/or in collaboration with store associates.  Merchandise moves quickly, either purchased by customers/associates or physically moved to different location in store."
good,"It could be stressful stuck behind the cash register. I preferred to be out on the floor, but I was good at the cash register, and deescalating customers in returns..."
good,"It's a great place to work with great people, just don't expect to get paid very much unless you plan to move up the corporate ladder, which if motivated, is very doable."
good,"Bed, Bath and Beyond was the place to work, at the time I was there. Then they expected me to do more than what I signed on for; I did like the job..."
good,BBB would be a good job for a person looking to advance in the retail business although low paying could be good in learning communication and customer service skills
good,"Only downside was the Restructuring of Management , lots of jobs lost, but other than that is was great working there. People really cared about their people there."
good,This is a great place to work if you enjoy helping people. They are very big on customer service. The people are very helpful and the perks and discounts are incredible.
good,"Shifts were typically 4 to 8 hours, and they involved tasks such as stocking, item lookup, and customer service. Management was professional if not always consistent."
good,"Learned about retail working here, and started to learn more about retail receiving vs. construction receiving, much more involving then just a few deliveries a day with all the big trucks"
good,"I worked in the bridal department of bed bath and beyond. I would get to work, and clean the glass and set up new displays. then as brides would come in to register I would walk them through the store helping them pick items that best fit their lifestyles and longings, showing them how to register through the bed bath and beyond registry. My managers were great and very easy to work with. worst part of the job was dealing with mother inlaws and the best part was helping couples create their perfect home."
good,Very open to teach people about different jobs within the workplace. Very willing to work with you around school and other schedules. Coworkers are very open armed and willing to teach anything if you’re willing to learn.
good,"I have been at this specific location for over 4 years. This place definitely has its ups and downs when it comes to hours, management, and environment. But overall is a great company to work for!"
good,Good company to work for.  Best at customer service that I've ever seen.  Provides excellent training on customer service and product knowledge. Good chance for advancement.
good,While at Bed Bath and Beyond I always had various task to complete  but never given a set direction per say; this is how I am most comfortable working I feel I work much better when given the freedom to use reasoning skills. The company had also bee very flexible with me being a full time student that goes to school out of state.
good,I like working here. I was a seasonal worker. I have not decided if I will go back to work there in the summer due to other commitments. I love the work culture.  It is very diverse and the people made me feel really.
good,Works hard to make sure all employees can work autonomously while also stressing the need to always make the costumer happy. All employees are trained to handle any department.
good,"This is not for the faint of heart. You will work very hard at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but you will be rewarded with opportunity to advance. There is competition for positions, yet you must work well with your competitors to be successful."
good,My experience was fine. A typical day at work included more of customer service than anything else. As a sales associate my duty was to make sure the customer found what he/she was looking for and try to add on additional sales.
good,"Nice place too work , good pay , the managers could some times get on your nerves but that’s probably anywhere so i guess it doesn’t really matter. If the pay was weekly it would be way better."
good,This company is good to work for. Always changing and  great people to work with.  The hours are not consistent and change week to week.  The discount is great for all locations.
good,"Definitely a nice place to work, just a lot of pressure for someone who is in college and not good working late hours. I loved everyone I worked with, and have no complaints."
good,This is a great company to work for part-time. Upper management wasn’t the friendliest and some of the managers in the store were not appreciated. Hopefully this was only the location I worked at.
good,"The Braintree branch was absolutely wonderful. It was like a big family. It was such a great work environment. Once I had to relocate to Seekonk I absolutely hated it. I did not like the managers, they wouldn't trust me with medial tasks. It was just so different."
good,"everyone was a team player , friendly place to work my superiors were very friendly and respectful, hours flexible no hassle if you got sick, as you learn you get avance"
good,"Great company to work for if you are driven, self starter, outgoing, and motivated; never boring. I worked at multiple Bed Bath & Beyond locations and the culture of the company, People are the Business, is consistent throughout.Bed Bath & Beyond holds their employees to a very high standard of product knowledge, integrity, & service to its' customers."
good,It was a good place to work. The employees were awesome. The work was pretty fast paced. But when you are working overnight you appreciate it. It helps you stay awake.
good,"I enjoyed my co workers and assisting customers.Great on the job training and assistance.Co workers help each other out when needed and the supervisor staff,are also very helpful as well."
good,Nice company to work for they have a good crew of people at most location and will try to give you the best hours that work for you I would recommend this job to anyone trying to get into retail
good,"I have worked for BBB for a long time and over the years many things have changed. On an average day you are assisting customers constantly. It is a very fast paced work environment. There is a lot of heavy lifting that most people don't think happens there. Up and down ladders all day, very physical demanding job."
good,"As a Bed Bath and Beyond employee, you make the customer's visit enjoyable. You aid them with anything they need help with and you also make sure they're always taken care of."
good,On average normal and fair productivity within store hours and non-store hours. Overall it has a blance work setting other than holidays and promotional sales.
good,"I like this job because i got to learn something different everyday . learn levels to pot and pan or to kitchen "
good,This would be the best call center I ever worked in...... If the pay wasn't so bad. They do inside advancement and they work with you to make sure you succeed. It is a little strict on the QA side just to assure the customers are receiving the best service possible but as long as you follow what they tell you to do you can definetly succeed and advance with BBB.
good,"bed bath and beyond is a friendly atmosphere, I love my co-workers. we are like a family. We treat people how we would want to be treated. We provide excellent costumer service. We do everything we can to make sure the costumer is satisfied and that we make a profit."
good,"It is a great place to work if you need a little bit of an extra income. The work atmosphere is good and it is managed well. They have a very flexible work schedule which has worked well for me."
good,"A typical day was keeping seasonal and the bridal station clean stocking candy and coffee and performing any closing duties. I learned that while retail might be a hard job it is also the most rewarding job in providing experience. The management was nice and very helpful when I was learning a new skill. The workplace culture was friendly and inviting. The hardest part of the job was the holiday rush, the first couple of hours were hard but the rest of the day went smoothly. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer find what they were looking for weather of a gift registry or shopping for a gift."
good,I personally loved working here even when I had difficult customers. It was a wonderful experience and it makes me always happy knowing I have a place to fall back on
good,"My work environment:"
good,"My experience as an employee was that I learned to bond with my co-workers and understand how the retail service world works. The ability to speak a certain language and communicate with various people were rough, but once you get used to the environment, it becomes very much a part of you. I can't experience the friendliness and warmth like I did working at Bed, Bath and Beyond and I'd recommend to anyone who needs a first job."
good,This place was a great start to gain work experience somewhere. The management was great and the people I worked with were great as well. The only downfall was the physical toll on your body from restocking.
good,"I have learned a lot from this company. My immediate supervisors and Director are great people. At times, upper management is not supportive but only in extreme situations. The company offers time off and acceptable benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job is not being micro-managed. However, this will vary depending on your direct supervisor."
good,"I enjoyed the job.  The managers are very directly involved with their agents, I enjoyed my co-workers, the job is very easy and I enjoyed helping customers.  The facilities are excellent and very well-maintained.  The only problems I had here was that they could certainly consolidate their systems as we had a lot to use, which for me is not really an issue because have extensive computer knowledge but for someone who is new to call centers or not very familiar with computers it can be overwhelming.  Also, I had some problems with the way HR handled certain things, and not just with me but with other agents as well."
good,It was great but it was just the managers were very racist and I lost my job for no reason at all but I made a lot of great friends while I was there.
good,This is actually one of my favorite jobs. They guarantee you your 40 hours per week. However they are strict so Dont think they not watching. You have three breaks two fifteen min breaks on the clock and one 30 min lunch which is off the clock. It is very easy work for good pay.
good,"The Management is great, everyone is very friendly and the co-workers are easy to get along with. Job advancements were given based on performance and management follows up with you to make sure you are in a position where you are happy!"
good,"this was a very good experience for me , i was recruited from my previous job to work here, many years brought many new adventures. i did everything from recieving to sales floor."
good,"An organization which prides itself on setting standards and exceeding high expectation of their employees.  The culture is a hard working, yet customer friendly culture."
good,"The job is overall a good experience for an entry level job. It doesn't pay minimum wage which is a plus and the employees are helpful in every way shape and form. however my only downside is that I don't have the capacity of continuing to work with the wage that is given, since i am currently in college and have a car, i have to try and pay as much as i possibly can before graduation"
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a good place to get your first job, or as a job in between jobs. They give you steady hours, train you when necessary, and are very good about working with your availability. "
good,I learned a lot about the different aspects of the company and how to handle different scenarios.Was taught how to read multiple reports to ensure proper steps were taken to succeed.
good,"At Bed Bath and Beyond, I learned a lot of things such as how to be fully engaged with customer or even how to handle task properly"
good,"Its retail, so a high turnover rate can make some days more stressful than others due to a lack of coverage. Not the most physically demanding job but you do walk and are on your feet all day. Fourth quarter or the Black Friday till January is stressful. Inventory happens every year around February and I enjoy the break from the day to day tasks. Hardest part of my day is managing customer service during all of the lunch breaks."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty good, go in get a radio and pretty much do my thing. If they needed help in the registers they would call me through the radio I would go help. Help out customers on the floor helping them find what they needed, looking items up and looking for their stuff in the back. Fill coffee and other items such as dinnerware, kitchenware, candles, vacuums, etc. Register people or help them find their online registries. At the end of the night we would clean up and help down stock put stuff back where they go and leave the place as clean as we can. Hardest part of the job was dealing with too many customers at a time have to move fast and quick. Most enjoyable part of the job was the job was working with people and learning about retail."
good,"I am really responsible with my job, I know how to time management, I never leave my work unfinished, and Mangers said that I am really fast and organized when it come to duty tasks. I can manage 3 customer at the same time. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unreasonable people that do not want to heard NO. The most enjoyable part of my job is to work with my co-workers and when the customers tell you thank you so much for all your help and wonderful job."
good,"Long hours spent behind a computer. Hardest part of the job was not always getting recognition for things brought to the table.  One boss would play off the new ideas as his own.  The most enjoyable part was many of my co-workers, and training associates and managers, and seeing the ""light bulb"" light up when they understood what I was teaching."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a great company to work for. I love all of my coworkers and the relationship we all have is wonderful. The only thing I would have to say is the rate of pay for the amount of labor and work we put in every day does not match. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor every morning and going the rest of the day extremely tired. But meeting all the nice customers and seeing my coworkers makes up for that. Unfortunately the managers aren't always on the same page as one another and it makes the job a little difficult.
good,Learn hands on with great management and room for advancement.  very flexible with scheduling. i would recommend this job to my family and friends if needed.
good,I learned to treat every customer the same way with respect and provide excellent customer service while doing it safely.
good,"I enjoy working here, the managers are relaxed but are helpful to working with new employees. Also the days go by quickly and smoothly."
good,A very constant productive place with lots of customers. Customer satisfaction is the main goal of every worker .we all most know how to sell any item productively.
good,"Working for Bed Bath and Beyond was an experience that was both good and bad. It was a good experience because any individual that may have been difficult to be around was often too busy to mess with me. Also, the work culture was lite and up beat. The bad part was that I wanted more hours and money, but the opportunity to have more hours and a raise were not offered to me. Overall, in-spite of the difficulties working at Bed Bath and Beyond was fun."
good,"Working hard to attend my goals and objectives, respectful and enjoy sharing experience with other co-workers. It is fun working where everyone knows what to do and ready to help."
good,"Can never get bored working for BBB, new product arrives every day!"
good,willing to contribute to the success of a world class organization which has focus on developing employees. I am currently working with BBB. A replenishment and receiving associate. we have a very capable workforce who always avail themselves to learning and helping one another in achieving corporate objectives.
good,"After clocking in, I would personally get a briefing from the supervisor if he/she is available at the time. I would then report to my post (Front End and sometimes on Hard Lines) and relief my co-worker after getting a quick briefing of what's going on. I would assist customers by answering their questions to the best of my abilities. I would use suggestive selling skills and good customer service. I would help the supervisor do whats needed of me. When it's closing time me and my co-workers were responsible for cleaning our work areas as well as cleaning the bathrooms, door-ways, and organizing/restocking the shelves. It was a nice job to have."
good,A typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond is steady paced. I have learned that to make any customer happy with their experience with us is to WoW them. By offering excellent customer service and going above and beyond what they may expect. The management and other co-workers are friendly and very informative when in comes to learning new things about our company. One hard thing about the job is unfortunately the customers leave unhappy. And not being able to help with what they originally came in for. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opposite of the hardest part. Seeing a customer leave happy and leaving with everything they came in looking for.
good,"A wonderful atmosphere. Enjoyed working here, A variety of jobs given."
good,wasnt bad just get sick of the late hours and sttocking the place till 12 am
good,A typical work day involves performing multiple task while ensuring that the needs of the customer are being met. I learn about new resources in providing customer service. As a member of the management team I find that we all work together efficiently to accomplish the goals and expectations of the company. My co-workers make the environment a fun place to work within. The ability to take care of customers make the job enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed my 2 year run here but after a sick leave and some management issues I got fed up and called it quits. I wish the employees needs were considered more. Had awesome managers who I know cared but at the end of the day I think district was the main problem at my store.
good,I move to different departments a lot. when I first started gift wrap was my primary job. It is a very easy job. Its mostly women so there is a lot of gossip. Management sucks!! Most of them only care about production. If your one of those people who can look pass gossip and sucky managers then this is the job for you.
good,"It's easy to work as a team at BB&B. I worked in the Harmon's Department as a sales associate, utilizing my resources to give outstanding customer service as well as balancing out my other responsibilities with great multi-tasking skills to clean my department in a quick and productive manner as well as working the registers."
good,"A typical day at work, busy when your cross train. I have learned a lot, because everyone is cross train. the management team is very warm. "
good,"management is laid back, the products in store are entertaining to just look at, customers tend to be very nice, decent pay but no benefits unless full-time. full-time is hard to get in BBB cause they place by seniority"
good,This company is great to work for.The managers are friendly and caring.
good,A typical day of work requiures you to help customers and put out new merchandise that has came in for the week. I have learned to multi-task and use good time management. The hardest part of the job is completing a task and then another management member have a change in mind and you have to redue the project you just finished. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and meeting new people.
good,"A typical day at work is never the same! Although I do have a basic routine and set my own daily goals, one just never knows what is going to happen."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place for people just starting out in the work force. It sets the foundation for those interested in retail. Throughout the years, I have learned about a wide variety of home products, and I have been able to put them to out of work use."
good,great day to day can do attitude shown by all employees. Solid leadership from top down and management listened from bottom up. All emplyees believed their efforts made a difference. The hardest part was leaving the company to pursue a better opportunity in another industry.
good,"learn how to do bridal registry,beyond orders"
good,Had no problems working at bed bath and beyond Good company I don't have anything to say about them
good,I love that my company allows me to help my customers leave happy. I enjoy working with a variety of people and no day at work is ever considered boring. Our management team gets along well and we help each other to succeed.
good,"Typical day at work for me is walking the floor and assisting customers with questions. I have just completed my training to become a bridal consultant, which enables me to help brides register for their upcoming weddings."
good,"This company was great at promoting within and encouraged it continually. Management was consistent in reviewing calls and interactions with customers to ensure you were progressing as well as providing customers with the best service possible. The benefits were great and easily accessed. The most difficult part about the job was handling higher maintenance or demanding customers, however, the challenge of problem solving was a great skill to enhance and build upon in those circumstances,"
good,"Great workplace but a single mom w/out child support can't pay rent or other bills on 25 hrs. a week on what they pay. Plus unless you're FT, you're not eligible for benefits. Employees deserve more pay for all the hard work we do & having to deal with some very inconsiderate customers yet we still smile. Employees need $2 more per hour at least to survive & more opportunities for full-time hours."
good,"A great place to work and make sure you have good shoes on, because you will be standing all day. Available work shift are great, good benefits, ok pay "
good,I worked for this company for exactly 4 years before my location closed. I was comfortable going to work everyday and made lots of friends from it. Management was also supportive and included everyone. There was drama here and there but we became a family and supported each other. I would work for this company again.
good,I would recommend working here. I have never had an issue with their policies or hours and I think anyone who is capable of completing a task in a timely manner will have no issue in that work place.
good,"Min wage, as expected, 25 cent yearly raise. Sometimes busy sometimes not, but always something to do to not be bored. Flexible scheduling, give time off if asked for a few weeks ahead of time."
good,"its an easy place to work for, the work isn't difficult but it is abundant. you will  if your lazy and will not get far if you are rude or unpleasant to coworkers or customers."
good,"It was professional, management was great, benefits were good, there was room for job advancement, employees got along. It was a fun place to work and I would’ve loved to continue with the company."
good,"Very nice people, nice pay really enjoy working there. The co workers are nice, they help when needed. Holiday pay. And over time pay was able to work extra hours when needed"
good,"I actually loved working here compared to all the other call centers I’ve been to, this one was the chillest. I had an amazing manager (luckily) but whenever you need help it’s not always there. Sometimes it was like high school but I always got overtime and sometimes when it’s slow they will let you go home early if you volunteer time off (VTO) not paid btw. But the money was good and they do shift bids once you stay there long enough to change your schedule to what you want. Training was long but we should have talked more about the random questions that get thrown at us because sometimes I was left without knowing what to say to the customer, my quality scores were always on point somehow! As long as you go and do your job you will enjoy it! Be on time! The metrics they had to measure whether or not you were doing your job right was all about call flow. I overall learned a lot here and wish I would have stayed but my days off were not consecutive so that messed me up when I started attending school full time. Make sure you’re somewhat computer savvy or else you’re SCREWED!"
good,It have great floor associates but some managers are unprofessional. They is a little favoritism between certain managers and floor associates which may cause other sals associates to feel a type of way.
good,"Overall loved working for Bed Bath and Beyond, however the pay was not nearly enough to get me to stay there. I was essentially doing management work (not by design just do to my experience)."
good,This was my first job in retail. I enjoyed it for the short time I was there. Very customer focused as myself. The company just needs to offer benefits to all and I'm sure it can hold and interest long term candidates.
good,I've been here for almost 2 years and I still enjoy it. The incentives program makes the job worth it. They feed us on large holidays and have cakes when someone is leaving or coming back. The management is amazing and I love my fellow staff. I've made great friends working there and I genuinely do love working there.
good,"I was the one of two recent graduates at this workplace when I worked, rest of them being my senior colleagues.  Everyone was welcoming and friendly enough to get me acquainted with the work environment, workplace culture, and job duties.  I had great time learning and being part of my colleagues at Bed Bath & Beyond."
good,this was one of the best places ive worked for in my professional life. was a great company and the pay was adequate. unfortunately i had to quit unexpectedly due to a personal matter and was deemed unrehireable because of my lack of 2 weeks notice.
good,"Amazing place to work, wonderful staff and products all around you. I can guarantee that you will gain a massive amount of experience that will benefit you in the future."
good,"As a full time employee I worked 8 hours a day."
good,"I learned many customer service skills that I can later use at other job environments. Nice staff, but organization of work schedules was a little bit of a problem."
good,"I been working at  bed bath and beyond for about 5 years now. The people are wondering. But I think it time for me to move on, The company isn't, how it used to be."
good,"Great place to work and workplace culture great management staff, lots of support from district staff as well. Along with great job benefits even including store discounts."
good,"If you are a student looking for a part-time jobs with good availability this is a great job! They fluctuate on hours but normally give you a much as you ask for. I work during the day and occasional evening and am normally happy with my paycheck in the end. "
good,Customer focused company
good,"Bed bath and beyond was an enjoyable work experience, a little more slow pace than what I was use to but the employees were amazing and made me feel like I was welcomed when I started."
good,I worked in the call center it was a very laid back place. I had a lot of support and guidance. I only left because of 9 hour shifts and only getting paid for 8 (hour lunch) it didn't fit in with my schedule.
good,great job opportunity. flexible hours. productive experience. ability to move up in positions. opportunities to learn more relating to customer service. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with different people everyday.
good,"A typical day at work involves you signing into several systems, because we have four other Sister Companies, so all systems has to be up and logged into, Also Phone..Variations of inbound calls will differ, example, Assisting our Bridal Registry clients to Our Baby Cliente."
good,I learned how to handle cash. Co-workers and management was very helpful with any questions.  I enjoyed helping customers and new co-workers. I learned how to handle different situation. It was un-stressful environment.
good,I like working at bed bath & beyond. It's fast paced and sometimes stressful.  Most of the time it's a great place to work. Management changes a lot which can disrupt the people there.
good,"Competitive prices, high customer service level, best bridal registry program around, best place to shop drapery, friendly associates who are willing to go above and beyond to find product for customers."
good,"It has been a great experience so far, with a lot of challenges. I have enjoyed learning how to over come these challenges and growing as an employee."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond was a wonderful place to get my first experience with customer service. I answered and transferred phone calls at an average pace and learned how to enter online/delivery orders. I worked with customers to build registries with the store and developed a skill for achieving customer satisfaction.
good,A typical day at work very fast paced busy all the time i learned how to supervise the front end some of management were very hands on others just sat in office workplace culture was never say no make sure all ailes are cleaned hardest part was to get employees in dept to come get on the register the most enjoyable part of my job was having great friends and family that i got to work close with
good,"•	Manager of customer service and bridal departments, as well as merchandising and leadership of them"
good,So the job that I would do will take inbound calls and I would help customers find their order or place their order or help them get their orders delivered at a cure time and pace and help them also get there 20% discount
good,pleasant place to grow and to learn as an individual. Management is decent just like any other job. People are nice and pleasant to be around and i enjoyed working here.
good,"The staff was friendly, the job was difficult enough to keep you busy and mentally challenged, and the environment was one of productivity and encouraged working hard."
good,"BBBY is a great place to work, and is a great place to advance within the job. the work environment is fun friendly and professional. It was fun and exciting working for BBBY, I felt very secure in my job and was ready to be a permanent full time member of the Orchid team. had I not made the mistake as to when my 90 day probation period was up, and able to use sick days I would be there today, and so I will try again in 6 months as I really liked my job at BBBY in Layton, Ut"
good,Supervisors were very kind and helpful. The work isn't horribly demanding. The pay was fair for the amount of work they asked for. Enjoyed my time there.
good,"I loved working here.  The job is very customer service focused.  Therefore, you spend most of your day helping people and answering questions.  Management was fun and relaxed.  The environment was relaxed also.  I got a raise every year at evaluation and hours were flexible to an extent."
good,Was working here temporary for store opening. Did a lot of pricing and tagging. Also learned some customer service skills. Very friendly people. Helped set up the whole store for opening
good,"Great morning meetings with lots of information, amazing co-workers, management is awesome, and the job itself was a wonderful experience."
good,"It was a fantastic place to work. They started you out at $8.50 an hour, and had a fun, safe work environment. We served many customers, and always tried our best to fulfill the customers needs. I learned more about great customer service, and how to handle all types of people. The hardest part of the job was doing stock after closing and carrying the merchandise up the ladders to the high shelves. What was most enjoyable was folding the towels - believe it or not - and interacting with all kinds of different types of people."
good,"A typical day at this job included restocking merchandise, inspecting rooms to ensure a clean, safe environment, assisting customer's needs, and procuring goods based on demand. I would clean bathrooms and work stations as needed, and dispose of trash and returned items in the appropriate venues. "
good,"The staff at bed bath and beyond is incredibly nice. They seem to honestly care about their employees. Sometimes they can be overbearinly nice. Plenty of time for personal things. More often than not, they ask you to work past your scheduled time."
good,a typical day of an early shift at BBB was really beautiful just to see the process of fill with products all the store from bedding until kitchen .
good,Fun and upbeat place to work.  Nice customers and staff.  Likes hiring older people. Very dedicated to customer service.
good,I learned to be able to use a scanner and many other skills such as working in fast pace warehouse.
good,"A typical day you simply took care of clients by showing them around the store or handling their transactions. you also were required to zone(clean and organize) your area/department."
good,"Assist customers throughout the store and on the phone. Work in the receiving area and process damaged goods from the store and returns. Learned to be patient, not only with customers but with the store associates as well. Everyone has a job and can not attend to every situation at the time they are needed. Hardest part of the job was seeing how some associates provide for the customer or do not provide enough, I always had to jump in somehow and do everything possible to satisfy the customers in ways the other associates couldn't. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team of people who all believe in customer service and letting the customers leave happy."
good,On typical day I teach classes and ball brides who are rehisterd with us. Management is great we all work as a team.
good,"It all starts in the very early hours, replenishing merchandise on the floor. Then, the crew begins to put away any merchandise received in by the receiving crew. I've learned to be more of a teamwork-oriented worker and learned a lot about time management. At times, it can be back-breaking, but the people whom you're with are great with positive attitudes all the time."
good,"A typical day of work begins with customers. I'll spend time helping people find products, answering questions, or tracking down and ordering items not available in the store. Most shifts at some point I am called to escort a bridal couple, sometimes multiple times during a shift or even having multiple brides on the floor at the same time. I'll sit down with them in the office, enter their information into the database where their registry is kept, go through benefits and features of the registry, and then escort them through the store to be sure they can get through with all questions answered, gifts are found in a timely manner, and that the registry is made to be fulfillable. If I am working a closing shift and I am not with a bridal couple we will begin working the freight until close. "
good,It's a pretty peaceful environment and the staff all get along pretty well. I enjoy working there.
good,"I am the morning hardside associate. After arriving to work, my manager usually gets with me on projects that need done for the day. After completing them, I start freight until the end of my shift."
good,"Despite this being a retail position, I really enjoyed my time working here. The staff was all very respectful and hardworking. They always made sure that the customer needs comes first."
good,"Greeting Customers, leading brides and grooms through the registry process"
good,"This company really puts customer service first and empowers employees to make things happen. I enjoyed working there, but am looking for something that will afford me more time with my familiy (especially at night and on the weekends)."
good,"Great work environment, friendly people , break times are a fair amount of  time, and great different work shifts. Some management I great and others no so great"
good,"When I worked for Bed Bath & Beyond, I enjoyed being able to genuinely care for my customers because the company genuinely cared and wanted to do everything possible to make their shopping experience as easy and efficient as possible. When customers could not be satisfied, I could be certain that my manager on duty would step in for me and have my back. The people that I worked with were wonderful and they were all very supportive of one another."
good,"I have a good time in the company, I have great and friendly teamwork very organized enjoying help the customer with good benefits  but its time for moving on"
good,They treat everyone the same so there is no favoritism. Easy to catch on to. This was my first wherehouse job. They pay good. And they are very professional.
good,Great job! Great people and self explanatory work. Sometimes it can be stressful but its good starting pay for what you do. Sometimes I wish it could be more.
good,- a typical day is you downstock the sales floor then customer service as much as you can through out the day while tasking other jobs through out the sales floor

good,Nice management and few good coworkers growth opportunities only thing that suck was rude customers and cut hours weekly unless on season . Not enough to pay bills 20-30 a week 9.5 starting.
good,"I landed this job right after I quit my last one, and desperately needed a new one. I only worked part time and lived an hour away, so it didn’t benefit me. I spent what I made in gas just getting their and back. However, it was a fun place to work. They employees were great, and managers were nice."
good,"they allow you to bring your pets to work, and they have bring your child to work, "
good,They were very fair and understanding. This was a great place to work they were very friendly. I had a great experience. I loved working with the customers as well.

good,I worked at bed bath and beyond for a little over a year and I really have nothing bad to say about them. I feel as though they are one of the up and coming companies of this decade. I loved going to work every day because it was always something new. From the beginning you are cross trained which I felt made the job 100% easier. Heavily consider this job over any other choices you have. Overall BBB is a great company and I would consider them for an employer again any time.
good,"A usual day at work, I work with customers and help fix and recover the store. I also go up to ring a lot and by the end of the night I help re-stock the store. "
good,Very professional environment and great atmosphere for retail.... I love working with and meeting new customer's daily to help them receive what they've come to purchase. Management is stellar and hands on with all that you may not know. Co-workers are fun as well as well.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in greeting everyone. Helping others. Giving excellent customer service. I learned how to deliver great customer service that no other company was doing. I had great managers that molded and helped me become a great sales associate. I got along with all of my co workers. The hardest part of the job was saying word for word what the company wanted us to say to customers, only because it felt like acting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom that we had with dressing casual and being ourselves around all my managers and co workers."
good,"Great staff and management. My new job makes me miss working here. Awesome benefits, felt valued as an employee, allowed me to feel comfortable in my work environment."
good,"Its Okay, on management and hours, will promote if you show hard work and leadership. depending on your position work load will be heavy and stressful."
good,creating customers meals and coffee drinks as well as taking customer orders and delivering food. the hardest part of the job was juggling the busy Saturday mornings but the thing I enjoyed the most is being able to use my discount and eat all the food the company offered. I can say that I gained a few friendships with my fellow co workers some I still associate with 3 years later.
good,"Good place to work at, great people, and great teamwork. Nothing there was any type of hard work but it wasn't easy either. I would say it took determination. Everyone did there best to get the job done and even when we are short-handed, we work together as a team."
good,Customer Service is the number one focus of the company. They always try to do what is right for the customer. You can grow as much as you want to with the company. In the interview you are told up front about the long hours and on going training. Open door policy.
good,Learned tons of new skills and learned new information on products. The employees are the best part we are like a family we care for each other and are very helpful to one another. The hardest part of the job some of the policies are contradicting and part time employees dont receive benefits.
good,Bed Bath & Beyond was a pleasure to work for. You are always busy greeting customers and meeting new people. Helping them made decisions on purchase and always being polite. Keeping the store organized and always professional.
good,"I have a few things to say about all the supervisors I have had at Bed Bath & Beyond.  I have not had a supervisor that is not willing to jump on the phones with the employees when needed. Weather the managers jump on the phones or not, I know they are willing to do so."
good,"Bed bath and beyond is a good environment to work in. Lots of team work involved,  decision making , organizational skills , productivity. Everyone is helpful when your in doubt of something. Management understands their  employees in any matter. Flexible scheduling even if last minute notice is giving."
good,"my first job, great people to work with, great team work, good hours for working and when i needed ot i got it,  it what you make it and you get your work done how you can"
good,The company itself was great to work for. They are all about family. I loved my District staff. They were always just a phone call way to help with anything and everything.
good,"Good company to work for. Equal pay, relaxed work environment and good people.  Many advantages, flexible hours, and employees discounts as a bonus that family can use."
good,i had a bitter sweet experience with this job but i must say i learned a lot as far as production & team work! i went to work at 3:15pm and got off at 1:45am! i was guaranteed 40 hours a week which is 80 hours every two weeks and we had the choice of doing over time. the pay was very good for the work we were doing and we had great benefits. my manager was great & my trainer was awesome and helped me learn alot. my job consisted of scanning boxes finding items that customers ordered and boxing them! very easy. i would recommend this job.
good,I worked for Bed Bath & Beyond during my High School and College years in Florida and North Carolina. They loved seeing people advance and were set on schedules and  pleasing the guests. I always enjoyed going into work at Bed Bath & Beyond!
good,My review of Bed Bath & Beyond was a good experience I learned a lot about Warehouse work shipping and receiving and basic production schedules and quotas that need to be met at the end of each shift
good,I loved all my co-workers and my managers super nice. There is a real team at BBB that values customer service. The pay was also fare. Well Organized company.
good,"It was a safe environment to work ,nice people to work with and good managers,the place was always clean and it made it comfortable to work ,there were always work to do and supervisors were always helping out."
good,"This job was demanding and time consuming, the leaders were great to work with the company cared about its emplyees, easy to get along with others, the comapny was compassionate about their employees"
good,"While working here I had great benefits and had a great team working with me I got great hours and really good pay! The only downside was the costumers and some were very friendly, but others were unfairly rude to the staff."
good,its a very easy job to deal with. the hardest part of the job is trying to figure everything out about product knowledge. i also work with ladders.
good,My co-workers were always available to help train me in sections where I needed help without being asked. I've developed a love for the products I would sell because they were relevant in my life as well.
good,Open atmosphere where team building and culture is integral.
good,Its a high fast working place and your always busy taking care of the customer. I have learned a lot about products so I can better sell them to customers. Great co workers and management team.
good,"great company to work for great people and management, good hours and good pay ability to grow within the company. the training you receive helps in many ways toward any job in the customer service field."
good,"You have to be fast, able to clim ladders, able to lift heavy weight, do multiple task, professional, more work to handle than how much they pay. Not much for growth or move up to a next position."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and reviewing the paperwork from the day before and handling old and new price changes. THe environment is always friendly and uplifting. What I like most about the job is being able to interact with customers and learn something new about the company each day. What I like least about the job is having a short period of time to get an alotted amount of work done. 
good,This a good job for a college student or someone just needing a little money. Starting pay varies from employee to employee. Store manager is not a good fit for his job title. He has a tendency of letting one person get away with stuff but not another person. He shows a massive amount of favoritism.
good,"Wants you to work hard for little to nothing, employees are not appreciated, registers have never been updated. They DO NOT promote from within. I would​not recommend this particular store"
good,"Being in inventory control, you are responsible for management of store inventory.  Performed detail review and analysis of inventory, sales and pricing data as well as cashier.  Reconciled discrepancies and discussed options to resolve recurrent issues or trends."
good,"Working for Bed Bath came with many daily challenges.  There was always multiple things to do everyday, so my multitasking abilities have more than improved.  I also learned how to be more understanding with customers and their general needs.  I loved the fact that nothing was the same on a day to day basis.  I also value my associates that made going into work everyday!"
good,"Make sure you have a purpose of why youre employed at BED BATH and BEYOND because they will overwork you, under pay you and fire you on the whim. Make sure to set goals, accomplish them and get out!"
good,Fun but still relaxed place to work.. Climate controlled.. I worked in the mods.. I was always on level 3 mod so I to climb alot of stairs. Which was ok due to the fact I kept my cardio up. I also used a RF scan gun on a daily basis.
good,Amazing workplace great customer service great people the company is very good. They focus on customer service and they train their employees. Everything about the company is amazing
good,great store just wasnt enough money to make any type of living off of.  The store is great almost on a Walmart level.  I just assisted customers along with checking them out.
good,"Live chat is a lot of work they are continuous"
good,"If you like working retail, this is job for you....weekends and nights required, on your feet and managers do not give raises.  Must work black Friday and long Christmas hours."
good,"Highly recommended for customer service and Anyone looking for part time work. This company is great if your looking for a job to increase your customer service skills, Customers are always first when working for this company .. BBB gets 5 stars for Customers Service"
good,"I enjoy working at Bed Bath and Beyond, I just want a new start . I learned how to open up to people more. Working there is a great start out, and it is easy to work your up."
good,"I would stock freight out on the floor, greet/help customers, and checkout customers. Its a simple job. What makes it demanding is that durring your shift you have to stock the freight for that day, while doing that you have to greet customers and if they need help, i would help them. What made this job so demanding was that I could be helping customers for hours, because policy is customers over freight, as it should be, but at the end of the night if your freights not done you havee to stay as late as it takes for you to finish. There was no incentive to do our best or to stay for a double, etc... and there was almost NO advancement in the company. All these things made it hard to want to stay and is the reason i left."
good,"customer service"
good,Is a fun active place to work at. Unfortunately their are no space for growth. Pay is too low. Work hours are very limited. But I loved my position and task. It is just a fact that no one can live at this pay-rate level. This could be a second job or extra income for someone. Not a primary job.
good,"This was a good job but the advancement opportunity was null,unless they liked you . it did not matter if you did your job well.The management needs to know the job better."
good,I had a great time working at bed bath and beyond until I was told that I could not take a family vacation in August. I put my application in for vacation in February I was not told about this policy until two weeks before I was to leave on said vacation. I was then told it was my responsibility to make sure that the vacation request was approved. I did make sure the request was approved but was then still told that I could not take my vacation. This led to me quitting a job I thoroughly enjoyed
good,Helps achieve Great customer service. Very fast-paste environment to adapt to. Deals with working as a team.  Easily adaptable environment. Teaches to steps to achieve customer satisfaction..
good,A great place to work and grow with the company. Working with Management is great and co-workers are awesome! Love seeing the regulars that come into the store!!
good,"Nice there"
good,It was a nice clean place and co-workers are very friendly. You could fine almost everything you where looking for in the store. Customer had there to go persons in store.
good,Well initually I never intended to leave. In the beginning it was ok. But then it seemed like the manager never had any time to hear me out unless it was to critique me. And I was all open for it but being the only maintenance person and working 3 hours each day there was only so much I could get done by myself. The final straw was when a co-worker was rude to my wife. I would say I would have stayed if the work team had been a little bit more understanding about situations. But as far as the work itself I have nothing bad to say about it at all. I had a great time
good,"Busy during the week"
good,"My shift starts in the morning. I wake up early and walk about a hour to the store. I clock in, put my stuff in my locker, then put on my back brace and begin to opening boxes."
good,I had to move to Colorado and the first place I wanted to work was at Bed Bath and Beyond. I really enjoyed a fun and busy work environment. I had an excellent group to work with and they were always so energetic and helpful. I would work and recommend Bed Bath and Beyond to anyone as good part time job.
good,At times it could get very stressful.  Including with the customers.  The best part of this job is all the workers become a family.  Working at Bed Bath & Beyond you either have a busy day or a slow day.  Which ever one you have their is always something there to keep you busy.
good,I learned a lot from the company as you are exposed to alot which is great!  The challenge is that it is older technology and there are challenges interfacing with newer technology.
good,"Great company that puts the customers first. As a prior employee I found the company fun, inviting, and very flexible when it came to needing time off for whatever reason."
good,"bed bath is a awesome company but they dont acomidate the people that work there the way they acomidate the customers. they started the pay off at $8.50 and that is never enough to pay rent in Atlanta. aside from that there was supervisors that did the bare minimum of work when they came in for work but took several ""sick"" days off and kept their job..... but when a lower paid associate actually needed time to recover from an illness they would get wrote up every time they missed work or had to leave early . eventually resulting in termination. i didnt agree with that myself."
good,"Start my morning off by working on freight that has to be on the shelves back stock items that are full on the shelf."
good,I really like working at BB&B as a receiving lead. The bad thing is that you do not get training other than you training  yourself.
good,"co workers were great "
good,"A typical day at work would include arriving to work at 7:30 printing out reports of sales, pulling all hands on deck, which includes merchandise that we sold over x amount of days so I go and pull from stock/top stock to replinsh shelves. Also Bridal Consultant. A member of Loss Prevention. Management was great. Co-workers were also great. Hardest part of the job was being at the top of the a frame ladders stocking or pulling down top stock. Was very scarry but I gained confidence each time and mastered it!! Most enjoyable part of my job was makeing my customers smile!!"
good,"Working at Bed, Bath, and Beyond was a great job. I liked the people I worked with and was able to climb the ladder very fast and get prompted quickly."
good,Great company to work with . hours could be difficult if thwy only offering weekend 12 hr shifts . The jobs are not hard . They also have opportunities for you to get promoted .
good,The work area was really good coworkers always nice good moods with everyone no rude coworkers nice costumers we had a really good  customer service breaks were fair
good,"Teamwork makes the dream work!! Always ready and willing ? It’s time to put down the donuts this job will defiantly whip you into shape! I care about my colleges and community’s! So my job couldn’t be more fun been in the business a few years now everyones like family making new friends is a must leave the fake ness at the door “be about your business, sell stuff ,know your products learn them too never be afraid to pass the buck” I’m always going above and BEYOND! Living the American dream....😎🥳"
good,"We would gather all items into the right place, keeping store neat and organized, sometimes the front would get busy and that meant we had to fill in as cashiers. Team work, delegation and leadership were a plus working together. The hardest part was to stay longer hours after closing the store to stack each required item at the top of the racks."
good,Costumer service is there number one priority as a company. I enjoyed working with this company. But i will say over all there was no real movement for advancement.
good,"This was a very good place to work, it taught me a lot about things I would have later needed to know about decorating. The people I had the pleasure of working with made it a lot easier to learn about what I was doing. It was a little hard trying to balance working and completing all of my school work."
good,"despite management i liked working there "
good,"I enjoyed working here, the managers are friendly and always willing to help. Customers can be a bit tricky to deal with, especially if stuck at customer service desk. Chances to work at different parts of the store is rare, especially if you are good at customer service the managers are less likely to let you leave that position."
good,I loved my coworkers. Bed Bath and Beyond was very considerate when working around scheduling. A great work environment and learning experience.
good,A typical day for me would be to straighten each of the rooms throughout the store. Drop and fill holes to make sure that we have a full product advertised for the customers to purchase. Work out inventory for the rest of the night while helping customers in need. I normally work with one other person on my side and all together there are 7 including the manager and front cashiers. The hardest part is time management but we also get everything out and done in a timely fashion. I enjoy customer service the most.
good,"Good place to work, has excellent benefits, good place for growth if you have the time, however lacks structure in the entire warehouse."
good,"I was trained to be a bridal consultant where my clerical skills came in to play, I'd schedule appointments for the couples, make follow up calls regarding their registry items, make registries for college students, escorted the registrants around our store to walk them through the process. When I was on the sales floor I would assist the customers in their shopping experience or special order items through our website. Handled cash/credit transactions as well working in the front registers. This is where I learned much of my retail/customer service skills. We went though many different managers at different times, but none of them I had an issue with. The co-workers were all really nice, and made it a fun environment to work in, which also made it more enjoyable to work there and get though the day if it was very busy or what ever the case was."
good,"For the most part, it's a great place to work.  There's too many managers and they all do things a different way.  You can't stand around for 10 seconds with out someone telling you to do something.  They did not follow labor laws for break schedules either."
good,"I enjoyed everything about this job, the team work was outstanding. If I had a question, there was an answer. Every day consisted of freight, stocking the shelves, organizing and most importantly customer service."
good,I loved my job here. I worked here during my pregnancy with my son and it was an amazing job. My co workers were awesome and everyone helped everyone out. We worked as a team and enjoyed it. I actually wanted to go to work and was happy to be helping customers every way i could to make their day easier.

good,it was a fun environment with places to be creative with bedroom displays.Being a seasonal store it was also fun seeing all the  new seasonal items that came in especially for summer and Christmas
good,"I absolutely loved my time at BBB. It was fast paced and competitive. THE ONLY REASON I LEFT was because of management issues. Some, NOT ALL, management treated people like they were dumb or below them. Oh, and some people didn't act their WAGE."
good,"This isnt like any call center, its awesome! great people, awesome customer, and not too forget amazing trainers. The energy is unlike any other, it doesn't really feel like a call center job."
good,It was an overall great experience for me. The supervisors were pretty cool and laid back. You do your job and they did theirs . the raises however were not enough.
good,"It was a cool to place environment wise, if they offered a full time position i would've gladly took it but they were irate if i would go over 34 hours a week on a two week pay period."

good,Working at Bed Bath & Beyond Distribution was pleasant & good work even though I was there for seasonal. I would fill out another application for this company to be put on for full-time.
good,My supervisor was an incredibly unhappy person and brought that negative energy to the workplace.  She never had a complete schedule.  We had to push an item of the month  and we had to sell a total of 20 during the entire day 8a-9p.  I would sell thay amount myself in a 5hr shift  yet she kept cutting hours

good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a great company to work for. Your job is what you make it to be. If you are a hard worker you will reap the benefits. If you like retail it is for you
good,Typical day at work was either slow or fast but mostly slow when there wasn't any work. I've learn how to drive a forklift and fill active on the boxes I find. Management wasn't great because there was always having favorite people when you shouldn't have that work is work and outside is outside. Hardest part about it is finding the boxes because something there was a lot of boxes and take put just one or multiples. The enjoyable part about it is that you get to drive and meet new people and learn new things that you haven't learn.
good,"I liked working here because everyone was really nice and it paid well. Most of the time it was pretty crowded and could get really chaotic. I worked on the cashier, a few times on the floor, but mostly at the customer service desk. Customers are usually normal but some can be demanding and rude just like any retail job."

good,"A typical day included making sure the department you were assigned to was stocked and ready for customers. There was one culture, the management team was wonderful and the most enjoyable part of the job was providing customers with what they needed. I learned a lot about products I did not previously have knowledge about. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the low hours and low pay.  I learned a lot in each department and also worked the customer service desk which was the busiest. this is all i have i have no more information to say, why does this keep rejecting asking for more information."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is an overall great workplace. Lots of positive energy from the staff, makes it a safe and professional environment.

good,My typical day at work starts out with early morning projects. After when we open my main focus is customer service. i always want to make them to have an great experience so they will return. The hardest part about my job is when a customer leaves without anything. i want to do my best in making sure they come with whatever they came to shop for. The most enjoyable part of my job Is bonding with an customer over an item we have in common. when you bond it brings the customer back and i enjoy hearing about how the product works for them.

I loved hearing about the stories and their future plans."

good,Exciting adventures await at Bed Bath and Beyond. Very interesting inventory and gracious customers. Great place to work
good,"As a student in college to get my BA, employment with Bed Bath and Beyond has been very pleasant. I have worked at three locations while attending school and find that each store has its own work atmosphere. I loved some and others not so much. A typical work day depends on the type of store you work at if its an A or B level store you will be pretty consistently busy if it is a C store unfortunately they in my opinion are not they fast paced work atmosphere I enjoy. The managers at the A and B stores I worked at were very pleasant and  approachable; in the lower level stores it difficult to understand how things work because different managers have their own ways of doing things. Also I think the added stress of having fewer employees at the lower level stores makes management positions at this company difficult. Co-workers vary upon store. I was very sad when I had to leave school because my co-workers and the management in place was just a very well put together team. which, when transferring back and forth can be kind of disappointing when you realize its not like that throughout the entire company. The hardest part of the job is when people get lazy and ask you to do things for them while I am trying to cover the entire service desk alone (Lower level store). I also have noticed a lot of rules throughout the company vary store to store. One store will answer the phone a specific way and correct employees if they do not do it as posted, while others are very open to the way things are done. procedures concerning small things like coupons vary from store to store as well"
good,"	Developed a strong pattern of repeat sales and client loyalty, through accurate and honest product information and help in accessing client needs"
good,i came into at 6 am every morning and dealt with the over night crew till 8. I learned every position on the sales fllor and including rtv. my co-workers were nice and respectable but management communication sucked. the hardest part of my day was not being able to interact with customers cause my office was in the back. the most enjoyable part of my day was when i could interact
good,The management was really productive and knew what needed to be done. I was always performing tasks at hand and was constantly being pushed to improve in the environment.

good,"Loved working here. Coworkers and managers are very fun people to be around. Great customer service system. Really in it for the customers, which is hard to find. Most are just in it for the money. The satisfaction of the actual human being put in front of them matters, and is goal. Best job I've had."
good,Great first job for anybody. I really enjoyed my time working there. Staff and customers are generally polite. Easy going job. Everybody is understandable when you can't make it in due to illness.

On weekends, I am told sometimes to manage the whole store since all of the managers and other sales associates are busy ringing up customers. All of my co-workers enjoy having me as part of a team. I am very well known in the store. Hardest part of the job involves the lifting of heavy boxes resulting in back pain. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiles on the faces of customers after assisting them with their needs."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashing people out on the register, answering the telephone and assisting customers with who or what they were looking for. I learned that I am great with customer service and on the phones. The management there was fantastic, they genuinely cared and did what they could to make every employee feel equal and important. The hardest part of the job was probably all of the returns we had to keep track of. I always enjoyed the fact that I liked going into work here and was happy to do so."
good,Very busy especially the holidays. I learned that no matter what you do at bed bath and beyond the customer always comes first. I love my managers they go above and beyond. My co-workers are such an easy crowd to get along with and will help you when needed. There isn't a hard part of my job. Most enjoyable part is getting to meet new faces that come into the store and listen to their stories.

A typical work day is helping customers receive what they want, whether it be ordering a product they want/need or finding the product in stock. The hardest part of the job would be the lifting boxes for top stock and the most enjoyable is being successful with a customer."
good,"A typically fast-paced and friendly environment. My co- workers and I enjoyed working as a team, we treat each other like family. The customers love to shop here where they know they can get great customer service and best prices. The management team works with you to get the job done. I've learned about merchandising, re-stocking and floor moves. I've learned how to be an effective sales person and bridal associate, giving me more confidence than I've ever had before. The hardest part of this job though has been navigating through the store on busy days, and also getting through the massive stockroom, which can easily become overcrowded with U-boats and merchandise falling off onto the floor. The most enjoyable thing is seeing your customers leaving with a big smile, and returning again with another one."

good,"This company was one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of working for. The company makes sure every employee is up-to-date with the items in the store. A monthly lesson is given to every employee throughout the company. The stores even have friendly competitions each month to see who can sell the most of the monthly item. The company proved that in order to be a good salesperson, you have to know your product. When I left, I knew almost every item's thread count, star quality and brand name. The hardest part of my job was climbing on a ladder to grab items. I'm slightly afraid of heights. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the sales team. My co-workers made my day fun and exciting."

good,I learned a lot and the co-workers were nice. The business was a great business and the co-workers made it a great place to work. 
good,"Everyday was a little different, depending on how busy it was and what types of customers we had. Management was great, took the time to teach new hires themselves, always answered any questions, supported all the employees, lived by the open door policy. Very much enjoyed my co-workers, most have become family friends. Hardest part of the job was when I wasn't able to get an item for a customer. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers, helping them find exactly what they were looking for."
good,when first working at Bed bath and beyond i didn't realize how much information one needed when buying items for there home. I would recommended working here for the knowledge

good,"Love to work here."
good,"Working in retail is always very busy, dealing with 5-8 coupons per transaction on top of a high drive of customers was a bit tough. you would have to know what to ring up so the customer were able to use all the coupons in there hand or else they will say you do not know how to do your job.."
good,"a typical day at work involves filling a room with required merchandise, and helping any and all customers that need assistance. I've learned a lot from there considering i've been moved all over the store, from the cookware/cleaning departments to sheets/pillows/personal care departments. My co-workers are amazing and i consider some of them to be family. The hardest part of the job would be balancing a task at hand and customer assistance. as for the most enjoyable part, that would have to be the synergy between all of the employees being able to help a multiple customers throughout a day."
good,"Neat place for part time employment."
good,"Great place to work for a part time job.  Great co-workers, flexible hours, and enjoyable customers that return due to the great customer service that we provide."

good,It was a fun and the time went by quickly.
good,I liked Bed Bath and Beyond. It was a small work like setting in there it feels rather home-styled. Great secondary job if you have the time to make some extra earnings in a laid-back environment.
good,"If you are looking for a good retail job to start out at, this is definitely it! I received extensive training for my department and for working on the registers. I worked in a VERY large store that had a health and beauty department which most BBB's do not have. The hardest part about this job was learning where everything is but after about a month, you have a pretty good idea. I was able to transfer easily through the company when moving from NYC to FL. Both stores I worked at were enjoyable with good coworkers and good management. Great place for team building encouragement as well."
good,"Upon coming here with some prior retail experience long time ago,I found the work duties to keep me very busy but I'm very good at multitasking.I learned very quickly basics on receiving aspects to get started for the store because at the time,they had no actual receiving person and then from there was able to learn things on my own or with limited in the job training.always reliable and give 100percent of myself from time I punch in until I punch out."

good,"I only worked at bed, bath, and beyond for a short period of time due to the local one closing. Walking into the job I didn’t know what to expect since I had never had a retail job before however the training I received was beyond wonderful. I was walked through using the ladders, dealing with angry customers, how to use registers and everything. The staff was absolutely amazing and I would do anything to be able to work there again!"
good,I love working for bed bath and beyond but unfortunately they don’t have the available hours/ days that would suit my family life style work balanced.
good,My only complaint is that the pay is absolutely horrible. Been there since 2010 @ 8.50 now 2019 and I still am not even up to $10. Meanwhile newer employees make more than me. So I’ve decided to move on.
good,would have stayed longer at bed bath & beyond if they paid better and let you advanced further than keeping you at a position they feel you are valuable at.
good,"I worked the over night shift so I job was to do inventory,stock,and audits. The most enjoyable part of working at bed bath and beyond was working along side a great staff."
good,Great place to work.Management team always there to help out when needed. flexible hours and paid lunch.Always see the sale items first .Great layaway plan for the employees.
good,I was a cashier so I did not have to work as hard. After the store closes if my shift ends when the store closes I have to help clean the store before I could leave which was not bad at all. We just put items back where they belong
good,"Very, very busy business. Demanding customers. Not enough hours and unwillingness by district management to offer more full-time positions needed to provide excellent customer service. Customers more often upset with the wait time to check out due to lack of scheduled employees."

good,"temp position. the store was under going remodeling. I and my teammates went and move and put up displayes bedding china, cookware curtains,towels, vacuums"

good,I have been employed at Bed Bath & Beyond for 6 years. They have taught me many things I really like my job a lot and look forward to when I go into the store and having great friends and customers
good,"although this retail business was fun, the way the managers would give you directions trying to be more efficient. If you found an easier more efficient way to do the projects they would get frustrated because you aren't doing it there way. they specifically tell you something but do not allow you to execute in a way that is your own."
good,Company has an amazing approach to customer service and really cares about their staff.  Fun staff and good training program in place.

good,"average stress mentally and physicall, if able to communicate while on the move then the job is easy."
good,"It was a very nice place to work, but I moved cities. I helped customers and ran the front end of the store as a cashier on my own.

good,I walk 6.5 miles a day or more each day I am here. Learning problem solving skills and lead skills which I enjoy. The hardest part of the job is lifting 100 lbs objects each day on a daily basis and the most enjoyable part is one the people I work with and two completing daily goals that are set and having a successful team.

good,"Typical day at work consists of help customers with bath accessories. Help with returns and exchanges, balance everybody drawers at the end of the day. The most part I enjoy about the job is learning about bath accessories, and kitchen appliances. The hardest part was inventory and trying to make a creative way to fit all the products in their right place."
good,"I loved this job, I wish I could have been employed there longer but it was too far away and it was hard for me to make a lot of hours because of the drive."
good,This company was very understanding. The management was also great as far as the employees it wasn’t that great. But the flexibility with the schedule was great
good,It was seasonal but overall it was cool company.. the work was easy.. some people was reaching out to help and very respectful and helpful............
good,I loved coming into work. I enjoyed walking in and getting a warm welcome everyday. The hardest part was remembering where everything was. I learned so much about the products we were selling by taking short classes. The management was outstanding.
good,Great management. Fun people. A typical day at work for me was receiving shipments. Other than that I did customer service or I was on the floor as a sales associate.
good,I have worked at Bed Bath Beyond for over two years and have had the opportunity to interact with all types of people from all backgrounds on any typical day.  Some management are easier than others but I still get along with them all.  I don't think there is any part of the job is hard at BBB. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with the people.
good,"It's a pretty good place to work my coworkers are good people for the most part. However if you are not full time you don't get benefits besides 401K ,  The yearly hourly Increase rate is ridiculously low."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is contact with the public and being able to assist customers with their needs.  The culture is one of service and customer care.
good,"Challenging but fun work environment, hard working staff members who are easy to get along with, management could have been a little more lenient towards employee transportation situations"
good,"great place to work part time when you are balancing work and school, as a floor associate you will do the same work day to day, its an easy job, weekends are long"
good,enjoy working there.  nice people encouraging managers.  Not stress full but can be demanding if busy.  good place if like meeting people and interacting with different personalities.
good,"There were aspects of this job I liked. I always exceeded with customers but the physical labor of the job can be very demanding. When new management came in about the middle of my time working at BBB, conflicts started to arise with every employee about how the new manager talked to down to the staff and focused too much on micro-managing. It got to a point where it was affecting my mental health and I quit before the holidays to be with family."
good,They really need to enforce same workers to do their job. Some people walked around and did nothing but no one did anything. It made it hard to do my job when I was picking up the slack.
good,I like working at  BBB its a learning  experience and an enhancement to my  customer service career. My co-workers are the best  and we treat each other like a family as far as working together as a team. the managers are  pleasant work with.
good,"The environment promotes positive energy, the managers are supportive and the other associates work well in teams. They are accountable and strive to provide great customer service."

good,A great place for a first job and an amazing opportunity to learn skills in customer service and problem solving. I was always on my feet and being kept busy.
good,This was a fun job .  I learned a lot of things about stocking that I didn't already know because they did it a little different here.  The management was really nice
good,I loved working at Bed bath and beyond for the simple fact that it was laid back and not too stressful. The only draw backs were the pay at minimum wage and there were a few managers that picked certain people to like and hated everyone else. They made you feel worthless.
good,"If you're looking to do retail or any job really, this is a good place to start. Well structured organization woth a history and fan base. The wheel will keep rolling with or without you, just try and fit in and get paid."
good,This job consisted of constantly being on the move and looking for new tasks throughout the shift. You quickly learn new stocking skills and overall become a more organized person yourself.
good,"Working with customers can sometimes be difficult, but it was always manageable. I learned a lot about many different products and a few life skills (cooking, deep cleaning)."
good,"great experience but i wanted to pursue i better job and advance my job experience in life, for i felt i would not advance that far. so i felt it would be better to pursue another job that i felt would advance better and it did pay more."
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond Is A Good Company To Work For. I've worked at other retail stores and Bed Bath & Beyond might be the most exclusive. "

good,"Fast pace and a lot to do in a short of amount of time."
good,"Direct customer contact."
good,You restock and assist customers. You mainly focused on maintaining a clean and clear sales floor. You learned a lot about merchandise and sale pitching. Management usually is always there to assist you if needed. The hardest part of the job is locating items that are not in the correct spot or only available in other locations.
good,"Very relaxed work place, clean, friendly, and organized. They employees work well together and always help customers even if its not something carried in the store."
good,"Management is more than willing to work with you, you have to really work to go full time and get some hours but it's worth it. This made a awesome first job and taught me a lot."
good,"There is a lot to learn at Bed Bed and Beyond. Employees are taught how to sell, stock, order items, work bridal registry's, and cashier. There is always something going on . The hardest part was being the only associate on the floor on a busy weekend day but the most enjoyable was gaining people skills."
good,It a place for young people to work really. management isn't always organized and there are some points to the job that just art ideal but thats most jobs
good,at bed bath & beyond i was working in different areas throughout the warehouse from picking & packing to replenishment to fork lifitting also order selecting i also was using RFA Scanners
good,You do the same thing everyday but come in contact with many different people. I love working here and learning patience along with all the different products sold in the store.
good,The employees are so sufficient . Everyone is very polite and is willing to help anyone who needs help. They also keep the lines moving fast and the wait isn't long at all
good,"This job was a fantastic entry level job, it provided me with ample retail experience and sales training. Management was heavily based on a favorites system."

good,I love all my co workers. They're some of my best friends now. Like family. We work together as a perfect team and we make things as confortable as possible. Definitely love being a part of bed bath and beyond.
good,"Excelente trabajo le falta crecer a sus asociados , en general es muy buena empresa y se aprende mucho."
good,"Cash handling, customer service, balance drawer and place orders for inventory."
good,"My typical day at work was constantly changing. In retail, it tends to do that even throughout the day. But this is the characteristic that continued to make it exciting just as much challenging. In this way it taught me to become adaptive to all situations. That way when the obstacle presented itself, I was ready to face it head on in a professional manner. My co-workers made it a very friendly and competitive environment. They were willing to help me become successful and utilize all of my available resources to do just that going forward. The management brought a very professional asset to the table. It made me confident that no matter what it is that I chose to do, I had great leaders to support me and guide me. The most difficult part of the job for me was to not have the ability to move up within the company. That is something I am always aiming and striving to do- better myself in any way possible!"
good,"Checking, reading emails and checking mailbox to start a to do list."
good,One thing you learn at this job is patience. Dealing with customers can turn very frustrating but when you have patience everything ends up being smooth. It's good atmosphere and not hard work at all.
good,"Fast pace high volume retail store, which always kept me very busy."
good,In my time working at bed bath and beyond it's been a good experience and enjoyable.
good,"The store was always very clean, Safety procedures was on point. Certain managers knew how to talk to the sales associate's."
good,I did the price changes for all of the store. I learned how to do just about everything in the store. I was given a lot of opportunity from answering phones to being able to adjust inventory discrepancies.
good,"I was able to use my Spanis peaking skill, one of many and it was a great place to learn interactions by phone to listen to really listen."
good,"process payroll for stores all through out the US. Every other week we submit payroll and make sure all information entered is correct and ready for processing. "
good,Everyday was something different which made it enjoyable. From the work environment to the customers it was a great place to work.
good,"Typically everyday there is a new project to do: from building furniture to making visual merchandising. Mostly though, its making sure the customer leaves happy. I've learned that a little bit of courtesy goes a long way especially when it comes to retaining your clientele. The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult people but luckily we have a set of procedures and a great team that helps us along the way. On the other hand my favorite part of my job is my co-workers, they are all genuine in helping and we all work as a team."
good,I learned how to work with customers to better the product and base work off another persons standards.
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond has built my customer service skills to the highest expectation. A typical day consist of answering phones while fulling customers needs or concerns,supervising special orders, and being overall attentive to satisfying the customer. I enjoy what my position as a  customer service representative you truly are the front line of the customers satisfaction throughout their entire shopping experience. "
good,"Operated automated cash register"
good,Knowing you're satisfying a customer makes your day. When you walk through the doors you get a warm welcoming. We'll bend over backwards for our customers. It's a fun job.
good,I would typically work an 8 hour shift with 5 other sales associates. I learned about the products that we sold as well as how to work in a team environment. My managers helped me understand the best way to advertise the product while also being tactful with customers. My coworkers were helpful in making the working environment comfortable. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job the best.
good,I love working there. My management and staff are great. Just wish hours were better.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond has taught me to be productive, prioritize my time and assist those who need your help to the best of your ability. "
good,"this place is pretty cool to work at. Everyone is nice, the atmosphere is relaxed and we get to wear jeans Monday though Friday. you need to wear a black shirt: females don't need a collar but guys do."
good,I got to meet a lot of exciting people on the job and help customer find what they were looking for. I enjoyed working with my coworkers because they were really positive and understanding.
good,"For the most part, there is always something to do here, so you would be bored with nothing to do. Sometimes, often there are customers who are outrageous or angry but it isn't hard to defuse the situation. The team here is very collaborative and polite. Management for the most part works together with employees to make sure that their experience is good."
good,"This was my first job and it's pretty nice for just starting out. I learned a lot from everyone there, even from some of the customers! In my opinion, there isn't much bad about this job. The pay could be better, but it is just a simple retail position, so I didn't expect too much in that area."
good,"I really enjoy working there, I got hired as a part time employee but if more hrs are wanted,they will work with you on scheduling you with more .The  Bed Bath and Beyond in West Ashley is overall the best one to work at over Mt.Pleasant & N.Charleston."
good,"I am okay there. Job is very complicated and challenging. IBM made migration not automatic, a lot of things should be learnt, only parts of the whole process can be found in Internet from different semi-official sources. IBM provides only version-to-next version approach, so to fulfill transformation from version 6 to version 8.5/9 theoretically impossible, requires very tricky approach of combining direct rewriting the code and using some simpler movements depending on tools used, I am lucky I have partner, Java Architect for Portal, who worked more than 10 years only with this technology. He helps me in case I am stuck. Mostly starting rewriting block by block but than I can find simplifications and re-usage of code/algorithms found/previously created. Very creative job."
good,Sometimes you can butt heads with management. They seem to expect way more than they pay just for a part time position but everyone is super friendly. They work with your schedule super well!
good,"Passionate about customer service. You never say no to a customer, you learn how to think on your feet and enjoy working in the retail environment. Here I started putting the store together, once opened I started at front end, became a bridal consultant lead, doing administration and going to all the bridal shows in the area. I then had the opportunity to go to a brand new store and train cashiers and became a front end lead. Only hard part was this position was also only part time."
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is your typical job working in retail. You work with various people who all come from different backgrounds. I would work with various different customers who come from different backgrounds and who need different things. The job can be stressful at times when certain customers are being rude or being testy with so it makes it hard to help them. It isn't a hard job I actually do like working there. It's just some days when the amount of work you put in at the job doesn't seem as though it is adequate for how much you get paid
good,"Typical day at work for me was greeting customers, helping them with there purchases, assisting customers finding the right items. Putting all merchandise back on the shelves."
good,Love working here. Management is great and it's fun to help the customer with their purchases. I would reccomend this company to anyone needing a job.
good,Typical day consist of unloading delivery trucks. Transported products to the sales floor with hydraulic pallet jack. Sorted and ensured that enough quantity has been delivered. Spend the night bulking the store with product. Workplace culture very strong with a great team atmosphere.
good,My managers and coworkers were always flexible and helpful in all ways. The environment was very friendly but stayed professional. The job tasks were easy but allowed for improvements and knowledge.
good,"I love this job, it’s a great work environment and all the managers are amazing. They are pretty good and giving people the time off they request. Favorite job I’ve had by far"
good,I loved working at Bed bath and beyond .The fast pace didn't bother me . The not  enough hours was killing me .So many workers not enough hours. Be great school with great discounts.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a great company and I hope they continue in today's retail environment. However, I do feel like some of the company lacks focus and what they want the store to be. In addition, leadership and management sometimes felt disorganized. You are also expected to fulfill every position, including cashier, as needed, in addition to the tasks already expected of you. This is of course, fine, but makes it difficult to accomplish all assigned tasks. Thankfully, the environment is not too strict and this is not frowned upon, at least for me. The pay is unfortunately low for the position and assignments."
good,They provide you training and help you develop your selling skills. In many of the jobs you work off ladders and are required to lift objects some as heavy as 50 pounds. The are truly focused on good customer service this will be your main job. As with most retail jobs the hours and having to work weekends are the main drawback.
good,"bed bath an beyond was one of my favorite jobs , it kept me on my feet meeting new customers and getting familiar with the regulars that came in . the management was wonderful very happy an energized an when holidays came around we would have little parties an etc . i loved this job it did get kinda boring when we weren't getting as many customers like we do around holidays"
good,"speedy work environment, easy to do work, easy to learn, nice customers, nice employees"
good,Hard workers and very diverse and productive. Enjoyable for the most part. Managers are proactive and hardworking. Workplace culture is very positive and full of driven engagement.
good,Great company to work for.  I would recommend employment to anyone.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.  The hardest part of th job is up and down the ladders if you work full time.  The management is awesome to work for.
good,"I always wanted to work at Bed and Beyond and when I got hired I couldn't believe it. I was hired on as a cashier, mostly in the evening. They have the best merchandise for my home for your home you could ever think of. I only work there for 6 months but it was very good 6 months."
good,Being a picker can sometimes be easy. you just need to stay quick on your feet to meet standards. I like it because of the benefits and full time pay.
good,"Honestly BBB is a great job as long as you do what is required. It’s my first ever job and after a year I’ve been promoted to Receiving Lead. In addition, I’m getting more training so I can move up in the company in the future. I’ve now been in two separate stores and overall my coworkers are pretty easy going. Every store differs and because of that make sure to voice what you need (ie: specific hours, pay, etc) management will always try to work something out with you."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a great place. The coworkers, management, and clientele.The most enjoyable part was the close atmosphere of everyone who worked there."
good,"I love the atmosphere of the work pace. I just wish that there were more career options and benefits of working there. It is a great job to have during school, but retail simply isn't what I have planned for myself long term. Overall they are very understanding and friendly to work with."
good,"Let me cut to the chase, I would still be working here if I didn't have to move. All my coworkers were amazing, the managers were cool and I learned a lot from each of them. Won't lie it can get pretty hectic and ALOT is expected from sales associates(like backing up at the register, getting online orders to meet a quota,and possibly wedding registries) on top of some serious customer service, but it makes the time go by so fast and I've learned so much about customer service while working here. WARNING: if you have a fear of heights, may not be the place for you! The customers that come here are usually older and a joy to talk to and make conversation with. So to some it up, I would definitely recommend this place!"
good,"I love the company and the opportunities it has afforded so many people to grow as the company grew.  The cofounders had a brilliant merchandising strategy and it sustained growth through many declines in the retail sector.  The company can address the changes challenging brick and mortar retailers, they have the talent required to address the new online and in store retailing environment. The work day is busy, rewarding, the senior management is present and accessible.  They could upgrade some antiquated work place policies around flex time and remote work options."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Bed Bath & Beyond. I made many friendships with my co-workers and other employees. It wasn't very hard to get the hang of what your job is. It does get a little busy during holidays, but overall, it was a great experience."
good,Managers are awesome! Just like any retail companies the hours are like roller coasters! They as a company try to work with you as an employee! Its a laid back work environment and work attire is casual! When opportunity for more hours are available they let you know! The hardest part of the job is the rude customers!
good,Love to work here. They are the most understanding managers ever. Not many places could you be off for 6 months and still have a job when you came back.
good,was fun working for bed bath and beyond i got great experience and got to learn receiving and how to build and organize a major business it was a good team effort and the company is still going strong
good,Management takes the time to teach you what you need to know about the products on the sales floor. You are trained in learning to read what a customers interests are and knowing what questions to ask to help the customer make a purchase they are fully satisfied with. The customers satisfaction is the end goal always.
good,"Typical day - Help customers shop, give detailed product info, suggestive selling, doing inventory, stocking shelves"
good,"Many opportunities to try different departments and activities. My favorite station is front end. I love customer service. People come in unhappy, and leave happy. It doesn't get better than that."
good,"I worked for BBB for about a year and a half and it was, hands-down, my favorite place to work thus far. The workers are like family, everyone gets along well and management isn't condescending or overbearing. We all worked together as a part of a team, which was great because we got more done. The only reason I left my position here was because I was offered a job that paid more. If I could guarantee that I could get the same pay that I get now, I would go back in a heartbeat, 100%. The policies for how to take care of customers are the absolute best I've ever encountered and I will take those guidelines with me for the rest of my life. 10/10, I would absolutely suggest working for this company."
good,Can be crazy sometimes and usually fun.  You get vast experience in customer service and merchandising. If you work hard they will give you hours and a good schedule to work.
good,"flexible staff, good for students and people with children flexible with hours and good with distribution of hours fast pace environment retail lots of shoppers big name brand store so widely known rude and pleasant customers strict staff some nice staff lots of postions to choose from good for seasonal or part time not really full time"
good,I loved. Bed bath and beyond due to relocation i had to move but if they gave me another chance id take it i enjoyed the company i learned alot as far as cashiering making signs promoting sales stocking receiving damaging items
good,the company overall is a great place to work great salary above par and great benifits package very freindly and team orientated they promote from within so chances of advancement are very high.
good,"very sweet co workers and some managers "
good,"Company is full of opportunity,  staff are respectful as well as understanding it is quite A fun place to work and shop. Would recommend people shop here and or be a part of the hardworking team of employees."
good,I was doing inventory control. The duties was to make sure the items    fit in the location where they suppose to be. If the measurement not right they will send it to the place called hospital. And you have to redo the measurements and send it back.
good,"it was very busy for IC however we were able to manage to get a lot done as long as everyone pitched in and stayed on task. IC was a lot of hard work, we were basically the backbone, everything went through us, so it kept us on our toes. The hardest part of the job is constant counts that are input incorrectly which causes us to continuously go in a circle recounting constantly the same things."
good,"Greet customers, returned or exchanged their items. I learned how to count registers at the end of each night. The management works well with their employees. Co-workers were all diverse, fun and free spirited environment. The hardest part of my job inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with certain co-workers and meeting new people."
good,"Typical workday as a cashier consists of processing customer transactions and assisting customers in the attempt to provide a better shopping experience. I have learned how valuable it is to provide a customer with assistance during their shopping trip as it would be disappointing from the customer's prospective to not be able to find what you are looking for while shopping. The management is very friendly and accommodating. My co-workers are friendly as well. The hardest part of the job is the beginning when you are being trained as a cashier, when you are nervous so the transactions feel scary but that gets easier with time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet, the customers, many of them have so many stories to share and it always interesting to learn something new each day."
good,"a typical day at work would be to assist customers , order items for them that are not in stock, check out customers , make sure the department I'm assigned to looks at its best, management is friendly , hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers but as long as you maintain neutral its okay the most enjoyable is the people who work around you,  and the store itself . i learned many things working here from great customer service to making the shopping experience for the customer a great one"
good,This is a very busy environment. There is something going on everywhere. It is great to know how to multi task and get all the projects done as well as help satisfy customer needs. I work alone as well as team up with other employees to always get the job done.
good,"The coworkers were amazing, it was a wonderful environment to work at. Management was very respectful, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and coworkers."
good,"I've worked at bed bath and beyond sine june 2015, easy training, chill managers, chill co workers for the most part."
good,The managers and co-workers I work with are a pleasure to be around. My store has been so good to me over the past 5 years. I've learned so many invaluable tips about sales and ensuring great customer service.
good,It's a busy store. Lots of incentive to achieve better performance. Good team work. We had a good team working together. great management. Lot of learning experience.
good,"Bed bath and beyond is all about customer service and the customer is always right. BBB accomidates all returns which can be frustrating when you receive a really dirty rug or something. Typical day at work was stress-less, fun and organized being able to talk to your co-workers at other registers or being able to assist customers around the store."
good,"A day at the job would consist of speaking with the manager about a certain set-up or the tasks at hand that needed to be completed that day. Once these tasks were handed out, they had to be done with multitasking and with attention to detail and proficiency. "
good,"Managers were very easy going, knew what they wanted, and pushed us to be the best in our positions at hand."
good,loved talking to clients to find what they need to buy or what to look for. Enjoyed looking through all of the new items that came in on a weekly basis as well.
good,I assisted customers with guidance they needed to find what they wanted to put in there homes. I also was a cashier and helped stock from time to time.
good,everybody was friendly and helpful during work. all fellow employees were all about team work. i learned that the company sold a lot more things thing towels and blankets.
good,I worked at Bed bath & Beyond in Casa Grande fun place to work great people i work with have been there a long time so that means no over turns in employment for this store. my store manager was great! hardest part was leaving to try a new field. the most enjoyable was knowing i had true friendship with my fellow workers
good,I would say the best part of my current job is helping people and making sure they leave the store they are thrilled with a high level of excellent customer servies.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond a  store where customers find all their looking for , exceptional customer service ,and also where team work is a requirement ."
good,worked here for about about six years stable job managers came and left everyone friendly you have to work really hard if you want to climb up everyone sticks together
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday. Although I had a specific job, I also had the freedom and opportunity to do many, many different task each day. The atmosphere was very pleasant to work in. I enjoyed everyone from the ceo, store manager to each other member of our team."
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a very great company to work for.  There are lots of opportunities for learning and advancement.  They are very supportive of their employees and provide lots of training.
good,working at bed bath and beyond has been great and has been a wonderful experience but I do believe it is my time to look for something more and different from retail.
good,As a bridal consultant and sales associate the staff and management are very friendly and often open to new ideas. I am able to learn and grow constantly about products and customer service.
good,"Great place to work to gain experience in a sales atmosphere, but lacks a serious competitive environment. Managers are very easy going and always willing to help."
good,You really learn time management with this warehouse. The people are friendly and worked great to get all of the orders out on time. I am sad this place isn't bed bath and beyond anymore. I would gladly go back to this job. They pay well too.
good,Had a staff of about 10 to 15 depending on the season.  Loved learning and teaching about all the new products that would be coming in.  Settle the registers and training the employee on how to use the equipment.  Customer service - helping the customer find just the right item and handling complaints
good,Show up on time. Do your job. Smile at customers. Have an open mind and you will be just fine. They transfer their workers to different states. Job security.
good,To Answer the Telephone placing orders with customers and making sure orders are sent and sent back. Working at this company was a very different but yet positive and fun experience. I learned a lot about this job.
good,I do my daily route and talk to customers as well as employers so I can do an great job providing my services. Then i restock and put frieght when the timing is good. I help out my co- workers in the time of need. The most part i enjoy about my job is that its such an friendly attiude and family caring environment.
good,I love working here. I learned you need to be fair with all employees and to not favor one or two. Make sure your employees are happy and taken care of.  Hardest part is working with none motivated people. I love being able to interact with customers and helping them get items for their home.
good,A routine day at work would include interaction with customers and supplying them with excellent service. Merchandising departments to increase sales and ordering to maintain quality performance. I enjoyed management because I motivated my team to strive for performance and morale to give outstanding service daily. I never found difficulty in my position because at the end of the day I went home knowing I performed every task needed in my position and enjoyed multi tasking.
good,"This was a part time job, that I enjoyed to work at. Management was well organized. Co-workers were fun to be around"
good,"While the customers can be a bit much (I don't think there's a reason to yell that loudly about a return), the policies make dealing with customers and issues super easy.  The management can get a bit stressed but the only time it's difficult here is during the holiday season.  Easily the best customer service job."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of answering telephones, assisting costumers, helping co-workers finish tasks, ordering things online, organizing the store making it presentable. I learned the skill of multitasking and how to help costumers to the best of your abilities. The co-workers I had were efficient and taught me how to work as a team to get things done. They essentially made the work place fun. The hardest part of the job was learning all the products and the details about them so that when you presented it to a costumer they knew about it in depth. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the costumers find what they needed so that they were happy and enjoyed coming to the store."
good,"A typical day at work includes putting merchandise away, Stocking shelf's, Helping customers with questions about any item, Helping them get what they were looking for.

good,"I was responsible for cash flow, provided customer service and kept my work area clea."
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure all customers recieved outstanding customer service. What i learned at bed bath was how to execute a sale in store and online, to go above and beyond to meet all customer needs, how to properly train new employee's, and also how to properly oraganize and stock merchandise. Management at Bed Bath and Beyond was outstanding they set standards for employee's to meet while helping them meet these goals through great management. The hardest part of the job was not having more than two hands. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the people and their repsones when their pleased with my service."
good,"Typical day at work being on the floor and processing transactions. i learned how to top stock, drop and fill and do freight. My co-workers are awesome. There's really no hard part of the job. Enjoyable is being able to work there."
good,I always looked forward to going to work and interacting with my co workers. I learned how to become more confident in speaking with different people and situations. My management team was always very helpful trying to help me learn and understand new task. The hardest part of the job is opening up to people about different subjects that others on the job disagree on. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people all the time through out the work week and learning things that you didnt know about.
good,They are very flexible with your hours. Not much room for advancement within though even if you specify it.
good,"i would ring up customer transactions, direct customers to merchandise on the floor. when i changed to over night i would count the pallets, break them down, and stock the selves up with the correct iteam going by the sku numbers"
good,The work at bed bath and Beyond was okay. They taught me good customer service skills in which i exceed in now. However the management at Bed Bath and beyond failed to comply with my school schedule. They wanted to me to work late hours and i have school the next day. Often times they failed to work with my schedule so i can go to school and work.
good,I enjoyed working around the store and keeping things organized. Most of the management was amazing. Enjoyable people to work with. Liked folding towels.
good,I Loved working for bed bath and beyond they were very fulfilling with hours given for the work week and it was just all around a great place to work.
good,"Although the job was hard work, I have made friends there that I knew I will have for a lifetime. I also learned a lot from the classes during training."
good,Good place to start for a first time warehouse associate. Great training program for lift drivers. Fast-paced environment room for advancement. Shift hours are great. Start time is 12:00 pm until 10:30 pm.
good,I have worked a few times In those 2 locations  I was actually really good at my job with finding things an organization for other employees to locate items for customers
good,"Great place to work if pregnant ,going to school ,or have another job. Would recommend it if you like being around people and getting asked questions constantly."
good,"It was a really good job I liked the fast paced, and opportunities to move up and do diffrent things. I would say that the only bad thing was that the warehouse was too hot."
good,the management at the Quarry location was great. we had a great comradery among us employees. everybody was very respectful. ive worked both with the day and night teams and it was great

good,"Working for Bed Bath & beyond was an awesome experience because I was in school an they were very flexible with the hours Also, the work environment was always positive and always focused on customers first"
good,"Bed, Bath, & Beyond a casual fun place to work. Serving customers and coworkers. I learn from Management, co workers and customers when attending to their needs. The hardest part of the job is an angry customer, the best part is winning back an upset customer."
good,This job is pretty much laid back and the usual  customer service and coworkers / management were nice and easy going when I was working their. It's a good job for students who are wanting to make a little bit of money. Not bad at all
good,"Leaders could do with a little less attitude, considering there are those of us who have been working retail a lot longer than they have been alive, but overall it’s a great fun place to work with a flexible schedule."
good,"not rated well for advancement due to Company losing money the past few years. this Company has great benefits and pay, a lot of training to make sure the right person is in the correct job role."

good,"Bed Bath and Beyond is a fun place to work, the advancement opportunities are excellent and the company allows you to be creative within guidelines. I enjoyed my time there."
good,I worked part time so there were only certain amount of hours I was there.   I would come in the morning and put my things in a locker. I I was then ready to go to the register to get started with my day.  I did take some time off to eat lunch.  I really enjoyed talking to the customers while checking them out.  You are busy but you are active which I like.
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond  is very customer oriented and expects top notch service and merchandising. "
good,"Work is tolerable and management is average. Team work could be better. It is a god company, but the hours could be more and pay could be more for all the work that ""sales associates"" are required to do"
good,"Positive and fun work environment. Management was fair, co workers were great team players! I would definitely recommend this company to work for! The only issue was the attendance structure and rules. HR will rarely work with you but Supervisors and Managers need more recognition for their work!"
good,Typical day of work consists of a daily meeting where we discussed how everyone was doing along with daily goals and promotions. Great supportive work environment who will help you reach your goals.
good,"This was a great place to work while attending school, and I learned a lot about certain products that I wouldn't have known about otherwise.  The management is fair and they were always willing to pitch in on the workload."
good,I loved working at Bed Bath & Beyond. My coworkers and managers were all wonderful people and I always felt happy to go to work with them. I enjoyed interacting with customers and having an opportunity to learn new things to improve my work ethic.

good,It was cool. I quite enjoyed it. It was cool to help people with different situations that you would usually have as a shopper too. I would definitely recommend this company
good,"Loved working with the employees and other staff. The management is great. Very stressful environment and lots of pressure, the company has gone through quite a few cutbacks and we have lost good people because of it."
good,working with couples and having knowledge of entire store was very helpful in my role as a bridal consult working closely with customers getting to know them on a personnel level very good for me
good,I was able to take away many ideas and strengths from management. I was able to put customers first then tasks given which truly made it very customer service friendly. I was able to go home every day feeling like I got something accomplished.
good,Helps you prepare for the business world as well as how to manager your time within a professional and corporate workplace. Helps you understand the importance of woking well in teams.
good,"I have worked for this company for almost a year now, and have truly made a family here. Management is very patient, kind, and helpful. I am almost pushed to do my best and succeed with everything I do. The store manager only makes you technically work one day during the weekend, and lets you chose between Saturday or Sunday if working weekends aren't really your cup of tea."
good,"I love my work life balance"
good,Short breaks. Your standing from the moment u clock in until you clock out. So i wouldnt recommend to someone who has a problem standing for long periods of time
good,"Ambiente relajado, trabajo estable, y oportunidades de crecimiento dentro de la empresa"
good,"enjoy my job, laid off, I worked different shifts, and was very happy with working there. I enjoy   people i worked with, during the years . employeement"
good,Good part time job for college students on break to earn some extra cash. Getting use to everything on the job is the hardest part
good,"At Bed Bath and Beyond I work at the customer service desk. I help people with returns and exchanges, I also help them find what they are looking for. I work with bridal registration so I know how to file and do paper work. I use the customer service computer to look up items and bridal couples."
good,nice place to work positive environment good learning experience systems are old but they make it work management is nice co workers are great people
good,"Working at bed bath and beyond was enjoyable. The people were friendly and understanding. Early morning stocking was easy, and allowed free time during the day. The company is strict about tardiness. Other than that, this is a great job to have."
good,"This job was one of the most pleasant opportunities i have ever had the chance of experiencing. Everyday was a different vibe, not once did i ever regret applying there, and used everyday to get the most done."
good,"Everyone knows what they need to do for the day and immediately get to it once they clock in. I learned a lot about good customer service and communication and all the ins and outs of the systems when stocking various items with the scan guns, and also how to make signs and print out wedding registries for customers. Management is professional, patient, and fun, they're super understanding when it comes to things coming up in life and that things happen if you're schedule needs to change a bit. They are also great at portraying what needs to be done, needs to be done. Co-workers are like family, but when it comes down to it, we're all there to help each other get all the tasks in the day accomplished. The hardest part of the job is the amount of manual labor to stock involved every night that's not evenly managed sometimes. I enjoy helping people find what they're looking for in the easiest manner possible so that they leave happy and I know I made them happy."
good,"A Day a work for me is I start by walking the floor and seeing what areas need more attention than i make a visual list of the other areas that need to be worked on. All in all i still am greeting and engaging with customers making their shopping experience great and comfortable ! My management team is awesome , easy to work with and have great personalities. All my co workers are great team players always eager to help me out and offer great advice how to advance myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is the team i work with hands down. The hardest part of the job is getting all duties done when assisting multiple customers but they come first and their satisfaction is what we are all about along with the safety and cleanliness of our stores."
good,"Day to day as a associate i am expected to wheel the days freight that has come in via truck on to the floor and stock shelves, while also answering any questions a customer may have. "
good,"Provided exposure to ALL pharmacuetical companies and the PKI technology."

good,Bed Bath & Beyond is a great retail place to gain experience in many aspects of fields for business. Great job to gain experience in customer service and understanding how to deal with customers.
good,"Well Adjusted Staff"
good,"I enjoy meeting people and working directly with the. The employees are all very nice, helpful and willing to go out of their way to help. The daily routine is usually the same but the interaction with customers makes it worthwhile; being to help a college student pick out the right gear or helping someone getting started in their first apartment or home is very exciting. You get to be creative in your picks (towels, sheets, cutlery, pots/pans) and explore the different colors and combinations that work. The real enjoyment is being told how helpful you were and that you made the experience a joyful one!"
good,"Working at bed bath and beyond was a great place to work at,excellent staff there and such friendly people,i would definitely work there again"
good,i enjoy my work experience and have a lot of fun while doing it. My coworkers are wonderful to work with from managers down to the cleaning people
good,"Everytime I try to pursue another career I end up right back with Bed Bath and Beyond. The only reasons I leave is not good enough pay to live on but good for getting through school or if you have a spouse that already works full time. Only managers get benefits and it is hard to get promoted. You either have to be there forever or get ""in"" with District Managers. They make sure you know the products by giving ""universities"" in each department. They have a strong belief in TRUE customer service and have amazing coupon and return policies. The two most important things to the company is safety (no matter what) and customer service. Just show up and do your job and you can go far with a good company. It can be stressful due to  always providing amazing customer service. Especially with picky and rude customers that are hard to please. That is why any problems you have you are encouraged to have a manager deal with the customers that get out of hand."
good,"Atypical work day consisted of three major objectives. Those were stocking merchandise, back stocking merchandise, and clean up. Overall I love that i could come in and knew what i had to do from 11 P.M to 7 A.M. I had wonderful co workers who i could either work with of when given individual jobs could count on them getting work done or ask for hep if needed. The management allowed me to work at my pace which was always fast enough to get the job done and still have time to get it reviewed and redone if needed. The hardest part of my job was adjusting to the time which i was able to do in 2 days at most. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting a job finished and knowing i did the best or even outdoing myself from the day before."
good,"My typical day starts at 5 am. I print our previous days sales report and pull merchandise to replenish the store accoring to the report. I clean and maintain the order of the stock rooms. I also back stock all over stock merchandise from our frieght from that day. I maintain 4 different stockrooms. I also update our database with the most current inventory that we have in our stock rooms, At about 9:30-10 A.M., I switch gears, I then look up our files on all of our employees and see what classes I am able to give. I give new hire classes, which pertain to cashier training, training in our bridal dept. (How to pull a registry as well as how to create a registry), Customer service classes, also merchandise classes for the whole store. At the end of my shift I typically am the relief for our Front end/customer service lunch coverages."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was a great first time job experience for me, my co-workers were very nice and cooperative with me. In addition, they pushed me further to develop interpersonal skills with the customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get out of my shell, and interact more with the customers, thankfully I grew more outgoing. Furthermore, I learned more about myself and found out that if I put my mind to something I can succeed and prosper."
good,"I have been trained and actively work in every part of the store ranging from inventory control to receiving and departments. It's a lot of work and information to know, but it is enjoyable. I love the people I work with and the kind of work that I do on a daily basis. I really enjoy being versatile throughout the store."
good,The environment was very clean and nice to work in. The staff were amazing.
good,"Great Company, Great Co-workers, Good training available - if you take the initiative to take advantage of it."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about any of the plumbing companies I have worked for in the past. They all contributed to making me the plumber and man I am today, I started plumbing when I was 16 yrs of age and now I am 34 and I have learned so much from each one I have worked for. I am grateful to have worked with so many different co-workers because I was able to learn so many little tricks of the trade. Every company has its bad apples but it is up to you as an individual to make sure you do not pick up any of their bad traits."
good,"This company uses a temp agency to hire you, and you will be there for 3 months or more before bed, bath and beyond, But it is a pretty good place to work if you really want to WORK. I quit as I needed daytime shift because of my child. And was told I'd never get it. But turns out it was a lie. Don't believe other employees to much as they are job scared and hope you quit or get fired."
good,"I would clock in and go to the dock to assist in receiving/unloading merchandise. I would separate merchandise according to the locations of merchandise placement. Ex; Quilts go in Bedding, Towels go in Bath. Then I would go to my designated area. I would rotate/restock shelves, put away bins back on the dock. Assist in cleaning. I got to enjoy many years of working with an awesome group of employees. I worked with a manager that pushed for excellence. I did my job with such accuracy that I was chosen each year to help with inventory for other store locations in the area. I do not find any aspect of the job difficult."
good,"Worked as floor man"
good,"Typical day at work is usually busy, but in the evening very slow. I learned a lot of things there, like: team work, self management, organization, some computer work, timing, customer satisfaction and appreciation and lots lots lots of new products which I never new exist. Management there is very friendly and co-workers too, I feel there like I'm coming to my family home and we just have some work to do together. The hardest part of the job is probably to find what to do when everything around is already done and there is not so much of customers flow in the evening. The most enjoyable is when I help customers and they get happy, also facing product in isles, and when it's busy.  "
good,"Typically I would work customer service desk, assist customers with returns, exchanges and purches. Answered phone calls and directed them as needed. Helped customers find products and helped find products on our website. Looked up bridal registries and explained them to customers. Organized credit card slips and coupons, kept front end cleaned and organized. Assisted in closing registers and counting the money to put in the safe. Also mopped, swept and vaccumed. I learned a lot of new things, I learned how to work with the computers system, order products for customers, work a register. My coworkers were great, hard workers. I enjoyed how much I got to work"
good,personally it was a fun place to work. i had the privileged to lead a highly motivated and competitive team. Ensuring that all customers are left completely satisfied and always striving for new ways to generate sales to increase overall profits.
good,loved this part time job. great flexible hours. fun job! fun company to work for!
good,The typical day is full of hard work filled with courtesy to customers and helping them in any way that they need.
good,I learned to keep work and home issues separate cause personal issues will show through your work performance. You cannot grow with a company if you are not on accord with the team 100 percent.
good,Bed Bath & Beyond is an Industry Leader. Everywhere you go the name stands out in the minds of everyone you talk to. The culture is very customer focused.
good,"I worked there for almost a year and made lots of friends. They say work is a place for work but at BBB, it was like working with friends. The atmosphere is very positive. The only downfall is in the slow season, like any retail business, that hours get cut."
good,"Busy helping customers. Always something to do such as learning about new products, cleaning, and stocking. Everyone is helpful and have nice attitudes."
good,"my co workers were ok i got along with the basically all the workers i had contact with, the hardest part of the job was to remember were things went because i would help afterhours but i was a cashier so i had to learn the whole store,i enjoyed the weekends because thats when it was the busiest,i love the fast pace and the flood of customers and i like when i got to help the customers because it made me feel like my job was done"
good,I strongly believe that the survival of this company going forward lies so we based a lot on the employees and how they treat the customers that come into our stores
good,"Some of my coworkers sometimes tend to think they're getting paid to do more than expected, some of the store managers are awsome while there is one that isn't so great."
good,A good place to learn if you are a peoples person ..very busy lots of great people to work with. Good pay flexible schedule and good management..I enjoyed my work there
good,This is good organization but at this time it's under vserv.It is working based on USA.Flixy timing.It is good for software engineers.Vserv management ok but not good.
good,"""You learn something new everyday"", would perfectly sum up this workplace. With millions of products and millions of customers there's a lot to learn and keep up with but with the help from coworkers and management it was achievable. Customers and quality are of the utmost importance and helping people was always an enjoyable experience."
good,"I was always able to ask questions. I enjoyed the job culture at BBB, I was given a chance to be promoted from within. I learned a lot of beneficial skills becoming a supervisor at BBB that will help with my future experiences."
good,Very productive with working and fast-paced environment. Supervisor makes sure you are trained in everything you do to keep customers satisfied. Recommend to work here.
good,"Working and coordinate directly with the Ecommerce business units with internal and external stakeholders by providing feedback and guidance to"
good,This is a great company to work if youre looking for something right now I didn't see much growth there but for students and someone who just needs extra money its great. The management team will work around any schedule you need.
good,Bed Bath was a good place to work.  I was able to do my job with no supervision.  I traveled and worked in the field to help in the expansion of new stores and remodels.

good,Great company with really good coworkers and great management for the most part. Really good with working with your schedule and you’ll have to request off 2 weeks in advance
good,"As long as you did what you were hired for, you were ok.  The management does not bother you.  I really do not have anything negative to say about Bed Bath and Beyond."
good,"Absolutely love the workplace, its a very easy going job that pays decently enough for a part timer, as well as having wonderful customers. The job itself is fairly easy, its mainly organizing, merchandising, helping customers, and working freight."
good,"I worked here for about a year and loved every moment of it. The only downside or complaint I have is that they refused to reach out to other stores and attempt to transfer me, as I was working there full-time and about to transfer to another college."
good,"I have the best manager I have ever had and a position which allows me to learn every day. Compensation and benefits could be much better, but the work environment makes up for it."
good,The pace was plesant and making sales was fun! The managent team was very friendly and considerate and fellow employees were helpful! Would work there again.
good,"I loved working for Bed, Bath, and Beyond because they were all about their employees. It was a stress free environment and I would highly recommend to all seeking employment."
good,A day at Bed Bath and Beyond could be eventful at times and other times it could be a relaxed day at work. Some of things I learned there were how to assist customers and learn customer service. The management was very helpful and the workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of the balance of my register through out the day.
good,"Productive, nice place to work.  Fast- paced working environment, that was constantly training on new products. Very interesting, and mostly nice customers.  Coupons/pleasing the customers with  the way they were entered and trying to help SO many people all of the time, was the most difficult part.  The best was that the time generally went quickly because you were so busy."
good,"I absolutely love working for this company. The managers are fantastic and the team truly works together. The only downside are the entitled customers, but you'll experience that no matter where you go."

The workplace culture was always encouraging and helpful. The management team always had my back and was there for every question I had."
good,Great job for any one who has school or has another job. They are very easy to work and very flexible with schedules. Lot of young people working there so made it easy to fit in

good,Coworkers feel more like a family. Great for an entry level job there is potential for growth within the company. The Company is still a family owned business and has many great values.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a great company to work for. Starting this job in high school I loved it so much that when I moved and started a different job I actually went back to them.
good,"I like to think I’m the only one who makes the workplace fun but it’s not just me, it’s everybody in the store that helps continue to put smiles on each other’s faces as well as the customers. Customer service is the main focus at Bed Bath&Beyond because the customers are always lookin for something so we all help them to the best of our abilities. Great place to get a lot of knowledge of the store and where to locate certain items and the story behind them."
good,"While employed in this position, I was a retail sales cashier involved with customer relations and money handling, stocking inventory, rotating inventory. The most enjoyable part of the position was helping customers satisfy their home needs."
good,"Great workplace, with many positions to work as. When you are assigned to one department or job, you can be trained for product knowledge of your own department and others, and you can try out different areas in the store to see which job you enjoy the most."
good,This isn't a bad first job the management can be unfair at times some are understanding but mainly they expect that job to be your everything even for the younger people
good,The employees at Bed Bath & Beyond are fun to work with.  The management are great to work with as well and always willing to answer any questions you might have. I love the discount we receive.
good,Stocking shelves  and helping customers. I learned to help customers  find items and just be helpful in general. Management was very poor. coworkers were great! Be on tall ladders was the worst part. Best part was the customers and co workers.
good,"Management has been awesome and they were willing to work with me when I needed to transfer stores for college. The employees are all willing to work together as a team, and management sets the tone for that. Customer service is always a tedious job, but with the right management it can be fun and rewarding. I have met so many great people through this job and have learned a lot about myself both personally and professionally."

good,A typical day at work I would walk the floor and see if any customers needed assistance. Then I would proceed to stock to see if there was any freight to be put on the sales floor. The job required allot of multitasking helping customers while you fixed fixtures and stocked them. We were also called to the front multiple times a shift to help with registers. We would make sure the customers were pleased with there experience and help with coupons. My favorite part of the job was when I went into bridal. It really focused on the product and helping the couples add items to their registry. This part of the job let you connect on a closer scale learning what they like and how they want to build their home together.
good,"Great place to work!  Love the customers and the staff that I worked with.  Free soda, nice break room with comfortable seating.  Lots of activities for the employees to participate in.

Customers dealing, cash register, return,  receive phone calls, labelling, pricing and more. Relationship between  management and coworkers was excellent. Problem solving was never a problem because of te culture developed there. I always   enjoyed since starting to finish the shift with customers dealing. A very good place to work."
good,Great Employee Discount. Employee Referral Bonuses. Fun and Friendly Environment. Comprehensive Benefit package for Full Time Employees. Good schedules.
good,"For the short time I worked here, I noticed that they try to keep their associates happy. They like to have fun and enjoys friendly competition between associates."

good,"A typical day at work is being on cash and dealing with custoers making sure the tills are balanced right."
good,"I loved working at Bed Bath and Beyond. The managers were great at training you in all departments, they were sympathetic and understanding when it came to schedule changes. There were good co workers that helped me out my first few days and were very kind people. there was 1 or 2 employees that I worked with that didn't really appreciate their job and it was disappointing and a little annoying having to pick up their slack. Other than that most employees took their job seriously and were a fun bunch to work with, it made those late night closings or early morning cleanings enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was having to move around a cramped back stock especially during the holidays, If an item was behind a rack with other items I couldn't move it because there was no room to move it to, so the customer couldn't buy it, and it was challenging moving those really tall ladders in order to get certain products from the top of the shelves. and also being 5 ft and 115 lb made it very scary when I had to get those huge comforters, and if a customer changed their mind  I had to climb all the way back up with those huge comforter sets. I disliked that I got very sweaty all the time, while I enjoy a good workout I don't think customers want to see you all sweaty. Working here I learned a lot about appliances, formal dining, building a registry and how to really give customers support on buying things to make their house a home as well as team work."
good,"You were treated with respect, Very professional atmosphere.  Could move up in company, they promoted within. Good full time job in TX, but in CA it was part time. Not enough hrs. to live on."
good,"This by far is my favorite place to work. I learned so much while working for this company. I learned about: sales, product, people, compassion, and exceptionally high customer service skills. I left because I didn't feel the management at this location valued my skills and suggestions. Since I have left those managers have changed or moved on."
good,"working at BB&B was such a wonderful place to work. I enjoyed everyone who worked and was a customer of the store. I really enjoyed putting all the products out, and building the displays for promo merchandise."
good,"They really work with your schedule, the starting rate is good. management is very helpful if you have any issues. everyone becomes family. only con I have is yearly raise sucks your lucky if you get 25cents"
good,"Greeting  my friends and coworkers  make sure I have everything set up in my station to star the day. I learn team work is the key to making a group productive. Management is the leadership that is required to make sure the group achieve its goal . its important to have good people around you like you self ""Hard Working"" its important to know the everyone understand  the job at hand. Looking for a customers request and the product is not available . Knowing that you did the best you could  to make each and every costumers experience a lasting one as well is looking at you coworkers, managers and my self knowing we did the best we could. But most of all  looking forward to doing  it again the next day. That satisfactions that knowing we did the best we could for our customer."

good,A typical day I stocked the stock room and stocked the sales floor. Management was very respectful and friendly. I got along with all of my co-workers and they were very nice. Hardest part of the job would be finding where the items belonged that I had to stock. The most enjoyable part of the job would be how active you had to be. It was pretty much a workout every time I worked.
good,My co-workers were fun to work with and very friendly. My managers worked well with my schedule and trained me well. I enjoyed registering couples for their gift registry and helping them pick out products. The hardest part about working at Bed Bath and Beyond was finding things that were in the banners above the shoppable product and even that wasn't very hard.

I've learned that going the extra mile to help out someone really goes a long way. My co-workers are really easy to work with. If I have a question or problem with anything they are more than happy to help. I feel that my job is very easy, it comes naturally.

good,"-Very nice work environment."
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers and giving excellent service, answering any questions they may have, and helping them find exactly what items they're looking for. I also was trained to use the cash registers, so I make the transition from sales associate to cashier when needed. I learned how to navigate through a specified computer program to find stock numbers, order merchandise, and create custom orders for guests. Management was really great. I always felt really comfortable at work, and if there was any hostility or problems between any employees, management made sure to handle it accordingly, and they treat me well. My co-workers are the nicest people I've ever met, and I didn't expect to be close to them when I first got hired. But I always love going to work knowing that I have a good team to be around. The hardest part of the job would be explaining to customers why we don't carry certain merchandise, being up and down ladders constantly, and making sure my hours don't collide with my schedule outside of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around co-workers that are always willing to help you, and are constantly making sure that you're okay with what you're doing, and helping you be comfortable in every situation that comes up in the workplace."

good,On a typical day I work the Customer service front end as the Lead. We mostly have new people so I help them with learning customer service and checking people out. I typically have to call MOD for key turns or assistance where I don't have the authority to approve. Its really easy to me having been there for three years I know the store very well and am confident to find solutions to any problems. One problem is all the call outs and unreliable coverage that i myself and a few other old employees have to fill.

good,the days went by very quickly because you stayed so busy. the management worked with you and helped whenever needed. the co workers were great we all became friends.

It was a very key job in my life I quickly learned how to deal with people in general. Management was superb I am very satisfied I had them around to teach me in all aspects of my job. My co-workers were the most interesting group of people I've ever worked with so far, they were so much fun made the day go by smooth and productive.

Another helpful life skill they gave was how to properly fold towels!"

good,"Love the schedule allowing for life/work balance. Management is great and everyone is willing to work together if any issues arise. Enjoy the associates that work under me and next to me on the other overnight team.

The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my fellow co-workers.

The managers motivate me to be a better associate and show me how I can do that. Everyone is just a great staff across all stores."
good,"I loved my coworkers and managers, I personally worked in a retirement community, so the customers were ALWAYS rude. I personally am only leaving Bed Bath and Beyond due to I finished school & am now a Nurse. I worked at BBB through my senior year of high school & college. They were very flexible with my hours & understood that school came first in my life. They also understand ""life happens"" for example I had an unexpected death in the family while working at BBB, and they had no problem with me missing work while being with my family during their time of need. Also, I had surgery & they worked very well with my accommodations before and after surgery. "

good,"This place is fun to work at for a part time job. Great employees to work with. If you get the job they start you out at cashier and then move you on to the floor if they see you fitted for it. Your daily task would be or could be depending on when you work, taking out trash, sweeping floors, making everything not empty up front like fridge for soda, exchanges and return(something you do allot of), damaging items out, bring damages to the back and so much more. It’s a nice atmosphere to work for."

good,Working at Bed Bath and Beyond is pretty easy. I learned a lot that I actually use in my day to day life. I would say the hardest part about the job is that some of the customers really bring you down and hurt your feelings but you have great coworkers who understand and will do their best to lift your spirits.

good,The Bed Bath &a Beyond is a very efficient to be working at. Management is excellent and in this company you are part of a team because working as a team in this company is one of the most important things.
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers. They always strived to show new employees the ropes and make sure that they feel comfortable in the position.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Payroll is very tight.  Managers do a lot of the work(stocking).  It is a very physical demanding job.  That's the only reason I left.  My knees couldn't do the ladder work anymore.
good,"Most of all, I loved my return customers that I had learned by name. My fellow employees were a great addition to my everyday, and I did enjoy working for Bed Bed & Beyond. I worked here part time, as I was studying at a nearby college. I would consider going back to BB&B to work full time if the compensation allowed."

The company really offers great comprehensive training for the product that is sold. I also loved that there were several managers all responsible for different areas of the store."

A special thanks to Joey our Cunstomer Service manager who has been with me every step of the way and who has really taken the time to work with me down to the last detail if I do not understand something.  Bed Bath & Beyond is a great place for a part time or even full time should you choose to peruse a job in the retail field in the future. I am very much enjoying working with the customers and my co-workers and hope there is always something new to learn.
good,"The typical day at work starts by going in on time and clocking. I get the catty and start to open the windows on the catty. I see who is there and who called out. I talk with management and see what they want to get done for the day. "
good,"Bed, Bath, and Beyond was a great place for a part time job. The hours worked perfectly for me when i got off the Oil plant to get there and have plenty of hours left to work into the evening. The pay rate wasn't enough to be a full- time job, but did make the part- time worth while. I loved the management and how they gave me my duties and just trusted me to get it done. The freedom to work me a higher sense of pride in the work."

good,"BB&B in McKinney is by far the best location in the country. The staff is more like a work-family, which allows for a positive environment for workers and customers alike. It is a retail job so you have to work with retail customers, which at times can be frustrating. But the workers at this store make up for the crazy customers that appear every once in a while. The managers are willing to work with you and any type schedule you have. Overall fantastic place to work."

good,"Great place to work.  The staff is very friendly, and definately a close knit kind of group.  They make the day fun, yet we always manage to get our work done.  Company is very caring, always willing to be flexible around my family's schedule.  Hard work, but it is worth it to help customers find exactly what they are looking for.  Stock gets to be a bit much at times, but we all pitch in.  Finally found my work family."
good,"I've been working at Bed Bath & Beyond for a year and 3 months now. I absolutely love this place!! Going into my first job I was really nervous, but the environment made me really comfortable as soon as I started. Management always works well with you. Good hours. Anytime I need to take off I always get approved, that is if you are a good employee and don't call in all the time. I've never had any issues here and it's a great place for teenagers for a first job."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was an amazing place work. The management, the fellow employees, just everything is enjoyable. They taught me everything i need to know to be in retail, including cash handling"
good,"This is a very solvent company that promotes from within.  Although it is VERY demanding, the company does care about its employees and customers."
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond at first had me at the door while I was still a minor, where I greet incoming and outgoing customers handing them mobile offers and checking receipts. When I turned 18 I worked on the sales floor where my skills in communicating with customers flourished. I escort customers to the item they are looking for along with providing information on products to help them reaffirm their decision. I helped guests with buying gifts off wedding registries along with making online orders for customers when the product wasn't in store. I also worked as a back up cashier when the store was very busy. The most enjoyable part about working in Bed Bath and Beyond is the friendly work environment and positive attitude all employees had, along with all the new information I learned about household goods."
good,I learned to listen and assist to the concerns and needs of my customers. I was able to compare and know items which were best for purchasing. I assisted in cashiering duties when needed and in cleaning up tasks in the work place. I helped in organizing the displays and bringing the items on the shelves in a presentable manner. The management was good in giving  my assigned tasks and making clear what was expected of my position. The managers would communicate with me about my progress and how I was responding with customers. My co-workers I got along with and helped me when I asked for it as well as I would help them when they asked. The hardest part of the job was working in multiple departments at the same time.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers and the thanks I recieved from them.
good,"I was able to learn the basics at the register as well as customer service. Also, I was put in different departments and that helped expand my knowledge."
good,"Fun place, fun people, Good management, GREAT benefits for full time employees. Hardest Part is being on your feet all day, but your constantly moving so it makes it easier. Interacting with customers all day long."
good,"great environment and over attitude from each coworker amazing product knowledge and feed back from management very engaged "
good,"I really loved the job, was able to connect with customers and find what they needed they had great tools to get the job done"
good,all managers were easy to talk to and get along with. Flexible on schedules and re-arranging to accommodate the most people. Positive work environment with positive re-reinforcement-gift prizes.
good,"This was a great place to find were you wanted to go, the company believes in their employees and with hard work there is plenty of room for advancement. i started on the floor as a regular assoicate and moved to the top as a District Operations Manager. Bed, Bath, and Beyond pays well but you work hard and work late, if this does not appeal to you then just stay on the floor as an associate."
good,"customer service friendly, great staff and management eould work here again any time. had no complaints with this job at all. wish i got oayed a little bit more but overall a great experience of work"
good,A typical work day consisted of customer service and stocking merchandise. I learned that I love to help people and love knowing that I helped them get what they were looking for. Management was knowledgeable and knew what needed to be done to succeed. My co-workers were fun to be around and liked their jobs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who didn't think I knew what I was talking about. The most enjoyable part of the job was always when I would hear about a customer saying how well they were helped by myself and others in the store.
good,"It was awesome working their I always had a great day here I was a customer service associate, however they cross trained us to do everything and we worked where we were needed cashiering to setting up displays to cleanup to sales to stocking shelves it was really fun helping people in the customer service center was great it had its challenges but my favorite part was ordering a special product from another store and having it shipped right to the customers house they were always so grateful and happy that we could do that for them."
good,"Being able to ring customers on the register and being able to ring with cash, credit cards, returns and gift cards. Knowledge of company computers to search for an item a customer is trying to return. Search for name, make, quality and make sure the description is correct.."
good,The co-workers were friendly and the managment was very understanding.The hardest part was taking care of multiple customers at one time. I learned how to have confidence in myself and how to lead and train other eployees. The most enjoyable part was the feeling of being apart of a big family.
good,"Since being in Bed Bath + Beyond, I've been developing a great sense of relating to customers in advertising sales promotions, discounts, qualities of items and products, and have grown to love what I do on a daily basis. The people I work with are wonderful, including all management employees. I highly recommend working for BB+B, especially if you're getting back into the Work Field."
good,"A  good place to go to work everyday. The manager I worked for was always trying to challenge us to be better at our jobs. The hardest thing about the job was often the most rewarding, customer service. A customer leaving satisfied is always a good thing."
good,"I learned a lot about providing excellent customer service from Bed, Bath & Beyond. One of the first things taught during orientation is the bottom line is, you never, ever say no to a customer. No matter what, you never say no. If you're about to say no, you contact your direct supervisor who will not say no. If he or she is unable to satisfy the customer, he or she will contact their supervisor who will not say no. If their supervisor cannot satisfy the customer, it will escalate further and go on up, ending up with the district manager or district customer service manger or regional manager or whomever it needs to end up with to satisfy the customer. The bottom line is, you never say no. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers, because of this never say no policy, we were always making our customers happy which in turn, made us all happy, too. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to run lots of freight in the mornings or evenings due to phenomenal sales, which is a very good thing, but usually required going up on ladders, sometimes up to  12 feet off the ground. As I am afraid of heights, it was sometimes a bit of a challenge for me. I managed very well, however, and after so many years of doing it, it became so much of a routine I simply overcame my fear and just performed the job exceptionally well and with ease. The most enjoyable part of the job was training new associates. I excelled at providing knowledge of all the products in the store. I trained all associates on 33 product knowledge classes each consisting of 1/2 to 1 hour of training. I then followed"
good,It usually consisted of me ringing customers up and answering their questions.  Very easy and only bad part was when customers had a bad day and decided they had to yell at me.
good,"I respected the structure Bed Bad and Beyond enforced. Being to work in a timely manner, you knew your job and how to do it. It wasn't so strict that made it uncomfortable."
good,"I Learned lots of things while working at Bed Bath and Beyond."
good,"Good working environment. Customer service is the company's no,1 priority."
good,"Each day I plan my activities I would like to get done. My co-workers and I get along with each other very well. The hardest part of my job is standing on the floor with the store been empty, while the most enjoyable part of my jobs actually when the store is busy."
good,If you work hard and devote yourself to the position there is unlimited potential for advancement.  It is a great environment!
good,"Busy and slow at times"
good,Warm and friendly family enviroment. Customers are nice and helpful about what products work and do not.  Easy and flexible returns on all products.
good,"Bed Bath & Beyond is a good company to work for especially if you are a student. Typical day would include customer service, cleaning, and normal duties of a cashier. I learned that it was really easy to make customers happy if you simply were more empathetic to customers. Management was great and they were always there to help if you needed them. Coworkers were even more awesome. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts outside in 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Fresno weather is scorching hot. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. you never know who you will meet and i found that very satisfying."
good,i loved the environment and had a amazing time working there.
good,I loved this job but I had to move so keeping it was no longer practical or realistic. My manager and coworkers were wonderful and helpful!
good,working at bed bath and beyond its fun working with people everyday its fun having to know people everyday its great
good,This job was my very first job. A cashier when I was 16. This place from when I started and being there on and off for almost 9 years was fun from the very start to the very end and I would go back if I had the chance! Loved this job!
good,"The best part of the job is that you are basically running your own business, without it actually being your money.  You create your own orders, feature your own products and hire your own people."
good,I love working at Bed Bath & Beyond. Everyone is very nice and helpful. Management is cool with switching hours and being accommodating with the weekly schedule
good,"Bed Bath and Beyond was an extremely busy store but we still managed to have fun and get everything done and keep our customers happy and wanting to come back! A typical day at work was always fun, I learned a lot of customer service tactics as well as retail experience. The managers were all very helpful and friendly and my co-workers were the same, we all loved working together! The hardest part of my job was getting used to the fast paced retail environment when I first started but after about a month it was like second nature to me. Last, the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my customers leave happy with a big smile on their face knowing I did my job right and they would be back soon with friends and family."
good,"I learned alot at Bed Bath & Beyond we get university classes in where we learn more customer service on how to ask the best qualifying question on what our customer needs.management are good and friendly,co-workers are great.For me is not a hard job been there for five years.I enjoyed what i do I love my job."
good,"I along with my co-workers are responsible for various duties, which all tie into one; making the online shopping experience easier for our customers. Although I hadn't used a lot of the computer systems in years, my experience with Corporate helped me brush up on my skills. When we report to work at 8:30a.m., we get right to work. we take our lunch at 1, & 1:30, we're right back to work until 5:00. This is the easy part, because I work with some of the most incredible people I have ever met. From Management to Maintenance everyone is so polite and very professional. I think the thing I hate most is, no overtime."
good,"I start off the morning by sorting and filing paperwork. Then I proceed to do price changes, whether they are going up in price, or are going on clearance. After I'm finished with that and posting the appropriate signs for the changes, I head off to RTVs. I process all returned merchandise that is not suitable for the sales floor. There are four categories: Donations, Disposal, As Is, and Ship Backs. Then I proceed to file the daily media (credit card slips, store credits, employee purchases, etc.). Once a week I do a Sign Walk and update any old signs; and also Mandatory RTVs that the vendor is requesting. During these duties, I am a cashier, I assist customers on the sales floor and phone, and I wrap bridal packages."
good,"This job was great. There was always something to do, my coworkers were great and fun, and it was fast paced. This job taught me a lot."
good,A typical day at the bed bath and beyond warehouse was very chill and easy. I was a picker/ wrapper while working there. Employees were very welcoming and warm. Although some employees were racist toward my sister and I. Management was so easy to talk to and extremely understanding in certain situations. Overall the job was a great experience for me.
good,Bed Bath and Beyond is a fast paced work environment with the intent to always please and satisfy the customer. The managers and associates work well together and all members of the store act as a team. Throughout the years I have been with Bed Bath and Beyond I have gained great customer service skills. 
good,It was always a joy gong into work at BBB. All of the staff members are friendly and helpful not only to customers but each other. I learned a lot about retail and the managers were great. The hardest part of the job was keeping the shelves stocked for the holiday season but it wasn't a bad experience at all. I enjoyed EVERYTHING about this job!
good,I had a wonderful time working for this company. I learned cashier pharmacy and photo and even management positions here.
good,"Clock in and do projects that get assigned to you. Stock shelves, assist customers, order, some basic cleaning. Getting the correct amount of hours is sometimes a problem. However I highly enjoy working here. My coworkers and all of management are wonderful people and all of my time with this company has been enjoyable."
good,Learned alot about planning and seeing through projects. You actually ran your department anyway you wanted to as long as it was productive.
good,It was a physical job as retail is. I enjoyed working with the public
good,There is no typical work day because each day changes unless your a cashier then it consists of ringing at a register. Great place to learn great customer service skills. Management is typically nice. Most co-workers are good others not just depends on the person. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the slower co-workers who have been at the store for a longer amount of time who still haven't picked up on things yet. Most enjoyable is helping customers and hearing great things about the store as a whole.
good,"A day to day activity at bed bath and beyond depanding on de kind of shift,you will be stucking,merchandising,costomer service,online orders and managing the sales floor."
good,"This job was my most important job because it molded me into the women that I am today. I worked in the office where I was given so many responsibilities that advanced my knowledge. It started off as just a typical job as a cashier but then I made my way up to the office supervior/payroll coordinator. I stood there for 4 years and I appreciate every moment of it. My typical days would start off at 8am and would end around 8pm. Not because I was forced to stay longer, it was because I wanted to stay. There was always so much to do and that kept me excited about my job."
good,"I usually worked an eight hour day with a half hour break for lunch. The store was divided in half and the side you worked on, the side with the towels and bath accessories, or the side with the appliances and art, was subject to change on where they needed you, so every associate was expected to have a detailed knowledge of all the products. They gave us classes on the merchandise to ensure that. There was a single store manager and then side managers that specialized in specific sections of the store that we could go to should we need help or have questions. Working at Bed Bath and Beyond was definitely a team effort. Working with my co-workers. In order to restock the products, we had to climb ladders and carry things down. To be safe, we would work together. We were a good team, friendly and the customers noticed that, allowing the customers to further enjoy their shopping experience. I would say that the hardest part of the job was remembering all the pros and cons of the items when a customer wanted us to break it down for them and help them decide which product to buy (for example: vaccums, towels, toaster ovens, or blenders). The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know people. People that came in to decorate their shore house were having fun, and a lot of the time, they wanted or opinions, so we got to walk around the store and help them decorate."
good,"I love working for this job, safety and customer service are the two top things at bed bath and beyond. we make sure everyone leaves satissfied. the customer is always right."

good,"Loved working there and loved everyone I worked with. They had much to teach, and were kind and patient. Everyone was willing to help each other, and no question was stupid."
good,I’ve worked at bed bath for so far four years and I love my store and the people I work with. I would say the job is very physical because you would be on a ladder and lifting vacuums and other big items. It’s fast pace and you have to learn a lot of products but it’s a really fun place to work at I’ve enjoyed my time here .
good,"worked as sale consultant. helped customers as needed, stocked products as needed, help rearrange things. closed building down. also worked as cashier if needed."
good,I requested and was given cross training. This allowed me to be a better asset to the company's overall bottom line. I enjoyed having duel titles. This allowed for me to stay busy throughout my shifts and maintain the store.
good,"I worked for Bed Bath & Beyond for well over 3 years and from the day I started training my coworkers and our customers were amazing. Bed Bath & Beyond is a great place to work, they train you in every aspect of the job going well into details about the products so that when customers had question we would be able to provide them with the best options. The o lay reason I left the job was due to full time positions where scarce and far in between, had a full time positions opened up I would still be there. timebecaavailwouldtstill be working there.popopositionsopened"

good,"As a retail worker for Bed, Bath, and Beyond, I gained more money handling skills and customer service experience. The atomosphere was often fast paced, but can become slow paced. I loved my coworkers, as they were kind and considerate. Relaxed, enjoyable experience in the retail world!"
good,"Stocking Items , At the cash register , and Helping customers find what they are looking for. The hardest part was when the customers had a disagreement against my claim. The most enjoyable part was Helping customers and making sure they leave the store happy and able to grab everything they were looking for."
good,"- Management, Leadership and Development of personnel"
good,The Amarillo Bed Bath and Beyond was some of the best years and experiences I've ever had.  The store manager is an amazing person who grows and develops all employees in order to cultivate them as a person.  He encourages the good in each person while maintaining diplomacy.  Great place to work and a great place to move up!
good,"All my co-workers were extremely nice, and the working atmosphere was outstanding with all customers being completely friendly and respectful.

good,This review will not contain any information regarding my time spent at bed bath and beyond simply because i do not wish to elaborate on this subject.
good,This is a wonderful retail store to work in. Everyone is very helpful and willing to go the extra mile if you aren't understanding something. The management is awesome as well.
good,"Bed, Bath, and Beyond taught me the great customer service skills I have today. It taught me how to deal with people and build rapport with customers when the weren't satisfied."

good,"I enjoyed working there. I also liked Lear ing about all the different types and brands of products, such as bedding and pillows.  I know have bedding that makes me not want to get out of bed."
good,We start with a quick meeting in the morning before the store opens then go to our designated departments. If I'm in receiving I go and begin backstocking or if I'm on the sales floor I begin engaging with customers.
good,I worked for BBB  for 2 years part time. I meet very interesting people and had a good time learning all kinds of skills.  I needed a confidence pick me up at that time in my life. I was treated very well as an employee. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for advancement and wanting to learn new skills.
good,"A typical day at work consists of working hard to ensure customer satisfaction. I was lucky to learn about the products they had there and learned more than I could imagine. The management is smart and hard working. They are consistently trying to make it a better experience for both customers and employees. The hardest part of the job is that they didn't have enough people working per shift, so the employees must juggle many requests at a time, but with the knowledge they provide you with, makes the juggling easier. The best part of the job is the environment; It is fast paced, and just the right amount of challenge."
good,"Started with the company in 2001..great company, much to learn, stayed with them for 6 years as a single female with no kids.left in 2006."
good,Customer Service and safety are number one the minute you walk through the door. Management is great if you have any concerns and will work to make it better.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people and helping them find what they are looking for.  The hardest part is helping a customer and several others need your help at the same time. Hopefully they are not mad at you by the time you return to them. Not enough sales people!

good,"I really loved working here everyday was something different. If I didn't bump into my personal matter that for some reason could not be excused by the human resource department, I would still be a BBB employee."
good,"Personally, I found all the team members very friendly. Also, the management is top-notch, they helped me train and build my abilities significantly. They also have a break room which is really handy to take a quick break during difficult times."

good,Working with my team to make sure we are giving our Customers the best experience. I learned that if you are not taken advantage of at least once a day we are not doing our job servicing our Customers. I enjoy seeing a satisfied customer and them giving positive feedback on myself or my associates. The culture of Bed Bath And Beyond is Customer first. The Company gives their associates plenty of trainings tools to help us deliver customer satisfaction.
good,"I enjoy working at BBBY."
good,"This job was what I consider to be one of my first 'real' jobs with customer service. Once I became comfortable with the work, which took no time at all, I began to look forward to going to work, which can be something difficult to admit for someone at the age of 18. From time to time when I visit the store for shopping purposes I still try to look after it, simply putting items back where they belong or nudging a shy customer in the right direction, or toward a current employee to help them. The store manager was one of the hardest working employee's in the store, leading by example and setting aside everything to help a customer, simply one of the kindest group of people I've encountered involving customer service."
good,"Before store opening, putting away freight. After opening, helping customers, placing online orders, cashing customers out, being called for back up at front of store. Collecting carts, Bridal consultant, down stocking/top stocking with ladders"
good,"I love working here, Just wished the pay was more competitive $9 - $10 an hour.  I hand picked the perfect hours and schedule.  I enjoy working here part time.  Job is not hard.  Favorite thing about the job is shopping the sales.  I love my fellow coworkers and bosses. Bosses work hard on the floor when things fall behind and the staff is overall very reliable."
good,"Flexible hours for college students, and consistent availability of work schedule. I never had to stay posted in one spot for a full shift. As there was always tasks on sales floor to tend to. Associates would help each other and share duties. A very busy place to work,  but never boring."
good,typical day in my position as customer service manager is making the daily training schedule to teach classes. daily customer service. conference calls. had monthly meetings with entire store...inventory team..loved my job
good,"Loved this Job. They give great hours, the pay was GREAT. good benefits. Management made you feel welcomed. Family feeling environment. They do Paid training. and its always room for a promotion."
good,"The management of the location I work for is amazing. Kind, caring, respectful, and incredibly understanding about situations and conditions that their employees have. "
good,great people to work with very flexible with working with my schedule  . i only work part time their as a cashier great place managers are cool employs are easy to get along with lots of cool stuff in here
good,"Managers are nice, flexible schedules, employee seem to like working there.  It's easygoing easy work I really enjoy working there.   Easy to learn they teach you many skills"

good,"great company to work for, been with the company  ten and a half years. Have seen it only grow. Each day offers something different but pleasing especially the customers."
good,i like working at bed bath and beyond because everyday you get to learn something new. We learn to respect others and help others. Everyone works as a team to provide good customer service. I work at the brampton location and i love the staff there.
good,"Work depends on what position I work that day. It changes every now and then. I usually switch between cashier, floor associate and replenishment associate. Typical days usually involve helping the customers with questions, finding items they need, or ordering certain items online. I learned a lot about working in retail, but overall, I learned the best parts about customer service and I feel that my knowledge about it has expanded greatly. Management is great as I feel that I'm on steady ground with the manager and I feel that though they can be tough at times, they have a lot of faith in me and what I can do. The workplace culture itself is great, sometimes hard since there are so many things I wish to buy, but still its a wonderful setting. The hardest part of the job, again, is restraining myself from wanting to buy so many things. While there are many things about the job that are enjoyable, I find that interacting with the customers and being able to help them find what they need is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"great company to work for, great people.  always busy and great environment.  Excellent working condition.  will go back any time."
good,"Everyday is completely different, you never know who or how many people you will be helping.  Most of our customers and very kind and will wait a few minutes for assistance."
good,"Love to work here, would recommend it to anyone looking for retail advancement. Management is fun and reliable. Hours are decent and work to what ever type of schedule."
good,a typical day at work is being signed assignments and helping customers. we start with a huddle every day and talking about the tings we would like to improve along with bouncing ideas off of each other
good,Taught a lot skills like customer service and how to treat customers through a frustrating time. The people I worked with were great and super supportive.
good,"Management is fun, nice, and will help you out if you need more hours or just someone to talk too. Co-workers are all pretty great. We work as a team and things get done fast. Professional environment and clean and organized store."
good,my typical day at work was long and always standing on my feet for ten hours a day for forty hours a week I replenished shelves with the product that was ordered and I also picked the product that was ordered by the customer that needed to be shipped out. management was amazing they worked with your schedule and was very respectful. The hardest part of my job was learning every department. the most enjoyable part was having friends you could count on to make your day go by faster
good,"This job was very accommodating with your schedule and management was very positive. Bed Bath and Beyond puts the customer first and managers insisted we help customers over doing freight and stocking the shelves. "
good,This job has been one of the best experiences for me since I first got hired. I've learned ways to better my selling skills & provide the best customer service to every individual. We come in with a goal at the beginning of out shift & this helps us improve ourselves in a friendly competitive way. Managers are flexiable & helpful as well as co-workers. I enjoy this job.

Management provides training classes on the different areas of the store so that you learn more about the products and feel comfortable answering questions from customers and helping them make decisions."
good,It was a rewarding and fun place to work. Employees and management were great to work for/with. Not much room for advancement therefore not much room for raises either.

good,Fun environment; However the pay and the hours aren't so great. Mainly because I am a college student and soon will be moving out to Tampa and I would like to be well prepared or the move. I love Bed Bath & Beyond mainly because it is different then other stores not just by shopping there but also because of the act that I am employed there. I would love to obtain a job where I can show my skills in being a laboratory professional.
good,"Great place to work with helpful friendly associates and managers. Overall customer satisfaction is the main objective, not driving sales. If you drive service, the sales will follow."

good,"A very friendly, positive work environment. I learned how to handle Canadian currency, I closed the store meaning I did some cleaning and worked the customer service desk. My managers were great people to work with - very reasonable and fair. My co-workers were fun and very helpful to me. The hardest part of the job was learning when to call for help and who to call. I was very new to retail and to having a job in general so I wasn't very good at it but it was a great learning experience and the things I learned there are things that can be used throughout life, not simply in the workplace."
good,Love working in this environment and being able to help others.
good,"A typical day would consist of helping every customer, making sales, understanding the need of what the customers are looking for.Help making the store look presentable. making sure everyone that walk in had a nice experience before leaving.

The  Hardest part of this job was reaching high shelves.The most enjoyable part was our co-workers were like family."

The public is not always easy, but is rewarding to work at a place where putting the customer is always first. I have the ability to go the extra mile every day. Though it might be long hours, it is a very satisfying job."
good,"Working at Bed Bath & Beyond for the years I have been there has been overall an exciting experience. Waking up everyday to go help customers with their day to day shopping is pretty exciting. You never know what kind of customer your going to get, whether its the grumpy customer that's upset behind a product that they are unsatisfied with, or the customer that shops there everyday and wants to know the new item of the month. Sometimes it can over whelming but having the power to make things better for the customer, and go beyond the expectations to give them what they need just to make them happy and keep them coming back because of the great customer service, makes it all worth it. And who doesn't have problems in the workplace? The management is like everyone else they don't think just because they have a higher position the rules don't apply they make things easier by not only working with the employees and making sure our day is going smoothly but also waving specific restrictions and rules to make the customer happy. It was an overall fantastic experience among the laughs jokes different attitudes and personalities."

good,"Day was spent mostly on cash register, stocking shelves, helping customers find items, or working the customer service desk. They have a great way of teaching you about the products so that you can explain or talk about them to the customers. The managers were great as well as most of the co-workers. Some of the younger people didn't seem to want to work too hard. The hardest part of my job was climbing up and down tall ladders to stock or retrieve items. The best part was working with the customers to help them find just the right item they wanted in the right size or color or whatever their need was."
good,Consisted of helping customers find products located around the store and online. Restocked depleted items. I learned about using good communication skills with all members of the workplace. Management was great; helped me fit right in with the rest of the team. Co-workers also showed me how to maintain a level head in problematic situations. The hardest part was multi-tasking between store problems and what the customers needed. The most enjoyable part was seeing the satisfaction of a customer get his/her questions answered.

I learned how to work in a fast pace environment, all the brands the company carried, and working as a Bridal Consultant. Managers were very concentrated on keeping up to date with their goals, making sure they set the right example to the associate, and at the same time making the work environment fun. As manager maintained their image as role models the associates, including my self, reflected upon their attitude and hard work. As I was getting used to the fast pace environment, it was challenging keeping up with different task every minute. As a fast learner, I was enjoying being busy and getting all of my task done fast and moving on the the next, time flew by."
good,"This BBB is the smallest amongst the rest in the area and the place is pretty nice. I would do the same stuff every day such as restocking shelves, making a new label for products, help out customers, ETC..."

good,Most customers are nice and understandable when it came to the lack of employees or if we are really busy. But all in all its a pretty cool play to work.

The leadership truly cares about the well-being of the team, and they understand that by providing or their employees they are providing for customers. The management is easy to talk to and very friendly. I never had issues bringing my concerns to them. It is retail, so naturally there is quite a high employee turnover. I worked here for a year before being promoted to a supervisor position."
good,"I would either do claims if it was Monday or check in freight Tuesday thru Friday.  I learned a new department in retail which was receiving.  All of the management was easy to get along with.  The hardest part of my job is when I first learned how to do receiving.  After finally learning my job, the most enjoyable of my job was being able to work quickly by myself.  I loved just working by myself.  Better reviews that way."

You were told you were not hired permanently and then escorted out of the building immediately.  I was pulled from my desk on December 23rd and half way through the shift was told I will not be returning and escorted out of the building.

A typical day of work consists of many activities, depending on where we were located for that day depending on our duties. It was expected of us to get to work right away, hence there were always things to do and to take care of. The most significant prospects I've learned is how to be a dependable team player who is also a reliable individual that will take care of the task at hand quickly and responsibly. I have also received over 12+ corporate compliments from customers as well as over 10+ within the store. The management looks up to me for this since it is also a good reflection on them as well. It was a very enjoyable experience always being busy and having things to do, since it helps contribute to a growing company and to its reliability to their customers."
good,"I greeted customers, help managers set up new layout for my department. I helped customers find items they were searching for.

The typical day at work was every day was different and gave us different challenges, which was great."
good,"My experience at Bed Bath & Beyond was a pleasant one for the most part. Similar to any job, there will be some bad days, but how it affects the individual is entirely up to them. I will say that I enjoyed being able to wear jeans to this job as it was most comfortable since my position was in the back room. There often more busy days throughout the week than normal, but those are the type of days I enjoyed the most. Through experiencing those days, I was able to greatly improve my overall performance. The management wasn't bad and everyone recognized that we all had a job to do."
good,"I greeted customers, did returns or exchanges and answered phone calls. Helped with the bridal events. I did a summer of receiving; when the shipment came in.

good,A typical day at work would start off with communicating with the manager on duty to see if any tasks needed to be done. After talking to the manager I would seek out customers and offer assistance. If no customers needed assistance then I would begin to zone and clean my portion of the store.
good,Training at the store was by a person not a computer.  Good hands on training.  Management for the most part cared for their employees.  All positions were taught so someone could help out when needed.  Decent work days.  You were compensated for working longer hours or working a 6th day of the week.  Freight was the hardest part of the job.  5 days a week of freight and put away times were very short window.

good,Typical day might be in receiving unloading the merchandise for the day that is delivered. Pricing and placing it on racks by departments. Or on the sales floor stocking and putting out product as needed and providing customer service to the various people in your department. I learned quite a bit about products while I was there. We would have meetings in the mornings if you were part of the day shift and would all learn about a particular product that day.

My experience there was,a good learning and challenging experience for me... If I didn't move away to the mainland,I would still be working there right now..."
good,"Checking inventory and filling orders to restock shelves and assiting customers with online orders and instore products. I have learned that working in a timely matter means alot but making sure the work is done correctly means more. The hardest part of the job would be trying to assist the customers, while filling the orders to have them instock for the next day and trying to replenish the shelf before the store closes or by the time the shift is up. The most enjoyable part of the job would be just being in the environment and learning new things from the management team."

good,great work place positive to work at completing task when needed positive attitude to workers and staff adapting to other job function with the ability to train others
good,"I've been here for about 6 years. It varies from slow to extremely fast paced depending on the day and holidays. A typical day is you just refilling the rooms and making everything look full. I learned how to stock up shelves and make displays and make them look presentable and shop able. Management is great. Can't complain. I get along with all managers and supervisors including in neighboring stores and sister stores. I pretty much know a lot of people in the company both in store and corporate. The hardest part is really the seasonal parts like Thanksgiving, Christmas and college season (summer). It's more fast paced and busy so you have to work a bit faster to keep up. But the most enjoyable part is when I accomplish everything the managers give me to do and they love my displays and end up taking photos and sending it off to our district managers and they compliment how well it looks and sometimes they even send it to other store to try and mimic the look as well. It's a great feeling."

The company hired different cultures to manned the sales floor.

The fun environment and the awards/rewards is part of the enjoyable working experience and the many friends that was established during my tenure."

good,"I am a part-time sales associate and i love it here.  The pay is not great but it is, after all, a part-time job.  I am paid more than most places and the atmosphere is very nice.  Managers and supervisors work with me and i am able to set my availability and i am scheduled as such.  being disabled means i need off much more than most due to doctor's visits.  Overall i love it here.  Once a month they have employee appreciation day and different types of goodies each month.  the discount is very nice and during the holidays they increase it for us"
good,The staff is very friendly and helpful. Things are labeled behind the counter and are easy to find and accessible. Never asked to do too much at once.
good,"Can get very crowded at tme and stressfull"
good,"BB&B is a place where real retail merchants can thrive. It still, to this day, allows a tremendous about of freedom & autonomy at the store, district & regional level. Only bad news is it needs o continue adapting faster and faster to the online nemesis known as Amazon. This may no be a threat BB&B conquers. There's far too much overlap in product selection(even if not identical) and vast transparency in pricing on line. BB&B will most likely need to consider going private for awhile and really take some pressure off all levels of mgmt in regards to figuring i all out. BB&B still has a very low debt load, plenty of cash and great people. All those great minds could potentially figure it out but stockholder pressure is mounting. Going private may be a great short term strategy."
good,"I never felt like I didn’t want to go in to my shift or that I was too tired to work my shift ever. I always looked forward to going in even when I worked the late evening shift, my co workers because some of my best friends and they are super laid back and flexible."

The hardest part of the job was when customer's product was damaged in transist or behind in schedule because the customers would get frustrated and become irrate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers because I enjoyed knowing that I was apart of them having a great shopping experience with our company.

good,"I enjoyed working at Bed Bath and Beyond because of the employees, customers, and the atmosphere the store had."
good,"A typical day would be to review the sales tactics and restock the floors with product. Would also change displays to sell a top item more.

Skills that I have learned while working is accounting, customer center services, and sales management. Each supervisor is a fantastic leader and a fair person to all their employees. Just like the managers at Bed Bath & Beyond, each employee is the utmost friendly and professional associates to all their customers. The hardest part of the job is mainly keeping up with the constant delivery of products throughout the day, but the most enjoyable moment as a employee at Bed Bath & Beyond is helping customers each and every day."

good,"A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond consisted of managing time  given in order to complete projects for the store (i.e. Stocking inventory, creating displays, etc..).  Amongst completing projects on the sales floor, you must always be polite, courteous and helpful to all customers that enter the store (i.e. Greeting customers, helping customers find a product, giving knowledge of the product to the customers, etc..). I've learned many things at Bed Bath & Beyond. Such as, approaching and talking to strangers in a professional friendly manner (all personality types). I learned how to be much more quick and efficient with the time I was given. The management is very practical and realistic. All managers are willing to help with anything, if needed. Managers understand what asking too much is and long as you used your time productively they always made sure to put a smile on your face and keep it there. I got along with all my co-workers. All co-workers were easy, fun and outgoing. I did not have any hard time working at Bed Bath & Beyond. Most everything was self-explanitory and could be accomplished with ease depending on how one goes about completing the task. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people with different backgrounds; being able to take a personality trait displayed to you and applying it when talking to another customer."

good,"Not only is it a shopper's paradise, but working here was just as much as a pleasure. And before anyone says I didn't, my department room was the Towel Room! I started in back-stock unloading trucks and processing merchandise. Then with my flare and training (from Pier 1) for visual merchandising, I ended up on the floor creating displays and wall fixtures while still giving awesome guest service. I didn't mind cashiering either, most of my add-on sales happen while I was standing there chatting with the guest I was ringing up, then I did on the floor. I loved working Bridal too, to see the happy couple figure out the scan gun, and get excited about their wish list! I also enjoyed the benefits of going to the manufacture's educational courses on their products, not just for the discount, but to learn about the product and why the product was so expensive to begin with!

I only worked closely with a few colleagues and the experience was always enjoyable. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the overall work environment."
good,"Customer service is what I did first, but learning all about the product is where I really had fun. All employees were taught in depth product training on all items on the sales floor. It made it easy and fun to sell to the customer!"
