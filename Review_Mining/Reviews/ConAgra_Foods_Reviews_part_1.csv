rating,review
bad,"They should be more fair to everyone equally! They shouldn't  promote their  employees biased on  nepotism!  I'm sure there is still people who works there, and deserve a chance to be promote."
bad,"Typical day at work is working on the lines packing, cleaning, operating box machines refilling them with boxes as the never ending line keeps going. Learned how to operate some machinery while working there. hardest part of the job is finding a way to make your back not feel broken after leaning over the lines for extended periods of time."
bad,"One thing they don’t let you know is that for the 8 hour shift, you will be working 6 days a week.. mandatory. You only get 1 day off. Also you only get two 20 minute breaks. Start wage is $14.29 general labor. Should be more. I don’t recommend working here at all."
bad,"Very demanding, stupid policies, horrible management the worst life work balance ever, they want you to be there slaves and do anything they ask all-the time"
bad,"My job a ConAgra was lots of fun, and high tech. I was part of our Safety Team, which I enjoyed very much. QA had its problems, it was very high tech, and they did cross train us which I very much enjoyed."
bad,"The management will cut your throat to save themselves. Supervisors lie to take focus off of themselves. They want you to take ownership, but they won't take ownership for anything. Culture is very bad. Couldn't expect anything less, as the ceo is the same way."
bad,Really hot and this place worked you to your bone! Fortunately this place shut down for good back in 2016 it was a sweat shop! I would have to work 12 hrs!
bad,Cutting positions on the floor and adding more management you can consolidate management roles and probably trim 200k in Salary. Maintenance sit in a back room and do paper work as lines are running unproductively. since change of plant manager conagra  Rensselaer has been at a steady decline
bad,Your work schedule was always changing but the opportunity for overtime was always there if you wanted to work it. Pay and benifits was competitive for the area .
bad,the place smells horrible and the workers are not treated very fair. They overwork people and then people end up quitting because of it. the management could be alot better.
bad,it was always over 100 degrees and if you wasnt burning alive you would have to worry about all the problems from your coworkers that had nothing to do with the job.
bad,big building to come into and work 12 hours doing the same thing over and over didnt learn anything but thats where pasta is made management wasnt good
bad,"Management  did not care about company and therefor company went bankrupt.Otherwise I like my managers and team members.   "
bad,there are too many cliques in the company. Management makes unrealistic expectations for the production lines and don't care if the workers work more than 40 hours or not because they don't work on the lines.
bad,"Horrible, horrible company to work for.  Completely disorganized. Backstabbing, lying, cheating, cut throat environment. Would never recommend this company."
bad,"They give 1 person the job of 3 and continue to pile it on. Managment doesn't know the positions they take over and team memebers literally have to guide them at all times, not supportive and lots of favortisum. Couldn't be paid enough to ever go back."
bad,Working in this plant was very uncomfortable. You had to work in 0 degree temp. It was a very fast paste. It was not a place for an expecting mother. I was injured on this job which caused me to resign.
bad,I hate this place with a passion.  No one can mind there own business and stop talking about everyone.   If I didn't make 21$ an hour I would never work there
bad,"Best job I ever had before the explosion in Garner NC. I was very disappointed that ConAgra closed down. Sadden by the lives that where lost during the time of the explosion,"
bad,Managing sanitation department of cleaning duties on machines up to state regulations. Unpredictable hours and or the days of work
bad,"Constant overtime for months on end. New trainees last maybe a month, usually less - do to the hot and horrible work environment that your stuck in for 12 days straight & 12 hour shifts. in July of 2015, we only had two days off. Gone without many weekends for more than half the year then basically unemployed for 2-3 months during slow season. Good & hard work is left unnoticed. Favoritism there is one of their biggest problems. So if you are looking for a company that doesn't appreciate you, wears you out within the first two months from working you so much, and makes it impossible for you to move up in the company because of their ridiculous points system, then this is the company for you!"
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of getting the Daily Schedule completed, at the best product that should be made. Learned each employees job went in order for everyone to succeed in this Company. Got along with my co-workers,"
bad,"Un día normal era revisión de inventarios del cliente, hacer sugeridos de órdenes de compra, hacer los reportes semanales para mi jefe."
bad,"I enjoyed  working in Con-Agra formerly Hunt Wesson.  This company provided the employees the opportunity to move the ladder. In my 20 years working I worked in different departments. I worked in Growers Accounting, Plant Accounting, International Accounting, Data Entry, Accounts Payable and Inventory Accounting. This company also helped not only the employees but also the children.  One of my kids got scholarship that really helped me financially. This company gave incentive to those who would like to carpool by helping financially and to those who lived close by, employees were given bicycles. We were also given empoyee discounts when we bought our products"
bad,en esta empresa es demasiada explotadora  no ´paga bien a sus trabajadores mucho trabajo muy ajitado .
bad,"A typical day consisted of maintaining and keeping equipment running.  Equipment isn't very sophisticated, mostly conveyors.  Parts inventory was always a challenge.  I was a maintenance supervisor and was micro managed to a point I didn't know could exist.  The worst part of my day was when the maintenance manager came in in the morning and imposed his daily screaming and degrading session with the maintenance supervisors.  I consider his rants work place violence and they couldn't figure why a union was banging on their door!  Meetings between managers and hourly workers in the maintenance department were non-existent except for the two over a four year period in which they were told how little the department was getting accomplished and they were an embarrassment.  If you wanted a weekend off it had to be taken as vacation except for the every other weekend you were off.  One pay raise in four years service.  The best part of my day was going home for what was left of the day."
bad,Company that really makes employees feel appreciated.  Very encouraging and supportive. 
bad,"No matter how much you put into this company, unless you are with the in crowd you will not advance. You cannot be honest to be in upper management. You can't trust this company. Such a shame. I am surprised it is still in business as much money as they stuff in their pockets behind closed doors."
bad,Sounds like the management in this company needs work due to favoritism. It's to bad cuz Omaha has great feedback from there employees
bad,"I'm a sanitor on 3rd shift at Marshall. When I started it was monday-friday and you could sign up overtime for sat or sunday. THEN,...without it known when i started they started forcing everyday of the week about two months ago. Yeah,..about $15 an hour,...but no homelife. You have to burn points and call in if you have any plans. Went 19 days in a row,...then let off one day. This crappp may last until January or Feb. I'm tired of it. Several are. Places I worked at before all had a bonus,... Conagra  decided it wasnt fair to some plants so they stopped. Other factories i worked at gave a $75-100 visa for xmas to employees,... not this place. It's a union shop,... so your wages ARE your perks, thats it. The first place i've ever worked for,.... where you REALLY are a number.."
bad,"a good place to work at, but it just don't pay enough. The people here don't treat you fair.Also i don't like some of there rules."
bad,Everyday working at this place was a burden. Machines were constantly breaking down and it would take too long to fix and was not efficient. Also Bathroom breaks were not given So I went 4.5 hours without a bathroom break and was upset about this.
bad,"You can work there many years and not get any opportunity for advancement. If you want to advance in this place, it won't happen unless management likes you. And if you speak up and say anything about it you will be deemed a problem by management and targeted"
bad,there no consistency when it comes to discipline and upgrade procedures. to many under skilled work force. which causes unsafe work environment. with low skilled labor it may be unsafe to the surrounding community
bad,Terrible place to work everyone is stabbing each other in the back in order to advance.  Incompetence is king and butt kissing will get you everywhere.
bad,"worse place to work. Long hours, the supervisors are nothing but bullies there. Seems you have more down time than you work so hard to pay bills when you are always on a shut down. Employees are great always willing to help you out. Seems like they are a revolving door with employees, people don't last long because of the way they are treated my management."
bad,Was very nice place to work until we got new management in office. Now we are treated as a number and not a person. Management will swear and employees and yell at employees. Do not care about safety anymore.
bad,I worked here for 3 years and never had a good day. The management pushes everything to the absolute limit to get the highest production possible.
bad,"Don,t believe the corporate office when they say your factory will not shut down. When that topic is brought up in a meeting you can bet they already have plans to close it!. They will spend billions of dollars on stealing other companies instead investing a million in a established factory. No job security with this company and the products being made are now using cheaper ingrediants to increase corporate profits."
bad,Managment has scheduling information but they hold out. Not a company of integrity and it is a lot of favortism!!! They offer you fulltime but your lucky if you get 32 hours.
bad,"I was hired to lead the electrical maintenance team. Within a few weeks of starting, I was also the plant electrical safety champion, the labeling department maintenance team leader, the planner for the department, and then was assigned to be the dayshift maintenance team leader in the tomatoes department all at the same time. 5 jobs for one salary. Talked to managment several times, HR manager even fell asleep in two seperate meetings. They could care less."
bad,Conagra offers descent jobs for descent pay but the culture is one of back biting and high school drama that unfortunately management adds to rather than controls.
bad,"A typical work day was a 12 hour running four machines with little help on a continuously running assembly line."
bad,Wasn't a bad job the pay just was no that good. You were able to move up but it takes to long. You work 12 hours of hard labor with little pay. I didn't like the pay thats all
bad,"hard work, cuthroat etc... High turnover with management and hr and the plant manager. If that tells you anything. I could see the plant closing in the next couple years."
bad,"Maintenance manager and supervisors micromanage everything.  You are told you are replaceable. The lines come before your family and you are reminded of that daily.  The marshall, mo plant needs an entire restructure of the maintenance department."
bad,Thus is a very bad company to work for have recently changed to tree house Foods management is horrible long hours and when the finish working you to death you'll have no family time mandatory overtime everyday and multiple safety hazards. Employees get hurt all the time due to exhaustion one of the worst places I have ever worked.
bad,"The work you like a dog for 6 months a year and lay you off for the other 6. Also a union that just keeps all the lazy old employees. I was better worker than most people in my dept, I get laid off and all the worthless don't thanks to you the union."
bad,Extremely poor management leads to high turnover rates. They turn and burn employees without developing healthy careers with them. Intense work hours and lack of inforcement of labor laws.
bad,The money was good but I wouldn't want my dog working at a place like that. They do their workers dirty and I wouldn't recommend anybody to work there.
bad,"Be ready to work anywhere from 6-13 days in a row with a lot of them being 12 hours. The actual workload is stressful and there is not much opportunity to advance since they handle just about every situation by seniority so those just coming into the company always get the short end of the stick. They will often tell you that your scheduled to have a day off and then at the last minute make your shift work that day so planning just about anything ahead of time is useless. You'll work so much that the day or two you are off, you'll be too tired to do anything. The pay is low when thinking of all the work you're required to do."
bad,It was a harsh enviroment to work in along with the disrespectful co-workers. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Temporary workers are neglected in the work place by workers that have been working there for years.
bad,"I was considered a general worker which meant I did a little bit of everything. I worked the production line, fork lift operator, sanitation etc."
bad,"An ok place to work, but lack of true focus and direction from management - immediate and senior. THere are companies that try to be great and others that just are great. ConAgra is still trying."
bad,"These guys talk the talk but don't walk the walk...on everything. No development, no career advancement, etc. Management allowed to ""go off"" on employees without consequence no matter how well you did (I was beating everyone with my numbers and I still go it). Old white boys club (and I am a white guy) with no room for more members."
bad,"The plant manager plays favorites and tries picking on certain individuals while others went on doing whatever they wanted! It is a union place, but people there are quick to say bad things about others to management and will throw someone under the bus to save their own skin"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for this organization. Even though they say they care about their people, they really don't. If you want to become nothing more than a number in an organization, this is the place to work."
bad,Worst management I have ever had the displeasure of working with. The entire company is siloed and everyone is trying to cover their own butts. If you take your lunch or leave on time you are wrong. They have to pay well and give decent benefits or anyone with a brain in their head would run.
bad,bad place to work..mean employees.short breaks long shifts
bad,Working at this company is highly stressful. Your never know how many hours your going to get. You get sent home alot. Its just extremely stressful
bad,They think your just a number. They don't care about employees they just want numbers. Decent pay depending on what your doing. Great benefits. Not a place to retire from since they lowered wages under new contract..
bad,I enjoyed working here. The pay was fantastic. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I enjoyed working overtime because it helped me in a big way financially. The work was sometimes hard. In production there was a lot to remember and a lot of heavy lifting. Sanitation was very hot.
bad,Unclear strategic direction and no plan for sustained business growth.  One volume growth year followed by the next with a volume decline.  Brands are very trade promotion dependent.
bad,"Have to know how to talk to people, and get them to calm down. The biggest thing is you people skills and how you treat people."
bad,great place to work other than the people running it. it consumes your whole life
bad,Was a great job but when you don't get along with HR or your Dept supervisor it gets tough... Hard to get into the company but once your in its a great UNION job...
bad,They work you like a dog and pay isn't well. I really had a bad experience with this company
bad,"Calling on grocery stores in the region representing the companies product to Store Management and Head Stock person. Ensuring proper product placement and shelf space for each product based on company and sales data.  Unless you have a company supplied vehicle,  use of your own vehicle at minimal reimbursement rate.  What I learned was to not interview for an available position and voice your observation that Sales and Marketing needed to work together to make the products a success.  To which I was told by a Regional Manager that Sales hated Marketing and that their Marketing efforts sucked and that Sales persons would never listen to Marketing.  As well as having my final pay check and expense check held for almost 2 month until I sought legal action to get my final pay check and expense check for working after I moved out of the area.  When questioned I was told they had ?'s about my expenses and wanted to know who had authorized me to stay over night after working almost 24 hours doing store sets at 3 stores and actually traveling back from the state I had moved to so that I could continue to conduct store sets and business for them.  While I was waiting for them to forward my infor to the new regional manager in the area I had moved to.  Upon deciding that I was not going to continue with ConAgra, I was able to find out from a former region manager that I had been Black listed by the Regional Manager that had told me that ""Sales and Marketing would never agree to work together.  Having a statement put in my company record that stated.  THIS INDIVIDUAL SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED"
bad,"This is the worst place to work, the management is a joke. The supervisors are kids. Not kids who worked hard and advanced but kids related to upper management who was gave their job because of who they are. They do not train you properly. The hours change daily and with out notice and it is your responsibility to know this or they will point you. They don't tell you this either. You will work 7 days a week with no days off. They have new hires every week because of how bad the turnover is here."
bad,Conagra is always in a state of flux. I think they have a difficult time finding themselves and what they want to be... This results in a lot of management and staff turn over.
bad,This is nothing more than a productivity factory job they only want you to push one as much as possible until they close down the facility and move to mexico
bad,Its been ok place to work for but the moral has went down due to being bought out 3 times in 5 years.  There is no initiative to get people advanced and you do not get paid for what you know or the amount of work you do
bad,Poor management. It's a family thing. If your in the in crowd your safe. Management makes up positions to help their friends and family. Human Resources is a joke. Expect your check not to be correct.  Drugs run through the plant daily.  A lot of the operators and maintenance are high during the shift.
bad,A good company located in the middle of nowhere. Not able to attract good talent. Constantly acquires and divests companies. Does not have a good vision or long term strategy.
bad,"Temporary position to provide tuition for college."
bad,"At a place like this, it was hard for me to find any enjoyment in my job. I have learned that when combining ingredients together, it's all about the consistency of the final product that makes all the difference."
bad,I was promised at least forty hours a week with possibility of overtime.  You get that during training but after that are lucky to come close to that.  Had I known then what I know now I would have ran and not even considered.  Yeah the pay is decent but if you are told forty hours you should be given that.
bad,"If you don’t like overtime, all the time, this is not the place for you. If you want managers, supervisors, leads, and coworkers that know what they are doing, this is not the place for you. There is currently a mass exodus from this place. Not just production people, but also maintenance, distribution, and management. They have had two HR direcors resign in less than a year. Run. Run far, run fast."
bad,"If your willing to work 12hr days 13 days on and 1 day off this job is for you. It is a seniority based plant so when you start out you will be forced to work more hours than you want. The supervisors are great but that's where the road ends. When a normal easy to solve problems happens managers drop the ball. "
bad,"To grow here you need to play the game, otherwise you won't advance. Each person has their own agenda. You will be judged on who you're friends with and not on your professional skills."
bad,no trust in management.  jobs not hard to do rather easy. some good guys to work with. the union can help but is on its downward spiral.  save your self some time and keep looking for a different job.  this isn't the place to work
bad,"Givaudan offers nice benefits including gym reimbursement, but work life balance is difficult to come by. Ideal advancement opportunities are available in the Ohio area."
bad,"dangerous work enviornment, shady management. Dont care about workers or about your personal life. Floors in the building are always oily and hard to manuever with lift."
bad,the best part of ConAgra foods was the people you worked with.
bad,Ok place to work. Quiet work environment. Friendly staff. A typical work day consists of routine actions and an occasional meeting.
bad,The Management structure for each department is different and within my department many were bidding out of the department (even senior members) to be able to grow within the company.  They did not treat their employees well and do not want them to speak their mind. There are many folks who play the favorites and the blaming game!
bad,"Terrible Management at Plants"
bad,"The management liked to keep people down, maintenance got it the worst. They did not care about their maintenance employees. The WHOLE morale of the place was low. You could not challenge a way of thinking and if you do you get shot down. Management needs to be replaced with more experience managers and mangers who actually cares for their employees. Same goes for HR."
bad,management is terrible no one knows what's going on people that work hard are unappreciated. HR department is a joke they take forever to process any paper work
bad,"Management is a joke, equipment is garbage, but the pay is good, and mostly unlimited overtime. They allow you to work your 6 month probation period and then walk you out because they don't want to give you the $4 raise and benefits. They've walked out so many exceptional and reliable employees."
bad,Typical day was long.  I did learn a lot but turnover was high and there was an unstable element to the environment.  New management seemed to be making positive moves though.
bad,I worked there for a year. Pay was great when there was work but they are losing tons of clients resulting in tons of lay offs. Their season went from a few months and some change to 60 days or less. Management is a complete joke. I've personally seen 2 managers get fired. Other managers and supervisors are absolutely oblivious to what is going on. This place hires absolutely unqualified people to fix their equipment. They hired a buddy of mine in maintenance and hes a complete idiot who has gotten fired from 6 different jobs but I guess this place doesn't do their homework. HR is impossible to work with besides a select few. They flat out dont care. This plant is lost millions in the last few months resulting in line shut downs and lay offs. Everyone is getting laid off. Old people who don't speak English have seniority and will take your jobs and cry to the union if they see you getting ahead. As nice as the people were there they will write a the fence on you in a heartbeat. Expect to get laid off! This particular plant is not a place to call home and is most likely going to close soon. I poured my heart into this place and tried my best to move up but it seems if you arent related to certain people or anre a part of the innet circle you wont get anywhere. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PLACE!
bad,very hot work days and very stressful not to trust management management  just like to fire people co workers are ok stress and heat nothing enjoyable
bad,Company-wide layoffs & outsourcing to India are what this CEO brings to ConAgra...same exact thing he did to Hillshire Farms. I predict in a few years ConAgra will be picked apart and sold off for the shareholders best interest to make a lot of money in a short period of time...yet disrupting thousands of employees livelihood.
bad,"The plant environment was very different than the corporate environment. If you were looking to advance, it was a who you knew kind of environment. In the production arena they required 12-13 hour days, didn't really care if you had a work/life balance and management was not very transparent. They were not into people development, they did not embrace many of the corporate initiatives at the plant level that were working at the corporate level. One example, the company paid to be a member of the Executive Leadership counsel which identifies minorities for leadership roles like VP, but the plant would not support supervisors going to such events. The other supervisors made the work enjoyable, even though there was this know your place mentality kind of inherent of the south. Most of the non-salaried workers were black, and management was white. Race relations were poor, but they liked you because they hired you, that's not necessarily true. Each day presented a new and exciting challenge where I learned to become a guru in SAP, Infinity, and create the COA program, I was able to hone in on my quality control skills work across departments and still get the job done."
bad,Too much conflict with home life. Cannot plan anything with family due to constant changes in production schedule. More concerned with meeting numbers
bad,"Terrible place.  Poor building conditions, strong negative culture.  High expectations and demand without support, strategy to accomplish goals.  This was a terrible work experience."
bad,"Very competitive wages.  There is no work/life balance even though management perceives they are 'working on it'.  Promotions are not based on your capabilities, but how well you go along with the politics.  The leads on teams do far less than those they are supposed to lead.  Not a female-friendly environment."
bad,Management was more concerned with blame than correcting problems
bad,"Average day 14 to 15 hours long, upper management was weak and unengaged with workforce, company treated supervisors like dirt, just a lousy place to work, remember this,poorly run food-business means poorly manufactured food!!!"
bad,Management verses Union. Advancement is very hard if in union.
bad,"Too many hours,  too much work for one person.  People are very disrespectful employee n Managers. Employees that represent the union are not very nice to employees in the office."
bad,"It was 7 days a week and you had to request off for a weekend. Even then you would get the stink eye. Pay was decent. I did enjoy working on the equipment, I learned alot. I do beleive the culture has changed some however I dont know how much. You were not saving lives , no reason to work 7 days a week."
bad,Job was not fair.  Lack of communication.. no structure.. pay and benefits were ok. Co-worker are great too work with... plant manager has no communication with worker.
bad,This place required you to be there a whole lot. And for myself I did not have a good experience with the management team that was managing the facility while I was employed there
bad,typical work day: package baked goods such as breads in individual bags and boxes. Check quality of it. Run assembly line.Make sure line was clean afterwards.
bad,"the hours were not guaranteed, pay was on the low side for the work. Fast paced stressful work atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend work there for anyone I know."
bad,I worked in a plant where the hours were hellish and the people were very difficult to work with. The experiences I got there were invaluable to my career but I wouldn't want to work there again.
bad,No accountability from management poor reliability for production flow to accomplish productivity and failure to maintain good communication skills between management and production
bad,"A typical day at work performing all duties necessary to meet the company Government requirement , what i learned understands equipment hazards prevent injury to youself and other."
bad,they pay was better than other labor jobs in the area and the benefits were okay. They do not give any PTO in the first year which is likely why this place has so much turnover.
bad,few years ago I not want to be working there any more for few things in they not was doing the rules in they not going some people of the safety in some supervisors screen some people.
bad,"management refuses to deal with people issues which makes the working environment a nightmare. the turn around at conagra is very fast, which says it all."
bad,"this job was one of my least favorite, you would go in thinking your working 8 hours but if they dont have enough orders they send you home. it gets really hot in the summer"
bad,"A very fast placed work environment, with good insurance and benefits, but team moral was quickly going downhill and management was absolutely terrible. Use to be a good place to work until the culture changed and now you go in not knowing if you would have a job the following day."
bad,"The union runs that plant. If you are salary, it is a fight to get anything done, because you have no support from HR in regards to the them making a change."
bad,"The job responsibility completely changed when new management came in and there was no clear communication or direction from the higher ups. Everyone was doing their own thing and communication was horrible. New management didn't back up their people and added more work. Career movement was non-existent. It didn't matter if you were doing the job for 40 years, if you didn't suck up or did everyone's work, you weren't going to move ahead."
bad,"Burn up in the summer and freeze during the winter! Business operates day by day and management does not use common sense in decisions that affect employees. Management shows no appreciation to employees and has mentality that if you keep employees mad they will work harder! Co-workers are good to work with and job pays well for the area and benefits are average for this size company. Could be a good place to work and I really like and appreciate my job, but when you work for greedy stock holders all employees are just a number. Employees make the company money and should be treated as the greatest asset but Conagra senior management feel they are more important and they know best period!"
bad,they work you to hard with barely any reword. they say safety is everything but then rush you way to much then makes the job unsafe they pay well but i believe its not worth it
bad,Hard working days at work the people were great very little time to spare company was great and good to the employees the benefits were very good
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of packaging oatmeal, labeling it, then shipping it off to customers. Proper handling was very important for food safety."
bad,"Conagra was not my favorite place to work.  If you like working in a culture that is high pressure, then this is the place for you."
bad,"In ConAgra I was a Utility/Hand pack I packed hash browns and cleaned debris to prevent accidents, we worked as a team and I learned how to more safe."
bad,Responsible daily for all in-coming orders generated by appointment and referring them to a team who unloads and provides you with a written confirmation of where the product is stored for usage. You must than inter the location on the internal computer system and update corporate with an on-line system which monitors inventory.
bad,Management seems to be the biggest problem here. (too many chiefs. Poor leadership and management. the wave is felt on the production floor and brings morale down to zero.
bad,okay okay company to work for. i saw some things i wasnt okay with. i like their wages tho.
bad,"That job went down hill when ConAgra bought it out. Safety wasn't priority number one, production was. Unprofessional environment."
bad,"While the workplace consists of many intelligent and hard working people and there is a great deal of challenge and experience to be gained here, there is a lot of problem with stifling potential and failing to reward efforts."
bad,"Maintaining Floors (Buff & Wax)"
bad,"Hired as a temp, promoted after 3 months, however without sufficient training and without raise or benefits. The site was undergoing a transfer of ownership, however that does not excuse the disrespect I was shown, including management ignoring the hostile work environment that developed for me."
bad,"The company has had many changes since I left, I do not have enough information to give an adequate review.  They moved most of their teams to the Chicago area after I left."
bad,"I started out thinking that I had a dream job only to realize it was a nightmare! I was laid off because I was ""intimidating to others"" although I did nothing that could be considered intimidating!"
bad,"Manufacturing/Cost Accounting is an environment that takes a certain individual, so be sure that you are comfortable with that environment prior to stepping into the arena."
bad,"the work schedule for slim jims is terrible, have to work 7days before you get any days off.  work most weekends, sucks."
bad,"normally you will start with warm up exercises so you don't pull a muscle while moving boxes to the pallet. you get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch, the job usually consists of moving boxes scanning labels putting labels on boxes, removing labels and taking out the trash when needed, the people around you are usually good people but rumors go around about everyone as well as gossip, the best part of the job for me was cleaning the conveyor belts that carried the food the hardest part of the job was counting unused boxes and returning them the the return center but dont expect constant pay or work if you are not part of the company"
bad,knowing your customers after a while makes it easy because you can talk or laugh off having a bad day. management communicated regularly about deliveries mostly. to me I enjoyed conversations with the customers.
bad,This is a good compant to start to get you machine oprator experence as soon u get get out start any where elsa... every where elsa pay better...
bad,"My experience at ConAgra was one of the worse I've spent within warehouses/factories. It was also an experience in which I wouldn't regret. A typical work day cannot be explained in just one paragraph. Their were times I would spend 12hr shifts, waiting in the lunch room with other co-workers for at least 4-5 hrs while we wait for machines to properly function. The job was just very unorganized, but I dealt with the adversity's within the company and managed to move around every now and then..."
bad,"3rd shift has 3 possible supervisors,because they rotate,1 of them does not belong in that position,spent most of his time while I was their outside posted up smoking cigarettes.did not ever have a handle on the situation at hand and is not respected by any of the night shift mechanics."
bad,"The price is management that does not care much about employee development. Managers say one thing, do another."
bad,"At this current point in time the management there has no clue what really goes on there. Not a very enjoyable job. Always coming up with news ways to save the company money. Which is a good thing. But do not give us the proper tools and equipment to be able to do so efficiently. I used to look forward to going into work, now i dread the thought of having to go back to work while I'm on my days off."
bad,"a typical day at work was boring, stand around all day, after day because of a packaging machine have problems i learned management and tecs r not held responsible for machine operation, down times not a problem, productivity is not a concern, management fares well with the amount of down time keeping employees friendly needs to work better encouraging employee to work as a team co workers in general r friendly, knowledgeable and hard working the hardest part of the job was standing around hour after hour waiting for the machines to run the most enjoyable part of the job was the # of good ppl i met i have a back ground in packaging machines and can say iv really never experienced the non productivity base solely on a packaging machine, non performance, sad and not a place for me"
bad,"Very fun and pleasant  and I learned alot abt crafts and art."
bad,"Some of the people aren't bad but the management is horrible. What do they care if you're working seven days a week every week. They go home at five o'clock on friday. Horrible place to work if you are on the sanitation or maintanence crew. It never ends. Red tape and b/s from people who know nothing about what it is that you do there, and unless you're related to someone don't count on promotions."
bad,"If your a single person with nothing to do with you life, this job is for you. It will take you at least 10 years of working graveyard or swing shift to get to a day shift. If you last that long. So don't count on a peronal life with friend or family, because you'll be working or sleeping when everybody else is working a normal day job."
bad,good place to work for binifits and pay. the people are greate but too many bosses and not enough leaders.
bad,"ConAgra Foods trying to change image as ""best place to work""."
bad,"too much ot and not enough time off.  no advancement.  it is a good ole boys club.  stuck in their ways.  don't want to listen to new ideas."
bad,The company had poor leadership The did not listen to their employees to make things better. Always pushing their employees to move faster. Did not focus enough on safety which cause the plant closure after 3 people died in plant explosion
bad,Been there for 21 years when they bought us in 2013 things went down hill from there.  Not a good company to work for. Really don't care about the employees.
bad,"They continue to buy and ruin companies; closing factories, releasing good people and trying to promote a fake culture of caring.  Although I'm sure they don't think this, they are continually working to add new brands and channels without the focus, understanding or resources to manage."
bad,fun place to work when things are going good for the company. Coworkers are great. Management was easy to get along with. The union was only there for their friends.
bad,"Company is going through lots of changes, seem to be for the better, new leadership knows what they are doing. Relocation to chicago should be good."
bad,"Assist all Operators with cleaning and operations of machinery. Also assist with whatever the Operators do not want to do or feel that it is not there job to do. "
bad,"The staff at this facility works very hard and is full of nice cooperative people who are a pleasure to work with. The management upstairs needs to be swept out and replaced. They have no management skills and rule through intimidation and fear. There is ineffective or nonexistent communication and information sharing.  This is a very politically based operation, with decisions often being based upon personal management connections with the main office rather than what is good for the company.  The management's job is thus protected and has no reason to improve. They are not forward thinking and are reactive rather than proactive. If the economy was better there would be a mass staff exodus. "
bad,Sometimes takes management forever to get you the right tools to use for the job. Management doesn't seem to communicate with each other sometimes. People I work with are great but all worn out and tired due to the long hours and no days off.
bad,"clock in on time everyday,  get to your job location address any issues and relieve the previous shift.  Get yourself set up and ready to mass produce product.  Hope to get relieved on time to end your shift.  rinse repeat."
bad,New CEO is in the process of redesigning the Company. I think it will be a successful Company and good place to work after changes are made.
bad,"Learnings are high due to breadth and scope of responsibilities per level tier (administrative, entry, engineers, managers, etc.).  You cover a lot of ground very quickly with little time to learn & sometimes react."
bad,Became a machine operator and supervisor. learned a lot from their.
bad,Easy to move up in the company
bad,"Long hours & high stress"
bad,"If you have a problem, it is blown off and forgotten about. You’re worked at a fast pace and sometimes given so much work you can’t do it without help, their idea of recognition is a T-shirt . I use to love working there, but the management has run it into the ground the past few years. If they don’t have enough ppl to run, they FORCE low seniority to either come in 4 hours early or stay 4 hours late. The union only works for you if you’re in the reps group of friends. If you love money and no rest, this is the place for you!"
bad,For the most part people are very negative and while you try to remain positive it becomes contagious. Poor management and very poor communication. Attitudes are poor
bad,The Culture and how the Company treats it's employees is great. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in many areas such as safety. I would definitely recommend this company.
bad,This job did not provide the work life balance that I really needed at that time. Benefits are Great. Management was under a lot of pressure to produce high daily volume. Very fast pace.
bad,Too much labor work for what they pay you. But the pay and hours is ok could be better. very strict place to work when it comes to safety.
bad,Management is aweful supervisers also this place catered to you by race. really dont want to say more. great pay and benifits
bad,"I cant move up an I know I'm a hard worker an I learn fast , I just need a job were I can move up an stay for a long time an also make a different in the comp"
bad,"Other than nice to people to work with there was nothing to look forward to when going to work. Work was boring and monotonous, some days you stood around for half the day waiting for maintenance to fix something."
bad,"A union facility that embraces safety at all time, interaction with manager as business dictated made the Co. fair."
bad,"I found the experience and learning of the equipment was awesome, the hourly people 500+ become almost family after about 3 years. The health benefits are great, retirement is good, unfortunately overtime at any position will be forced. If you are raising a family, have questionable health or other requirements; I wouldn't recommend applying. I really do not want to leave however life priorities are not just money with forced overtime in my opinion."
bad,Sold western waffles within a couple years of buying it. They came in and didn't even fix or change anything. Made it worse. The head honcho wasn't pleasant at all. if you said hi while walking by him he didn't smile or acknowledge that you even existed. We were just a number to him.
bad,Company and management was under severe pressure to perform but without proper initiatives for execution approved by management the company never reached its goals requiring reorganization.
bad,easy job but lots of overtime and no sick days very strick on attendance. no work life balance. The only good aspect is pay and insurance. work week is six days a week.
bad,"start out the day by looking at the work area sheet to find out were you will be the first four hours."
bad,"Overworked.  Good pay.  Liked the employees.  Communication was not stellar.  Boss was good but overworked too.  Generally no one was happy.  Company was bought out, laid off a lot of people and moved the headquarters."
bad,long hours for days at a time. facility is closing in 2 years. has 3 production lines that produce a variety of canned meat and cheese products.
bad,"ConAgra offers the typical benefits.  Health Insurance, dental and vision.  401k.  Over the years the perks slowly went away. No company picnic.  No Holiday party, they even stopped giving coupons to the employees during the holidays."
bad,They wanted us to work seven days a week and constantly changed our hours. I enjoyed working with the people their. They had us working in different areas often.
bad,"Though the company has fair wages for the area this branch of con agra could not care for it's employees in the least. In certain departments a 6 day work week is forced on you, if needed which was often you are forced to hold over with no regard on how you are to get home, as many of the employees care pool or take a bus.  When you request a vacation day it is often denied forcing employees to use their points to take time off.  When sick Doctors notes are routinely lost and more points are taken away.  If you as they say do not clock in or out though you scan your card points are taken away, when you request new cards you are often denied, and in the mean time you lose points,and once you are at zero points you are terminated, this did not happen to me but it has to many other former employees.  Though the company routinely states they look out for our safety and home life they have proven not to care in the least.  Routine preventative maint. is not done and many people and been hurt with many more with near misses.  I pray that there is state and federal inspections to uncover the misdeeds, and hold them to the high standards they state they have, and do not let them off with fines and continue with business as usual."
bad,"My days at this company was nothing I want to relive. I started on the Cleaning Crew where I should have stayed. But no I thought the grass was greener on the other side. I move to Production, big mistake. The management was use to working with a certain type of people so they didn't know how to talk to people correctly. My co-workers were terrible they had little groups that made it hard for a new person. The hardest part of the day was to deal with all these Chiefs no Indians. Everybody want to be the boss. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home."
bad,the management is go go and has a hard time relating with team members they ask team work but dont show progress with the idea the company needs a better understanding of its team members and needs to work on its team work skills to progress you pretty much do your job and keep quite
bad,It was a good job till I had a car accident and missed 6 months of work. I am an electrician by trade and returned to work for 6 months as a general laborer then had to fight to get back original position. I had a minor disability after accident with not walking fast. After 8 years employment I was terminated on a trumped up violation that was very questionable and unfair.I believe they wanted to get rid of me for medical reasons but had no proof to prove my case.
bad,"We start our day with our morning meeting with our Lead and Supervisor. We start talking about what we are going to do that day and how we are going to do it. Talk about our risks and how to be safe. I have learned to drive machinery. Also, I have learned to work with others. "
bad,"This company was great when I started. It had been in this area, for over 60 years. Manager was proud of the company and the people, and you can feel this team work. Our manager got promoted over the nation wide Con Agra and he relocated. New Managers they had it all wrong,the comany went down hill the company blew up killed 4 people hurt over 60 they first layed off 421 people then later closed down my Co-worker were my family made me enjoy going to work everyday on time we did 12 hour shifts working 3.5 days a weeks I stared as a cook then a microwave operator then a play book saftey writer, and then a forklift operator"
bad,"The hardest part of this job is to keep your sanity. The hours and days to be put in weekly; however, the most enjoyable part of the job great communication."
good,"ConAgra has a lot of projects, working as a project engineer the bulk of projects are cradle to grave, and have included training personal. The design work is exciting, and provides many challenges. A typical day requires long hours to complete the rapid schedule."
good,"In my experience with ConAgra Foods, they did not want me to go to college, would not work with my everyday life, such as doctor's appointments and such, and did not care anything about advancement opportunities, even though I was a Leadperson for four years there and was ready when I was let go and, the only reason I was let go, was the fact that they will not work with college students. They forced me to choose to either call in late everyday, four days a week, or drop two classes, which would have put me behind even more than I already am. I would NOT recommend this company for anyone with a family or anyone trying to go to school."
good,I was on call to take a shift when they were short on employees.  I didn't see this working into any full time employment for me so i found another job closer to home that was still part time when they promised i could work more hours.
good,"As an employee of this company for nearly three years now, i have been subject to really just tortuous behavior. abuse. "
good,"my typical day at work consists of being yelled at for not being fast enough or working hard enough, constantly working 12 hour shift with little to no appreciation. working with team leaders who don't know how to lead."
good,"There was no work life balance, they didn’t care about you as a person you were just a number. No room to move up without relocated to Headquarters. More responsibility and no change in status or pay."
good,"Durante los meses que estuve trabajando dentro de está empresa se notó la falta total de administración y cultura laboral, a los novatos como yo no se les da la capacitación correcta y en ocasiones tenia que quedarme a trabajar más horas de las acordadas los fines de semana."
good,The management is kind of low quality.  They pick favorites and jo advacement opportunity. It usca good co worker inevorment.  But you have to basically suck up to get ahead in the company. Pay is bad and the supervisor have their own agendas.
good,"bad place to work for. no room to move up, everyone for them self and that too for management. days off are the only thing that people look forward too."
good,E If you like working your life away then this is the company for you.
good,"It was great working here. Great people making a good, well liked product. Management needs relations management training and lacks follow through with corrective actions."
good,Employee workforce was Teamsters Union and advancement was minimal depending on what department you worked in.  Seniority was everything and when department cuts happened you were subject to being bumped out of your job by an employee with no experience in your department.
good,"tough place to work and long hours, the production side worked these hour while corporate would let there personal get summer hours and work 35 hours a week."
good,"Conagra  when I started was a great place to work, but over time it went to pot. trying to work to many days not enough downtime to properly maintain equipment"
good,"It's ok place to work if you are on the office side. "
good,Business and customer were challenged to find a way to align to grow and gain share and distribution for existing and new items.
good,Started out as good job a lot of selling off and cost cutting.
good,This particular company offers decent benefits and wages from an hourly standpoint.  The union is lacking in leadership and determination to stand up for the workers rights.
good,Conagra Brands is a exciting fast pace place to work. It requires a very demanding schedule which pays off with hard work and determination. There is an opportunity for advancement.
good,"The product is not worth the money. Small portions fit for a three year old. Metal found in food at times and unsafe warehouse conditions. Workers are not trained properly and don't wash their hands. You have to put on all your proper uniform, then punch in on the clock."
good,Hard to balance life and work schedule. A lot of overtime required. Feel as though my concerns are not met effectively. Ive discussed ways to make lines run more efficiently but the two years I've been there with same supervision things remain the same as usual.
good,Line bosses are great for the most part but the company makes you feel like you are not really valued. It's like they feed you with one hand and slap you with the other.
good,"Worked all day at desk without a lot of breaks, numerous projects to complete and management had their favorites. I learned a ton about all the Hunt Wesson products and how to ship them fast."
good,"The company in Indianapolis pays well, but you have to give up family.  This company goes thru managers like they are walking thru a revolving door.   Management has added a lot of new equipment without thinking this all the way thru and creating more work instead of relieving the work load. "
good,Worked hard at making things function correctly on a daily basis.  By helping operators and repairing problems with equipment failures
good,Very excessive forced overtime. Currently working 19 days on and 2 days off with the weekends being twelve hour shifts.
good,"A large corp offering a mostly stable environment, and some employee development.  However, positives largely offset by highly political environment.  Advancement is limited, driven by favoritism and not by performance."
good,"If your all about working and not having a home life this job is for you "
good,Hours can range from 10 hour days to only a couple depending on weather. Employees better be ready to work in heat and be appropriately clothed.
good,Co-workers are the best part of the day. Management lacks people skills and seem to enjoy frustrating the employees until they quit. Union is not a true union at all. No representation even when you pay for it. Work schedule varies month to month and it is very difficult to plan a budget on unknown income.
good,the management doesn't care about any of the workers there.
good,Apply if you don't want a life. You will be treated like a number. Your hard work isn't appreciated. Its a place where the maintenance manager gets away with getting in your face. When you take the issue to HR they ask you what they should do. Go ahead and apply if you like 12hr days 7 days a week.
good,"very repetitive motions some fast paced, some slower. Hardest part of working there would be the pie line, very fast paced!!"
good,The experience was good but the job area was scarce. There were limited factories in the county and looking for assignments were hard.
good,"ConAgra moved almost all jobs from Omaha to India or"
good,I enjoyed working there made some good friends but management was not good there was some good supervisors but there was a lack in communication the environment was ok
good,The workplace is not comfortable. Temperatures vary and are very tough to correct because of factory size. Breaks are not long enough and you have to wear protective wear.
good,Relaxed environment and good people to work with. Work was manageable and not overwhelming with a lot of vacation as a new hire. Dress code was relaxed but no real room to advance. Didn't pay their employees well though.
good,"Negattive, long hrs no qulity of life with family, unfair on promotions. very discrimiatory, upper management has no clue what is happening, Enjoyed the people I work with"
good,The training and experience here has been a huge help at safely maintaining and operating boilers. Anywhere from operating to disassembly of boilers for inspections.
good,"-Constant changes within the company prevents people from being promoted. "
good,"Setup equipment "
good,Easy job but people are not really nice. The management is not good. The security is important but they do not really take car of EE. However I learned to deal with new people and i discovered new skills in myself.
good,"Start at 5am in the morning to get the pass down from 3rd shift as to how the new day will go and plan the best you could.  "
good,"take apart machines ,clean them and put them back together to get them ready for set up to run another order.typically eight hour days with overtime available."
good,"Eight hour day,overtime optional.fast paced job.worked at the end of the line and was responsible for making sure enough was made for the order to be sent out."
good,"Poor Management, Difficult overtime coverage process, poorly staffed, and inadequate compensation for skilled jobs."
good,"great place to work"
good,"Very unprofessional place, work way to much and never have time for family. Every time they get help in there they couldn't keep it so each person was working months straight at a time without a day off since there was no coverage."
good,Enjoy the fast paced work. Great employees. Rapid advancement.
good,showed me lot on how to be a leader and team player.Ialso learned different how to interact with upper and lower management
good,"Steady company to work for.  More opportunities for advancement in the corporate offices, I would think.  Working in the plant offices makes it hard to move beyond your position.  Not a lot of creativity in growing employees."
good,"your day begins at 10pm and goes till 6am , and when the prodution crew leaves you are busy non-stop till the work is done and USDA has inspected and released your area for prodution . co-workers in most cases are there for themselves and offer little help ."
good,"This is a fast paced and very demanding place to work, the hours are long and you should expect to work 12 hours a day,6 days a week. The work/life balance does not exsist in this company.As the company moves forward it tends to eliminate positions and create new ones on a regular basis, regardless of your time or dedication to your position. People are disposable here."
good,"No room for advancement, not very clean to be a food facility"
good,"ConAgra has adopted the use of temp agencies, with the added downfall of promising the sky and being the first to sacrifice the work for the sake of financial pursuit. Moreover, there seems to be a high school like mentality for developing cliques. In this company, it truly is all about who you know, not what you know, what you contribute, or your level of dedication."
good,The company got away from the customer service aspect of business which is seriously lacking in today's workplace. A typical day used to consist of running a dedicated daily route with customer interaction. The company in 2010 made the move to pull all the routes off the road and decided to have it all delivered by semi truck to the high volume customers and forgot about the little guys needs to survive in small towns.
good,"The people were nice to work with,butt the hours & vacation/sick days could of been better. I traveled an hour and 5 mins to work every day Monday through friday..."
good,ConAgra is a good company but managers and supervisors didn't talk to each other or communicate.  I was informed by my supervisor that I was doing great and to keep up the great work which I was and prided myself on and the next day I had a meeting with the manager and she said they were downsizing for a move and that since I was the last one in to the department that I was the first one who was going to leave.  I was dismissed through no fault of my own followed by sever other Accounts Payable workers who were shown the door a short time later.
good,"This company offers decent pay compared to other jobs in this location. However, you work too many hours and required overtime. If you want to have no life, you should work here."
good,Overall the ConAgra Brands were strong where they played. Choices made in the past moved ConAgra from one of the worlds largest food producers/suppliers to a much smaller company when the proteins business was sold off.
good,"The work at ConAgra is never-ending.  I didn't realize how much stress it created until I no longer worked there.  Management comes and goes re-creating the wheel every few years."
good,things change a lot.too many rules are being implemented in expense of the employees for their benefit because they are running a company.too many people got fired and some were getting suspended.
good,"It felt like going to a club where there's a clique and people who worked hard but didn't belong to the clique would never be recognized, whereas the ones who didn't work would move ahead."
good,"The work at Lamb Weston can be tedious and a little boring.  The wages are good and the benefits are great, however the morale at Lamb Weston needs improvement.  The hardest part of the job is the training of new employees.  They always aren't properly trained and their needs to be better incentives in order to get the best out of the trainees and the trainers."
good,Being a lab tech was fun for a minute until the forced OT and the bullying took over... if your not with them your against them and that makes for a hostile work environment
good,"I was busy from the time I went in until I left."
good,"ConAgra went through a transformation that was good for shareholders but remains to be seen if it will be good for the employees. It is possible to be competitive and be good to your employees, you just need to commit to it."
good,Not a bad place to work. High management turnover poor work life balance. no job security. Easily fired with out cause work force does not speak English.
good,ive learned that even if management doesnt appreaciate or sees what you do i still have to do my job 100% to be an example to others to be able to keep their moral going.
good,"Review prior shifts paperwork each day.  I would have to do 3 rounds during a shift to review all paperwork to make sure they had the correct forms along with filling it our properly and in a timely matter.  Do daily sanitation swabbing for testing,  I also created a trainers manual for wrapper operators and did shift training sessions."
good,"Cons- company is always changing directions, every 2-3 years big changes occur, which are not well thought out.  Not a stable work environment.  The people are good, but the upper management lacking.  New CEO is horrible! The culture is not motivating.  No praise for job well done."
good,This company is trying to run all out with little to no resources.  Everything is made way more complicated than it should ever be.
good,"nice pay, poor management and advancement; cliques. Would like to have more opportunities for advancement and experiences to help us grow."
good,Factory type work hard work but good benefits and pay. Fast pace and good friends to work with. got laid-off. Went back to school.
good,"This job is very physical, lifting and stacking. I was very depressed at the time, so with having to wear earplugs for 12 hours, I mentally could not do it. Otherwise this is a great paying job."
good,Overall a good place to work.  Hard to get raises in Salary position.  Good people to work with.
good,Everyday was a quick thinking process. Had great co-workers. Upper Management acted very un-professional
good,"fast paced"
good,Basic Preop inspections including walking with USDA inspector and correcting any deficiencies found. Paperwork and basic lab tests throughout production.
good,"Typical day would consist of putting on all protective gear and organizing all needed supplies for cleanup. I learned quite a bit about cleanliness, contaminants, and some chemicals. At times it seemed supervisors lost track of some of the workers which made it harder for others to accomplish the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was at the Christmas dinner where good food was served, people danced and enjoyed time with eachother."
good,"Fast paced, driven by people dedicated to the product. Most employees are outgoing, nice, and helpful, with some brief parties celebrating various holidays and events."
good,Jobs are very hand intensive. Employee used their hands for many repetitions in a day.
good,"I learned a lot about computers, procedure, inspections and audits. My days were never boring or mundane. The standards I was used to using for product were raised with procedures in place to allow self-direction and decision making to take care of problems as they occur responsibly. I enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"The hourly rate was decent but not as high as similar companies in the area. The work/life balance was a joke. I had to work almost every weekend, and they never told you if you had to work the upcoming weekend until Friday morning, Thursday afternoon if we were lucky. It was pretty common to work between 50 to 60 hours a week. Most of the managers and supervisors would never explain what needed to be done, and would then reprimand you for not completing the tasks they didn't explain."
good,"Ppl leave their dishes in the sink,  lazy, "
good,"My time here was less than enjoyable. Were it not for my co-workers, the job would have been miserable. I would not recommend this as a place to work."
good,Working at ConAgra was an experience that taught me a lot about maneuvering and handling Forklifts in all types of spaces. Learning how to Pack and Wrap large packages.
good,"Unfortunately when the new CEO hit a lot of people became obsolete. Caring only for the bottom line you were either relocated or shown the door. Also, the culture was a bit off, took about a year before people would warm up to new hires. Really any opportunity depended on your manager, but mostly on your immediate supervisor, whether you were liked enough to be allowed progression."
good,"ConAgra was a very large company with an incredibly diverse product portfolio.  The decision to acquire Ralcorp in order to become the major player in private brand products was ill fated; many of ConAgra's branded products competed with the private brands purchased and created a cannibalization effect.  This decision was what lead ultimately to the breakup of ConAgra and concurrent corporate reorganization,"
good,ConAgra is going through a lot of changes right now.  Many long term employees are being let go due to restructuring.  A typical day starts anytime between 7 am and 8 am.  Flexible hours are possible.  Managers need to be more consistent between employees and departments.
good,A typical day at work was fun. I would get all of the shipping and receiving forms and start putting them in order in the system. I learned very good communication skills in this job. My co-workers were all men so sometimes I felt somewhat intimidated but I did not let them now. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was when a paper was miss placed that was a new adventure trying to find the miss placed order. The most enjoyable part of the day was when everything was in order neat and perfectly done great feeling.
good,"Purchases and sources assigned items, supplies and materials at favorable prices consistent with quality.  Negotiates, reviews, and approves purchase agreements.  Coworkers and cross functional teams are supportive and knowledgeable.  Hardest part of the job is ensuring I am focused and aligned with business objectives, sometimes they change fast.  I have learned to actively engage with my business partners for maximum impact and deliver results.  However, the most enjoyable part of my job is to see it projects come to fruition."
good,"Currently ConAgra is in the midst of selling so advancement is not happening and the possibility of losing ones job is everyday. I've been there for a year now and have no signs of being able to move up. They don't have a tier setting where you can advance in some fashion. Upper management is ok, not exactly the brightest but Supervisors are primarily great and easy to work with."
good,Work you so much you have no life. So rude or horrible with paychecks and paperwork its only the pay that keeps people. They hate the bosses because the bosses don't know what it is really like on the floor.
good,"-fast past & long also hot"
good,"I found Con Agra, to be average in compensation, with little to no increases.  Their benefits were top line.  They work half of the year at a 7 day schedule with little extra compensation. They manage with a poor retention rate."
good,"I work at one of the manufacturing facilities that produce Bars. We start each day out with a safety and quality snap and then move on to discuss which bar will be run for the day and if there are any issues from the previous day. This helps to make our job a little easier because we know what to expect from the previous shift and day."
good,"I loved everything I did at ConAgra and I learned so much in the 3 years I was there.  New Management wanted to weed out the salary people and bring in hourly, so I did not agree with how things were being handled.  There was no part of my job that I found hard in any way.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with and our family atmosphere."
good,Repaired all machinery in the plant. Management could not be trusted with what they said. Coworkers were nice and helpful. I always did the very best I could working 15 hr shifts 6 days a week.
good,Have good ties with fellow employees. I feel the plant is coming up from being ground zero. Has a long way to go.
good,Its an ok place to work if you like 12 hour days and not having a life other than work
good,Not much of a team effort there. Line Leaders always looking to blame others for there down falls.
good,The ConAgra Foods that I was hired by and worked at was a much different company from the ConAgra Brands of today.  Many of the employees in the Omaha area lost their jobs.  Unstable environment with Corporate office being relocated to Chicago.
good,"I met a lot of nice people working there. They gave me the tools I needed to do my job. Safety training was kind of boring, but really necessary. The culture was ok"
good,"Not a bad place to work at? Like any food processing plant, busy work and plenty of overtime! Everyone working there are friendly people, everyone is willing to help out."
good,"Was an amazing company to work for 10 years ago. Good benefits, competitive pay. Since the change in senior leadership the focus has drastically changed. Event money drives, people come second."
good,It was an okay place to work. I didn't like working in the raw meat dept.it was too cold but I know why it had to be. The packaging dept. was okay in the new building. Good management and great people for the most part to work with. They treated employees to the most part very well.
good,Overall not a bad place to work as far as the job goes. Management played favorites with employees. Co workers were fake and two faced. Lots of drama.
good,"It was a good place to work for if you're only looking to make money. While working, I worked seven days a week for 56 hours, so it was difficult to live life outside of work. It helped me make easy money, the coworkers were helpful, the jobs were tedious but easy, Management was somewhat easy to get a long with and would let you take a day off if NEEDED due to the physical work."
good,"The job was all right, but not for someone who wants to live their lives. Work and time at home was horrible, especially for night crew. It started out being 8 hours a day, but turned into to 12 hour days and no days off during the week. Not recommended at all for someone who wants to have time outside of work, even if it pays well."
good,"I have had many family members who have worked here over the years. It was a wonderful place to work, but the management and corporate greed is running the place into the ground. Great pay but not worth the stress and aggrivation."
good,"ConAgra Brands is a good place to work.  There are a lot of hours to work, but the compensation is really good.  They have a competitive benefits package and offer lots of overtime."
good,"Hard to get promoted,over worked for those that have experience.management don't know to how run the business and always running out of raw materials.employees are like family"
good,"Good experience, decent benefits. Too many open beaks! Helps to be female as well. Cause conagra all about biscuits and pancakes and duck.yeah they really into duck!!! Spellchecker haha"
good,"it was ok could have been a cleaner environment. shift was continental nights. layoffs for lower seniority happen often. the company is always being bought by somebody. it is a union facility, but the union isn't very good."
good,"The culture there is amazing. Hard to beat coming to work happy to be there, but once the new CEO took over and rumors started flying around, that all changed. I loved our small department, but once the changes started happening our whole team fell apart. I would say the company is ran like any other company its size-competitively. I don't regret my time there and will look for other opportunities to work with a company similar to this, I just strongly disliked the management and how reviews were conducted."
good,"Good teammates there we work good except for management. They are hard to figure out, keep workers in the dark until the  last minute then change there plan over."
good,Conagra foods has a clean and safe work place. The employees there a great people. The pay is pretty good for electrmecanics.
good,I experienced a lot of great opportunities at ConAgra Foods and accomplished a lot of things I never knew I could. There were some intelligent hard working people in the corporate headquarters. My experience with the employees in the manufacturing plants were also very rewarding as they were mostly very passionate at what they did. Unfortunately the experience is coming to an end as the company is looking into outsourcing IT.
good,"Good place to work at, but a lot of the same routine everyday. management was very nice but the job had no benefits at all. co-works are very easy to get along with."
good,It's has there problems. Overall it's ok. You have to know for yourself. Different people have different opinion. It's have their advantage.
good,"Temporary position. Worked 7 days a week 10 hours days. Pay was good. No benefits, no opportunity for permanent employment. Liked co-workers. Faced paced work. Small work quarters. Some job duties changed on daily basis."
good,"Working at ConAgra was factory work.  There was overtime available and that was nice.  Until the company shut down, it was steady work.  ConAgra bought the company from Carriage House.  It was at that point that morale went down.  ConAgra bought it to shut it down."
good,work with equipment operators to resolve immediate issues daily. Perform pm work orders as time permits . Submit notifications on items that need more involvement of materials or personnel.
good,"It is an okay place to work, it pays very good. But the management crew only has one mission, they don't care about employee's."
good,"the hardest part of this job is standing up for so long "
good,Opportunity for advancement is there. Future is unclear and undefined.
good,They developed people and gave persistent training. they treated their people very well.
good,"Supervised the cleaning of machines, Dealt with HAZMAT, labeled, stocked, recorded, cleaned area, and trained new employees on the standards of pennant."
good,Works at my speed as i work best with my hands and it requires alot of standing and repetitive work and during seasonal its 7days a week during the tomatoe run
good,"ConAgra is a very stressful work environment, however if you are able to handle the last minute work notifications,  then you can actually make decent money."
good,"If you are queasy about animal slaughter and subsequent carcus processing then this is definitely not the job for you."
good,"Very aggressive in the way they pursue business goals."
good,"I personally feel things could be a great deal better,,of course I think everyone may said that about their jobs..I just think management could do a lot better with the employees."
good,The company has changed significantly since I have been there. Many leadership challenges and opportunities to train their employees and put them first or at least top 3.
good,"I spend a lot of time there. I like to be able to spend more time with family. When I was hired I thought I would be in production but now I spend the first 4 to 5 hours out of 12 cleaning, its cold and wet up and down stairs. Not to kosher with that. After the cleaning there is start up, the work is not hard put it has gotten to be very cold  in the fill room. The pay is good, the benefits are okay"
good,Warehouse job that pays very good with benefits. I like the way they did help you with unforeseen circumstances happening in everyones life from time to time but there is poor management when it concerns employees not doing their job duties if you become a production lead on the floor.
good,"make sure that machines stay running during production, maintain a daily preventive maintenance schedule, communicate with production supervisor about any down time required to repair machinery"
good,8 hr days call-ins were normal and if you are the low man in the dept and everyone else wanted to go home you were made to do the OT. Learned alot about how potato plants run and behave
good,It was an assembly line atmosphere.
good,"To grow here you need to play the game, otherwise you won't advance. Each person has their own agenda. You will be judged on who you're friends with and not on your professional skills"
good,"ConAgra is still a large organization even after a major restructuring that officially began in early 2015. Today it is a much different company. But was has not changed is the competitiveness within the Retail Food Industry.  "
good,conagra  was a place of many hours of work some days when you went in you didn't know when you were going to come out it was a piece of work for every one who worked there.
good,"Not bad work, pay could have been better. If you like a fast paced job then it is good. Only other down fall is the cold, with being a packing plant. But coworkers are very nice."
good,"I was never interviewed with Conagra -- they bought my previous employer Ralcorp Holdings and we were all legacy. The company seemed to be a good place to work but their leadership made a poor decision buying Ralcorp, and the CEO was ultimately sacked and many lower echelon employees lost their jobs."
good,good company to work for. you get awesome discounts on all the consumable products that ConAgra Foods sells. i learned how to manage a department with a total team members of 18 people. the culture was ok.
good,I enjoy working at and working with the associates at Conagra.  I do not agree with some of the practices but that is to be expected in all businesses
good,I enjoyed working for ConAgra.  Both of the managers I worked for were really good for very different reasons.  My last manager taught me a lot about the business we were in where as my first manager was just a great person.
good,i really enjoyed working there until conagra took over the company. the people were really friendly and helpful. i had friends that came to work there with me and they also left due to conagra's take over.
good,There is little chance of advancement and I prefer to be challenged daily and that's something Conagra couldn't offer.  Being at this job I have obtained a huge knowledge of experience and the ability to troubleshoot.
good,"My typical day at work went well I got to learn and gain necessary work experience such as learning to operate new machines and eventually gaining a operator position. I worked very well with management and thought they worked well with all of the employees. I feel Con Agra is an amazing place to work. One of the hardest parts of my job was learning to operate the auto palletizer machine for the first time, and one of the most enjoyable parts of my job was working with the supervisors."
good,"Work hard and learn as you go. Big companies with very little room at the top . Hard to get into upper management, unless you know someone at the top. Good place for benefits."
good,It has been too long ago for me to give a review.  Lamb Weston has since spun off and by their stock price seems to be doing well.  I can not comment any further.
good,The new ConAgra brands is not a place one should seek employment. The new CEO only skill is the gut the business enough to set up business components for sale.
good,"Fast paced environment that is good for some not for everyone. However, health insurance, retirement. moving expense perks were awesome. Ability to be promoted is great as well."
good,"Fast paced environment that is good for some not for everyone. However, health insurance, retirement. moving expense perks were awesome. Ability to be promoted is great as well."
good,"I enjoyed working at ConAgra Foods, prior to the new CEO outsourcing many of the positions. I was part of the sale to TreeHouse Foods, so was spared my position; however, felt the transition of outsourcing could have been handled in a better manner"
good,Management was in the mindset of looking for any excuse to get rid of people. Now i understand why because they were planning on closing the doors. It started out being a great place to work though.
good,The management at my time of work was more focused on keeping their friends happy then creating a positive work environment and a properly producing factory. The job was easy and the peopleon the floor were easy to get along with.
good,"Good company to work for.  Unfortunatley, I got caught up in a Company reorg and the Finance Administrator hired a person from Chicago that used to work for her."
good,"Day to day operations of plant.Welingand maching, electrical repair, mechanical repair. replaced motors and trouble shooting in plant of all kinds of problems."
good,"Does pay well. Job not bad, but very demanding and a lot of cross training involved. Interesting work. Not enough people so when people out STD, call in, etc...then you have to work overtime (a lot). Made a lot of money out of overtime, but was worn out going home. They do have nice perks, but management always on edge and just trying to hang on themselves."
good,"salir a vender cumpliendo el objetivo, aprendi que tengo que estar mas de 10 hs. en campo, la gerencia es buena , los compañeros muy bien, lo, dificil no acepto que la empresa no absorve los cambios de productos caducados, el gusto debes comprar tu pantalon del uniforme."
good,was a good place when family owned and went downhill from there. No accountability for work performed or lack of work performed.Eventually that shut the doors.
good,"not to many bad days, learned all about sanitizig and cleaning food production equipment. management was great!  Hardest part of the day was 12 hr days, most enjoyable part of the day was my co workers."
good,You start your day with a shift meeting.  At the shift meeting you go over what you accomplished/struggled with and pass it on to the following shift.  There are daily goals that you work towards depending on the product you are running.  At the end of the shift you go over successes/issues/etc.
good,It was easy. At times messy but as a team we would get work dune. It was ok. If I could go back. I would work for them again. To bad. They moved the company.
good,nice place to work. pay not good but good environment. easy to get along with people.  don't have much days off.  this is a growing company and the food industry is growing as a whole
good,"I was not ann employee long enough to form any reasonable opinions on the workplace environment or that of management, only worked for one year as a seasonal worker."
good,"Learned a lot while working there. Had opportunities to make significant impact, was exposed to many challenges. The food industry is very competitive and margins are razor thin."
good,"They are very supportive and have your best interest at heart.  They work with you despite any obstacle that may arise, treat you like human beings. Always a pleasure working with them."
good,"Good place to work, with an average workload. "
good,"show up put for on safety equipment,change lines overget orders from boss.runs production runs . Break down machines, then help out other lines to finish  there production."
good,"learned how factories worked and how stuff was made. I saw how peanut butter, jams and jelly, chocolate syrup, manonaise,  was made"
good,"12 hour shifts with detailed work plan of production expectations"
good,"This company is a nice place to work, but it does not offer the benefits I was looking for. They do not review your performance as often as they should."
good,journée normal ou tout se passe bien et comme prevu et où le monde et heureux
good,"very good pay, most sections of plant are climate controlled. very clean!!"
good,Nice bunch of people to work with driving distance was great learned a lot of things there packageing cans to putting ingredients together for different products
good,"completing daily assignments staying on task and assisting with packaging operators , ordering parts and scheduling repairs around production schedule"
good,"Their were many changes over the 10 yrs, most of it good. Great opportunities to cross training in various areas of the business. Worked with many management levels on a daily basis."
good,A typical work day is that work and socialize later. Meet deadlines in a timely manner and be consistent. Also theirs a time and place for certain things use your better judgment. On time is a must.
good,It's a high paced environment with long hours and decent pay. Be prepared to get into small spaces to clean the whole machine.
good,"Lots of opportunity for experience, however learning on the job is obstructed and in silo's make a sink or swim situation as many rooted employee's fearful of sharing knowledge for their own job security/advancement during restructuring/downsizing.  Management over taxed with multiple/overload of responsibilities and less focused on effectively managing employee's.  Working more with less so opportunities are those less desired by co-workers initially.  Perks of working remote in some positions and summer hours for work life balance, although hear will be discontinued soon."
good,"Es un trabajo de campo, aprendi la venta de pruductos de abarrotes, el ambiente de trabajo es bueno ya que las personas de ventas por lo general son personas abiertas, pero hay mucho cambio de esquemas de pago, lo cual no es de mucho beneficio para el personal. Ya que cambian los insentivos, si se manejara un programa de comisiones seria mejor no solo para la empresa tambien para el trabajador vendedor. Seria lo justo. Y esto evitaria la rotacion de personal que este es demasiado frecuente. Y que trabajas para la empresa por medio de un prestador de servicio"
good,We had good and bad managers and the wagesand benefits  were pretty good. They were always rock solid on their scheduling no surprises. Great people to work with good work ethic..
good,"a typical day was long and very fast "
good,"Times have changed and no longer secure in my employment. 24 years at this production facility, have seen many changes and have been involved in many changes over the years. Hardest part of the job is not knowing from day to day if your employment will continue."
good,"my job allows me to work at my own pace and do the job how I see fit and decide the best way to get my job done in a productive way. management works good with workers getting things fixed to so I can do my job in a reasonable manner . "
good,"Did my job, rotated jobs, some where better then others. some people were shown favortisim. I didn't like 12 hour shifts. We not only had our vacation time, we also accumulated personal time off, we also got attendance points off every month, if we had any. we got to go outside on our breaks, they also let us take home some of the health food bars. Ididn't like the health care, it was to expensive."
good,"We make kid cuisine dinners, I mange and watch over teh food production line. It's very fun and interesting job. We produce about 160,000 dinners a day / per line."
good,"I add up all time for each line for time study for that line."
good,"La entrada de trabajo es a las 8 am. a la primera tienda, mi rol era de cubrir tres tiendas al dia, muy buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros, el unico inconveniente es que tu trabajo depende de mu chas personas ajenas a el, un ejemplo es que cada tienda tiene sus jefes de departamentos y varios gerentes y cada uno tiene puntos de vista y opiniones distintas y eso hace un poco dificil tu trabajo."
good,"this company has so much potential to be a great place to work, but I don't think a company this size will make significant changes"
good,"The workplace atmosphere is fast-paced. Occasionally management asked too much for what can realistically be done. The pay for the area is pretty good, as well as the benefits. Overall, a good place to work for."
good,"Enjoy my colleagues and that my responsibilities could vary on a daily basis. I've held different roles which has allowed me to achieve road experience by working across multiple departments - brand, insights, packaging, marketing, etc."
good,"I really loved my job and the people I worked with. The eleven years I worked there I acquired a lot of skills. Centerling, lubrication and sustaining improvement are some of the things I learned that I will always use. The hardest part of my job was closing process orders.My favorite part was teaching people things that helped make their job easier."
good,"Talented employees"
good,"Most people were fearful of losing their jobs as there were frequent lay-offs.  Therefore, many qualified people leave within a few years."
good,It's a food factory.  The work isn't hard just repetitive.  The machines once used to them are pretty simple and the people I work with for the most part are friendly.
good,Overall a good place to work. Would be better if there was better communication between management and hourly workers. worst part of the job is that it doesn't have much fulfillment so most people lose interest and just show up to the job for a pay check.
good,My co-worker were great people to work with and be around. The hardest part of the job was nothing really the job was fairly easy.
good,"My job at ConAgra was interesting. I did a lot of different jobs while working there. I open mail or disbursed checks on a given day "
good,"very helpful and friendly place and safe place to work."
good,"Worked Night Shift Packaging department."
good,you general work 13 days straight with 1 day off. yes it pays good but your body will pay for later. the management really doesn't give two cents about you whatever lie they might tell you.
good,"Very different environment post Ralcorp purchase.  No segment of this business is safe from lay-offs or reorganizations.  Management makes sweeping knee jerk reactions to one bad quarter instead of staying true to the course and trusting in the process to grow the private brands business.  Wide spread speculation the past year about spin offs and sales makes it very difficult to see a future with this company.  Bright side is solid benefits, lots of vacation.  Below industry average pay though offsets this."
good,"Enjoyed the team spirit of my co-workers.  When dificulties arose I found my co-workers very willing to help in resolving tough problems."
good,I come to work knowing that the people who work with me is here to work and get the job done. the management of this place is well ran. the only part is there is no suggestion input and because of that you find yourself frustrated.
good,"maintain food processing and manufacturing equipment, work with operators and coordinate with management on projects and preventive maintencance"
good,ConAgra is an okay company but in the production environment it is a 24/7 operation and that leads to a poor schedule.
good,"Big company, may learning opportunities. I can talk personally"
good,"I learned to work on old boilers, air compressors, chillers, and all other plant equipment."
good,Lots of interesting experiences and great co-workers! I have gained valuable experience in the food industry at ConAgra.
good,"The day would start with moving a large box of whole chickens from cold storage to the end of a production line. Then, those were hung on the line to be processed for packaging and shipping. When the box was empty, the process was repeated."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job were the people I was fortunate enough to work with for over 20 years
good,High paced food manufacturing environment with a lot of changes.
good,Good for newcomers...not financially or developmentally beneficial for long term employees.
good,Streamlined process and driven by numbers.  Great opportunity to wear many hats and learn how all departments operate.
good,"I manage high profile accounts, and take sales leads. A typical work day involves communicating with all internal and external parties to ensure that all products meet deadlines."
good,"I worked day shift 7 am to 3:30 pm. good management, take care for safety."
good,Location is often an issue for many commuting from the city. Lots of change in the organization currently.
good,Plenty of opportunity to learn new skills. Opportunities to move lateral but not vertical.  CEO is very supportive of work life balance and building better work culture.
good,ConAgra had an interesting business model. Missed the opportunity to see the benefit.
good,"A typical day at work would be scheduling the sanitation crew around production on a day to day basis."
good,"Inspection Union,"
good,"Recently terminated.  So I may be biased."
good,Only worked at Conagra for a short period of time but enjoyed the lab work as well as the flexible hours.
good,Multi Billion dollar company with a wealth of opportunity for younger job hunters.
good,"Average warehouse genarl labor "
good,Liked being challenged.  Learned a lot about interdepartmental and interpersonal skills
good,"Although this was a very physical 12 hour shift the stategies and abilities you can show in a work day depending how your machines ran, you could still show how hard you work pays off at the end of day when production was in the 90s and no rework left for next crew. If your line ran great being able to help each other out was a grat advantage, although managment had many ups and downs and changes our co-workers supported one another."
good,Boring and way to long of shifts. Had to work 12 hour days everyday.
good,As a group everyone gets along despite their diversity.
good,Mi funcion era levantar pedidos de las tiendas en moto hacer la lavor de venta y tratar de que todas las tiendas que visitara compraran
good,"Palletaize all ordrs in the way they came,learned how pick orders, work with good superviser and nice co workers nothing hard about the job very easy work to me."
good,This facility is going through alot of change after buying out Elan Nutrition. These changes are happening very rapidy.
good,"Conagra is a good company to gain experience and learnings.   There are opportunities where you can shadow or explore other areas.  Unfortunately, there a few opportunities to advance."
good,it was a good and bad place it is union so it was alittle different then some places but some of the management was not the best but you get through it
good,"I did payroll so there was always something to do. I was always updated on procedures. MGT was always wondering any ideas to improve performance . The culture was balanced as employees were expected to do their jobs. The hardest part of the job was the trafficparking ,and the pay. The most enjoyable part was the employees.And the stock options."
good,Very well paid job but is very stressful and working hours can get exhausting at times. Good place to advance from operator to mechanic and even at times supervisor.
good,Not much of a review to write. I enjoyed working there and then they closed. The company bought out Ripon Goods and tried to make it a world class plant. They had battles at every turn from the employees who used the union as an excuse.
good,"ConAgra Brands is a competitive paying career. Within the 8 years I have been employed with ConAgra Brands, I have learned several new job requirements that would go along with new job requirements. Management has been very helpful with new responsibilities and requirements."
good,"ConAgra food is one  of the stressful and fun place to work in the same time, its is really fast and make the time goes by quick, but sometime we get some heavy boxes that we cannot even lift that we have to use pallet jack to care them to the line assemble."
good,Worked various production and utility jobs while at ConAgra. Learned to live safety. Learned many jobs at different locations through out the facility. The hardest part of the job at ConAgra was the plant was extremely hot during the summer.
good,Very flexible work life balanced place to work. Constant change is always going on due to lot's of management movement. Training is not as strong as it was in the past. Lost lots of experienced employees over the past year.
good,Used to be excellent opportunities for learning and advancement.  New leadership regime is less focused on employees and providing best in class service to customers.  New mantra is to accept minimum standards for lower cost.
good,"I learned a lot at this job. I learned how to acquire capital by writing capital appropriation requests. Sadly this skill does not apply to a large selection of jobs. Decent company, good management."
good,"I enjoy the job that I do but there is not enough team work in the department not enough supervision. They work in cliques."
good,"At ConAgra Foods, we believe in the power of great food. Food you turn to every day, food you count on as part of your life. We make food that does more than satisfy your hunger — it actually gives you less to worry about and more to look forward to. That's what we do here at ConAgra Foods: We make great food — everyday food — in extraordinary ways."
good,"Was a good company, but new changes are coming, so no telling what that will bring as HQ is moving to Chicago.  It will be interesting to see how the company will look after August of 2016...after all the changes have been made and the dust has settled."
good,Extremely fast paced performance oriented culture.  Current state is in flux and morale is extremely low.  In the glory days this was one of the best IT shops to work for in Omaha.
good,"Clock in then breaker room for 15-20 minutes for shift meeting. Then relieve first shift of their duty to start working."
good,"I worked for the Lamb Weston division of Conagra, which is one of the largest manufacturers of frozen potato products in the world. I was in charge of contract manufacturing for their line of frozen breaded appetizer products for the food service and CPG markets. All products in this category were produced using outside sources. I managed a total of 5 companies located across the US. "
good,Overall good job. Fast paced..Learned a lot about food production.
good,"Could start on one job and end up on several by end of shift."
good,"I plan daily business in the warehouse, from how many employees needed to do the work, to what time the shift will start and how long it will run. I work with transportation to balance work loads each day and adjust volume if needed."
good,"had to clock in and work in wet conditions for 12 per day,,,didnt like the smell of the place and there were some hazardious coditions"
good,Real family friendly environment.Conduct alot of safety meetings.Job was closer to home.Meet alot of people from different cultures and religions.
good,ConAgra IT is a challenging and rewarding career. I led teams in support of processes and technology. We constantly strived to improve processes and gain efficiencies and impact the bottom line.
good,The shifts were 12 hours long with three 20 minute breaks.  The benefits included 401 k and health care insurance.   The work schedule at my particular plant was three days on and two days off .  And overtime was easily accessible and optional.
good,"Overall, ConAgra is a great place to work. It just so happens at this particular job there was no work/life balance. Had there been an effort to provide more balance, would never have left."
good,"At Conagra, work was extremely slow, but the work was easy. I would pack product into boxes. Sometimes, when work slowed down, i would make boxes and label them."
good,"move cans with forklift on pallets onto rail car, over to shipping department or load and unload into storage. fast paced environment, safe, enjoyable job."
good,"If you like to get a career in being a security officer then this company would be a great fit for you. It requires, strong, and very hard dedication."
good,I enjoyed my position at Watts Brothers for the most part.  It was an enjoyable environment to work in.  I am a very personable person so i enjoyed working with the employees and greeting the quests that would arrive. Like every workplace there were of course things that could have made the environment better.  The H.R department was kinda left in shambles wen the H.R manager left so there was alot of work that needed to be done when the new manager came in. I also was a very cross trained employee who worked helping several different departments and do not think i was compensated fairly but hey isn't that everyones complaint never enough money!!
good,"Working with USDA inspector and lab techs at start ups, starting revising paperwork from previous day, alot of support from the production colleagues.involve in alot of safety audits and supporting lab techs on the floor"
good,"While working at ConAgra Foods, I learned to work as a team. The work is at a steady pace but it was harder when working on the Gallon Line. But, I enjoyed the job."
good,"High pace work in charged of maintaining safety, quality and production goals. Worked with management to reach these goals."
good,"My daily functions included making sure the product(s) weighed what they were recommended by the FDA."
good,With the positions I have had some have been more enjoyable then others. Also more fulfilling.  I enjoy keeping my mind busy along with the physical demands that are required.  I am going from the moment my feet hit the floor till I leave for the day.  I typically work 8-10 hours a day.  Management there makes decisions that the employees don't understand.  They are not very good at communication at times.  Co workers there can either make your job enjoyable or unbearable.  The supervisor does try to work with you and place you with a partner that you enjoy their company.  Working in one place for any given time is taxing but is possible to keep a good mood when you have someone you like beside you.  The hardest part of my job at times is communication with the many different people who needs the information I have. SAP isn't the easiest program to work with. The most enjoyable part of the day is at the end when I know I have accomplished the day doing the best to my abilities.
good,Very exiting to interact with different cultures and provide quality service and products to our loyal customers. Enjoying the use of different languages.
good,good place to work. too many hours. i was working 70 hours a week. i got called in almost on a nightly basis to troubleshoot more complex problems.
good,"While change was definitely needed, the new direction at CAG has changed the morale of employees.  I did however learn a lot and enjoy my time there.  ConAgra's are the most helpful co-workers, willing to collaborate and share.  The culture is also extremely family friendly."
good,Great company overall. Management does need impovement. Working over night was the hardest part of my job because of ministry and family. I most enjoyed the excellent benfefits.
good,ConAgra Foods is a very large organization that offers employees many opportunities for advancement.  They take pride in managing employees for success.
good,"ConAgra took over the previous company at the beginning of the year. A huge change in culture was needed to perform up to conagra's standards. Nine months later, the culture had not changed much. There was definite progress, but not what you should see with a huge empire like conagra. The company takes care of you in terms of benefits, but you leave everyday with a headache."

good,"Typical day involves much business analytics for sales opportunties; extensive collaboration with all functions, including finance, brands, management, category leadership, supply chain and demand planning; insightful business and budget planning; and intensive planning with the customer."
good,Over all great benefits and safety and attendance bonuses. they just dont like to give ex-employees second chances.
good,"It was a great experience , working for their company. It was a temp job. So I am sadden that there was not a permanent position for me to apply for. The drive was a little far."
good,ConAgra offers an appealing environment because it's relevant and trendy. They offered the opportunity to work remotely and still accountable for your work. They cared about their employees and attempted to boost morale through various employee engagement groups. They developed and trained their employees on when new platforms or systems were rolled out.
good,There is always a lot of overtime whether you want it or not.  Be prepared to give up your social life.  However you are paid very well for your time.
good,"Cleaned building floors by sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, or vacuuming them.Gathered and empty trash. "
good,"Easy work with not a lot of creative opportunity. All designs are farmed out to design firms for initial creative concepts. I edited many and retouched a lot of photography."
good,It's very hard work.Heavy lifting and working ovens and big heavy pots for mixing.  Co-workers good. Rotating shift not good. Temp. Service so if people not shoe have to work.
good,Management is open and willing to share their knowledge.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new and exciting things.  The hardest part currently is learning to work with others in another country.
good,Checked product for any defects of any kind quality processes and issues to look for friendly co-workers clean up and jams in the lines
good,"Fun to work with cowokers.Management more worried about numbers.There was alot  of variety in what i did each day,ranging from monotonus task to differnt projects."

good,"It is a descent place to work, but I have been there a long time, and it is time to move on. There are no visible chances for me there for advancement."
good,"Was in charge of 22 people..made pizza dough crust for mama rosas pizza for sale and shipping through out the state of ohio.I did shipping and recieving of the product also,Made sure my employers were safe and worked hard and did thier job effeientally with no injuries we were a team and we all pithched in as a team to male the best product for shipping."
good,I believe overall the company was a good place to work but not much room for advancement. Even if you went for a different speciality the pay is not much more than you already make. It was very hard to plan things on a daily base because you could be forced up to 30 minutes before your shift ends if production goals were not met. this could be for 30 hours up to 2 hours.
good,"if you like working, its a good place to work you can get a lot of overtime if wanted. The down part of the job is the forced over time. the management is as normal as it gets. It is a good environment to work in and they will make any employee feel welcome,"
good,"Standing in one area packeging snacks, and working on assembly line. The hardest part of the job was standing in 1 spot the entire shift, the best part about it is that the job payed pretty well."
good,"Learned a lot as this was my first warehouse job I had ever had.  The company was good, work was pretty straight-forward and routine.  Some odd jobs every so often."
good,"Too many workdays. The plant is older and because the plant runs constantly, it is falling apart. Not a place to stay forever."
good,"very fast enviroment to work in, ive learned how to manage people and be better organized.management is very awesome there, my supervisor lets me work and is not always on top of me. My coworkers are very hard workers and worked for there families. Hardest part of my job is loosing good people. the most enjoyable is having saturday and sunday off."
good,I worked in the marketing department so it was pretty fast paced. Edina office closed
good,People are awesome...and its laid back. The jobs themselves are very easy...and simple. It's cold in some areas. You just need to dress appropriate for the area your in.
good,"ConAgra was a great place to work overall. Great work life balance, great at work perks, mostly helpful people etc. but it really depended on which group you were a part of and the management in each group."
good,learned various fields from recieveing to making products to the shipping end
good,"Hard work production. Safety, data entry, and team work. Management was challenging at times. Trying to make production.     When the line made production."
good,maintaing production while meeting company expectaions and quality.
good,I have learned from transferring from different plant that there is a lot of confusion on different procedures. There is a lot of favoritism and racist activity going on. Management has their picks as well. When team members go through the chain of command instead of issuing discipline to both they only do one. They refer to them as the assets to the company. So they cater to them and offer special favors. I have been with them for 2 years and transferred  from my home plant where I have worked for 16 years and I would not recommend the Kent facility for a place to work
good,"Must be detail oriented, paperwork for food requires it."
good,ConAgra was a company that was always focused on the bottom line.  I enjoyed working at ConAgra most years.  People were fun and we all shared in the successes & failures.  It was like a family.
good,"At ConAgra you would work 10-12 hour days, 7 days a week with 2 days off a MONTH. You do not have a home life. Then they come in and told us that they are  taking our jobs to a different facility. Therefore 300+ people would be without jobs...."
good,Many accounts you would take out the outdated product and put new product in and leave that stop making nothing and spent over an hour doing the servicing.
good,"I have experience in QA, Production leader ship, leading production employees on the line. "
good,"No language requirements"
good,The Work/Life Balance is difficult at ConAgra Foods because they have trouble scheduling your weekend shifts until the friday before saturday.
good,I learned how to communicate with people and make quick and good decision to help the company.
good,"A typical day consisted of doing corn crosses, gathering data. Coworkers were kind and easy to get along with. Hardest part was being outside nearly every day in the sun."
good,"Job is very self explanatory once you get the routine of it down. The employees try to work together as a team to ensure that everybody gets a fair amount of breaks, and other employees will always step in to help if there is a problem with one of the lines  go down, so all the product can be checked and ensure that it meets quality standards."
good,"While working for Conagra I was able to wear many hats. I scanned, filed, sent & received mail. Was the part time receptionist which allowed me to interact with Customers, Administration and other employees. The management always had an open door which made employees feel like family."
good,"Did a combination of Transportation Accounting and IT work, DB Admin, SAP, BI, BO, Oracle, and more"
good,Nice job.I dont approve of the job moving out of town. Alot of workers got played out of money. I felt sorry for people who had worked there 15 or 20 yrs and it was retirement time for them. I felt it hit them the hardest.
good,I would still be working for this company but it wasn't meant for me. They are hiring again but I have tried but I don't think they want me back so I have to move on.
good,Conagra is a good place to work with an employee company store that is awesome. I enjoy working here but I would like to find something that pays good and is closer to my home
good,"I did not work for ""ConAgra Brands"" I worked for ""ConAgra Foods"".  Found my job to be very interesting, loved the fast pace. Every team oriented.....most team members were awesome...then of course the few bad apples!"
good,When I started in 2004 this was a great company to work for. It was a progressive and exciting place to work. This changed when the CEO decided to buy some companies that did not fit well in our portfolio and business plan. No one from upper management ever bothered to consult with their employees on the front lines as to how these new acquisitions would fit in. The result was chaos and disruption of our business that eventually led to the departure of the CEO and a take over by Janus Investments that demanded cuts in workforce that transitioned my position to a consultant in New Jersey.
good,"I've enjoyed driving a truck. I have drove other trucks as well, but I increased my driving experience here by learning to maneuver a larger trailer. It was enjoyable."
good,"Could be better in some areas"
good,Good pay and benefits make it difficult to leave. However culture and care for their employees should be questioned.
good,"ConAgra Foods compensation, benefits, and other areas were very good. However the corporate culture was one of reactive, knee jerk actions based on short term results and numbers. "
good,Getting the store ready for the day. Getting employees there positions. Dealing with the money and inventory. Making sure the coustomers were happy and had the right food.
good,"sweep and mopped floors, drove forklift, and worked with cleaning chemicals. "
good,"Operated bleach and dewaxing processes,monitored control room.Learned the cooking oil making process.Management was satisfactory,put alot of emphasis on safety.Plant was unionized so you really couldnt get the feel of your cowrkers."
good,"Great place to work, lots of overtime if you want it. Always being trained, great pay. Never have to worry about being fired. Supervisor are the greatest people here."
good,Be prepared to work lots of overtime. Other than that a good place to work. Pay was good and jobs were easy once learned. It's a factor so expect very hot conditions.
good,"I worked at ConAgra Food from 2001 to 2006.  I started in HR and then moved to support the VP of R&D.  Until late 2005, it was an amazing place to work and I worked for a wonderful manager. "
good,"Great pay"
good,Tuff place to work and feel good about what you are doing.  It is difficult to navigate the political waters and no one has a feeling of job security.
good,Working for Con Agra provides full time hours and benefits. I learned safety procedures. Management held all authority. The hardest part of the job was the physical responsibilities.
good,Be able to feel like you are a part of a team and respected for the same. leadership interaction and development is the key to a team culture
good,Started at 5:00am and ended at 8 - 9pm. Learned organizational skills. Management and coworkers wered are team oriented which made for a good working environment. The hardest part of the jonb was the commute to work was 1 hour. The easiest part of the job was being part of the team.
good,I would be on the production floor waiting on machine b reak downs or troubles. I learn to be flexable to work without supervision and with different personality types.
good,"Conagra Brands restructured, moved head quarters to Chicaco, and outsourced our division.  I liked working for the company and would still be there if the business was not outsourced."
good,"A typical day at work involved developing packaging design and graphics for a number of company related projects. I learned about different tolerances for printing while working on offset and litho project as well as coupons, pallet signs and other p.o.p materials for the company. Management wasn't bad, but they were responsible for outsourcing all of our department jobs and laying us all off. I have never recovered in my field as a result because a lot of the skills I learned were non-transferrable. Our department would not allow each other to fail. We seldom made a mistake. The workplace culture was pretty fun, the hardest part was the workload could vary from day to day. I remember having had as many as 20-25 projects on my plate at one time with marketing breathing down my neck about who's project was more important. I don't miss this facet of the job in the least. Corporate wanted your soul, and they would often time bribe you for it by offering sport tickets to a game for example. I remember putting in a 7am - 11pm day once just to crank a project out on time. That's just not right. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other graphic artists who were passionate about their craft. We were all doing something we loved. Compensation was based somewhere between what a production artist and a graphic artist would make, so in that respect, we were not paid what we should have been making."
good,60+ hour work weeks most weeks and never get off on time...sometimes worked 3-4 hrs over. Had monthly meetings where outstanding team members were recognized and received gifts for their hard work
good,Its a great place if youre strictly about your money. It doesn't really have a work/ home balance youre always there 12 hour shifts and manditory over time based on senority so just now starting out youll be placed to stay for sure
good,Working with card board boxes all day is difficult work. Also they could never really promise just when you'll get off the clock which is difficult if you don't drive.
good,A fun place to work even with high production standards and expectations.  Good working environment.  Maintained high quality standards.  too bad the plant closed.
good,they had closed there doors but other than that is was an ok place to work everyone was good to work with boss helped as well when needed everyone stayed possitive
good,"Nice working experience and a lovely envaroment working condition ,"
good,"Had to work there for many years before any advancement opportunity. Many people were grouped together and difficult to get along with, afraid for their position."
good,"I met very nice people.  The residents were enjoyable to work around, and I became friends with several.  The relationships formed were great and helped the day go by fast."
good,"Good, year round job with nice pay and benefits. Lots of opportunity of overtime which is time and a half and all the french fries you can eat.  It does get hot during the summer."
good,If I was on a machine I set down at my assigned machine and worked it until break then we rotate until the day is over. When I was in the warehouse I was stacking boxes on skids or putting deplays in boxes then putting the boxes on the skids until the order was filled.
good,Conagra has great pay and good benefits. The work is not overly difficult and even though it is a factory there is not a lot of jobs where you stand in one place doing the same job.
good,Very fast paced. You will be taught how to clean multiple machines. You will have diffident cleaning duties everyday. I liked the work place just could no longer work third shift.
good,"I loved working with ConAgra and was proud to be a part of their team. Coworkers made it fun.  I am a casualty of the move to Chicago and dismantling of the companies many brands."
good,Family type work atmosphere. Learning opportunities available and advancement. Management and co-workers easy to work with on a daily basis. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"The company is a good company good medical benefits good job.  The people are great to work with, very fast pace but easy going job."
good,"Hard work was rewarded with overtime when available .Learned different machines ( grinders, mixers,Smoke house ovens etc. ) Worked in cold ( stuffing room )& hot (smoke house ) areas .sometimes in the same day .Most enjoyable part was customizing my take home pay."
good,A typical day at work would include working a ten hour shift which I would work alone the first two hours until my warehouse associates would start.  I would pull the line and assist other departments getting them what they needed during the first two hours.  The balance of my day included loading and unloading trucks and pulling the line when needed.  The hardest part of any given work day would be the slow days.  I enjoyed all aspects of my job duties.
good,Heavy work load on daily basis. Good group of people working there. Out date machinery is a problem at times. Very hot to work in the summer. Very high QC standards
good,"I had an awesome team of co-workers, that were always willing to help and we never met a goal that was set for us.  Good place to work."
good,"Good company to work for, you definitely have to be a hard worker! great benefits, some of the supervisors weren't very helpful with showing the new comers the ropes."
good,"los horarios son muy extenuantes, la carga de trabajo era mucha ya que en la parte de administracion solo 3 personas eramos los que haciamos todo, desde preparar cargas, recibir preventas, recibir liquidacion de efectivo. etc."
good,"ConAgra Foods is a friendly working environment. Working there, I have learned to further develop my organizational skills. Being a, mostly, independent environment, I learned to organize my time well to ensure the continuation of production. the management are insistent on rules and expect us to follow those rules, regardless they are more of a laissez faire type of leaders. Co workers are always there willing to help whenever help is needed. the hardest part of the job would be lifting over 20 kilograms of flour bags when mixing a batch."
good,I enjoy working with people and my excellent management skills have allowed me to build a very strong team.  Most my day is overseeing activities regarding mail / shipping and warehouse activity.
good,"ConAgra is a large company with many finance and accounting functions.  Individuals have the ability to move around to the various departments in order to get a wide knowledge base or they can stay in one department and become a subject matter expert.  Choice is yours!  The company is large enough that it hits on all areas of finance and accounting, from Taxes to Financial Planning.  Good benefits, good pay, and great people."
good,A pretty good work environment to work on a daily basis. Great benefits and pretty good employees. Not enought paid holidays per year.
good,"I was offered opportunities to enhance my skills.  I was able to work alone or with others, which allowed me to be self-motivated or work as a team."
good,upper management lacks loyalty has no problem just moving on from employees.  Great place to work hate to see it shut down
good,It has been a largely pleasant experience working for ConAgra. They have been good to me personally though recently I have had some issues with their policies.
good,I was able to move up quick in this company. I learned how to deal with stressful events. With this being a union facility I also learned how to deal with the Union.
good,"A team oriented company with many departments, however, if any assistance was needed from others, people were always willing to help out.  Management was fair and understanding  in their treatment of employees which resulted in a productive workforce."
good,Lot of opportunity for extra hours. Good higher management. Do not hire people quickly enough or frequently enough causing a lot of strain on teams.
good,There were 10 hour shifts at the plant. Four days on and three off. There was also opportunity for overtime available. There were extreme temperature environments that you had to adjust to. I could go from 32 degree temperature into 100+ degree temperatures in the same minute because of the meat product we worked with. So if you are bundled up for the cold and have to go to the warmer temp environment it can be very uncomfortable. Most of the folks were easy to work with. But I think that the extreme temperatures caused some employees to be more irritable than they would probably normally be. Management usually stayed away and allowed the Team Leads to handle the floor supervision. Supervisors only did a walk through. I would say the hardest part was adjusting to the environment change. I enjoyed being able to work without someone micro-managing my every move.
good,The pay and benefits was very strong. Opportunities were a plentiful. But there was room for improvement from management and the way the company handled inter company hires.
good,Very hard working culture where all employees are expected to contribute and hold their own on projects.  Cross functional matrix sometimes causes unnecessary complexity.
good,"Working at ConAgra, it was hard, because I ran into a few safety problems and it was not fixed. I also found bugs in some of the food and no one followed the procedures that were required to sanitize the line afterwards."
good,"Not a Jeans and sneakers work place, but definitely well organized and stable company. This company is headquartered in Omaha Nebraska."
good,I've enjoyed the people that I have worked with through the years and have learned a lot through the training that the company has provided me.
good,"Start of my day would consist of setting of the lab the consumers test tasting. Checking inventory, communicating with the food scientist regarding products. Recruiting new taste testing via phone."
good,it was an great experience . no work & life living if have small kids & no seority
good,"Diversified hardworking and loyal work force producing high quality food manufacturing facility with a key focus on safety.  Learned OSHA and GMP compliance and the employees were the most enjoyable part of the day!  Co-workers appreciating each other's skill set to accomplish daily tasks, goals, or current projects at hand.  Hardest part of the job was being to real."
good,"Not a bad company to work for, there were some headaches but decent overall."
good,"great place to work. great location, decent pay, normal hours"
good,"ConAgra has been a great opportunity to learn how to manage a matrix organization and to balance the opportunities and challenges presented by the brands and customers.  Keeping everyone, including the customer, on task and working towards the goals was rewarding."
good,"I would clean pasta mixer; water, soap, scrub, rinse, and sanitize at a food production factory.  I learned what working at a factory was like and that particular job wasn't for me The coworkers where cold hearted, the management was just ok."
good,"I cover the entire country for the natural channel. I am in the field 70% of the time calling on customers, distributors, working with my broker organization and doing market visits. "
good,i enjoy working for Conagra. I am looking to grow my career. Currently i have no more room for growth at this facility.
good,"Decent place for starting job. No incentives, or raises, non-competitive wages. A typical day, is spent in an office and on manufacturing floor, with repetitive tasks. Management is easy to communicate with. Virtually no opportunity for growth. Co-workers easy to get along with."
good,"Working with FDA on site, pulling samples for QA, assigned as a lead on 2nd shift. I have learned how to install and place together different sized augers, I have learned about the lock out tag out process, and have trained in several different process modes. At this plant we made Slim Jims. So there were different stations where the various types of Slim Jims were made. The experience received in working with these many machines were excellent. Even though the operation was automated the fulfillment of the task still needed physical hands on inorder to complete the task. As a team, every night we had the challenge of meeting our goals and completing breakdowns for a sanitization team to come in and sanitize all equipment used in making products. Hardest part of the job is playing catch up from down time. The most enjoyable part is the various training session we received inorder to fulfill and overcome any road blocks."
good,I work 12 hours nights in a team enviroment loading trailers and running palletizers I get along with fellow workers and like to keep busy and help out
good,Hires solid hardworking individuals for this fast pace manufacturing company.
good,I would start by tearing my dinner line down and letting sanitation clean it then put it back together for 1st shift. I learned how the industrial maintenance field works. hardest part of this job was all the different work orders on top of maintaining your dinner line. Pay was the best part of the job
good,"ConAgra is a very nice company to work for. If you have and questions or need help, someone is always there for you. I've learned to strive for the best and work my hardest. Keep pushing through no matter what. The hardest part of my job is the physical work but it is worth it in the end."
good,I lead a team in the mixing bowl and i was reasonable for the daily quailty and paper work in making product
good,"Reviewed invoices and input in for payment."
good,I had more training and professional development at Hunt-Wesson and ConAgra than anywhere prior or since. 
good,"Responsible for all accounting activities for Milton, PA, and Sylvester, GA production plants.  Directly managed ~ 15 employees, including accounting supervisors."
good,"conagra foods paid good enough but the hours were brutal.  3am-3pm shifts.  As well as dealing with extreme heat.  While unloading dozens of boxes upwards of 30 plus pounds, it was also 100 plus degrees."
good,This is a research opportunity provided through the college and it allowed me to get hands on experience seeing a project from beginning to end.
good,The company was great until new management took over. It only took three years and the company pulled out. Many people lost their jobs.
good,"Went to work, did my job, got off of work. Working in Sanitation you always come home soaking wet from the pressure washers."
good,"Overall a good place to work, with excellent benefits and pay for this area. Also some good perks to the job as well. 12 hr shifts did kind of put a damper on family time, but when you made it to your 3 or 4 day off week it somewhat evened out. The people who worked there were definatley the most enjoyable part of the job, as they were like a second family"
good,"I enjoyed working here. I worked in two labs on premises. The lab near production floor, I would run simple tests on food products. In main lab, I would run analytical tests using NMR, AA and GC/MS."
good,"sanitation at night , 1st 2nd shifts production"

good,Long hours and the pay was well. I worked from 11pm-7am 12 days on two days off for five years. I was required to attempt to receive an Associates Degree to be able to further my advancement in the company.

good,"Not to bad to work at. people are ok, bad management. (some team leaders)"
good,My overall experience for 16 years was a very positive one and a very professional one. I now have had the opportunity to compare it with 2 other companies .  I am grateful for the time I've had with them.
good,"I found worklife to be stressful, management is constantly over your shoulder. On the other hand they will throw a great Christmas Party for employees. Pay is moderate to low and raises are not often."
good,"Pay and benefits were good.  Culture lacking a bit, most people working there for the money, otherwise disengaged from company .  Segmented duties and strong safety program.  Weak HR services."
good,"good coworkers and nice supervisors, long hours make the workdays difficult. Repetitive tasks with very little chance for ascendence in the company make it very hard to recommend this business to a friend or family member."
good,"solid company to work for, fast paced environment helps the time fly by. lots of overtime, you can be required to work a 13 on 1 off schedule. discount store."
good,this somehow came up as a position. i enjoyed working at company xyz even though this is not a real position and it is only to please the indeed algorithms.
good,"This Company has a lot to offer if you can deal with the way Management wants to run it, There are good days and bad days, as with any Company or life in general, I have learned a lot of great things in this Company, I've learned that I am a strong willed Employee with great work ethics and willing to learn anything from working on the line to running it. The hardest part of this job is to deal with machinery that doesn't run properly and it doesn't get fixed right. I love this job and enjoy working with great people with all sorts of attitudes and different personalities, gives me a great challenge every day!!"
good,"Sanitized bathrooms, showers and locker rooms."
good,worked on complicated interfaces however it was interesting and fun.  learned new systems and given projects to take full initiative on.  fun place to work and people are very nice
good,I personally had a very fun position thus I loved it and also made good friends. However I also heard negative issue with other co workers that they do not enjoy CAG as much
good,Working at ConAgra I learned that is can be tough to find the resources necessary to complete my job. The organization of the company needs work since there are multiple copies of files and no one knows which is the correct one to use.
good,good to work for. They have good benefits with excellent retirement plan. Good people to work with with lots of different diverse culture to keep the job interesting.
good,"Nice management they help when they can, Learn something new everyday. Lots of different and exciting people. The hardest part can be the fast paced environment if your not used to it but everyone is there to help you learn as long as your willing"

good,"Setting up, maintaining and operating machinery. Ensuring interminable and efficient running of production. making sure  that you are reliable and able to work with attention to detail and safety standards. Ensuring that production procedures are carried on smoothly to maximize efficiency and profits..."
good,Loved my job!   I enjoyed what I did and worked for several years doing different types of work.  The culture has changed somewhat.
good,"My time at Conagara was a great learning experience, I took every opportunity to learn new production aspects. My daily routine varied through out the years there, as new positions opened and my seniority grew, allowing me greater job options. The hardest part of a production job is the repetitiveness, and how to stay focused on the same task for hours on end, I found singing in my head to be effective. I formed many lasting friendships with my co-workers that I maintain to this day. I was greatly saddened with the news of Conagara closure."
good,There was no typical day at my work.  It was an evolving role that required extensive travel and  relationship building with customers. I had great co-workers and except for the long hours the job was challenging and satisfying.
good,"packed,stacked, inspected products. trained new employees and ran box machine.  most coworkers were friendly some not so much.  the hours are long whick was tough but the overtime pay was good. the pay over all is very good"
good,"I really enjoyed ConAgra foods before the new CEO.  I feel like he only cares about money and nothing else.  It used to be a learning environment where everyone was engaged in the process to assist the business in supporting and creating applications that worked for them.  I worked in the IT space which wasn't treated as well as the business counterparts but still...it was a good job.  I learned a lot.  I'm sad that I have to come out here to look for jobs but that's life.  You never know!  :-)  Good luck out there on the career hunt.  We all need it, right?"
good,"ConAgra Foods has been a great place to work.  Overall, no complaints.  We are now under a new CEO who subscribes to the 'lean' work place.  Many changes are taking place which could affect the Enterprise Learning training department.  The majority of the changes/lay offs will take place by end of September.  "
good,company is slowing down a bit but always work to be done. pay is competitive and plenty of overtime. plenty of good people to work with.
good,"A typical day is like arriving to a fire every morning as we work to change the safety culture. The management team works hard to accomplish the goals of corporate with some support but not in all areas. My co-workers are a great group of individuals with our own agenda to prove that we can be a valuable part of the corporation. I have learned that even if it is the right thing to do, you may not be supported so you should not fight battles you will not win. The hardest part of the job is knowing that no matter how many hours you put in and how hard you work there is no more compensation for your efforts. When acquired we were not given the same salaries as the rest of the platform and are struggling to be paid evenly with our peers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the difference one can make within the facility to make life better for one another and how we have managed to become a very close functioning team despite the challenges."
good,"Bad health care plans and no low deductible higher premium plans for those with expensive medications, but offset somewhat by good 401k contributions by the company.  Management doesn't seem to have a good grasp on processes of those lower than them."
good,Management is nice and support your outside life as much as possible
good,Good place to work. Good family/work balance. Management goals at times confusing. The re-org has been difficult but I think the company will come out stronger on the other side.

Unfortunately lots of hard working people with much time at the company were displaced, but at the end of the day the company has a responsibility to its shareholders."
good,"I am employed by Acosta, Dedicated Rep for Con Agra. It has been a positive experience.  My contact person at Con Agra was great to work for and my supervisor from Acosta was also very nice to work for.  My days vary.. I usually  visit 3 to 4 stores a day.

Might better if then management is no longer there."

good,"It was a good place to work because you could train others on your team and it wasn't frowned upon.  The upper management was horrible in that they would cuss and yell no matter if we had any control of ""the numbers"".  We kept watch over our teams and did well together.  Too bad they decided to restructure and blew the morale and plan that lots of people had worked hard on for years.  It went downhill fast."

Keep up with your checks and make sure all product going thru your area is how it should be as far as the right weight, good quality and not damaged in any way.  Management when I worked there was much more professional at that time. Most of the people you worked with were pretty decent and usually willing to help and teach when you needed them too.  Your job kept you busy and as long as you done it correctly you usually did not have a problem out of anyone."

good,I enjoyed working here for the most part. I was able to excel at what I had to do. I was always getting compliments on my abilities. The only problem I had was the management gets uptight and overreacts to the smallest stuff. Co workers are pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was staying calm when machines malfunctioned and work had to be stopped. The most enjoyable part was meeting quota

good,Offers good training and okay pay. Union environment so some people work while others find something to complain about and do as little as possible.
good,"ConAgra is a large corporation always looking to trim the bottom line.  They are know for closing smaller plants and distributing the products made to other larger facilities.  Job security therefor is always up in the air.  Benefits are great, 401K could be better matched and with such a huge company profit sharing would be nice but does not exist.  Tuition reimbursement if you are looking to further your education.  Good work environment created by the employees but ConAgra is more focused on bottom line then employees."
good,Stacked boxes at a fast rate as they came of the line. Management very willing to work with you any way they could. All my coworkers were great. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast line. The most enjoyable part of the job was the cooperation of my co workers

good,My time at ConAgra has been well spent but I need more time with my family the 13 on 1 off schedule isn't mixing well with my trying to have a personal life
good,Many changes going on to reach aggressive goals for the next 3 years
good,Most workers at Con Agra are more than happy to walk you through work and teach you what you need to know for your job because they understand the importance of team work and ultimately we all have the same goal: to make the company thrive. 
good,"Typical day would be working on payroll, review general ledger accounts, working with HR or upper management on current projects"
good,I believe if you should work here if you are right out of college. Good programs for the young.
good,A typical day at work consisted of starting out with a meeting to discuss issues from the previously shift and always included discussions about safety and safety concerns.

good,excellent place to grow your career. they give opportunities to people to get into the food industry. Would recommend to anyone looking to break into the food industry
good,Workdays were slow paced and cross training paid a large part in reducing stress levels due to the ability to help each other as needed.  Management was responsive to our needs and provided all needed equipment and skills.  The most enjoyable for me was making it happen for customers when they did not expect it.
good,this is a very productive environment and sometimes long hours. It is sort of over crowded at the time but everyone works to get the job done. The most enjoyable part is that everyone gets along more than against each other
good,I don't believe these sales positions still exist. It was a geat place to initially start and learn about sales. The pay wan't great but it wan't tough either.

good,"a typical day at conagara food consist of Completing paperwork checking the inventory,mixing spices and seasons to create flavors"

good,"ConAgra is a great environment to learn and grow not only as an employee, but as a team.  The team atmosphere is really great, and it is highly emphasized, which has proved beneficial as long as you are willing to put in the work, hold yourself accountable and lend a hand to fellow peers. The idea of being ""one"" is strongly encouraged; you succeed or fail as one company.  I really enjoy this attitude and believe it is a great model to have for any company who strives to be the best in their particular industry.  Stability has been an issue the last 3 years, and some acquisitions were questionable, leaving a lot of people questioning management and the direction of the company.  Advancement overall is a challenge in IT, as an employee, for the most part is locked into a position for 1-3 years before promotion.  With advancement being an issue, the stability in question (Primarily due to a new CEO taking over), ConAgra seems to be on the verge of drastically changing.  Benefits and the people are great, but ConAgra seems to be a shell of what it used to be just 5 years ago."
good,"The people are very smart, the responsibilities are highly challenging.   The training for employees is excellent. The downside is most of the food products are in declining categories so it is very stressful."

good,"Coming into ConAgra with the skills that I felt would be a plus to this company. I came in with a teachable spirit, which at the end made me one of the best operators they had; If the plant had not exploded I would be there today. A typical today was meeting production demands but safety came FIRST, it was our number one goal to work safely.

The management as a whole does not care about the employees just production, even though they say that the employee are number one on the list.

good,I have worked at ConAgra foods for 17 years I love the challenge of learning new things for production and cost saving.  The only negative thing I could say about ConAgra plant in Kent Wa is that they do not apply accountability and do their Team Leaders review in a timely fashion

Management they treat you good as long as you treat them good and do your job and not sitting around not doing your job.

good,"if you show up, do your job, and don't look for petty things to complain about, there are no problems. its a food production plant. as a sanitation and sterilization specialist, it isn't meant to be a ""glamour job"", but it is a job with plenty of good people, in an atmosphere where you find the good in what you can. you will get out of it, what you put into it. I learned a lot of new skills, each machine has an order in which to be cleaned, and some cleaners cannot be used on some of the machines. Also, the management may have some communication delays, but if you stick with it, and/or bring it up to the other members of management also and make sure they are aware of what Is going on, everything will work out. The rest of the sanitation and sterilization staff  is broken down by department area, so not everyone knows everyone necessarily, which may be the hardest part of the job. especially if you get to work with a group from a different area on overtime one weekend.  the most enjoyable part of the job was learning something new, always having something to do, even if it was something random, and different, and being able to count on others to help you if you needed it."
good,My day would start off getting in uniform  and seeing the next shift go out look at schedule and see what machine I'm operating and who's going to be on my line or if I'm going to be on the line and on someone else's line. Management I wasn't to crazy about but they were ok the rules were ok some jobs act like your in a prison this one didn't. Hardest part of the job staying up 12 hrs. and standing up 12 hrs.
