bad,"American axle is a complete joke 1) the Human Resources Do Not do their job at all. Instead a outside company that gives you the run around does "
bad,"Corporate level is the headquarter of unqualified, irresponsible, phony BULLIES. Company suffers from poor productivity, lack motivation , morale, poor communication and the creation/spread of gossip. AAM is filled with Engineers who are completely void of extensive skill or knowledge in any Engineering discipline."
bad,"After 3.5 years here they ruined my life. "
bad,"This company gives you almost no days off. They do not respect their employees. They do not give resources  to let the operators do their job, correctly. They also do not care if your pay is incorrect. All they are worried about is bodies."
bad,"Management doesn't care about it's workers what-so-ever. Be prepared to run a 2 person job by yourself for days, weeks, months, maybe years, at a time without a single thanks from management. For your first year you will have 0 vacation days. Non-safe work environments are encouraged whenever production is behind."
bad,The best way to word it is “everyone is here for a reason”. Once you pass the hair test they don’t do random drug tests or they’d lose 90% of the employees. Both shifts are an open opportunity for both dope heads & illegal Mexicans
bad,It was a decent experience i just wished I had more time to work there. But overall I had a nice time and I enjoyed the employees that I worked with and everyone was nice
bad,"Aweful place to work."
bad,"The group that came in with me will Broad and merely to boost production we are paid an hourly rate of $14.35 and the other workers who were established in there for years hated  us because they thought we were there to take the jobs . Once we were let go, they tried to bring us back to cross the picket lines after their full-time benefit workers going on strike. I chose not to go back and cross any picket lines and thankfully for me I had another job by the time they called me back"
bad,"The union does'nt represent you, there's no back bone, upper management and supervisors do what they want and how they want. Violating union rules against the employees without any justice. It is all about numbers if you don't work really hard then you will be chop liver."
bad,"they didn't give any consideration to all of my previous experience."
bad,Horrible management. Unfair treatment for minorities. Company lacks culture and benefits are bad. Don't bother working here unless you are a coop and need experience.
bad,One sad places to work  bad management  nasty place to be at over time for worth’s work supervisor don’t plant management he a dump  planet management  he never work job to know
bad,"no me agrado su forma de trabajar de los jefes, hay mucho favoritismo e injusticias con los operadores."
bad,era bueno hasta que te ensenan los colores que tienen
bad,hard work underpaid and the management doesn't care if you get hurt. I was injured and they refused me medical treatment until after my shift because my injury wasn't life threatening.
bad,"Had to work 7 days a week for most of the year.  One saturday off for every 2 worked, but when in critical status which is most of the time no sundays can be taken off. Workers are treated poorly and overworked. Supervisors harass employees."
bad,Was a temp there and was placed on a line that had many steps to it and a lot of lifting.  I had no idea that I would get very little support fro the regular workers. The forklift drivers fly around the floor at very high speeds.  Way too much walking and it takes ten min to get to the work station. I don't recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Bad place to work the bosses are bad at there jobs the job is terrible the union is spineless and the shop flooor is always dirty. The place is just terrible
bad,"Most departments work 10 to 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week, due to covering for other shifts and excessive downtime of the machines. Alot of bad parts."
bad,The site I worked at no longer exist. The company closed the Holbrook facility after forcing employees to take a $20 an hour pay cut. All I know about the current company is that the pay isn't very good and the benefits they they once gave employees is no longer available.
bad,They draw you in with promise of a decent wage. Then when you start you get little to no training in your job. They change the time you start at whim. The insurance is awful and the place is dirty. Do not come to work here it may have been good thirty years ago but it’s not now.
bad,"No medical for 9 months ,miss 3 days a year your fired even with dr note. . They promise a increase in pay but youll never get it. ."
bad,"The only place i know of that fires you for being in the hospital for a week and having paperwork to back it up. They dont care about the employee, its all about the $.  Management is a complete joke its real cut throat."
bad,"This company is not American Axle. It is a company of American Axle. They do not have a union, you work 6-7 days a week. The people who train you have no experience. They make a lot of promises but don't follow through. They have a very high turn over rate"
bad,Breaks were plentiful but overall this was a terrible place to work. They'll fire you if you get sick and they don't understand that your personal life is important.
bad,It was nice doing something different.  I had four different managers in the two years I worked there.  Some were good and supportive while the others were not.  One of them avoided conflict by avoiding employees and when cornered would just tell them what they wanted to hear.  So many people came and went in the short time I was there.  No job security at all!
bad,"manager will do whatever he wants and we also didn't get an appraisal for 1 whole year, they will ask you to sign a bond of 2 years for a 1-month trip"
bad,"There is absolutely no future in working at American Axle Manufacturing. There is no work / home life balance. And it doesn't matter how much money you make, you never have a day off to spend any! They work everyone 7 days a week 8 and 10 hour shifts. For weeks at a time!"
bad,"They'll tell what ever you need to hear to pacify you.  They’ll hide behind the veil of “policy” for their decision.  Management is not accountable, they take short cuts to train. Like it when you’re flexible.  They will not be flexible with you, lie to your face, no growth.  Great for short term, or better yet!  Go for orientation for the free pizza on the first day of training"
bad,"If you dont mind being lied to"
bad,"All they care about is money, plants is closing and working every one in the ground till it closes. Running equipment in the ground, employees are getting tired and worried about some one getting hurt."
bad,"They don't care about their employees enough to pay them what they are worth, they simply don't want you to have a life and get screwed over if you decide to be slightly different"
bad,If you expect to have any life dont work here. As a supervisor I wasn't  authorized overtime and was expected to work 72 to 84 hrs every week. My associates I supervised got overtime. The lowest paid associates made more money than I did. We all got treated like utter garbage. Bullied harrassed and your 20 years of knowledge and training meant nothing to Managment at Biscoe. They never understood how to talk to you just at you.
bad,"Poor leadership . Employees not properly trained but blamed for everything. Shifts sabotage others shift to look better. Management cares more about number of parts then quality. Management hides scrap to look better then other shifts. HR makes up things as they go along, point system not realistic when working 7 days a week."
bad,"All work and no time for family.. Lying managers. When American Axle took control of the facility, The HR manager quit, the controller quit, and my boss,quality control who had been there over twenty years quit. Many hourly employees quit, me included."
bad,"The company is a joke. They go through managers like you change your underwear. There is No training for any position, you have to learn your job on your own. They never give a good review because their policy is to give you a average review and then never give you a raise. They promote managers that have no idea what they are doing. If your a friend of upper management you have a job or get promoted, everyone else looses. The company uses you then for no reason at all let's you go. No raises,ever and over work you for their benefit."
bad,If you like being back stabbed and lied too and bad management and bad leadership and no career advancement its the place to work and only get raises enough to cover insurance and a good point is you get free boats
bad,They treat temps like dirt. Low pay. Only 1 other job opportunity. Management fights between each other. HR is clueless. Training is suspect at best.  Selfish environment
bad,Working for this company sucked. Management sucked. Benefits sucked. Underpaid. Health insurance was cheap. Consistently being laid off. Higher management sucked.
bad,"This is an absolutely horrible place to work. Management wants desperately to win recognition as a ""best place to work,"" but it just isn't. Management is self-obsessed. The new CEO is concerned about himself - trying to build a legacy that he hasn't earned. The former CEO, his father, is just sitting around to protect his son and taking a king's ransom for doing it. The CEO appoints his friends and others that he likes to key positions, and many have little or no experiene with them. Morale is low, there is no direction, no focus, no discipline, and no feeling of teamwork. Management treats employees like property, and discards when and how they wish. The only thing the company had been known for - manufacturing - has been abandoned and they have many launch problems and delays. And the only business they have that makes them any money is GM trucks, and that stop being profitable when GM forces price decreases on successor business."
bad,There are no reviews there and you have to beg if you want a raise but they will just act like you didn’t ask! It’s a joke! I’ve never had to beg for a raise anywhere I’ve worked in my career.
bad,"Work culture was horrible, cut throat enviroment.  I would not recommend. Managment does not care about "
bad,"Low pay, no advancement. Management is a buddy system. Not in the click won't be around for long. Starting wage is low. Takes 8 years to max out at 17$ insurance ok not great."
bad,"I was hired into the Fort Wayne AAM/Accugear plant as a ""tool room tech"", which I'm qualified for. Sadly, as is so often the case, management, to include the plant mamager, did not have a clue about CNC machining, and the resources myself and another employee needed to do our jons. Worse, the 4 people in the tool room were doing the work of 12+ people. "
bad,Management was never around and when they was around they would just yell at you we would put out more cores then we needed to for the day and at end of day they would start nitpicking about everything to slow us down so we wouldn't meet our quota to many chiefs. Move you around about every 2 hours so you don't get to get used to a job and then yell at you and you're not doing it right cuz he don't know what you're doing because nobody trained one supervisor will come through and tell you to do something this way then another supervisor will come through and telling you do it wrong to do it their way and then employees will be trying to be the supervisor needless to say it's like a circus
bad,"I am currently here as a temporary employee, and have only been here for two weeks. This company uses three different staffing services because they can't keep employees in the door very long, and there's some very strong reasons as to why."
bad,Management sucks there. They treat you terribly. I've unfortunately wasted 6 years of my life there with nothing but mistreatment. They work you so hard & treat you like trash in return. If I could give negative stars I would
bad,"Expected to work 7 days per week 10hr days. No advance warning on changing hours. Management has no clue what they are doing, gets yelled at by corp. and employees."
bad,I have never left a job at the end of the work day as dirty and covered in black dust as I did working here. It was horrible I would blow my nose and it was just black Stuff from breathing the air in there for 8 hours. That can’t be healthy for anyone. Human resource woman is a idiot and has a attitude as though she is better than everyone else and lies about the job when she interviews you. Supervision wants to act as a warden constantly watching everyone.  No actually training was ever done horrible horrible place.
bad,"The only positive of this job was the pay! "
bad,After doing everything required of me for years - including working 12-hour shifts - I was fired without warning by my arrogant boss. This company does not care about its employees.
bad,"Management is a joke. They are young, inexperienced, unrealistic on 2nd and 3rd shift. Some departments have a mandatory 7 day work week. They often do not have parts to assemble. Often times the parts they do have are bad and are used anyway. The 10 hour orientation I was given was NOTHING like the actual place I worked. The hourly people are awesome. The pay is too low for some of the jobs that you are required to do. They have a prison mentality on how they treat their hourly employees. I did 7 weeks and I quit."
bad,The atmosphere at AAM is horrible. It is a high tension place and hard to get along with others. If you have a family they will take advantage of that. They expect you to work 7 day a week but only force you to work 6 days a week twice a month. Wages aren't the worst but also not the best. People at grocery stores make almost the same we do with less drama. Management makes it hard to work there. They constantly instating new rules taking away your rights almost every other week. Workers there are always on the edge due to stress of the facility. The hardest part of the job is walking in knowing what all you have to deal with and keep a positive attitude. They mess up paychecks too often and have no concern of family issues. I would only recommend this place as a last resort.
bad,No job security and poor management practices. Never any positive feedback or encouragement from management. Seemed to not care at all about workers.
bad,Got layed off due to gm strike day 98 of 100 day probation. Went out and found other employment immediately. Was recalled on a Tuesday afternoon 5 weeks later and was told to report the next day wendsday 6:30 am. I called back made arrangements with the supervisor that made recall call to be in on following Monday so as to not just drop my new employer. On my first day back on that monday they said I was released for violating attendance policy.
bad,"Absolutely no place for a family man or woman to work. They have zero home life/ work life balance... As long as upper managment gets their days off, they dont take the employees into consideration whatsoever. You are just a number to them and it shows."
bad,"Company claims to be a happy family, but its a toxic and dysfunctional family at best. Staffing is an issue that is solved with mandatory overtime in some departments. Management is best described as ""Too many chiefs and not enough Indians""."
bad,Very hostile work atmosphere. Management is top heavy and don't care much about retaining engineering talent. Co-workers are insecure and hostile. Supervisors are insecure and they set you up for failure.
bad,"really poor work environment and really bad management that don't care about thier employees they just care about themselves, and they underpaying the employees that's been there for a long time and don't appreciate nothing, also I was out on medical and because my fmla wasn't approved they let me go. also when they made record breaking profits they don't give you  in profit sharing, and you don't have paid sick leave they make you use your vacation for sick leave"
bad,"Very bad management for my team. My manager bullied me daily and finally I got laid off. As you can image that they prefer layoff on January just because they don't want to pay you penny for any compensation and annual bonus after over full year service there. my paycheck just account for my last day. What they really toast for lay off person due to unacceptable of ''mediocre"". My manager is a very bad guys, very arrogant but stupid. and trust me never working for our team."
bad,"Unless you’re a female or a brown noser, management treats new employees like a piece of dirt. Co workers were very helpful and friendly. Union shop but the union is useless. Management does what it wants regardless of what the contract says."
bad,"If you enjoy seeing your family, this is not the place for you. If you plan to become pregnant and keep your job without hassle, don’t do it. They claim to be equal employment opportunities and that they do not discriminate but that’s a lie. They will do what they can to get rid of pregnant women. The HR department does not know what they are doing or talking about. They’re a joke."
bad,"No technical competence and no value for the knowledge again thru experience"
bad,"I started at this position with the hopes of advancing one day, but the second week on the job I found out they were closing our plant. From then I had days of little to no work and was given the cold shoulder by management and many of the employment along side of me."
bad,"Bluffton facility: turned over plant management."
bad,"Lots of problems but GM avoids discussing them. Communication overall is poor.  If attempting to address them or make change, he tunes out... you're better off having a conversation with the wall."
bad,Used to feel like a family in there until bought out by American Axle. Now all management wants is a scared workforce. They are egotistical and moronic in their ways. Amazing that a company with American in its name could mistreat its employees with much seniority the way they do.
bad,Supervision repeatably lied straight to my face about how processes and procedures needed to take place. Basically no support at all from supervision except negative deficiency reports even after asking for procedural guidance on the very same topic. Culture is one of rule by fear and intimidation. HR threatened to discipline me because my supervisor was not handling issues in a manner they saw efficient. No way to protect yourself even with documentation that you tried address procedural processes before the issue arouse and received no response from multiple levels of supervision. Turn over rate speaks for itself. If you make it more then six months your a senior employee.
bad,"This is not a good company to work for. You are treated as just another body in the facility only used to produce the specific parts of that department. The company does not care about you or your specific circumstances that occur in your work life and outside life. They only care about one thing and that is production which is related directly to money. Thats all they care about. Management is extremely unorganized and it shows throughout the plant. Pay related to work is unfair. For the work being done you should be paid more considering the amount of money the company makes off of their employees backs any way. They are an unappreciative, uncaring, and an overall bad business to work for."
bad,"Lost job due to a misunderstanding. Tried getting it back. Got things set up, they told me to leave right after I got there. Nobody would answer my emails as to why I had to go ahead and borrow money to start up a bank account and everything for it. Some of us are broke af. Anyway, I was under the impression that the interview was just a formality. Mind you i had my work history on the application and they told me that I would be a good fit. But because of my work history i literally got told to leave and that I would have a hard time finding work. So rude. They're too good for me but they can't keep employees. Hilarious."
bad,As a current employee at American Axle I would say that it's a terrible workplace. The management and Human Resources is terrible. There is poor communication between management and the employees. They don't care about a balance between work and home life. It's all about numbers. The benefits and pay are about the only positive things about working here. The union has no backbone and lets management do whatever they want. There is no representation by the union for the employees. I would not recommend working here.
bad,Management is bad.   HR has no clue what goes on but how to fire people for stupid reasons.  Company gives forklift drives no respect for them to do their job safety with management and Maintence parking in the way or walking right in front of them.  Shocked more people haven't got hurt.
bad,boring monotonous work. mandatory overtime. lazy co-workers who have been there so long they are untouchable. very much a slow union don't work hard attitude.  not for me.
bad,I worked 2nd shift. 10 hours a day 6 days a week for almost a year and a half.
bad,"It was a great place to work, but recent management changes have greatly increased the stress levels in the plant.  If it's not making them money, they don't care. The machine broke down? You should have fixed it faster. You have an illness or family issue, too bad for you. That doesn't make them money.  The turn over in the front office for the last few years has been just absurd.  The culture that is prevailing now, is one of backstabbing to make one self look better than a fellow worker, in the eyes of the upper management. All the good mechanical and quality engineers, have left, or do not stay because of the toxic work environment.  They post open job positions, for jobs that are currently filled by salaried employees, and hang that over their heads."
bad,"i worked second shift supervisor is very cool and laid back expects you to do your work just like every other supervisor. co-workers were very nice and helped a lot. management was very bad HR is a nightmare always tried my hardest to not go any where near there. Love to micromanage, and ultimately do not care about your well being. A co-worker severed his pinky almost all the way off and was gone for three weeks and wasn't 100% ready to come back but they were pressuring him and when he got back they let him know how much money that he had cost them for getting hurt . Many people quit here all the time so expect o work lots of weekends including Sunday. Most the time will let you know you have to work over the last ten minutes before your shift ends. if you need a job for a little while to keep you a float then then this is a job for you but not a long time career job they make it impossible for you to get a simple raise. i do not recommend working  here."
bad,"good pay , no job security, somedays at this job was very stressful, it was hard to get restroom breaks."
bad,I spend day in and day out trying to advance and get a better job title it took them 8 months to finally see my worth. It was the most miserable 8 months I spend at a company. They do not care about there employees needs or mental health. They only care about the work. They do not work with you on stuff out of your control. Was probably the absolute worst place I worked at. I only stayed because I need the money. If your thinking about working here I would suggest you look at other options.
bad,"Dont bother with this place there is higher paying jobs with less drama.  "
bad,"Plant closed and moved to Mexico, not much job security there although they say buy American to keep our jobs here in the USA where is the union now when you need it"
bad,"Learned a lot about the extrusion process, which didn't know this was part of the process of making car axles."
bad,"It was a good job with great benefits. Unfortunately, the now deceased CEO wanted to move the plant to low wage/ non-Union countries. I would've retired from there but that wasn't in the cards."
bad,"American Axle and Manufacturing, dominates your life.  Management typically asks people to work 10 and 12 hours shifts as well as working weekends including double time on Sundays.  A few times a year work slows down and layoffs are handed out on a seniority basis.  Break areas are minimal and usually are located next to department machinery.  The plant is union and the union causes as many problems as they prevent.  They are always hiring because no one wants to stay.  It takes 17 years to get to top pay and recent efforts by the company have attempted to take away the free health, vision, and dental insurance, which is the only good thing about working here."
bad,Work culture was not good. Management was more dominating. Salary benefits were not so good. There was no parity. More discrimination.
bad,"●Management was horrible, they for sure had their favorites."
bad,"AAM used to be a great place to work.  People cared about their job and each other. They cared if you family member died.  In the last year new management has taken over after a huge acquisition and the culture has changed. Many people have left or moved on.  The ones left have a don't care attitude.  New hires make more money and are offered more vacation time than legacy employees.  Their priorities have changed from caring if people are happy to just letting people go and adding the work to those left behind with no additional compensation."
bad,"managment played favorites and i gave the company 15yrs and its like they could have cared less.The company was out for one thin and that was too get rid of as many high paid people and hire people at the lowest wage they could pay.So they can make huge profits,and put money back in the big mans pockey"
bad,"No......just no. Managed horribly. They expect you to give up your home life and be there everyday. They hound you over every minute of the day, don't fix any problems and expect the world from you."
bad,"Very basic job, exactly what you'd expect for a manufacturing plant. I'm sure it's better if you are salaried/ or just not working on the line in general but if you are a general assembly worker I would recommend saving for school and getting out of there as quickly as possible. There's no job security."
bad,The place wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for management. There are plenty of poor decisions being done which keeps the shop 7 days a week and a huge disconnect between them and the people on the floor. They preach team work but the supervisors push for cut throat actions between shifts by hounding people for their numbers game.
bad,"Typical workday isn't typical, lots of OT.  This is a 6-7 day a week job with 10 hour days not being unusual.   Management only cares about numbers and not about quality.  IMO most aren't qualified to be managers.  There are a lot of good workers there, but a lot of ppl got in that shouldn't be.  When wages were low they would hire anyone.  Now that they raised wages, they expect more with less people."
bad,You are just a number here . The quality processes are lacking . No bonuses . Health benefits are god awful . They do all the work here by the Seat of their pants . Hourly wage is average. For a place that makes so much money you would think they would invest in new machinery and their employees
bad,In the interview process the manager informed me that I would get ever Saturday and Sunday off and the whole week of Christmas off. When production picked up it was mandatory to work every Saturday and the week of Christmas only getting Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off. The only reason I quit was because management was considering us to work mandatory sundays every other week
bad,"mangers knows it all, dont try to help or give any ideas, they dont wont to hear you all we hear is we just fire everyone and hire more who wont to work we wont to work we aso wont to be respicted treat all persens like dirt that can be replaced anytime they wont alway make work hours different wont more and more no rest very bad mangement at this place hr is worst ever tells us we listan but never do nothing be carfull work here not good"
bad,It's not a hard job. Very laid back and easy. No room for advancement unless you are buddy buddy with someone. Will disown you in a heart beat. Treated badly and poorly. and if not a builder or upper management you mean nothing to them. Not valued or appreciated
bad,The pay isn't too bad. But you only get yearly raises and not every year. Management don't care about anything but rate. They say safety is their top priority but it isnt. The workplace is dirty. I could go on and on. It's just not a very good place to work unless you want the pay.
bad,"Supervised production & Crew, repair & diagnose product and machine issues, keep track of and make sure chemistry for iron was in range tolerance for optimal quality. Fill in other positions when needed, Being a very knowledgeable and skilled worker only makes them demand more from you with no regard of your family life, raises are rare, regardless of performance, most employees don't care to put in full effort which leaves the more dedicated workers drained form having to do multiple peoples jobs and not even get any extra notice of it, management is horrible, they care about quantity over quality, good solid workers get pushed out for lower paid less skilled workers."
bad,"I thought that working for a reputable company as such would be a better experience. I was moved more than 7 times in a six month time span, form 2 shift to 3 shift (vice versa) several times. Was not given proper job instructions. Had maybe 30 seconds of direction before thrown into a new job. The only good experience that came out of this company is the relationships i built with co-workers....because of the many discussions we had about how bad the company was treating its workers. Would NEVER work for this company again"
bad,Bosses and union did nothing to help associates out would not be returning
bad,There is no regard for employee personal life in coordination with work life.  The hours are long and work is monotonous.  People are treated as idiots and any ideas suggestions they may have are ignored.
bad,"Too much of coworkers hitting on flirting with and sleeping with each other not enough training given to the supervisor who are suppose to know w"
bad,so stuck in the past it's not even funny.  they claim they are trying to revamp and change that but the commitment from the top is not evident.
bad,While AAM pays for our insurance the pay is very low and management and laborers working together is non existant I do however like my coworkers and working with a close nit group
bad,No value is placed on the hourly workers.  This is an issue that has filtered down from headquarters to plant management and from there down to the hourly employees.   You are constantly threatened to be punished for just having to use the bathroom.  This is COMPLETELY  UNACCEPTABLE!  Nobody should have to feel guilty or fear being punished just because they have a full bladder.
bad,"They will tell you something it wont happen. Management had no clue what was going on half the time. Everything seemed to be guess work. Unprofessional management couple of managers talking negative about employees sexual orientation, race, etc"
bad,"Overall pretty good place to work, only problem i had there was they didnt wanna hire me due to not having a high school diploma or equivalent and i actually got let go because of it, and i really liked it there."
bad,It's been 20 years since I have work there I don't even know if they are still open. Made good money when I was working there. Management was bad. As usual upper management don't know their job.
bad,"you work 9-10 hours weekday and 8-12 hours on weekends. you get one weekend off a month and management has no sympathy if you need a weekend off. horrible work environment, unhealthy and will kill you over time. the only good part was the pay and benefits."
bad,I worked there for 3 years making axles for GM and  Chrysler management sucks there company going down hill they can’t keep no one out there working u get tired of work 7 days straight fir months
bad,days consist of standing for majority of your shift 7-8 ours lifting machine parts anywhere from 20 to 100 pounds (with machine assistance) no air conditioning in areas temperatures can reach 100 degrees or more
bad,"Large company with a ""Job Shop"" mentality. "
bad,decent place to work if you have no family or social life. lots of mandated overtime. union sucks and doesn't represent you properly.. your just a number there
bad,I didn't mind working here.  I enjoyed the people but it was a long drive for me and gas prices were very high at the time I was working here.
bad,"Pouca valorização do funcionario."
bad,long hours low pay 7 days a week bad management great employes hardest part is standing for 10 to 11 hours the most enjoyable part is going home to my family
bad,"The overall job is not bad if you are ok with manual labor. The benefits also make the job worth it. However, management is disrespectful and disregards associates. Although it’s a union shop, the union also does very little for associates regardless of seniority which is what being in the union is about. Great for temporary work but wouldn’t recommend it for long term."
bad,I have worked for this company for many years and have watched the management become more and more disorganized.  They are now at a point where they will resort to bullying tactics to try to get their numbers.  All they seem to care about any more is numbers.  Its become quite a  toxic work place.
bad,Your experience depends on who you work for and who you work with. The work is easy to learn but dirty. The pay is decent for the area. Start out is the highest in town.
bad,"American Axle is a fast pace factory. For the most part it's not a bad job. There are difficulties but every job has problems."
bad,They are running their production people in to the ground.  Work 19 days straight with two days off (every 3rd weekend).  The pay is good but they wear their people out with the work schedule.
bad,"Bring em in, Burn em out. "
bad,"Long shift hours with short breaks, the scheduling is also poor lots of times we find out we have to work extra days or weekend at the end of the week and no vacation is approved."
bad,"Typical day is to run multiple machines to complete assembly of RDM's.  Management is not very caring, as long as they get their numbers then they are happy.  Management looks to write people up in order to control them.  Co-workers are very friendly and hardworking for the most part.  Hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day.  Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to run multiple machines."
bad,Manager pick on worker. No personal life. Everybody start on 2nd shift and it's pain to change shifts. No training. You must learn as you go. Would not reccomend to my worst enemy
bad,Great company until 2 years ago. Seems to be on a downward spiral. Everyone leaving as soon as they find a place to go. Cutting jobs and piling it on who is still there.
bad,"UAW union shop, plenty of training, good tooling VERY loud & VERY HOT!  A great plant to learn trade,  No place for sissy's, a real hard working man's plant!"
bad,estuve mucho tiempo ahí por que tenían buenas prestaciones
bad,"Overall nice people during work environment. Underpaying for monotonous, and sometimes overworking schedule. Any factory around the area will be unenjoyable and boring. But this positon is top of the ladder.  Don't work in factories."
bad,"It wasn't enough work for an 8 hour day, we use to sit around doing nothing or create work every day for a few months until they let me go along with some other co workers."
bad,A lot of to work on. A lot of safety hazards plus not a lot of safety going on. OSHA would close it down in 5 minutes just walking inside the Melting Department.
bad,"You work with old broken down machinery that is held together with band aids. Never the less it is on you to make parts that pass quality checks. Management is good on first, or second shift. The team leader on 3rd shift is immature and has anger issues. constantly having a tantrum and throwing things. The only way you make good money is by working 60+ hours which is what everyone there is required  to do because they cant keep any new hire over 2 weeks."
bad,"The Money was very good during my time working there,If not for the Money I would have left before I started.Management was awful due to many changes with different Manager's every other Month."
bad,The compensation was excellent but the culture was very stressful
bad,There is no union to protect you from the things you may encounter. You are more than underpaid because of the strenuous work limits they put you through. Favoritism plays a huge role in this facility.
bad,I learned so much about car parts that i did not know before. For example that it is not all one piece for the axles. Management could have been a little more well put together.
bad,Bad management  they have favoritism in the work place and working a lot of hours. Other then management it’s a good place to work in and great team leader
good,At American axle I was there almost 4 years i know alot there and how to control the out come of the product when forging wasnt perfect. We're piece rate paid  and had to make 1000 or more parts to make any money. I left because there closing
good,I worked at AAM for 3 years and the management had gone down hill once all the Puertoricans came to town.. not all of them were useless but the ones in management sucked.. they would treat the local employees that have been there for years like garbage and then over work all of them..
good,Los valores de la empresa son maravillosos pero no hay compromiso de Gerencia para implementarlos a la practica de la misma.Hay gran potencial y valor humano para lograrlo.
good,Requirement of  a 6 day work week that makes it hard to balance life and work.  The ability to learn and pick things up quickly is a plus in this facility.  I have had the ability to learn quickly and have projects handed off to me to work on and lead myself.  I the year that I have worked at the Brewton Foundry we have not had a Quality manager.  The culture here thinks that quantity is better than quality.  The hardest part of the job is stressing the importance of quality to the culture here.  However the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I am constantly busy and able to have something to work on.
good,Buena Empresa con buenas oportunidades y beneficios
good,"falta de estabilidade para os funcionarios"
good,There is good job security because of the company name. As far as company progression goes there is very little in ways of advancement.
good,"Very busy, very intense, must be multiple task oriented and enjoy overtime"
good,"Shop floor personnel the best. Helpful, productive, always willing to work to get the job done and fun working with them!"
good,"American Axle is an ok place to work if you want to spend the rest of your life on second shift. But you cannot get hired in unless you tell them that you can work all 3 shifts, and they use that excuse that you said you could when you need to change shifts and you can't.  Employees are pushed hard, often short handed and still expected to hit the same numbers as fully staffed.  Lots of safety issues.  Union is a joke, no enforcement with contract.  HR is also a joke, only open maybe 3 days a week maybe 8 hours on those days, and are no help.  HR constantly looses paperwork. HR is a window so no one to really talk to or a secretary for them. You can get as much or as little overtime as you want. Benefits are ok."
good,"- Too much of work"
good,"I worked for American Axle for 15 years. I chose to take a buy out in 2008 because I hurt so badly from the constant work pace and heavy lifting. I had ruptured a disk in my back at work and the plant doctor had told me for 2 months that there was nothing wrong with me and it was all in my head. My doctor took an MRI and I was on an operating table in 4 days. The money at the time was nice but not worth my health. They don't care about you and yes you are just a number, they will lie to you, use fear tactics to rule and practice discrimination  and no body says a word about it. The UAW is very weak and they will lie to you too."
good,"I have worked in automotive production for 14+ yrs. I have been at American Axle for almost 2 years and I am ready to quit. I work in a fast paced position where the work we do never seems enough to management. No one is held accountable for their jobs. Management is always wanting more and they expect you to work 6 and 7 days aweek, 10, 12 sometimes 16 hour days. If your sick or kids are sick: you better have a plan and still come to work."
good,Managements blame games take priority instead of implementing corrective actions and continuous improvement. They force overtime continuously to deal with the mismanagement.
good,"-Poor management ,"
good,I would still be at American Axle if I did not have some health issues that stood in the way of my employment. My supervisor tried to help but there was only so much he could do.
good,all around the best supervisors I've ever had. amazing coworkers. pay sucked when I was there. CEO is a greedy P.O.S. But was a fun union job. union sucked but coworkers and supervisors and coordinators were awesome
good,"Although I am appreciative of working 17yrs for American Axle, I feel"
good,"Decent place to work. People were awesome but the management could use some work. Lunches sucked cause you get no time barely. We had (2) 10 minute breaks with a 20 minute lunch. Management made sure you only get 20 minutes. Union job so don't expect much if you're new. People with seniority get treated way better. If the plant is in critical expect to work 19 days straight just to get 1 day off. Union Rule is you must work 2 Saturdays in a row to ensure you get the 3rd one off. No paid vacation days provided unless you've worked there a year. Pay was decent at 16/hr. Saturdays you get paid time and a half. If you work Sundays, it's double time."
good,"good place to work for but they will work you 24/7 365 if you let them "
good,"Falta de herramientas, falta de refacciones, falta de tiempos para realizar los planes de mantenimiento."
good,"If you didn't mind working 6-7 days a week you could make really good money and advance your career.  Seemed like if you weren't ok with working Saturdays and Sundays, you weren't cut out for this company.  If you want to raise a family, then somewhere else might be better suited. If you have nothing better to to do (young college grads!), working tons of hours and gaining lots of experience is great."
good,"American Axle & Manufacturing (planta SMF) es una buena empresa, como todos los trabajos existen cosas buenas y malas, en la parte buena hay seguro medico de gastos mayores (que es muy bueno), buen sueldo, vacaciones, en general hay buenas prestaciones, en el ámbito laboral, cultural y administrativo aun existen muchas áreas de oportunidad,"
good,I learned a lot from this position. I value the training and the relationships that I gained here. the overall environment was less than desirable due to the graphite in the air and everywhere.
good,"Being employed at this location has been a difficult struggle for the past two years. With a Union there that doesn't protect the good workers, and management that does not handle the poor workers, you find yourself working harder for no extra benefit. "
good,"great place to be a part of at one time ..until the stockmarket took over ,,and the greed filled in.. rest in peace big D. its a shame a forging plant that was in buffalo that help win the WW II is now gone. alot of lives that place supported. to bad  corp. greed took over"
good,"Empresa muito instável, mudanças constantes na gerência e diretoria, rotatividade de funcionários muito grande."
good,"Empresa com a produçao sempre alta .Sempre prescisa aprimorar o conhecimento para superar os problemas diarios e ter muito profissionalismo.Gerencia sempre comunicativa,incentivadora.Parte ruim horas extras de domingo a domngo.Parte boa boa amizade com os colegas"
good,"En el tiempo que preste servicios y ami experiencia laboran en ella."
good,Started there a year ago in July. Like working there. Got laid off because of the GM Strike. Supposed to be called back when the strike is over. Nice place to work.
good,"I have worked at American Axle for 9 years. I have witnessed the ups and downs first hand. Fast paced manufacturing facility. Management does a poor job of managing their business. Regularly run out of materials needed to get the job done. Always in a rush to get product out the door which causes mistakes to happen. Without the Union, management would work ""associates"" 12 hours a day sometimes 7 days a week. Most of the people are friendly but some still live for high school drama. HR spends majority of their time trying to get people in trouble instead of trying to fill open positions. Workforce is always shorthanded. New plant manager has cutback overtime and seems to value time you can spend with your family. Some days it feels like a ""world class"" facility, other times it seems like a three-ring circus."
good,AAM is closing their Remington Indiana plant in 2019. I've enjoyed working at AAM Remington for the last 17 years. Unfortunately they have decided to close the plant.
good,Buena oferta de trabajo aunado a la competencia que se le distingue
good,"I worked in the engineering department as a intern.  I assisted launch engineers in the implementation of a program by machining prototype components, making required documentation, and fixing line issues."
good,"Safety issues were my concern. Several times when I was the material handler, people would not honk or anything to alert oncoming traffic. I worked my butt off and frankly did not understand why i got let go as a temp."
good,"I worked about a month at AHM (Auburn Hills Manufacturing) which is a part of AAM. It's like a sister-company, so don't misunderstand it."
good,My particular location seems to never want to hire more people or buy new equipment. They just work 6-7 days a week to make up production shortcomings. Other locations may be different.
good,management was terrible. no one has any idea what is going 90% of the time. there isn't any team work at all. they care more about the floor then you're safety and well being.
good,"Es una empresa muy fuerte en el Bajío, tiene muy buenas prestaciones, me ayudo a mejorar mi liderazgo con el personal, sin embargo a nivel gerencial hay muchos puestos y los mandos medios tienen muchos jefes y generalmente las indicaciones se contraponen al criterio del gerente"
good,"work culture is not so good , but besides that a best learning opportunity  for engineers ,management is good , co-workers are hard worker , and hardest part of job is that you hardly get leave due to workload."
good,"poor leadership skill starting at the top. There is no need for ops reviews every 2 weeks. Also, when there is a walk through everyone is trying to jump through hoops to make everything presentable. The employer cares more about the floors than the safety of the personnel working there."
good,"Area de desarrollo en lineas de ensamble y maquinados en diferentes tipos de maquinas, herramientas, insertos para cortes especificos."
good,"Empresa com metodologia e cobranças baseadas na política americana, porém com estrutura nacional, oferecendo equipamentos e programas ultrapassados aliados a ambientes mal estruturados, o programa gerencial da empresa é o Oracle, porem nenhum colaborador tem formação no programa o que dificulta a sua utilização."
good,I enjoyed working at this company for many years. They offer great opportunities for travel. But the long hours (10-14hr days) and not being able to take time off (weekends were mostly required) were too much. Management is not what it used to be. They used to be able to see the big picture and hold the RIGHT people accountable. Now it appears they don't know what they are doing and just doing things they Think they should do. They hold the wrong people accountable which do nothing to solve the root cause of problems.
good,If you have thick skin and can work 7days a week for months on end it's a great place to work.
good,A typical day at AAM is not typical; everyday is different and present a set of circumstances that can be challenging to any manager of a 400 plus employee environment.
good,A lot of standing. I got a lot of assistance from others who knew the machines I was working on. My supervisor was easy-going and helpful to me and the other employees.
good,"Show up to work on time, keep to yourself, and do your job, and you should be ok. Others tend to stab you in the back to get in front if they feel their job is threatened by you."
good,"Former Simpsons plant, now AAM. You can make a decent living working here. Union workforce. Overall, a ok place to work. Work force is divided. Half are in the company's back pocket.  Other half stand with the union. Extreme favoritism exists between managers and some employees. Honestly, I would not work here without being union."
good,"AAM es una empresa grande la cual te apoya en lo económico y tiene muy buenas prestaciones, pero el equilibrio de la vida privada/laboral es una mentira, a todo tiempo te hablan siendo la madrugada, fines de semana y muchos gerentes te quieren mínimo 12 horas diarias y cuestiones el porque sales temprano y debe quedase por cualquier cosa que salga... La estabilidad depende que si en una visita del corporativo estaba sucia una puerta o no.. Sus gerencias no dan  apoyo tratan de defender su puesto mas no su equipo de trabajo"
good,"American Axle is a very busy and fast paced job with plenty of different job opportunities. Unfortunately the management is less than impressive and can hinder a persons ability to want to go to work. "
good,"demanda mucho tiempo, el sistema no ayuda en la tareas diarias, horario de trabajo pesado todos entras 6am"
good,Very high paced alot of working hours might be 7 days a week 12 hour shifts but pays good does have benefits when hired in also does a hair follicle test
good,Bad management. Supposed to be family oriented. Work you so much you don't have quality time with family unless you work salary. Hourly employees work their butts off. Like the work. Some fast paced. Good benefits
good,"-Lots of pressure to produce cost savings on poor initial designs."
good,"It is a great company however, they have had three different lay-offs since January.  No job security.          jlkjlkjlkjljk;ljkl;j;j;j;jl;jljljl;jl;jl;jl;"
good,"In my life it is best organization I have enjoyed my time at this company and I work with creative idea's. I done many mistakes but I learn from them and work with team,apply my skills."
good,Although Working at Axle was not my dream it did help me financially. with being single mother and going to school Axle provided the funds for me to do all I was doing. I enjoyed most everyone I worked with and for th most part time went by quickly.
good,"A AAM do Brasil é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, apenas a falta de orientação de pessoas mais experientes é que falta, pois os gerentes são pessoas de pouca vivencia na indústria e os mais antigos, não tem muita experiencia em outras empresas. Então, as ideias são boas e modernas, porém não se valorizam as pessoas que possuem conhecimento para melhor aplicar essas ideias."
good,"La empresa cuenta con gran estabilidad laboral, pero considero que con el paso del tiempo es importante ser competencia dentro del mercado y ahora tanto las prestaciones como el equilibrio personal y laboral son muy importantes, y la empresa no es muy flexible en este tema."
good,"Management has issues with some employees, can make alot of great friends. Place need more training other then a five minute this is what u do, don't mess it up."
good,"Pretty typical place to work. They are UAW, which can sometimes make it a little harder, all in all, not bad. Like any place, a lot depends on your manager and co-workers"
good,"Typical manufacturing experience.  The benefits are better than average thanks to the union.  Management knows little about the work required on the floor which can be a headache so mind your gauges and make sure your paperwork is accurate.  "
good,"Work always got done, some mandated over time necessary. Great benefits and good pay. Management did a poor job running the place, could not keep track of there employees."
good,"A typical day for me at American Axel & Manufacturing is: I come into work on 2nd Shift, (it's Autumn), the wind is good on the lake for Wind-Surfing, so I take a ride on my Wind-Board, Before work... (Just to mellow me out for the night). Then around 2:00 in the afternoon I show up for work, (I work in Hub Machining)... after a night of precision inspection of single & dual wheel truck hubs, I'm ready for a night on the town! So, I head back to the Zoo (Kalamazoo) & see if there's anything going on at Way-Side West or Coral Gables. "
good,was a good company until it closed.co-workers was like a family away from home.
good,work life balance not the best. good hard working people at this facility. worked above and beyond what is asked of them daily. good supervisors but sometimes their hands are tied to help the people on the floor
good,I learned how to grind iron with robotics me and my partner had won the fastest times on the robot the robot won't clean the inside of the castings so I had to do that the hand we worked on a lot of valve bodies looking through borescopes for the inside of the casting using a shot shooter
good,"My 8-year tenure at American Axle was pleasant wouldn't have left except for the plant closing down, I enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers and the management team as it allowed me to utilize my ability to its fullest potential."
good,the job consisted of a wide range of responsibilities and it was your job to know what you had to do and do it. communication was key and if you dont know how to do something it was always a good idea to ask.
good,"Work 10-12 hours seven days a week always in critical "
good,It is your typical factory job which is not bad. The work is not demanding and there is unlimited overtime if you want it. There is little drama and everyone seems to get along.
good,"Assembly line, long hours, loss of wages and benefits, many buyouts. Most jobs are now overseas, no longer contract, loss of pension and wages and benefits"
good,"except for the fast paced enviroment , in was a good place to work excellent pay and benefits , good quaility of life , unfortunialy  free trade closed the place ."
good,Not enough information for a full review. American Axle has only recently taken over for Metaldyne / Punchcraft in early July 2018. Cannot form a full opinion yet.
good,"American Axle was an EDS assignment in which I supported 9 manufacturing plants.  I learned a lot, worked with a great group of people as well as multi level of management. The job was fast paced,  always putting out fires and running to situations as first res-ponders to technical issues."
good,"Hard work from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave."
good,american axle is a great company to work for. the company has great benefits and provides various discounts to employees for both internal and external products and services.
good,"Responsible for the manufacturing of transmission gears. beginning of shift, have a turn over with last shift. Do maintenance checks on coolant and lube levels. Run first part then check with control plan tolerances. After that check the part on CMM. Utilize precision measuring devices. Make tool compensations and tool changes. Change parts in and out of machine in a careful expedient manner. Log down production amount of parts hourly. at the end of shift do a turn over with next oncoming shift. This is the typical work day."
good,Great place to work.  Fast pace and very rewarding.  Freedom to make decision and grow the business.  The employees are great to work with and the is never a dull moment
good,Typical dictatorship style lower management is often elevated and praised. This is usually unprofessional and involves yelling and public humiliation. Employees are viewed as numbers and you are considered on-call at all times regardless of your personal life. Compensation and benefits are fair for the area. Union workers and representatives are often at odds with management and favoritism flourishes on both sides.
good,"Overall AAM is a good place to work. Very results oriented and demanding, long hours are expected not appreciated. If you work hard you will see growth but managers don't live in reality sometimes."
good,"It was good working for this company over the summer but in the end, I would prefer to stay within the Kalamazoo/Portage area."
good,Empresa boa com estrutura para atender a demanda dos clientes
good,Easy work for most operation preformed fair management. Lots of good people to work with. Low pay is the biggest down fall but there is a lot of overtime available if you don't need or have a life outside of work.
good,"•  Managed cross-functional engineering activities on launching, current and future programs involving prototype builds, validation, durability testing, reliability, change requests, manufacturing, assembly plant and serviceability."
good,"Managers like to micro-manage and hover. If you told them you can not work on weekends, it seemed I would always end up working them."
good,"Depending on what job.  Say the shaft job come in and start machine up if third shift didn't work.  Run some parts and see if the machine is running correctly by checking the heat signature of the shaft over in quality.  If it is good keep running machine do hourly checks and loading up conveyor to machine ahead of mine.  Off load if needed if machine is not working fast enough.  Continue to do hourly checks and make sure water levels in machine are high enough to run job. When the machine goes down either figure out what is wrong with it and fix it or get a skill tradesman out to fix it.  Sometimes I may be on another job say the assembly line I may either be doing quality checks, air checks, putting on parts for welders, putting bolts in, attaching drums or cables.  Each day can be a different job.  I also, have worked in the tube job using a welder and can spot if there is a problem with the part."
good,"I feel that management is not moving in the right direction for this company.  There has been over 40 engineers leave in the last 12 months, and mainly the associates that are left do not have the skill to lead programs."
good,"It's a factory. You don't really use your brain or mouth... Just do what your told, when your told, how your told... Not for me. I do not like blue collar work. Give me a doctor's office or hospital any day..."
good,"Good place to work, lots of friendly people. Learn how to run many different machines"
good,"El trabajo es estable, tiene buenas prestaciones,el incoveniente en mi caso era la distancia ya que abarca parte considerable de mi tiempo, se aprende a convivir y trabajar en equipo de la mano de la seguridad y calidad y pues es una opción decente de trabajo."
good,American Axle paid it's workers well. I was a job setter on a rear axle assembly line. The work was fast paced. Management was always cracking the whip. My co-workers were like a family to me. I enjoyed working at American Axle.
good,"busy. Check for missed shipments, schedule lines, purchase component parts, call for truck pick up, follow up on open PO's, work with manufacturing / engineering on new launches, etc"
good,"In the begining AAM made a huge investment in the plants they purchased, but didn't pursue any work outside of GM. So when GM when down so did AAM. Wages could not keep up with the work that was out there. With more investing in plants in Mexico and over seas, the handwriting was on the wall that it would have to close or go bankrupt."
good,Buen Salario y prestaciones..Horarios flexibles de acuerdo al àrea..
good,Opportunities for advancement. Rely on seniority for advancement. Ample parking and cafeteria. Monthly shiftwide meetings. Closest to the pin golf contest with catered barbecue.
good,"esta mas o menos vien el sueldo y la comida es que dan es de lo mejor; pero hay muchas areas de oportunidad por mejorar en cuestion de seguridad industrial asi como tambien con los turnos que maneja ya que los cambios aon repentinos del esquema ""4x3"" a ""6x1"" a ""5x2"" son muy desgastantes."
good,"All in all, American Axle is a solid work environment with a plethora of employees from different backgrounds. The departments are extremely competitive with not only the manufacturers outside the building but within as well. However, from an honest stand point I can't say American Axle is necessarily the most balanced of workplace. The reoccurring issue of the company is its lack of proper communication channels. This is not a demerit at the establishment, just an observation given the over abundance of office and management positions that have difficulty relating to the working force. Granted communications are trying to be established via multiple attempts, though none seem fruitful at the moment. My typical work day is that of high paced repetitive movement that at times can be a tad overwhelming. This stems from having to perform multiple jobs/tasks to compensate for co-workers whom have slowed down in a way that would effect our daily performance. The problem being is this is now expected of me by my new supervisor whom is my age and lacks experience. I mean no disrespect to him but he lacks both direction and adequate leadership qualities. His inability to assess the situation and react swiftly with decisions and disciplining employment staff that do not meet work expectations greatly hinder my department's overall performance. From a learning point, I now understand manufacturing competition and the many layers of management as well as their interactions. The hardest part of the job would have to be the strenuous hours that sometimes are required to achieve the customer's"
good,"Company is a growing and stable, good jobs with market completive rates. However, they have ranges for rolls and will compensate one person more than another if they want to. Over all I'd give AAM a letter grade of B. Solid company but room for improvement."
good,"A los ingenieros les hace falta tener conocimientos en administración de empresas porque de eso es su trabajo es administrativo y no 100% ingeniería. Por ello su frustración, el no saber coordinar, no se involucran en las áreas productivas, muchas veces evaden su responsabilidad, ante una alerta de calidad simplemente amonestan pero no dan soluciones profesionales. Es una lástima, una vergüenza que personal de las compañías ajenas a AAM estuviesen realizando obras y operaciones que les correspondían al personal de mantenimiento y a los ingenieros. Cuando alguna maquinaria fallaba gravemente traían a los proveedores lo que representaba un fuerte gasto adicional a AAM y después se quejaban de bajas utilidades. Además su egoísmo de ellos (los ingenieros) que no se esforzaban en ser responsables y profesionales (caminando entre pasillos únicamente) porque decían que para qué... para ser ricos a los gringos-norteamericanos. Y cínicamente querían tener en sus bolsillos algunos de los millones de dólares que la empresa generaba. Continúa..."
good,"Allows having creativity on Job"
good,They had a union that didn't protect their workers. Their supervisors promote safety but don't make safety changes until an accident occurs.
good,"En AAM se tiene uno de los mejores ambientes laborales en cuanto a nivel de prestigio y niveles de producción de piezas automotrices, es una de las empresas de las cuales he aprendido."
good,"The benefits at American Axle is pretty good but the pay is bad. They expect you to not have a life outside of work by making you work six days a week, seven days if the plant is on critical (which doesn't happen often). Management is what you would expect in a Manufacturing company but the union has made it difficult to get fired."
good,"Learned extensive proprietary testing instruments, some 40-50 years old and some brand new. Management seemed standoffish.the co -workers on days were knowledgeable and friendly. Off shift work co workers were much less willing to help and train. Learning many different control systems built over the last few decades challenging parts of the job was the most hardest challenge, yet a paradox existed there as I enjoying as I work. Also"
good,A manufacturing job that teaches the necessary skills to be value at other fields of employment.
good,American Axle was a new learning experience for me in the start but fell in love with the process of manufacturing. I enjoyed working with the people there it was like a huge family many had worked together for years. I worked in several of the different plants on that site and I must say I really miss doing that type of work. American Axle provided my family great opportunities working there I enjoyed being apart of a successful team. It was the place I thought I would retire from like many of my elderly family members had done.
good,Em um dia normal de trabalho me sinto bem e sempre disposto.
good,After spending 11 months of my life for this company I can say the best part was bringing home close to 1000 every week. The reason I'd left was for the fact that i was second shift on 10 hours a day. That's 4 P.M to 2 A.M. That left me no time with family and friends if I desired it.
good,"While American Axle was a typical manufacturing company, the compensation and the culture as it related to co-worker to co-worker was very good, which made for a good atmosphere."
good,American Axle was a decent work place when I worked there I got paid $10.00 hr but working in a Auto industry all management worries about is quantity and not quality. With my families life in their hands if I buy one of their automobiles and its not built right because they worry about the quantity and not quality my Family and I could get injured because its not built right.
good,"Running a team training class was the part I liked the most. I could interact with good people that wanted to participate and learn."
good,"It was a good, clean place to work. Management always seemed to keep us in the loop. But the owners lied to its employees, and made us feel like dirt, when in fact the profits were being gathered by the owner to buy international stock, which he was the only one that had it.Not a fair business practice"
good,It did not fit me but the company was very nice to me. I was not comfortable at the company because of my personality. It was not the company’s fault it was all me .
good,Es buena empresa pero mas que nada tiene muy buenas prestaciones eventos para toda la familia que valen la pena
good,"Excelente compañía, beneficios y prestaciones excelentes"
good,"Aprendi muito sobre trabalho em equipe e qualidade, desenvolvi muitas habilidades como agilidade, organização, foco entre outras, a empresa fornecia treinamento para nos capacitar para novas funções, também eram fornecidas palestras para nos prevenir de possíveis acidentes."
good,I loved working at AAM.  The ability to problem solve and use creative ways to resolve issues was very rewarding.  Being able to build and produce prototype axles was very fulfilling.  The work environment was a little rough since the facility was under construction.  There was no air conditioning and no ice machine available in the work area.  The work team was dynamic and supportive.
good,I have worked for American Axle for 4.5 years and I have seen my share of ups and downs within the Chrysler Gears program. There are plenty of very passionate and skillful workers within the organization and on the floor.
good,"The Environment at American Axle is great to work with especially with other employees, and the balance between work and personal life is perfect. The biggest and only problem that i had is that management isnt very good at managing. I had 1 supervisor but there were other supervisors on the floor directing me to do this and that while other supervisors would tell me to do other things at the same time. There were plenty of times where my own supervisor was harassing me about getting stuff down when another supervisor would tell me that the job he tasked me to do was  the most important right now. The job is a union job and I had to call a union member over multiple times, until finally i quite because nothing was being done. All my experiences there come from forklifting, which is a different world entirely from the other positions."
good,"Personable Customer Service Associate dedicated to providing the highest level of customer service. Outgoing, and efficient with the capacity to multi-task."
good,"Health care included, reliable and clean environment. loud large equipment, a supervisor for each department"
good,Todo muy bien desde el material de apoyo para hacer en las mejores condiciones tu trabajo como los compañeros muy buenas personas
good,"Good Work Environment"
good,"I really enjoyed managing suppliers and working with them to improve their product(s).  Travel was often involved, and at one time I spent several years at a supplier in Puebla, Mexico."
good,management was horrible and they lie told me i could come back after 1 year its been 5 years and they said i had attendance issues and that was not the case..........................
good,"Es una excelente empresa,con mucha organización ,trabajas siempre bajo una alta presión,nunca para sus actividades y tiene buenas prestaciones."
good,"Empresa muy buena, pero te queda poco tiempo de disfrutar de la familia o salir."
good,"The pay and benefits are good but some of management just doesnt care. They would keep you 7 days a week, 12 hours a day if it was allowed. They care more about getting parts out than making sure you are ok. Most the people that work here are easy going and are good to work with."
good,"I spent 11 yrs here, I could write my own check in overtime. Paid holidays total 13, double time is paid on top of holiday pay and Sundays, if you volunteer to work. (they cannot make you work holidays, even on ""critical"" status0. They cannot make you work more than 10 hrs per day, nor more than 8 on weekends and holidays. Weekly ot is usually plentiful. (all this is because of collective bargaining). The most frustrating part was never having the right parts to fix things, and the yoyo of rumors and mgt. The union is currently governed by only about 10% of the membership, this is the fault of the majority who do not attend monthly union mtgs. (the ppl rule the union when they are involved). When not, it leaves the votes to the ""good ole boy club and their friends and supporters. (I wouldn't want to work here without a union, but sometimes I wonder if aam had more flexibility, could they do a better job for the people)? (because aam would have to stop hiding behind ""its the unions fault""). Overall a money maker but frustrating and hostile on the floor."
good,"The place itself isn't that bad just certain people in management as well as the union are what makes this place rough to work at. There is good pay, but very hard to advance because everything is based off seniority versus actual skill or knowledge."
good,This was a very demanding job with little to no satisfaction.  If you worked 60 hours a week that wasn't enough and if you worked 70 still not enough.  Work you like a dog
good,"I was not here long, and left as a result of termination which came after an injury I sustained from my duties. They blamed a late day in regards to termination despite the good report I had with all managers and coworkers, as well as those in HR. I believe it was a move to not have to cover workmans comp. All politics aside, if I could work here again I would, so long as I was able to do the same job I was given going into the place."
good,The co-workers are the best part about American Axle. Being union workers we stand as one when management or human resources treats an employee unfairly
good,i enjoyed my time. i was less impressed about the way the union treats people under thier union time even though the charge union dues before your actully counted a union member.
good,Great Pay many hours. Not very much movement and requires a lot of physical labor. Requires a lot of patience and upper body strength. Hope others apply and enjoy their experience.
good,"AAM is a mixed bag to work for. They have great pay and great benefits, however they don't have a great working relationship with the floor staff. They will tell you one thing in a 'town hall' meeting and then do the exact opposite within a few days. "
good,"Very good place to works, but areas lead to little advancement opportunities.  Management is learning, but need to develop better global development.  Pay tends to be lower than peers."
good,American Axle was overall a good job. Their management was just a little out of hand and they had little to no respect for their employees. If the management would have been better maybe individuals would last longer than they are.
good,"es un área muy dinámica y divertida siempre y cuando tengas estudios que sean afin con el puesto (ing lean, industrial, gestión empresarial) como practicante el salario es muy bajo y el horario es decente considerando que tienes transporte."
good,"Go in to work ,make numbers and go home. Management can't be trusted. They screw you every chance they get. The union is not as strong as it used to be and dues keep going up."
good,um ótimo lugar para se trabalhar com varias oportunidades de crescimentos e varios cursor ofericido pela empresa.
good,totally good with safe and clean hygienic work place with coordinable workers and operators.
good,"very good manufacturing facility"
good,"Es una empresa dedicada la crecimiento de su personal, en la cual tambien obtube experiencia en el ramo de inspector de calidad, el equipo de trabajo era accesible y ayuda mutua entre vosotros, hubo partes criticas en la cuales fueron sometidad a evaluacion y finalmente liberadas o rechazadas las partes del producto."
good,"This facility was very straight forward, job is laid out for you, instructions are given from more experienced workers and training is done on the job"
good,As an Intern I was constantly engaged and learning. I started the Job as a College freshman with not much experience and was able to learn a lot during my time there.
good,"En mi experiencia, el área de Forja es pesada, el convivir diariamente con el calor, humedad y aire con partículas puede traerte consecuencias de salud a la larga, a pesar de tener tu EPP siempre terminas respirando residuos o incluso por las exigencias de sacar material llegas a quemarte con la intensidad del calor, es un trabajo riesgoso y no creo que sea bien remunerado, lo igualan al de otras áreas."
good,Boa empresa de se trabalhar com vários benefícios  e estrutura várias ações sociais
good,"Factory jobs are not inspiring careers. However, American Axle does a decent job at making the best of it. Theres a union. The place is pretty clean as far as factories go. Safety and ergonomics are brought up often enough. And they are forthright about what to expect when it comes to getting mandated. My only complaint is with how strict the attendance is."
good,Me gusta trabajar en una empresa donde el compañerismo y el amiente de trabajo ban de la mano tanto como las heramientas y la alluda de todos se puede trabajar correctamente para lograr los objetivos establesidos en tiempo y forma
good,American axel is a really good place to work. They did however just let me go cause of one mistake i made on my application and didnt even bother talking to me about it. They just let me go. Other than that its great pay and a good place to work
good,"Seniority system isn't the best. Definitely hurts the lower level employees but every thing else is okay. Able to listen to music,OT available always."
good,"My job as a machine operator in the cleaning room dept. was much more difficult in the beginning. The company made many changes to improve the quality of the work environment, focusing on health and safety improvements. After changes were implemented, the job itself was much easier and cleaner."
good,"Great pay for the area but at the cost of your health. Stay away from politics, do your job and you'll be fine. Don't expect a lot of pay advancements. They will tell you to work whenever they need you and expect you to be there. You are just a number to them, don't expect them to care about your issues."
good,I just know i did my job and was treated pretty fairly within the job.. THe job was pretty easy and and good comfortable even though it was fast paced but with the ability to get the job done
good,I have had a good run at AAM but there's no advancement. The typical day was to manage multiple facilities. The operations side of things were 24/7 for many years.
good,AAM is a solid company that is results orientated. The business is diversified and has customers consisting of most automotive companies. They have a high expectation with regards to safety and will correct issues quickly.
good,"Enjoyed working at AAM , Worked as a union Carpenter. Staff in my team was nice to work with it seemed to be very balanced with different skills and experience"
good,"falta enfoque a la solución de problemas, trabajo en equipo"
good,A fast paced non hostile work environment with satisfactory management. A typical work day would consist of mild lifting no more than 30 pounds and marking car parts.
good,"Había un buen ambiente de trabajo y oportunidades de crecimiento, poco equilibrio entre el trabajo y tu vida personal"
good,"O problema é que a divisão brasileira é gerida por um sujeito muito arrogante. De resto, uma excelente empresa"
good,"Good company - good benefits"
good,"My typical day at American Axle was spent learning something new everyday. I made sure I completely understood my job before anything else. I worked very well with others and attitudes. I became a trainer for my department. I was very dedicated to my work and work place. The hardest part to my job was lifting the truck axles off the hooks and packing them. However, the job always got done. I really enjoyed going into work and seeing co-workers learning and doing the job so that we could make rate everyday. wonderful company."
good,Es una empresa en el cual se pone a prueba el sentido de la urgencia de un empleado y se deben desarrollar mejoras día para poder entregar el producto en tiempo y forma siempre cuidando de antemano la calidad del mismo.
good,"Aprendi que em uma grande empresa, você pode ser reconhecido profissionalmente, tendo mais valor no mercado de trabalho."
good,"Most days were a blast and the co-workers were great. Learned a great deal from the jobs I was assigned to, hardest part of the was overbearing management, which at times was the hardest part of the job."
good,"Reuniões diárias para definir estrategia com a gerencia ,trabalho em equipe,ser maleável a mudanças durante o turno para atingimento de metas,resolver pequenos conflitos entre colaboradores,passagem de turno tudo ok."
good,I would work eight or more hours a day on an assembly. The environment at American Axle is a fast paced environment. Workers are expected to wore digently and swiftly.
good,"Very clean and nice environment to work, co workers and all management very nice and helpful every one try there best to work together to meet customers requirements. Lots of hours to work all the over time u need u can get great benefits and medical insurance."
good,"Love the hours, pay and benefits. Great group of people to work with."
good,"Emresa con muy buenos salarios, y bonos cono incentivos al personal, muy buenas prestaciones"
good,"Possibilidade de viagens, contato com tecnologia de ponta."
good,AAM's overall employee benefits are very good.  It once had developed a great culture of employee value and empowerment with its core values and strategic principals.  After the acquisition of MPG the culture shifted in a significant direction to the negative.  Many long term employees left the company at that time.  I hope they have corrected that issue as it can be fatal for a company in order to keep their talent.
good,you go to your assigned place till the end of the day. i learned what it takes to assemble a axle and how many components are in a axle.management is up and down pending who you are around. the job was what you made it. it could be bad or it could be good. there is nothing hard about it.the people i met.
good,"Ambiente muito agradável para trabalhar, pude conhecer a fábrica e o máximo de detalhes sobre o processos envolvidos, desde a entrada do produto bruto até o produto pronto para a entrega."
good,Los beneficios son muy escasos y el sueldo muy bajo
good,"the overall experience at AAM wasn't bad, the only difficult part of the job would be communication through other members of staff. most fixtures and stations had specific duties to uphold but the work was laid back for the most part."
good,"AAM is a competitive company growing at a rapid rate.  The work was challenging and sometimes called for long hours, but I thought the compensation package was excellent for the area."
good,"Toma de decisiones rápidas"
good,"The lack of life/work balance is key here. If you are looking for a good benefits company, there are not very many that match up. But if you are looking to make money but able to spend it with your family, best of luck here."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the New Castle, Indiana Plant. This was a fun place to work. We was very busy and we made it competitive with other departments and each other to pass the long hot days quicker. I worked a lot of 12 hour days voluntarily. The pay was alright but should have been more. Everyone there is very safety conscious and strive for better safety. They need to add some type of bonus program for safety and production quotas to give back to the employees. The employees strive for perfection in these areas."
good,"Contamos con comida gratis, y transporte gratuito, me parece perfecto para practicas pues aprendes mucho."
good,"Empresa com qualidade interna bem apurada; Aprendi a operação de novas máquinas de usinagem; Gerenciamento e colegas de trabalho bem competentes; O mais difícil era suportar o alto grau de calor, devido ao teto ser de metal; parte mais agradável quando realizava uma nova atividade dentro da minha função"
good,"Boa empresa multinacional, reconhecida no mercado em que atua."
good,"Nice place to work. Typical  big business politics."
good,"Its a fun place to work if, you can ignore the games that are played by low level managers at corporate. The people are fun and helpful for the most part but, moving up and/or around can be difficult."
good,"So far working here its been all right. first shift has good management but 2nd shift is poor. they always on your butts, n watching you while you take your breaks"
good,I worked for American Axle for ten years.I did enjoy working for the company.
good,Clock in check in with plant manager find out my job duties then head to my station! I would place sand casings on conveyor belt and the machine would do the rest! Had to shovel sand piles when the lines went down because the sand would fall out of the sanding machine!
good,"AAM has really great compensation and benefits for their employees. Some management and higher ups could use a bit of work in regards to understanding of work/life balance, but all in all a really great place to work with much room and to be promoted if thats what you’re seeking to do."
good,"I have been working for AAM for 9 years. It has been hard, but good also. I have been grateful to be employed there. I have been compensated for work done. Sometimes management is too stressed out, yelling at you. I did not appreciate it when the production coordinator lied about a mistake that he said that I made, that I do not believe that I made to cover himself with the company. He has been friendly at times and I have been friendly back since this happened in 2017. "
good,I loved working at AAM but I made a bad choice. I work for AAM 19 years and I regret leaving. I can’t go back until I get a degree and I will have it in two and a half more years.
good,"Excelente tecnologia, porém equipamentos velhos e não existe o incentivo para trabalho em equipe. É cada um por si."
good,I've only worked here at Litchfield for a few years and love my job. Most of my coworkers are great then you have the back stabbing lazy hide behind the Union shield workers. If you can get rid of them which is holding this plant down based on their daily activities place would be awesome. Shop has its normal problems as most but the culture from the few affects the many. This job has changed my way of living drastically and I'm thankful.
good,"AAM provided my first true experience within manufacturing.  The manufacturing team inside Plant 1 was exceptional.  The company put their investment into their people, but rotating their management team so time was spent by each supervisor on every shift in every department."
good,"Existen procesos muy avanzados con alta tecnología, hay algunas personas muy capaces de las actividades que realizan"
good,"fast paced production machine shop making harmonic balancers and balance shafts for major automotive manufacturess."
good,A good company with a solid strategic vision.  Operationally excellent although at times a bit bureaucratic.  Senior leadership is very strong and has a strong culture built on work ethic and willingness to do whatever it takes to drive results.
good,"Trabalhava na areia de novos projetos, consegui adquirir uma visão sobre aplicação de novos conceito de abastecimento de linha,  mais por falta de oportunidade de crescimento na areia logística que gostaria de trabalhar, estou a procura de nova oportunidade, para pode mostrar meu conhecimento."
good,es una planta que le invierte en capacitación a sus empleados pero el ambiente laboral es muy tenso.
good,Es una buena oportunidad de trabajo y te ofrece crecimiento hasta puestos muy altos pero te exige que le dediques mucho tiempo.
good,The first shift materials department exist outside the majority of the politics that plague a manufacturing facility. There are rarely layoffs in this department as there is always materials to ship. The biggest downside to working at AAM is the us versus them mentality that exists.
good,"Trabalho na linha de montagem de eixos traseiros onde aprendi o que é um diferencial e como ele funciona, o diretor/gerente sempre estão dispostos a ajudar e te escutar, meus colegas de trabalho são dedicados e esforçados,a pare mais difícil que encontrei ali na AAM é na questão de promoções ja que estou a 5 anos la e só consegui uma promoção,talvez meu perfil não se encaixe com o da empresa,a parte mais legal do trabalho é que todos trabalham juntos por um único ideal"
good,"En American Axle Manufacturing en un ambiente un poco peligroso. ya que por la producción de la misma es un riesgo y debes estar atento a todo lo que pasa a tu alrededor, las personal son atentas pero al momento de hacer auditorias los trabajadores se portaban un poco groseros al no querer responder de buen modo las preguntas hechas hacia ellos y hacia las maquinas con las que trabajaban, la parte mas difícil del trabajo es que la jornada laboral es de 12 horas y es muy cansado y gestante trabajar esas horas y de que no puedes descansar bien."
good,"Em um dia típico de trabalho temos que realizar verificações nos processos de produção e nos equipamentos de controles como Ultrassom, P.M, Corrente Parasitas e Durometros  , realizar liberações de cargas de peças tratadas por processo de cementação e realizar liberação de set up de processos de tempera por Indução."
good,"Good place to work and raise a family. Hard dirty work, but it does pay the bills. Lots of vacation time, and paid holidays. Paid lunch, and uniforms."
good,Empresa con un ambiente y sistema dinámico de trabajo.
good,This job was one of my favorites I loved the fast pace of the job and constant moving it made the day go by so quick!! HR is the only down fall they are all for the $ and not the employees 98% of the time! They need to be able to give the workers more then they do with time of and call-ins!!
good,"las personas que convivia en el area de trabajo fueron las mejores "
good,It's a decent place to work.  Hard to say much as they recently required my company so I have minimal experience under AAM.  My only real complaint is their lack of dissemination of information from the top to the bottom.
good,"Uma empresa ótimo para se trabalhar, com bons benefícios e de grande porte."
good,"A typical day at this workplace included working from nine to five at a desk. This included creating presentations, excel matrices, and generally gathering data of automobile parts. I learnt a lot about automobiles and the engineering behind the gears and the motors. The management was rather traditional, we were a group of three interns and we had our main boss who assigned us tasks. The work culture was very professional. The hardest thing in this job was translating german to english and vice versa. I think the most fun thing about this job was getting a look into the life of the average engineering job."
good,IT department at AAM was well run.  Staffing was better than most and skillsets were appropriate for the various disciplines within IT. Little office politics.  Needed more processeses and policies put in p-lace and mechanisms for compliance.
good,Large automotive company. Staff was hired primarily from temporary agencies. Pay was decent if you actually were hired on. Benefits were available. Difficult to advance.
good,Great people in the working ranks. Most managers are very accessible and easy to work with. Global sites work with WHQ well. Tools to do your job with are very good and up to date.
good,"I would run different CNC machines making parts for GM rear axles, and I would work on the assembly line buildling rear axles or in tear down finding out what or why the rear end failed inspection."
good,"es una empresa muy buena que motiva mucho a sus empleados , con varias oportunidades de crecimiento laboral..."
good,"Scheduling trucks"
good,I spent 15 years with the company and would have retired from there had the Detroit facility not closed. I worked with a lot of great people.
good,I worked there for 2 years and moved up pretty fast. learned a lot of skills and made a lot of friends. my coworker and i would troubleshoot 8 machines and 2 robots on a daily basis.
good,es una empresa buena como todo falta de motivación en capacitación al personal aprendí muchas cosas buenas y a llevar un buen liderazgo
good,"Leadership quality & team work of the employes. Time Management, Cleanliness, etc"
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar , unico problema é o plano de carreiras , não funciona"
good,"American Axle is a good place to work for the first-time factory employee. The hours are reasonably good, with the exception of having to work two Saturdays in a row. The co-workers can be good people to work with, but don't expect to make good friends with the people. Many of them are not trustworthy and love to talk about you behind your back."
good,Overall AAM was a good learning Experience lots of good people and some not so good.
good,As senior supplier quality and development engineer I was responsible for developing and managing quality related aspects of components manufactured by 64 stamping and weld assembly suppliers both domestically and abroad.
good,"I liked the job I did, I would go in at 6am and run my test pieces and do quality control. I would make sure that the machines were running right and the patterns were center favoring toe. I would the put the test pieces in the quality assurance board. As the day went on, I would do two other quality checks and make off sets for my parts to bring them into spec. I would also run relief, canvass for overtime, call skilled trades for help and support. The hardest part was when a machine went down and I had to hand it over to skilled trades and there was nothing I could do. The most enjoyable paert of my job was the people that I worked with. Upper Management wasn't the best to work with but there were some lower management supervisors were very good to work with and for."
good,More good than bad overall. That is all I want to say...
good,"AAM sold the facility that I worked at as part of a group sale. They did not give us a raise for the calendar year of 2019, pushing it back from January to July then none at all until we were sold.  Bad business practice towards the employees.  Otherwise it's a good place to work."
good,One of the best companies I've ever worked for. Hours and compensation was well worth the sweat. I  worked with amazing people. I learned different skills and had opportunity to grow within the company.
good,muy buena empresa aunque en ocasiones la carga laboral es mucha para el personal
good,I work all I want. Doubles on weekends if I want them. Management is laid back. The work is challenging.  Most days I stay busy working on different operating systems.
good,I was assigned to supplier plants for launch of new product and to improve Quality and Production. I worked with the development of axles for heavy duty trucks. I did the development of heat treat patterns for new axle assemblies at one supplier. I worked to improve production for axle tube assemblies at another supplier.
good,Management is geared toward proper training and safety.  paid time off from Christmas to New Years.  Profit sharing is also a plus. current contract is up for renewal soon.
good,"Great place to work if you're an unskilled laborer. The work day flys by, since there's always something to fix or clean if the machines are down. Get to use a lot of cool machinery."
good,"I loved working for American axle, i loved the factory work. I learned many jobs, i was sad i didnt become a journeyman. I was very happy  with the Quick pass high demand go fix it job. I worked in the union and after the 2008 contract we lost our jobs to out sourcing to Mexico"
good,Great place to work if you enjoy a fast paced work environment. It allows some flexibility to advance within the company based on how long you have been with the company.
good,Need more seasoned technical personnel to address all of the technical challenges ahead of then as they grow.
good,American axle motors is a company i am proud to work for. They have a solid business model and treat their employees with respect. Anyone looking for a job in the automotive industry would be lucky to work for a company like American Axle
good,The facility is now closed. This was a great place to work. It was a union environment and there was a partnership between management and the hourly work force.
good,"this company had a friendly work environment that worked to include its employees in activities and events, such as fundraisers and health competitions."
good,"Other then working 2nd shift, no complaints. Since I left the wage scale has changed emensly. Manufacturing driveshaft. Nice thing as you did 3 different jobs per day"
good,"A typical day working at AAM was productive and busy, working on the line you were constantly moving. I had an opportunity to work as a supervisor will at this job. I enjoyed the people I worked with there."
good,"Buenos Cursos para el area de Trabajo. Buen area de calidad, Excelente normas de riesgos, Buena comida"
good,Axle has been a great place to work but operating a machine is not what I am interested in doing. Looking for something that will be more of a challenge
good,"Es una empresa en la que hay que seguir estrictamente los lineamientos de calidad para que el producto terminado sea el deseado y requerido por nuestro cliente sea interno o externo, en cual el personal debe estar capacitado para la tarea asignada a desempeñar previendo scrap y accidentes de trabajo"
good,"Junta de 5 min ,con operadores para pasar indicadores del dia, junta de 5 min. con tecnicos para revisar estado de maquinas, Junta con cliente interno para revisar los requerimientos de turno, junta con tecnico para pasar requerimientos del cliente, seguimiento de produccion por maquina, recorrido con tec, y operador de area para revisar los puntos de  seguridad,calidad y limpieza de area, Colegas, buen ambiente de trabajo, parte mas dificil, ninguna, lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo, el trabajo bajo presion."
good,"A typical day at work goes by fast because it's always a busy and fun! I learned a lot from this experience because I helped many different departments such as, Finance, Investor Relations and Marketing. I had the opportunity to work with many different people, and learn a lot. The management was very understanding and helpful, I made some great memories and friends with the co-workers who were really friendly and interesting. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines, and the most enjoyable part was creating the culture within the company and being a part of their growth."
good,"I worked one of the assembly lines and the way the team worked together was unbeatable. Every day management gave us almost unreachable goals and no matter the moods and attitudes of the operators, as a group we always put forth our utmost effort. Although management never truly seemed to be satisfied, they had a way of showing their appreciation without letting operators let their guard down and slack off for even a few minutes."
good,A empresa tem um bom clima de trabalho. A gerência é comprometida e trata os colaboradores com respeito.
good,"Em todo tempo que trabalhei na empresa sempre foi satisfatório em parte de salário, participação sempre agradável."
good,"Nesta empresa obtive a oportunidade de me desenvolver como líder de equipe, aumentando meus conhecimentos de gestão e de trabalho em equipe. Existem colegas de trabalho comprometidos com o resultado geral da equipe e também existem colegas que não conseguem um bom resultado em equipe. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é saber administrar as informações com o objetivo de resolver todos os problemas. A parte mais agradável do trabalho é conhecer os resultados alcançados."
good,"Get report from previous shift. Do a quality check and make necessary adjustments if needed. Bring materials to machine via hi/lo. Performed job changes for new production. Replace any worn out or broken tools. Report any quality issues to shift manager. Stock machine for incoming shift. "
good,Excellent Opportunity to advance your career before company closed.
good,"American Axle was a great place to work. The co-workers were great. Management was not to different from the average manager. Also, a day working at the Axle would be full."
good,"I love my job, I just want to relocate to a different state. great company to work for just needs to pay a little bit more and everything would be perfect."
good,"Uma empresa que foca na qualidade de vida dos funcionários,trabalha com segurança em primeiro lugar e com qualidade para o cliente final, foca em plano de ações eficaz no dia  a dia, e sempre mostra a realidade dos negócios."
good,"Went around cleaning floors, mopping, helping with the office people to stuff Easter Eggs.  Overall not a bad place just very dusty and dirty.  It is Forging oriented."

good,"Empresa con altos valores morales, aunque suele caer en cosas demasiados conservadoras"
good,No hay transporte de la empresa hacia León Guanajuato.
good,"The working atmosphere at American Axle and Manufacturing is, for the most part rather relaxed. The supervisors, depending on who you get, are for the most part easy to get along with, however, there is a true sense of it being the union sheop."
good,"Good place, nice people. I am not worked so long but there was nice. Exactly, that time rate was not good, now there better then other place.  That's all I would to say"
good,"Motivate my department as well improve performance simplifying Daily task, work instructions"
good,This was a very organized place towork for. very large facility so break time was hard. pay might have gone up since ive been there. Upper managament was pretty understanding and caring.
good,I am in a salary position and I enjoy what I do.  Some of the hourly jobs are not as enjoyable.Pay isn't competitive and the turnover is high.  Benefits are lacking as well.
good,"Fast pace job with lots of incentives. Lots of options for different areas of work, several different departments to work in. Some heavy lifting and some light duty work."
good,Perseverar en un asunto o problema hasta que quede resuelto.
good,"Great company.  Smart People with no BS.  Just do your job and you will go far and enjoy your time there.   Not much in the way of training and job preparation, so you better know your stuff going in."
good,Es una empresa  Comprometido con la mejora de sus procesos con involucramiento de toda su gente desde el operador hasta el Director los cuales apoyan con su granito de arena para ser cada vez mejores tanto en lo laboral como social.una empresa con grandes cambios significativos de tecnologia y varias cantidades de modelos a producir lo cual te reta para estar haciendo mejoras para tener menor impacto en tu producción.
good,American Axle was a fantastic place to intern. I was give a lot of autonomy and was treated like any other full time employee. The experience I gained as an intern made it possible to secure my first full time job out of college.

good,"A typical day was ensuring security for AAM, checking doors, visual on workers conduct and maintaining gate traffic as well.  I learned a lot about people and their work habits. Wasn't too much involved in management, but had head officer in security at our location and was offered a job with main office.  Workplace culture was low key and do your job.  There were no hard parts of this job, if had to choose it was dealing with plant workers during strikes.  The job was enjoyable overall I was blessed and happy to be working there."
good,"I was employed at American Axle & Manufacturing (AAM) as a contractor. During my contract period AAM merged with another company and needed to re-evaluate their budget and laid me off."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo fue muy bueno. Aprendí mucho sobre como operar maquinaria. Tanto en su funcionamiento, como en su documentación.(hojas de proceso, plan de control, liberación de proceso. Etc.)"
good,"Empresa dinâmica, aonde adquiri conhecimento engajando na empresa!"
good,"Empresa muito boa, beneficios, chefia e trabalho em equipe."
good,"Its a good place to work with great benefits, the work load is fair nothing is extremely demanding. the only reason i marked management lower is there is very little communication and they allow people to circumvent safety to increase production, but to be fair it is on the work force to do so they do not force anyone to do anything unsafe."
good,"Good company to work as intern"
good,"There is no day to get bored at American Axle, it is great to have every single day as a challenge."
good,AAM was a great workplace. I enjoyed working there. I got to work with great people. I learned a lot fixing and maintaining assembly machines.
good,"A global auto parts designing and manufacturing company."
good,"un día típico en el trabajo, llegas y te das cuenta que todo urge, como siempre, consideras la situación, ves los pendientes, te pones de acuerdo con los líderes en el plan a seguir y comienzas a trabajar según el plan, sabiendo que en cualquier momento puede cambia. Aprendes a controlar las situaciones de estres, desarrollas tu capacidad de comunicacion, la forma de ver las cosas se amplía, consideras diversos puntos de vista propios y tomas la mejor decisión que ayude a resolver problemas de raíz. En cuanto a la direccion de la empresa es buena, pero tiene sus carecias, se quieren resolver problemas precionando hacia abajo en los niveles de trabajo en vez de trabajar como un verdadero equipo haciendo lo que a cada quien le toca hacer y teniendo una buena y clara comunicación. Lo mas difícil es estar siempre en calma porque de todas partes presionan y lo mejor es que a pesar de todo se genera una fraternidad muy buena con los compañeros de trabajo."

However, this being a rapidly expanding Tier One supplier, expect your workload to fluctuate over the course of a week. It's not unusual for certain tasks to come up suddenly, but if you can stay focused and well-organized, and communicate with managers and project teammates effectively, these can be managed effectively."

However, there is no such thing as job security in the auto industry.  Associates with several years of experience were laid-off.  The company due to a restructuring, workforce reduction, they eliminated some positions and unfortunately had to lay-off.  I would still recommend working there."

I learned how cross-functional departments are, how imperative it is for good communication practices to be upheld, and how to use cost analysis softwares.  Most managers have an open-door policy and are willing to go out of their way to make sure that their subordinates are happy and productive.  The culture is pretty casual, but still professional.
