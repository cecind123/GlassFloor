rating,review
bad,I wouldn't recommend working for this company.  In my experience they will tell you one thing but do another and only if you are a top dog will you be treated as if you matter.
bad,The people that worked here were rude and would talk about other employees behind their backs and fired people without a reason but would make up lies.
bad,"Middle management is very unorganized leading to high turnover rates, low patient satisfaction scores, and little to no chances for advancement. Numerous clinicians have left this organization due to the unqualified middle management that oversees multiple clinics resulting in delayed pay for employees. Be aware, stay away from this employer."
bad,Probably one of the worst places I have ever worked.   Management is horrible from the CEO down.  Raises are rare and its always short staffed.  They cover up mistakes.  If you approach cooperate every that is a problem magically disappears.   They are a for profit.  And their main goal is profitability.   Not patient safety or satisfaction
bad,"High turnover and difficulty recruiting, but they don't value the people who come to work for them."
bad,"Run!! The worst place ever for nurses, patient safety is non existent! Nurses are treated terrible, patients are only a number, nurses forced to take unsafe patient load."
bad,Don't waste your time.  They are all about hiring people of non color.  I was talked to like a meaningless animal.  It's just not worth it.  Plantation days are over.
bad,"As a former employee there is so much expected of you! You are expected to do the job of 4 people and have Zero overtime. I worked regularly 3-4 hours after I was scheduled to get off work. Benefits are expensive and horrible they cover little to nothing and you still have large Bills. They do not hire enough staff, very stressful enviornment and you will fear for your professional license working here with some of the situations they put you in. Horrible managers who care nothing about their staff! This is a horrible place to work!  You will burn out so quickly on a job you once loved! Pay is very low with little to no chance of moving up in the company!"
bad,"Terrible leadership, poor communication, managers do whatever they want and everyone else is treated like a slave. HR watches everything you do like a concentration camp in Germany. Benefits are not good and they just are not good people."
bad,"I wish I would've known people who had worked here before ever wasting my time applying. Compensation was great but if you factor in the workload, poor management and the stress then the pay isn't worth it. You get hired by HR because they want the best but then Management (team leads) can't stand if you are smart and know your job- you then become a target. Employees are pitied against eachother and it's like being back in high school. Worst work environment I've ever experienced!! Training is hit or miss. One team lead has ran off over 8 employees in less than a year and no one has realized or done anything yet. Director acts oblivious to things happening due to hardly being at the office. If they could see the real problem at hand the company has potential to keep great employees. Also health benefits are pricey compared to most healthcare companies around."
bad,"Management doesn't care.  No promotions nor transfers to another department.  HR doesn't want to help."
bad,"I had worked here previously and was happy to come back to such a family oriented hospital. Wow, was I wrong!. So much has changed in over a decade and it is now anything but family oriented."
bad,"I love this place all of the ""O"" team is amazing. Infection control officer is terrible, and gets away with everything."
bad,"No concern for patient care or staffing needs.  Getting to be a dangerous place for patients.  Nurses way overworked, lower pay than other area hospitals, and we are a trauma 2 level hospital.  All of the patients at higher paying hospitals come to us.  Ancillary staff getting escorted out the door and fired with no warning.  Health insurance is good, but we are in negotiations and they are trying to take it away from .8 and below nurses.  Constant 16 hour shifts, nurses being  made to take more patients than what is safe.  Used to be a great hospital, but not anymore, and Duke doesn't care at all.  Horrid place, looking elsewhere for work."
bad,"Due to healthcare reform and other issues, the culture at LifePoint has changed in the past few years. LifePoint has become much more ""corporate"". Career advancement is difficult unless you are hired in at Sr. Director, Vice President, etc. or above.  I think many good people are overlooked for opportunities because the company seems to like to hire outside applicants over internal promotions. It doesn't seem like loyalty or time with the company matters that much to LifePoint."
bad,Lifepoint hospitals struggle to simply meet needs both of patients' and staff.  The are truly inept at providing good care which makes it next to impossible to do good work for them.
bad,"The management practices of LifePoint are not conducive to long-term sustainability. Exhorbitant Executive Officers' compensation and shareholder return are delivered at the expense of sufficient number of hospital personnel, adequate equipment, training, and adequate compensation for hospital employees."
bad,You very much feel like a number instead of a person working at Lifepoint. The most important thing is the bottom line. Not efficiency or patient care. It's all about profit.
bad,"Frequent management changes, uncertain job stability. Often too many responsibilities placed on employees without the time needed to complete tasks assigned."
bad,"Not the place to go for growth. Compensation for the staff below average."
bad,"After a glowing performance appraisal 4 month's later i was laid off at Lifepoint HSC in Brentwood. This was the 3rd layoff in one year. All good people, now their lives disrupted. Meanwhile the CEO made $12m. This was a down year for him. It has been much more in years past. The O's are bleeding this little company dry, meanwhile threaten to lay off everytime the stock dips. "
bad,"micro managed, unfriendly coworkers, good benefits, no room for advancement, no consideration given for appropriate work/life balance.  Never hear from CEO but one or twice a year."
bad,"management is terrible, nobody knows what is going on and just passes issues around and nothing ends up getting resolved, PTO and making up time is a pro to this job"
bad,"I was able to keep up with managing my work only if I worked 14 hour days bc I was forced to perform nursing/managerial and Nursing Assistant functions throughout the day due to lack of staffing. There was terrible employee culture, which I was tasked to fix as a ""leader"" but was not given any of the authority that leaders have...mainly to staff proactively."
bad,The company overall is good but middle management lacks the ability to provide leadership.  The current management is going through a merger and it is clear that the current management has a huge amount of insecurities.  There is no direction and no clear communication.
bad,"Stressful and ZERO chance for advancement. They have a ""reorganization"" every 1.5 to 2.0 years, however they pay well for what short time you are there. Benefits are decent. Healthcare is expensive unless you go to a LP facility."
bad,"I have been employed with Lifepoint Health for almost 4 years now. I started out as a FLOAT, but was placed in PEDS DEPT first. I was unsure of being there, because working with small children was not what i was used too. I had worked with Geriatrics in the past and that was my comfort zone. The day I started, I was placed with a seasoned nurse that took me under her wing and showed me what a true PEDS nurse was. I knew then that is where I wanted to be."
good,I was put on work restrictions by my doctor and was let go because of this.  There should have been no problem to not accommodate these restrictions.  I was a hard worker and these were temporary restrictions.
good,"LifePoint has grown to large to fast and therefore has a poor infrastructure.  Management is to concerned about the next acquisition and keeps subordinates in the dark until the last minute,  Travel is excessive and the reporting structure is not clearly defined."
good,"Growing organization with no real culture.  Leadership is not in touch with the front line staff.  Not stable environment, but they are trying.  Management conducts engagement surveys from staff, but does not make changes.  Turnover is high at all levels.  Some positions offer work from home benefits, but not all positions.  They are trying to make it a better place to work, but the changes are slow to come."
good,A flexible work environment allows for a decent work-life balance. But the leadership is sub-par. Those who should not be promoted are while others are left stagnant in un-challenging roles. They do not often adhere to their professed value of promoting from within. Leadership is not good about providing opportunities for their employees to grow.
good,"LifePoint is Corporate and those in Management especially in the specialty fields really care for their employees. It is difficult for them to care on a personal basis due to corporate instruction. The local people in this company truly care. If you work hard and don't have any issues, you will be fine."
good,This company is very unstable and has frequent lay-offs. It does not utilize the skill-set of employees or offer opportunities for advancement.  The senior leadership team drives the business based on financial gain (bonuses) rather than the company's mission of making communities healthier.
good,"There is a transitional management team in place at this time and uncertainty concerning the hospital's future, There is a purging of employees with a sense of urgency.  There is a tightening of budgets that restricts ability to care for patients"
good,"Great place to work to build your career and great workplace culture. Professional, friendly atmosphere but fast-paced with high caliber employee base. Competitive benefits. Recommended."
good,"It was a comfortable work enviroment."
good,Worked for company over four years. Company has excellent benefits and 401K package. Monday through Friday weekends off. Typical eight hour work day. Co-workers were awesome!
good,"not a great management team with communication. Work not evenly distributed, and a lot of favoritism shown. Quick turnover rate"
good,"Good coworkers, little to no breaks (normal rehab in all companies). Organized and committed rehab team. I enjoyed coming to work."
good,I like the challange of drawning people blood. Not everyone has awesome viens. Meeting new people for all over the United Sated was very rewarding
good,Great job in a busy for profit healthcare company.  I enjoy being able to help improve processes and aid in the efficiency of the directors in the field.  I take pride in my work and get satisfaction in knowing that I was able to make a positive impact on someone or that I was repsonsible for making their life easier.
good,"LifePoint has a strong vision and a very respectable mission, but since it was limiting itself to rural and under-served areas, the revenues were always low.  That made funding hard to come by.  Leadership was competitive and often unforgiving.  In the right departments, the company was good.  The company, though, was growing very fast and not able to assimilate all of its acquisitions effectively, so it may encounter problems in the future."
good,Specializing in the purchase of small rural public non-profit hospitals and turning them around as for profit hospitals.  Strong focus on labor and productivity management.
good,"worked with knowledgable team of IT folks."
good,"I enjoyed doing provider credentialing work; but my downfall with the company was lack of training. One hour's training over the phone was not enough training to be able to work with the software system and up to the company's expectations; not to mention, I wasn't given the necessary equipment to do my job successfully."
good,Wonderful place to work.  I wish I had never left.  You would be lucky to work here.  I just wish that it had more room for advancement. The building and gym is awesome.
good,Good place to work for such a small town.  Family like atmosphere with managers and hourly employees working together for a common purpose. Overall there is a good work/life balance when fully staffed.
good,"Focused on Quality and patient safety. Lots of support with various divisions. Based in Brentwood, Tennessee. People work here a short time or a long time"
good,"I was hired on as a Implementation consultant and worked a contract for a few months.  It was 100% travel and I went from Hickory, NC to Columbia, SC during the course of my assignment.  Management always tried to make themselves available for any issues or questions, and they did not micro-manage."
good,"Senior leadership is excellent, approachable and respectful"
good,Medical benefits could be better. LP offers mostly high deductible plans. Advancement and promotion opportunities have decreased over the years. Last two years have given out flat 2% merit increases across the board which is unfair to employees who meet or exceed expectations during annual appraisal's. If you are use to anywhere 3-5% merit increases you will not get that here!
good,"Lifepoint is a good employer, they just don't compensate their non-clinical staff for their contribution to the company.  Non-clinical staff is underappreciated and underpaid compared to industry standard."
good,"Enjoyed working at LifePoint, work place culture is positive.  Historical leadership was engaging, present and lead the organization per the company’s mission of making the communities healthier."
good,I really enjoyed the time I spent at lifepoint hospitals. I was paid well and had a flexible schedule. I would work here again if given the opportunity.
good,"The position itself was very informative and working with the Surgical Directors was a pleasure. Overall, I enjoyed my work there."
good,"Very well run business with senior leadership that are veterans of the industry. As the company is a spin-off of HCA, there are many former HCA employees there but they have begun to broaden the culture with addition of management from other healthcare entities. Senior leadership is very good and young enough to be there for some time."
good,"Working with patient account and billing."
good,"Used to be a great place to work until the company was sold to the equity firm, then everything went down. it started with many laid off and cut the staff very deeply,"
good,"Fun place to work. Not too stressful. A lot of work and the pay and medical benefits aren’t great, especially given the importance of the positions and the amount of work you’re expected to do, but still would recommend."
good,"Great place to work!  Co-workers and those within other departments were always friendly and helpful. One of the things I really liked about  LifePoint, is how much they are involved in charity organizations and embrace employee participation. That really spoke volumes to me."
good,"Collaborative, team oriented culture focused on making communities healthier. The company places a focus on employee work life balance and providing great benefits."
good,Basically a great place to work.  Very nice people and good benefits.
good,Overall I enjoyed working at LifePoint as it is a great place to work with good benefits. I had great coworkers and would gladly work there again in the future.
good,"Physician Services Dept has been beneficial, great teamwork from the VP to Sr Dir's to the Market Directors in the field.  I worked with 475+ physicians in 22 facility locations, Western states."
good,"The work there was enjoyable and work keeps the day to day from becoming too routine."
good,"I loved working at life point everyone there were always in a great mood and it was a great working environment. On a day to day basis I will assist the physician with care operations where I learned a lot whereas to •Conduct physical examinations Diagnosing and treating patients, and Assisting in surgeries."
good,I have enjoyed working at WCCH in a leadership position. I believe we promote our mission and senior management supports their leadership team to accomplish our goals.
good,Good place to work.  Staff worked as a team.  Management was fair and tried to help arrange work schedule with personal needs.  ER Physicians were easy to work with.
good,"Good company, great health benefits. There is no support or suggestions on additional training for gaining knowledge in the job/field for non experience employees. High volume, will not hire additional employees"
good,"I worked with great people, learned a lot and enjoyed the job.  I was the analyst for completing the upgrade of MorCare.  Was the Project Manager for the upgrade.  Enjoyed the job."
good,I have enjoyed my time at this position.  I value my team and co-workers.  I learned to include my team instead of trying to accomplish every goal single handed.  The hardest part of the job is not getting the support from senior staff or corporate office.
good,I loved the way the job changed with the innovation that I put into place. I was able to make this department function as a team.
good,"The company culture is great, the management is usually outstanding, the leadership is down to earth and thoughtful, and the facilities are wonderful.  There have been layoffs every few years, advancement opportunities and salary increases are limited, and the healthcare benefits are expensive, but work life balance in most departments is respectable. Overall, this is a good company to work for."
good,"Great place to work.  Leadership  is very personable.  Minimal opportunities for growth,  have to aggressively them out. Benefits are good and on site gym is really nice."
good,"LifePoint bought St Francis a couple of years ago and just recently began making major changes (new EMR system, updated technology, equipment and supplies, more staffing, giving merit based annual raises, education opportunities, and even construction work to the ER to facilitate better patient care, improved processes to shorten length of stay for non critical patients and shorter lobby wait times). I worked med/surg (2 south) for a year and a half and loved everyone I worked with, but I was given the opportunity to transfer to the ER, which is more my speed. The ED has awesome management and teamwork, flexible hours, varying degrees/paces/departments within the ED to work (triage, “doc in the box” rapid care, main/critical ED, behavioral/mental health unit, etc.) My only real complaint is that they don’t give paid maternity leave. You have to use your built up PTO/EIB hours."
good,"high performing people/teams"
good,"This is a great place to work, with a good management system. They do provide a fair workplace culture with lots of positive perks available to employees, like onsite fitness and meal options."
good,Great employee and patient care orientated company. would recommend this company to anyone in the medical field. The management is wonderful there.
good,Thoroughly enjoyed assisting in the operations and growth and development of the new grads as well as the seasoned staff at this beautiful Lifepoint location.
good,"Lifepoint is a very productive workplace. Always new changes, and new physicians to the facility. I was able to work in various positions from Pediatric, General Surgery, Urology to OB/Gyn. I am very appreciative of the opportunity that was given to me. My team was very enthusiastic, eager to learn and to teach in their field of expertise. When the childbirth center closed at out facility, it was a very sad time as we all lost our positions. Our patients were in turmoil basically, scrambling to find new physicians to accept their insurance and upset physicians they grew close with had to leave. I loved working in pediatrics and OB/Gyn, getting to know and care for patients before and after childbirth was an amazing experience. Sincerely hope to get the opportunity in the future. Nursing school will be complete and I pray good things lie ahead."
good,The lab has some of the best people to work with. Except for the management team. They lack the interest in obtaining good qualified employees. It is a high volume/high stress job. Many times there is only one Phlebotomist scheduled to cover the entire hospital including outpatient services and the emergency room.
good,"LifePoint has a fantastic culture and I truly enjoy working there.  Job security makes me a little nervous at times, but I stay because I truly appreciate the people I work with and support the company’s mission 100%."
good,Wonderful company with hard working individuals looking to ensure quality healthcare for our nation's communities.
good,"Meet managers to determine current and future workflow. Design system and build to meet what is needed for the hospital to meet staff, patient, and government requirements."
good,LifePoint has grown rapidly over the lasts 5 years through Acquisitions and Mergers.  I've learned to navigate the political barriers in the organization.
good,"LifePoint was founded on the ideas of creating a professional environment where the community trusts them to provide great healthcare services, providers want to work for and employees look forward to coming to work.  LifePoint was recently acquired by an investment firm and merged with another healthcare company.  The merger took place about a year ago.  The jury is still out on whether LifePoint will be able to maintain the principles that made her great but so far they seem to be sticking with them.  The corporation is ran by a new CEO who is well versed in the history of LifePoint and what made her great. I cannot imagine how hard it must be to satisfy new investors and maintain the core principles of LifePoint.  If everything stays on track, LifePoint will continue to be a WONDERFUL place to work.  If you are interested in working for LifePoint you will be surrounded by thousands of amazing people (and a few grouches)."
good,Enjoy working here. The staff help each other and work well as a team. It has the family feel. Management takes part in what is going on there and listens to any concerns.
good,"Typical Mondays are spent driving and flying to whatever hospital I go to.  Tuesday's, Wednesday's, and maybe part of Thursday's are working in the hospital next to the Director of Care Management looking at processes, goals, and action plans for improving their hospitals readmissions, claim denials, discharge planning, social service, and documentation to be sure Medicare and commercial insurance needs are met.  Then travel home on Thursday, and work from home on Friday.  "
good,"Awesome place to work, management is very willing to listen and teach to help you gain knowledge and experience,  the workplace is very friendly, awesome break room and workout center."
good,"By far the best leadership team I've ever had the pleasure of working with. A very strategic, forward thinking company that values its employees."
good,"I learned a lot working for LifePoint.  I had great Corporate bosses as well as an Outstanding local CEO that we worked very well together and we were able to make a lot of positive change in the 2 years I was there.  I had Great, Loyal and hardworking staff as well as Awesome Physicians, that were great to work with and for!"
good,I assisted many in my roll at Lifepoint.  Learning so much about healthcare and managing hospitals.  It definitely helped me in my understanding of our healthcare which has taken me far.
good,"LifePoint Health is a very collaborative and inclusive environment. The leaders make it a point to bring together everyone's voice and opinion so that the leaders are making well informed and strategic decisions. That alone makes the culture at LifePoint attractive. At LifePoint, you will get the chance to work with the very best in healthcare, get the chance to implement and adopt best practices, get the chance to use the biggest and best in technology all while feeling like you are a part of a small, family friendly team. LifePoint takes care of its employees and strives to be the perfect balance of patient advocacy and fiscal responsibility."
good,"Was a reference for case management directors in 24 East region hospitals.  Is a great job as you get to keep current of case management trends and to share knowledge with your team.  After 2 years, the constant travel was very stressful."
good,"I love, love, love lifepoint! I’ve been with Springview Hospital for almost 2 years now! Everything about them is wonderful!"
good,"I was a consultant for LifePoint for a few months and from day one I was treated with respect and asked to do meaningful and challenging work. My supervisor was great, allowing me to miss some time for family events and also worked right alongside with me on some projects. A great temporary assignment and I would imagine a great place to land permanently    ."
good,Productive workplace; excellent management team; workplace culture was very positive and Christian based. Family atmosphere. Really enjoyed this job and found the care to be excellent
good,"I love this hospital and my job, my co workers are the best and most helpful, my nurse manager is the best that I have ever had, she is patient, kind and understanding."
good,Never had any issues working here. Worked here part-time for a couple of years.  Not a ton of work available due to the small community size.  Left to get more steady hours.
good,Mission driven; champion of rural healthcare; focused on quality and patient centered care delivery; employees are empowered to make a difference in their role
good,"good company be ready to move around at the order of the company."
good,"Work with the best group of skilled nurses and best supervisors you could find anywhere. Because of there grate support and like mindedness of providing the highest skilled nursing care in the most efficient way, I worked there for 13 yrs.  ER is a fast pace department but we had a well oiled machine of team players and Doctor's/PA's that had our back. I really miss all the staff there and wish them well."
good,"Great Company that has Great Leadership and plenty of "
good,I enjoyed my position at LifePoint and worked with a great group of people.  Had a very supportive boss and great working relationship.  Worked with and supported 130+ employees.  The department I worked in had a very relaxed atmosphere.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my relationship with those I worked for.  We worked as a team.  There was no drama.
good,Love working at LifePoint!!! I have been here 10 years and everyone treats each other like family. I encourage everyone to get a job at a company like LifePoint.
good,LifePoint is a great company. Strong focus on quality and patient safety. Provide great wages and an outstanding benefit package. Growth opportunities are available.
good,Good culture at this publicly traded integrated delivery network company with a constant eye towards professional and family balanced work schedules for all levels of employees.
good,"Great people and great corporate culture. A lot of exciting things happening in healthcare right now, and this company at the forefront of the industry."
good,I loved working at HCA and given an opportunity to return I would definitely go back when I left the company it was to increase my rate of pay.
good,Every day is an exciting opportunity to improve our patients' care experience - implementing patient counseling as well as improving the medication management processes behind-the-scenes.
good,"This company is a very progressive, fair healthcare organizations whose strength is investing in their people. The company has tremendous growth over the past 5 years and dedicates their mission to improving healthcare in small community hospitals."
good,Excellent place to work.  Family atmosphere.  A focus on quality with a very easy to use EMR (eCW).  Co-workers are friendly and supportive.
