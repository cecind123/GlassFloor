rating,review
bad,Qualcomm is the most vindictive employer in the market. Qualcomm blacklists its former employees. The workplace is full of viscous rapers completely condoned by HR. Get yourself a job anywhere else. Especially if you are a woman.
bad,"I had a huge learning curve during the time I spent at Qualcomm. But contract employees are not treated well, and the chances of converting to full time is very low."
bad,"It used to be a terrific company. Now it is not. It's a haven for those on Visas seeking to gain H-1B status. Many people work vary hard, sometimes chasing their tails. Others, not so much.  It's all about status reporting and seeking. You need to be highly aspirational and tribal in certain departments."
bad,"Work life balance is horrible, Qualcomm will take all of your free time. "
bad,"While Qualcomm was a visionary wireless technology leader, the company is currently in the process of reinventing itself.  The company has lost key leadership and engineering talent."
bad,"Reason i dislike work culture at QCOM is because of lot of report collection, huge upper management and less engineers. Deadline is what cared about not the quality of work."
bad,"really disappointment about the management team, make bad decisions. keep useless people in company and kick off who really working."
bad,"Watch out for contracted positions.  Low pay, grunt work.  If your honest worker beware... better if your a good show off, pretenter, credit steeler.   Too many employees, lots of overlap of work.  Hard to get ownership.  Culture is pretend, pretend your a robot, pretend you work all hours of the day, pretend you know the technology."
bad,No management structure in getting new hires started with memory device structrue and what is required. Not treated as a person just a person to use and abuse. Would never work here again.
bad,"Perks are one thing, but most perks are not available to many of those who are hired as temporary employees of Qualcomm. Make sure that you are not hired through a temp agency. Firstly because they dont offer any training and you are expected to know how to do the job requirements from scratch. Youre pretty much on your own as a temp. and if you get sick or cant work for any length of time, pack your bags! Zero job security. This company hires hourly people and keeps them as temps for almost a year...then they let them go for two or three months without pay, hire them back for another year etc etc. I personally know RF Technicians that have been hired, laid off, and rehired as many as four times and are now in their fifth ""ride"" on the merry go round! These rehires get ZERO benefits and work side by side with permanent employees who get paid vactions, raises, promotions, holiday pay! If you like being a second class employee, hire on as a temp with Qualcomm."
bad,"The engineers are usually great and are knowledgeable."
bad,No stability in this company.  Most opportunities are given to permanent employees.  Hard for most contractors to advance in this company.
bad,"I worked for few months, the leadership team and culture is pathetic. They take mostly as contract employee and through people out without providing any notice."
bad,Management often side track female engineers to perform secondary tasks which are left aside by male counter parts. Generally rude culture with no respect for suitably qualified female engineers.
bad,Organizations have healthy autonomy for productivity
bad,"I work in support services, the team I work with is kind, helpful and accommodating."
bad,"Very Busy/escalation across every department. Sleepless nights ,working round the clock for delivery.MOdem technology and learning pace is very slow due to the Hectic work pressure. Management is the worst of all in Qualcomm for the poor performance. The hardest part of working in Qualcomm is shutting you eyes,mouth and ears against injustice. Nothing to enjoy esp from 2014."
bad,"Manager was very egotistcal and very unprofessional i quit. Make sure you screen manager before you start job with these people. right group and Manager is key to succeed and be happy."
bad,"no benefits, bad culture, lots of politics, upper management is not fair, stay away from qualcomm, you can do better, zero job satisfaction"
bad,"Okay place to work, but there is a lot of internal conflict.  Team doesn't work as a team and management has no experience in regulatory compliance or quality systems.  No support for quality by the top management."
bad,"harassing, unethical, political agenda, favoritism and much more nasty behavior that is not appropriate to openly discuss. However, if you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask me."
bad,There is no proper planning in work assignment. Very limited growth. No value for individual's skills and area of interest.
bad,"no advancement opportunities unless you're indian. work and be accountable all day. meetings in the evening and mornings."
bad,"it's a sweat shop, all Indian engineers, poor management."
bad,"Aside from the pay, which was very good for what I did at Qualcomm, the place is a sinking ship these days. I was just laid off because management thought it would be a good idea to outsource my job to a help desk in India."
bad,"I went through a Horrble Devorce and"
bad,Senior executive management needs to be replaced to allow for new leadership who will lead the company regarding innovation and great place to work as well as retain great employees verses golden parachutes and outsourcing to lower pay regions.
bad,"I was in mid-level management in a product/engineering group. Q leadership is focused on all the wrong things; execs nit-pick technical details and cater to major customers instead of fixing the organization and focusing on strategy and vision. Technical teams have unofficial pocket-veto on projects by simply not staffing them. Product Marketing only talks to manufacturers; the company has almost no insight into consumer behaviors or the future of how humans use the devices that pay Qualcomm's bills, because they laid off all of those people. Engineering teams might be awesome or grumpy, depending on the group and the location. Everyone is overworked. Program managers are often way out of their technical depth, and the processes and tools they have to use are nightmarish. FocalPoint is an absolute disaster and actively makes the products worse and take longer to make. Process owners usually build processes to serve ""the core business"" of handsets, and force all of the other businesses (IoT, connectivity, automotive, audio, etc) to use processes that don't fit their products or customers and just cause more problems that they solve. ""Product Strategy"" is usually a massive presentation full of TAMs and SAMs, basically stating how much money they could make in each market segment. No analysis of what is the right product to build to make that money, or why anyone would want the products they were making. They're 98% focused on cellular and handsets, and in spite of all of their efforts to diversify, they squander their acquisitions by forcing unsuitable processes and decision-making"
bad,Got extremely low support from colleagues. Did not get the correct training or mentoring for project.
bad,"It is were world politics happens.  The CEO and upper management have no idea   it is taking place.  Middle east politics, African politics and Indian politics is affecting the company."
bad,"Qualcomm is struggling to find its identity. Currently has poor vision at the CEO level. The company is going through massive layoffs with little vision. All of IT is currently being outsourced to India, regardless of employee loyalty. Moral is a big issue at the company currently as most employees that the next wave of layoffs could include them."
bad,"Mafia-style intimidation and self-dealing combined with North Korean-style demands for personal loyalty. HR is Human Refuse. Stay far, far away from this workplace."
bad,If you think somebody will ever even view your submitted application then forget about it! i have submitted for over 2 years and seems like it goes to planet Mars and no response what so ever. Even from Mars you might get some response proving responsiveness. But Qualcomm has no recruiting system with real human beings seems like.
bad,"Mediocrity and bureaucracy combined.  There are not enough people to complete all the projects, but there is also far too many incompetent people.  The DMV operates far more efficiently than Qualcomm."
bad,"Never had any issues with this when working with this company.  Always good customer service. Replacement or new parts delivered quickly and accurately,"
bad,They give you a good package but it's only temporary. It they can't license the project you are working on they shut you down and do it all over again with another group.
bad,"A company only out for C suite executives.  They don't care if they fire you or if you leave.  The CIO gave a presentation stating that they only offer so many promotions and if you aren't happy, feel free to leave."
bad,"Over all it was OK to work at Qualcom."
bad,I cannot claim that Qualcomm is a bad place to work at but personally I had a very bad experience when working there. I attribute it to the management in the organization that I worked in. The manager always imposed their will and I was never afforded an opportunity to learn and grow.
bad,Lots of departures and brain-drain of highly talented engineers of late. Company does very little to stem it or reduce the ever-increasing workload on employees and benefits are getting fewer by the day.
bad,"too much politics and no room for growth with very less compensation and benefits,too muh middle management and micro management"
bad,"They will keep you in as a temp as long as they can before letting you go, just to call you back in after 3 months, just to go through the same cycle again."
bad,"In my experience, Qualcomm was a very cut-throat environment in which to work. I was initially excited about my job, but soon came to realize that the people in management roles had personalities unsuited to being  good managers."
bad,"Officially the company was supposed to have Matrix management structure, but not all departments followed it. So there was a high probability that you got overworked by your lead/manager and you had no way out. "
bad,"Very little work/life balance, and no career growth.  Management was very male dominated and did not allow for remotely working.  The compensation package was what kept me at the company for so long."
bad,"lots of politics, no tolerance for risks, people always looking for whom to blame, too many meetings, losing talented people, no clear direction or leadership from the top... future looks grim"
bad,"Poor management. Luckily, just before leaving the company a really good manager was switched to our team which saved my sanity. Learned how to work in a fast paced environment, with many clients  and personalities."
bad,"not a fun place to work. work culture is old fashioned. food is not good and expensive. convenient and classy location. rest of the facilities are good. tennis court, volleyball and basketball courts along with gym and swimming pool. complementary benefits are not bad."
bad,Qualcomm used to be a good place to work under the original founders.  Since the new leadership team has taken over it has become a sweatshop and they do not care about their employees.  They are arrogant and this comes across to their customers and other business partners.
bad,"The team is very secret when it comes to passing on knowledge. There's a lot of biase, it's hard for American to get title changes and good pay like the Indian's."
bad,Assigned a mentor who promptly went on vacation for three months. Had to create my own work and then was told not to. Role was mostly sitting there and doing nothing. Other workers seemed to have that strategy well implemented. Very much a good ol' boy's club.
bad,"I am in Qualcomm for almost two years. I was in San Diego and then moved in San Jose by IOS. Be careful while doing IOS because they do not provide any relocation except very little lump sum. It is super frustrating even they do not provide any support for household goods moving. There is no office room in San Jose so the environment is noisy and loud. No Cafe, no gym. San Jose campus has only 1-2 restaurants in walking distance. They will not provide even laptops if your laptop gets too old and too slow to work. Promotions are very slow, the salary increase is very little each year. You can not cope with the market with this much little salary increase. In San Diego, Qualcomm may survive with good employees but in Bay area, I doubt because the living cost is so much high and benefits provided by competitors are also high, where Qualcomm is treating its employee very poorly."
bad,"Constant fear of layoff. Arrogant Director and above titles. Retaliation, favoritism, nepotism. Age discrimination and unfair employment and business practices."
bad,"Company culture has gone down significantly over the years."
bad,"Qualcomm has changed a lot in just 3 years.   There are too many hierarchies.   I still don't know what my chain of command is, where our group projects, and direction are coming from."
bad,"Poor management and job placement dominated by Asian workers in San Diego."
bad,"Qualcomm has changed a lot, from an exciting innovator where you could learn amazing things and wear several hats, to a soulless sweatshop powered by H1B's with pigeonholed positions overseen by VP's who really don't care about their people and will keep you down in a rut. "
bad,"After new CEO took over some years back, it's no longer what we used to feel proud and happy to work for. Many many people are leaving (as of May 2017)"
bad,The company is not what it once was. Upper management only cares about numbers and bring involved with the financial side I can say there is little job security. They are looking to keep most people as temps or outsource.
bad,"It used to be a great company. Hard work and long hours, but good pay and benefits. That all changed last year. Too much talent was stupidly cut, those that are left get treated poorly."
bad,"Low level managers need work. Some rarely showed up. Most took little active interest. Most were too involved on appearances, and empire building. Little to no communication on the business. No social activites to foster cammeraderie."
bad,"There is a lot of politics and favoritism. "
bad,"when i worked there it was overwhelming i had people breathing behind my neck at all times i couldn't take a quick break without having someone come ask co workers where i went and how long ago did i leave, so wrong. Coworkers some are awesome some make it feel like its high school all over again."
bad,"At the working level, the teamwork is fantastic.  Given the pressures of the senior and executive management, the teams operated professionally and with purpose.  If I would say what has gotten Qualcomm to where it is today, I would say the working teams that focus on success which has made the difference.  I can't say enough about the level of commitment that the execution teams make to achieve success.  All this while keeping an environment of respect and professionalism. "
bad,"it seems there is no technical design here."
bad,"As Qualcomm's patents expire, so does its futures. The company has become bloated with directors, with theorists reinventing the wheel and with divisional cabals where political nepotism trumps all. There are hardware teams whose management would rather ignore problems than solve them. If you are ""in"" then the Qualcomm review could be great; whereas, if you are not then look for limited security and advancement, 7-day work weeks, and mediocre compensation."
bad,"Before you join enquiry about job profile clearly, as most of the job profiles no use in our side world.... Sometime thier job profile description is looking too good but in practical worst job profile... If your a full time employee than atleast you will get pay and other benefits..."
bad,"The group I'm in is very disorganized and separated. All of the different projects are separated out into their own source control (Git, TFS, P4). I worked almost entirely by myself the entire time I was there. There was almost literally nobody to go to with questions. Things are constantly done the wrong way which results in things not working, entire solutions not compiling, simple tasks taking too long, etc. No planning is done whatsoever. I suggested to my boss that we should plan out what will be done and their response was ""We can't change it, this is how it is"". "
bad,The overall management strategy and roadmap is at best questionable. The strategy of winning customers cannot be that the company fights with everyone.
bad,"nothing to share, working extensive hours every day. Hard to get promoted. Fast pace environment. Good bonus and salary. Stocks varies by performance."
bad,The top management have become highly political and irrational. We started not following the established processes and guidelines consistently and uniformly. People who pointed out the problems and made efforts to fix them were given bad reviews since they embarrassed their VPs. You could no longer express your opinion if it was different than your superior.
bad,"Difficult to continue for long time without causing a burnout."
bad,"Work Life balance is less , pressure is much to meet the deadlines, even saturdays are working days for Contractors"
bad,"Qualcomm offers excellent compensation and benefits to high-tech workers, and interesting, challenging, and rewarding work.  However, the work environment is stressful and sometimes toxic due to rampant politics, posturing, and back-biting with some of the employees and the fact that management rewards rather than address this type of behavior."
bad,Good Place to work in top Global MNC's and learning place for future technologies . Nice atmosphere and friendly . lot of stress and deliverables . taking feed back and good communication must be maintained
bad,Staff engineers won't be helping Engineers. In qualcomm Engineers are most likely a test technicians. For that there is no need of Masters degree/
bad,I love to help offer my support to help users with there job. I enjoy the projects that the company has out there and gives me great opportunity to work with so many different people.
bad,Lot of room for learning oppurtunities. Great technical stuff to challenge. favoritism is shown. Not a great place to work anymore.
bad,"Negative atmosphere currently due to lay offs and drop of sales. Lots of acquisition, came via  acquisition of Ikanos."
bad,"Used to be the best employer, but not any more, no life and work balance, too many working culture suck, no fun at all, messy working environment"
bad,"Great pay and benefits, but be prepared to give up a personal life.  Very demanding job with good benefits.  Great if you only want to focus on a work career."
bad,"Alright place to work. Not that great. The employee benefits are all right. Not much growth, nothing much new to learn. The management is not that great."
bad,"Difficult to continue for long time without causing a burnout."
bad,It was a great place to work. Definitely a variety of customer issues. It was my first call center job and I expected something completely different. I ended up leaving due to being relocated from my husband’s job. But I would’ve left the company sooner if I had other employment.
bad,"good worker , bad management , WIFI VPs are  bad example of dictatorship . he has bunch of guys who kiss-up and useless ...Like the senior director who own Verification team and SOC , completely useless and stupid"
bad,"gave me the opportuntity to use my skills as a Marketing Communications guru for global leader in wireless technologies. Help drive marketing campaigns/programs in concert with commercial business and brand strategies for Gobi modem product line with support for  IoE (M2M solutions), embedded computing and RF solutions.great company and benefits"
bad,"I worked for a manager who had been with Qualcomm since the early to mid nineties...so needless to say , he didn't really need to be working anymore.  Hence, he took very laisez faire approach to management and we only had one meeting per week. This sounds good, but it became a little depressing as it felt like I was working in a silo."
bad,VP and Sr Directors are often bullies who demean others. This leads to Senior and Staff level workers emulating the same character as their leads resulting in a heavily siloed environment with middle managers tending to point fingers at others instead of fostering cooperation.
good,My immediate management was poor which was unfortunate but I can't say the same goes for all the groups in qualcomm. I know some people who are in qualcomm for years and enjoying their work which is good.
good,"Great for engineering , no advancement for Marketing. Marketing function is not  valued or understood. The company is going through a tough time right now."
good,"For a non-engineer, Qualcomm offers limited career development opportunities. I also did not appreciate the atmosphere of fear and mistrust between the team members, and unreasonable demands of my boss. Other teams or engineering roles might be more rewarding, but for me it was almost impossible to move to another group. Choose your boss carefully, or you might find yourself in a very tough environment"
good,"The place was a complete H1B sweat shop."
good,"mostly support issues"
good,"They seem to think that people with experience are not as useful as new hires. Since I have experience at small companies, I learned that people with a width breath of experience can see and solve problems better than those without. Their environment doesn't enable people to develop a wide breath of experience, and they don't promote that idea."
good,"Workplace ambiance helps to be very focused and productive, especially the individual cubicles, monitors, seating arrangements. Job encouragement thru awards and promotions."
good,The company is struggling to grow its business. They would have been better if Broadcom had acquired them. There are too many layoffs and employee morale is low. Benefits and salary are less than other tech companies.
good,"Qualcomm is a great company to work for if your an engineer, executive assistant, or in the IT field.  The people are very nice and the atmosphere is great."
good,"Being a big company, it has the typical pros and cons of a conservative company in the tech space"
good,"I enjoyed working with Qualcomm. Learning is good, work/life balance sucks.You can learn and gain experience on everything in this company. the best part is qualcomm arrange classes for its employee."
good,"Consensus driven company, many meetings, and long hours.  Visibility to upper management is high if you are on important projects.  Growth is limited."
good,The fulltime employees resented the contractors because we could take their jobs. There was not often much help to do your job. They also made it understood that you needed to work more than 40 hours / week and made you sign that you would only get paid for 40.
good,"Not a fun employee culture. "
good,The biggest problem I've seen is a lack of support in team involvement. The main thing that I can say about Qualcomm is that they need to rebuild their mindset
good,The colleagues were very helpful and the company had a corporate corporate culture that was very inclusive in the Research and development group. I had many previous colleagues that worked here
good,"I would not recommend this place; a true boys club; limited room for advancement."
good,"Great location, facilities extremely nice. Used to have a lot of perks and benefits, e.g. JCC holiday parties etc. but these are going away with the budget cuts."
good,"I enjoyed working at Qualcomm as it is the leader in the exciting wireless mobile pace and is a very fast-paced company. But management won't spend time on strategy to scale and grow the company, as most of them are basically engineers and will continue to do engineer level work."
good,"People really dont train you here. Expect to be sent right in the line and do your job, without knowing how to do it. Nobody explained to me how to change files, locate correct folder etc.. on the computer. No proper training on the job. Then the lead supervisor would tell the manager that this employee is not learning anything, cant do the job, and cant fully understand the work. How is the employee going to learn if no one really cares to train new hires? Also, if you ask people for help, they would give you a look and then they'll let your manager know that you cant catch up on work and you ask a lot of questions.... Its just not fair for new hires."
good,Pays well but very poor management culture. There is no Identity. Have to be careful which team to join as good teams are very few. Company culture has changed significantly since 2010.
good,I liked the work culture in Qualcomm because work is important than the dressing and way we look doesn't matter and learned how to be careful with candidates who creates problem who stays beside us all the time.
good,"Advancement very difficult.  Doesn't matter how hard you work, it's subjective within your manager.  Always concerned in the back of your mind when the company will re-structure and start lay offs.  Went thru 4 in my 5 years at Qualcomm that I lasted thru, got hit on the 5th one."
good,"The program manager operates in an extremely weak matrix environment.  Our main role was to copy data from one database, into another database, then copy other data back to the original database.  Plus, sit in hours and hours of meetings where you are asked to participate for 2-3 minutes, but need to sit there for 1.5 hours.  "
good,"Good benefits, tough culture.  Seems like the startup-like culture that many of us enjoyed has been taken overtaken by project managers and red tape processes."
good,"- Work life balance will take a toss."
good,Not satisfied with management decision. Need to understand the company policy.I started as contractor and then rolled over as Employee and then layed off in next 6 months.
good,"The interview process was fairly good.  Felt very comfortable with the people I interviewed with."
good,"good place to work in general, understaffed and most people work under deadline across company. some divisions are expanding, random projects need to constantly prioritized."
good,"Flexibility, low wages, and unrewarding.  Management is short sighted and can't prioritize programs. Lack of resources to support all programs.  Regardless of how many hours you put in, there is a high chance the program will get cancelled."
good,"While working here I learned a great new technologies.  With one notable exception.  I wanted to learn about CDMA, but since I worked in business unit(data science), I was denied compensation to learn about CDMA."
good,Qualcomm was a great company when the founder was the CEO. Ever since he retired the company was no longer fun to work for. Moral was just shot down with no longer doing things for the employees and benefits got to be just so mediocre.
good,"asic design flow including verification, implementation, timing closure, product definition. most enjoyable part of job  was working with smart people"
good,"Had great coworkers who I was able to attend the gym with daily if our schedules permitted, however, the job itself didn't award growth opportunities or secure employment due to the economy and lack of Government budget. Since I have a family to raise, job security is key and I would like to have the ability to grow within my position and move forward in my career continuing to support my family and their needs."
good,"It used to be fun - like a startup - but when it became extremely corporate, I think it lost a lot of the fun."
good,The descent has started. Its all downhill from here. The upper management runs around like a headless chicken while the middle management is getting fatter by the day
good,"a lot of smart people work in this organization. However, there's not much interactions among people.  I will not work here as a permanent worker."
good,"A Day at my Work:"
good,"Everyone is really friendly, and I have met some really smart engineers, but unfortunately in my division I feel overworked and underappreciated. My team is great and everyone works really hard to make sure they are doing the best job possible, but management is lacking and I'm starting to really feel burned out."
good,"You have to work really hard and long hours. Company has very tight schedule and under resourced. You have to put a lot of effort, lot of learning but also a lot of figuring out by yourself."
good,"Very stressful project."
good,"Qualcomm has a massive campus and presence in San Diego, but the majority of its revenue come from China. It's a global company with many global initiatives, so travel will likely come up at some point. "
good,"Qualcomm (engineering in San Diego) used to pride itself on being a great place to work - a good work/life balance, lots of team-building activities, social meet-and-greet functions, etc.  Now, it is management-by-metrics and all of the esprit d' corps that was commonplace is gone."
good,"Ample opportunity to work on interesting technologies."
good,"Qualcomm was a great place to work for, however due to Geo shifting and cost cutting measures, focus on innovation is lacking.  Executive focus needs to be on innovation and driving technology as appose to short term savings."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Qualcomm.  It is very stressful and I started at the beginning as a start-up company but over the years it has become like many other companies, unfortunately, you are just a number and way too many politics going on."
good,"It is a place full of brilliant people & brilliant technology with decent outlook. Productivity suffers from management myopia and redtape, business middle management is resistent to changes & ideas for improvement."
good,"As a leading chip company, able to learn new technologies while working. Too o much work requested in daily cycle and also expected work in weekend as well."
good,"It is a great environment for fresh engineers from engineering school. "
good,With so many pending legal and regulatory headwinds the future of the company is uncertain and this leads to uneasiness and added stress in the workplace. Qualcomm is a great company going through a troubled time.
good,"A bad place if you work hard expecting close-to-fair treatment."
good,It's a stressful environment due to a weak program management. Projects were not scheduled accurately. Missing team goals/objectives. There are more managers/leads than developers.
good,Great colleagues to learn from. Enjoyed and learned a lot during 5 years. Had chance to work on cutting edge technology which i enjoyed thoroughly....
good,It's generally considered a company that puts its bottom line before anything else. The employees are constantly fearing layoffs and being replaced by younger workers.
good,12 hour worknights (7pm-730am).  Wednesdays thru Fridays every other Saturdays.  Team dynamic with multi tasking. Provided data for engineer team to analyze.
good,"No comment, was only temporary employee. I did not get to see much of the design, only testing. Worked close to the airport"
good,"lot of work pressure, work pressure is not equally distributed, some teams enjoy a lot and some are working day and night. deadline centric. every one busy, its luck to get good team."
good,This company has lost it's luster.  It was once considered one of the best employers- not anymore. This company hires too many H1B's at expense of US workers to keep salaries low.
good,I enjoyed working at Qualcomm. Fun work place but lots of deadlines to meet. Work never ends here and priority changes quickly.
good,"Not too much to add that hasn't already been said by others. Qualcomm was a good place to work until about 3 years ago. Then the investors decided that R&D was an ""unnecessary expense."" The writing was on the wall."
good,"The first thing that I noticed at this company is they have tons of meetings.  As someone on glassdoor put it, 20% of the people do the work and 80% ask status. Lot of layers of management. Even some engineers end up just tracking status, once promoted to lead or manager. Most of the work is pushed down to junior engineers, who need to spend long hours and weekends to get work done. There's lot of talk and email about work life balance, so there maybe a chance that other groups are better. "
good,Corporate Qualcomm as a whole is a very open and easy company to get integrated in.  I was surprised at the small company feel and ease of integration.  I would love to work in the corporate headquarters.   It would be a joy to come to work and be a really good career move.  
good,"There are good managers and engineers but they lack training. Qualcomm needs to step up their game in taking some of the chaos out of the daily routines for every employee. They really need business improvement or process engineers. People who can look at every group and the way business is run to make it more efficient for everyone.As a new hire I felt overwhelmed with all the information coming at me, I managed to start analyzing everything and creating documents and putting all the pieces together that helped me understand what was required of me. As new employees where hired I was able to help them transition more easily into their roles with all the data I gathered on my first week there. Some of them confided in me that they would have quit had I not been there to help them out."
good,The campus is nice and people seem friendly. There are a lot of benefits to the job amd cultre but there are also cons like most big companies it all depends on what suits you as a person.
good,"If you like to work with cutting edge technology and have the inside scoop of the tech coming down the line, it's a great place to be."
good,"Excitement level to go to work was fair. The mentioned was due to the standard approach of most to come in do your job and go home. This is fine for some businesses but for those in an ever changing customer influenced market, this view will close doors."
good,"Qualcomm tends to be ponderous and resistant to change.  Overall, good ideas are distilled through mechanical processes that render them less impactful."
good,Time to move on to another job outside of Qualcomm.  The past several years have been tough seeing all the changes and friends moving on to other positions.
good,"QC is a good company in general.  A lot of policies were designed to keep the company  a pleasant place to work for.  The facilities are good, there are multiple excellent onsite gyms, and the benefit is good even though it has been reduces gradually.  The operational environment is getting worse and the revenue is declining due to litigations and disputes over the business model of the company with OEM manufacturers.  QC is trying to save cash by cutting the workforce and lots of good people were let go over the last couple of years, which led to instability and low moral in the company.  There is a problem with the company hierarchy, where there are too many layer of managers, but not enough people to do the work.  Hopefully the management realizes the issue and take actions to turn things around, and put the company back on track."
good,"When I started, Qualcomm was one of the top 10 places to work in the country.  Now, it doesn't even make the list.  Benefits have been eroded over the years.  Even in 2008, the company was being run like a startup, now it is being run by activist share-holders who are unable to see past the next 3-month financial report."
good,"not a great place to work anymore. Way too  much politics.  Management has been awful and it is very cliquish.  "
good,"Big company , but no mush job security these days . "
good,"In the beginning, the culture really took an interest in the employees. This made me very loyal to the company. But once the executive changes started taking place, employee support waned and they were handled as business resources instead of humans."
good,"Most employees seem unhappy there. Management is not helpful. The workplace culture is very formal. The company provides competitive wages and great benefits. Not really a diverse place to work. You are  likely to be either a Caucasian male or an Indian male.  Of the population of females working there, 99% of them work in more typical office roles, practically none in tech."
good,"Qualcomm used to be a great place to work but any longer, it isn't. For the last 5 years, we have had the threat of layoffs hanging over our heads and they finally hit home in the latest round of layoffs announced this past April. IT was hit very hard and a majority of our jobs are now being moved to India. I was actually relieved when I got the notice, now I can actually move on with my life. I feel sorry for those that actually still have their jobs as things will not get any better any time soon."
good,"Qualcomm is good at creating new products. But, the culture is spending, without control and thus layoffs every 2yrs of so. You never really new how long you would last."
good,Qualcomm has really changed over the years and there as still a lot of changes to come. My experience over the 8 years was fantastic and rewarding. The transition to manage across multiple geo locations will be a challenging over the next few years.
good,Too political but great if you are a self starter and will get things done on your own.  There are some groups doing really great work.   It's difficult to know prior to taking position if its a good fit.
good,"different kind of nice people,learn a lot from them, doing electronics tech job, soldering. wire wrapping ,cable assembly. radar set up, and how to build cellphone."
good,Every morning we have a team meeting for approximately 5 mins. You will be assigned your work for the day. Most days you will be assigned extra work through out the day. Extremely hard to roll over to full time employee. Majority people are let go after two year contract position. The nice thing is you work 3 days one week and 4 the next.
good,L'environnement de travail était dans une zone industriel cosme a la riche pas très agréable à travaillé
good,"A GREAT company 10 years ago, now just a good company. Competition is fierce, schedules are tight. The company runs too lean with not enough manpower. Pay and Benefits used to be great. Many many cuts in the last 8 years bringing the overall compensation to just decent. Many divisions being pushed overseas, the work culture and diversity is extremely diverse, sometimes causing working issues within the company. Many, many H1B Visas and high turn over. In 13 years I have had 16 Managers! Company consistency and direction changes so much that it lacks actual direction. Company is still trying to find its direction and strong product base."
good,I was stuck editing html pages/ python scripts to parse some custom data. Everyone is friendly and the company is fun. However it was as fulfilling as one might expect.
good,"During my time at QUALCOMM there was a culture of transition that was building, culminating with the transferring of the day to day accounting functions to India. The culture changed dramatically from the time I interned with the company 8 years prior. What was once a San Diego company that was a player in the international business market, with ties to it employees, became a multinational corporation with ties to its bottom line and the stock holders. It is understandable that they went the direction they did, but with the profitability an innovation nurtured through the prior culture I would have suggested a transition period of longer than 2 years."
good,"But due to patent litigation, is losing steam. Benefits are decent. Work life balance has improved over the last few years. If there is a management change, there is some hope for Qualcomm"
good,"Good place to work for Engineers. But, too much work oriented, not much fun activities.Good for Software engineers, depends on the team also. Some team are kind of grey areas"
good,"A wide variety of different projects that are very interesting and exciting."
good,Ok place with good benefits. Upper management holds onto older ideas and ways need more ingenuity. Currently for some an unstable environment. Morale highly affected by this.
good,Fair amount of red-tape today as company has grown exponentially over the years. Some management resistant to change. Good folks in general and hardworking.
good,"good experience. But depends on the lead"
good,"It is a bad time to join Qualcomm these days. However, it is a very good company if job security is enhanced.."
good,I enjoyed working here until he past few years when the stress level rose drastically.  They increased the amount of work required and cut the hours we could work.  I liked the people I worked with and was very sad to leave.  The culture of the company changed over the 8 years I was there.
good,"Each day involves learning atleast one new thing, as everyone is involved in all the activities as well as the individual actions. Friendly and productive  atmosphere"
good,"Qualcomm is a challenging and demanding place to work but if you can manage the workload, stress and deadlines, your job is almost secure. Salary is at the lower end of average but the benefits help compensate for this and exceed other corporations."
good,"Qualcomm provides no training and has such an aggressive release scheduled that I found myself working over 50 hours a week to be pretty normal. During the interviews, they understood that I was an entry level employee with no experience in that kind of corporate environment. When they let me go on 4/18 the said it was because my work ethics were entry level. I asked for six more months, saying that I would come out of it with better 'ethics', but they denied the request. They dropped into a high-priority project and seemed to ignore the fact that I delivered what they wanted, saying that I did it the 'maverick' way, not the Qualcomm way. But they failed to properly teach me, pointing me to outdated wikipedia articles and 'community' pages. Do not work for this company if you a contractor, they will use you."
good,•a typical day at work
good,"I have mixed feelings about this company. On one hand, Qualcomm is leading the way to the future, and employs many of the worlds best in the industry. And, its exciting to work there. On the other hand, public humiliation, ineffective management, and a culture throwing people under the bus to save oneself is more common than not. In addition, many of the engineers come to Qualcomm right out of school, and lack the maturity, and insight to manage everyday activities. Most of the bright and shinning stars leave, and the ones that stay are promoted, and eventually to ""Director of so and so"" I saw more grown men pitch temper tantrums, than both of my sons did when they were 2!"
good,"Some REALLY talented people working for the good of the company! Leadership challenges the staff on status quo.  Emphasis on ""minorities"" for leadership rather than talent does create an environment where there is no equal opportunity to grow."
good,"Pays well, Sluggish growth, no long term vision."
good,"Challenging, lot to learn, but no growth. This is particular to my team only. There is a lot of scope to learn about stuff, but at the end of the day, I felt undervalued."
good,"Your experience at Qualcomm is highly dependent on the team you are on.  Many teams are dysfunctional and strong management skills are not rewarded. As a result, if you are under poor management, you can get stuck in a bad project with little to no ability to correct the issues at hand."
good,"I enjoy working at Qualcomm but it is not what it use to be.  The promotions are limited, yet there is still much freedom to learn.  Unfortunately, the priorities keep changing so the work you did 6 months ago may no longer be necessary."
good,"Technology-centric company with incompetent management that lacks vision! Working here for the last 12 years and seen the company grow from strength to strength. However, things have gone downhill in the previous two years with no sight of revival."
good,"Now, it is hard to get into a good project / team. Many jobs are transfered to Indian, US works are losing their jobs. This is not the same company 5-10 years ago."
good,It was fun to work Qualcomm. A large number of people are employed via CWF and no career path for them at all. Poor pay rate for CWF employees and unnecessary 3 months break in service after every 2 years.
good,The company needs new and younger leaders to help the growth of the company. Older management weed out people for job security. If it continues this path there is only so much growth to be allowed.
good,"great work life balance with gym, swimming pool, and basketball and volleyball courts. Plenty of high-tech projects happening in parallel which can make the company exciting for tech lovers."
good,"a typical work day there at Qualcomm is fast past production line. Once you clock in , you will be chasing your tail. For me I love this type of work, you keep yourself busy and with an blink of an eye . You are ready to go home for the day. The overtime is wonderful its like an all you can eat buffet. I worked pretty much every day for nine months 12 to 16 hours. Though i could tell you the management was very poor . they don;t care what you do , it's all about their bonus"
good,Qualcomm is a good place to work if the team supports you. But they need to provide better bonus and salary to retain talent. It all depends on the team in which a person works.
good,"Pros"
good,"They give you a chance to prove yourself at a different line of work, if you're willing."
good,Qualcomm uses state of the art financial systems and processes and will enable you to advance your career potential. Work-life balance continues to be an issue.
good,Where I started my career. I started out as a clerk and moved my way up the corp ladder. Became a secretary and learned the trade and my future.
good,"Good while it lasts. Retention is an issue. There are not enough permanent position for the company to retain good temps, only two per year across 4 shifts."
good,Pure Technical organisation gives exposure in telecom domain with expertise in this domain. Modem level testing and development gives in and out of modem stack of various domains.
good,"* Work with smart people, who will try to bring up to speed with technology."
good,"	Ran current drain test suit on different commercial devices like iPhone5, Samsung Galaxy S4, Motorola Mini, LG Optimus etc as well as internal devices on GSM, WCDMA,LTE networks for optimization before launching in to the market and also to do competitive analysis with other commercial devices."
good,"On the technical side, the job was very interesting and I learned a lot about 802.11. However, the program management was very weak and the company culture seemed to have very little understanding of proper software development practices. Also, given that culture, it was very difficult to improve the software infrastructure."
good,"Hardware company with software teams."
good,"Great work culture. Some of the policies are bit weird."
good,"Qualcomm started out as the best place to be. The management and employees were very driven and cooperative to achieve success. As the company grew, the politics of greed and favoritism started to grow as well. Overall, it's still a good place to work. However, it's not a good place to advance, grow and make money. "
good,"Company pays well and benefits are excellent, but it is not a fair company. They tend to hire a lot of family members and if you're not one of them, then you don't count. Getting promoted is very inconsistent with whichever division you work for. One assistant may support 13 people and get same pay as an assistant that supports over 100 people."
good,"I worked at Qualcomm for more than a year"
good,"Fast paced work in Qualcomm but overall nice experince to  learn new cutting edge technology, Multiple projects pipelined , need skills to keep up with the speed"
good,"Although the people were nice enough, there was a lack of training as well as communication which made it diffficult to get the job itself finished. I maintained a fairly usual work flow"
good,Great place to apply your talents and develope yourself. Poor management don't have the skills to grow their employees; but low pay for the amount of hours required to work. Dispatchers aren't road savvy so they push driver beyond their limits and sometimes take off load if they feel dissatified with a driver.
good,company is Good. staff are friendly and co-operative. Management is also good. Overall it is ok. I am working since 3 years in this organization. I am happy to work in this.
good,"Good place to work and there is place to grow in your career, Good management with the joyful part of the work."
good,"No benefits to contract employees. Worked the same amount as a full time employee but paid hourly. Overall the atmosphere was great, but wish they had converted me to an FTE."
good,Qualcomm is a good place to work. The team structures and management are well organized. you are given a team lead and a line manager. This helps to keep your technical and managerial issues separate.
good,Uncertain at this time...I don't know exactly what to say about this just yet. I need more time.  It is an interesting place to work but there are uncertainties.
good,"It’s a great company."
good,Good workplace for fresh graduates' first jobs. work life balance is really bad for some engineering department. remote meetings in the evening to work with international locations.
good,Management was able to work around my schedule but became an easy target for layoff candidate. It became apparent that it was difficult for my team to be open to new ideas after several management changes.
good,"Not the best time to join Qualcomm, but its relatively a stable company with job security..."
good,"Good Work Life balance, Good manager, Talented people, Average Management Team, Band Marketing, Good Engineer, Lot of Poeple Laid off, Good 5 G Technology"
good,Was a good company to work for with good benefits until new management decided to outsource everything to India to pay a cheaper price.  Quality of work suffered because of it.  The knowledge was not the same.
good,"good place to work, Dymanic team collaboration, Good compensation and benefits, very well defined management, job work life balanced. Strong Security and"
good,"Team members open to sharing information and new ideas. Training and support provided to new team members. Access to cross-functional teams as needed,"
good,"Typical Day at work: Mostly not stressful"
good,Qualcomm is a good company to learn and work with many teams and stakeholders. It provides classes about new technology and new features being developed.
good,Qualcomm is a good place to work. The diversity is great. A typical day would be signing in guest. The most enjoyable part of working for Qualcomm is the people.
good,"I have been working at Qualcomm (More than 5 years)"
good,Qualcomm is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company that designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services. It derives most of its revenue from chipmaking and the bulk of its profit from patent licensing businesses.
good,Good direct management. Minimal interaction with executives. cannot rate them. Good team. Challenging work. Good diversity. Skilled employees. Helpful.
good,"Stressful most days with unrealistic deliverables without outlining clear benefits and reason for deliverables."
good,"Overall company is great. QRef dept needed some restructuring or maybe just some new management. "
good,"Provides optimum exposure on how different components inside mobile devices function."
good,"Being at Qualcomm for 10 years, I would like to say that it has been a great experience so far. I started with humble beginnings where my scope was rather limited to software BIT and gradually expanded it to involve a lot more firmware design, development and bring-up. "
good,"It's not a bad place to work.  Good technology but not the best processes.  If you want to work on the latest modem tech, this is the best place to be."
good,"good company to work .. typical day at work is full of design discussions and debugging on live setups , collaboratively work with teams spanned across geographies ."
good,"Qualcomm has great technology, somewhere around 2,000 patents. The entire company has top-notch people. It is a great place to work, even if it is quick-paced."
good,"Compensation/Benefits and Advancement seem to be a major focus on engineering vs other business units. Work life balance depends on the size of your dept. Some departments are funded very well while others seem to struggle even if needed,"
good,"As a growing and aging tech company will do, the stockholders have taken over and slowly taken away all the good things that make working for such a fast pace/stressful company worth while. Turnover has increased steadily over the last few years."
good,"Everyone is a ""lifer"". Would not recommend to young engineers. Good part is most people are competent, but managers tend not to care. Promotions from Engineer to Senior Engineer is mostly time dependent regardless of contributions."
good,Management Does not value talents. There are lot of ups and downs in the company. No clear direction. Seems it is a sinking boat. Senior leaders are arrogant to listen
good,"I have been working at Qualcomm full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,As overall good company to work including various benefits but nothing exceptional as such. Big company issues but also some of the benefits as well..
good,"Company don't give any extra money and health care for ppl who handle chemical all day, shift 12 hours. Salary Not fair to employee who Working already 2years"
good,I was worked in company from 2010 to 2015.work weather was cool and Team supported to learn new things developement in depts. But i want to tell one thing when you work here you'll be feel happy..and you will work anywhere...thanks to my old staff
good,"It was great working with Qualcomm.I worked with very good people around and learned new technologies like FINFETS and worked on 10nm,14nm,16nm layouts."
good,"Good Company, nice building in Raleigh but to many meetings with"
good,I worked in the manufacturing dept that supported engineering projects. It was a good place to learn and work on the latest projects that Qualcomm was an industry leader in.
good,"Modified and maintained a 3000 KW and 4500 KW cogen plant by performing PM's and modifying existing equipment to"
good,Good company to start your career. Work life balance is not good. High expectations from management. Going through layoffs now.
good,"You will be working night, day, weekends, 24/7/365 - you will have NO LIFE whatsoever. "
good,"I worked at QCOM for 8 years. For the first 5 years I was employed at QCOM, I enjoyed my job. The last three have been killers. Due to lack of management skills, poor planning, or last minute design changes, it seems as though everything had to be done in a rush. Many employees were required to work well over 10 hrs. per day, and weekends. Time constraints led to a tendency to cobble things together and hope it all worked, just to meet a deadline (--not the ideal environment if you are hoping to build a superior product.) What I learned is that if you really want to do cutting edge coding, you can't work for a chip manufacturer. Also, engineers are consistently undervalued in a workplace that encourages cutthroat politics among management. I actually liked the vast majority of my engineering coworkers. Most were much younger, and very enthusiastic. It's not a bad environment for people who are just out of school, and who may not be sure in which direction they want their careers to evolve, but who can't afford the uncertainty of working at a start-up. Salary and benefits were good, but now that cost-cutting has been implemented, perhaps not so much. The hardest part of the job was attempting to secure the cooperation of various Balkanized factions within the company for time-sensitive projects--which I usually managed to do; but that's one of the reasons I left management. Most enjoyable part of the job was the assignee position at Linaro. This was a company that did kernel development the way it was intended to be! (IMO.)"
good,"It is such a nice experience working with Qualcomm i reaslly admire the work culture and people"
good,"work on projects and the ticket queue"
good,Good benefits. Cutting edge technology. Work hard and play hard sums it up pretty well.
good,"amerikanisches Unternehmen mit Unternemssprache Englisch, befristeter Arbeitsvertrag, gute Produkte und Lösungen, sehr gutes Know-How"
good,"good to work"
good,"Interesting work in the field of forecasting and reporting. Great products. good benefits."
good,"Nice company to work for. Cutting edge technology to work with."
good,"Too much work, too few staff."
good,"From its beginnings in 1985, Qualcomm has grown from seven individuals meeting in a den to a world-leading provider of wireless technology and services. Qualcomm is a global company, a firm with many facets, with each business division changing the way we live and work through its own unique contributions. But no matter what each Qualcomm business does, all are united by a single, driving passion: to continue to deliver the world’s most innovative wireless solutions."
good,Great work
good,"You can learn more, but recognition is far from existing as you may find zillions with your kind of skills."
good,I am an RF technician at Qualcomm Inc. for 7 years I Help the Company Save good amount of money by discovering how to Repair one of the IC chips (Flash) wich I enjoy the most.
good,"Its a technology oriented company, great place to learn technical stuff. Also work environment is flexible."
good,Was a good company but outsourced most of the business. Poor job security
good,"casual of a big company, big gym, stressful but stable ... always work on new technology, new tools"
good,"Good management, challenging projects. Fast-paced environment, makes you busy all the time. Work on cutting-edge technology. Sacrifice on work-life balance."
good,"Not too demanding; flexible. It was a good place to begin a career, but the management was lacking and there were limited opportunities for advancement if you were not an engineer."
good,"Really cool workplace with lot of opportunities, fun at work, lot of learning and developments, standard benefits and except for the management is poor, Qualcomm as a workplace is enjoyable."
good,"Its a good place where managers and supervisors are not standing over you. You are given a task and expected to perform it. "
good,"This was once a great place to work! Benefits, work/life balance and feeling of worth. Not the same as it used to be. A lot of geo-shifting and mismanagement as of late. Hopefully, it will return to its original glory."
good,I've grown and learnt a lot technically working at Qualcomm. The hands on experience I've gained here is very valuable. It also offers a good health plan for employees. Team events and team outings are enjoyable.
good,Very little work/life balance.  Worked extensive hours late into the night and on weekends.  Expected to work through vacation days.  Management was old fashioned and did not believe in working offsite and supported outmoded technology.
good,"A great place to work with free gym and soda.  Can be challenging sometime, as you are always in learning mode.  There is at least 1 meeting each day.  Everything is fast pace."
good,"The crown jewel of San Diego has gotten a little tarnished during my half-tenure. 10 years ago it would have been a great place to build a career. Now ( at least if you are in IT ) I would avoid it. You will be stuck working on legacy applications that no one knows how they work. There will be a layoff every 6 months. Sorry Qualcomm, I guess I had higher expectations...."
good,"Qualcomm was a great workplace in the beginning and then things started to take a turn. Work morale lowered year after year with the feeling the company was stagnant. My group, at least, provided a great work-life balance. They could have used the recent cuts to weed out the weaker staff, but they did not. They let go go of some strong employees. Hopefully things turn around for the company soon."
good,Work life balance is minimal. Opportunity to handle critical things despite the designation. Full ownership of work. Expected to work on weekends and on official leaves.
good,"good company to express my ability."
good,"Almost all engineers I have met in these years have been easy to get along with. People do not have that large ego you see in certain other companies. "
good,"Qualcomm has been dynamic and creative.  Since 2015 it fell of the rails a bit, as it has tried to establish itself in new markets.  It has been a case of give and take as it went through three layoffs since its up to 2015 period of excellence."
good,"According to old-timers, company used to be great, but the culture & morale have been deteriorating consistently for a few years.  Benefits are merely mediocre."
good,"Gained lots of technical knowledge and experience."
good,"Highly competitive work environment and many people work very long hours. There was and still have unfair treatment of female staff, and a clear unfair pay. To combat that, Qualcomm is now pushing for a lower title/job grade but at the higher salary range. It also seem like Qualcomm is doing regular small quaterly layoffs to avoid paying a large severance and give employee prior notice as required by California state law!"
good,I enjoyed my crew that i worked with but the training was a little subpar. But overall i enjoyed my time with the company my managers and its atmosphere.
good,"I would considered average, Its a legitimate company to work,"
good,Qualcomm Life has some good market opportunities and good product development.   The company needs some big wins to keep the revenue going to hit the big opportunities that are out there.
good,Very good work culture and very smart people to work with. There is a lot of ares to learn and excel. There is very good work life balance.
good,"Very productive, traveling to different building through out the day.  We also set up events in different location at the bay or the beach some times and we worked a lot of over time."
good,Many teams are not good to work. They have great resources to learn. Management has too much politics and not going in right direction.
good,"Being within IT gives good satisfaction that you are keeping people productive and helping with any issues. The downside, as with any IT position, is the looming ""outsourcing"" which makes the environment depressing when rumors start to spread."
good,"A lots of work. Frequent meetings and collaborations.."
good,Overall a good subsidiary or division of Qualcomm. Good Benefits from San Diego Main Corp. New Technology - Mechanical Display.
good,This is awesome work place for telecom research ; flexibility is good ; work life balance is good as it has lots of gym/tennis/volleyball facilities ; ok management
good,"I have been work in production smt and post smt area. And what i learned is that :) No matter how hard you work or how good you are. You will not have a place or climb the ladder to better position in this company. Why ? Because this area only raise their relative. Even that person is so bad. Go out smoking 15 min every hour and always on phone they still give him a title as cover leader just because he has work here for more than 15 years. New people won't has a chance. So funny how qualcomm always promo on their ads is ""looking for bright future"" or better technology in future. But the way they run this area is old work been lazy and took credit of temp people and got raise. New people always wrong. If you want to look for a place that impressive your work then look some where else. If you want just to work slow and got good money here it is."
good,"I spent 14 years at Qualcomm, progressing from Engineer to Senior Engineer, to Staff Engineer. My role changed many times as we moved from project to project supporting the changing nature of the business."
good,"Lot to learn, fast paced working environment. Very smart engineers. Lack of  good leadership. Very low work life balance. Too much legal trouble on licensing front."
good,"Great co-workers!   Executive team seems to be struggling to find the right direction.  Serious cost-cutting, job reductions and ongoing legal issues are distracting."
good,if one focuses well they can learn a great deal in a day at work in Qualcomm. Work culture is co-operative and competitive at the same time. A little better management would help.
good,"5G technology, 7nm chipset."
good,"Job security."
good,"Good place to work with stable career and good compensation. Top heavy and lot of routine work, with relatively less opportunity to innovation. Work life balance is okay but sometimes can be quite hectic with lot of pressure."
good,"the best part of working for Qualcomm is the relaxed dress attire.  Otherwise it is very competitive and its all about who you know. It used to be so much more, people used to care about each other and help each other, now it's to each's own.  Sink or swim attitude. It's really quiet not a lot of management or peer communication."
good,"Very good place to start as an Intern.Various events have been conducted to improve the culture and to promote view of the company among Interns."
good,"I prefer not to review working at Qualcomm because I was only there for a short time."
good,"it's impressive there are many top engineers in its industry who work even harder than what you expect. this is good to the employer but life work balance is frustrated. Plus, you will find more than half of your coworkers are from India which is uncommon for such a big US company. That means if you have more hurdle in seeking promotion if you are not either Indian or white."
good,"Some very smart people to work with."
good,"Nice experience working for Qualcomm."
good,"On a normal day, there is atleast one status meeting. Then it is followed by a series of debugging sessions on issues. If you are part of good teams, you can get to work on challenging activities which might include filing patents."
good,"A good working environment. People dedicated to help support one another - a team player."
good,The company had a lot of great achievements over many years but dont see the trend continuing. Management/leadership has made it difficult to grow based on your contribution/skills.
good,"I joined Qualcomm in 1995 and remained with the company almost 20 years (if you don't count an interval when the business unit I was in was sold and its employees were expected to help the buyer get up to speed). Looking at Qualcomm today, it's hard to see traces of the features that made the company so special in its earlier days."
good,"good place to work"
good,Divested its handset and infra businesses to focus on silicon and IP
good,Good balance between professional and personal life.Office environment is good with supporting colleagues. Office hours are flexible and vary depending on your work.
good,Fast paced work. And little work life balance. Good benefits. Gets boring after a time. Little managerial problems. Too much extra curricular other than work
good,"Good working experience but Industry has matured. Management is struggling to expand into adjacent markets. Plus, this is top heavy company, so career advancement opportunities are minimal."
good,"It was an OK place to work, I was on a contract. They pigeon hole you so you do specific tasks the Qualcomm way, the break-rooms and restrooms are nice!"
good,Awesome benefits.  Great company to work for.  Great cafe's inside of some of the buildings made it nice at times. It made it nice to make the wages I was making at Qualcomm and living in California.
good,Nice place to start your career or if you are early in your career. Not much of work/life balance and work culture is not very professional in certain teams.
good,"Good work culture, people will always help you out. Nice company to work for or give a start to your career. But as per my personal opinion not a great company to pursue one's career as because though it started with the vision of innovation, it's current operation is only concerned with market domination and sustenance without any focus on innovation and growth.And yes, poor management."
good,"CSR (Cambridge Silicon Radio) was a giant in bluetooth area. In peak time, it took 90% bluetooth market share in the world. It still sets the bluetooth standard in the industry. Now it was acquired by Qualcomm in 2015. "
good,"25 years into a steep growth curve in cellular phone chip business, and what made Qualcomm rich until 5 years ago is no longer working.  The company has a lot of smart people.  Management is not shy about believing they are smarter than everyone else and that they should be paid millions of dollars per year.  But there are plenty of resources and plenty of interesting technical jobs."
good,"Qualcomm is good place to learn about leading technology."
good,"Good pay . Employee Average age is in 30's . "
good,"Good place to learn and have fun. Management is good and encouraging however there is lot of focus on out-sourcing .. "
good,"Opportunity to work with multidisciplinary teams."
good,"Job outsourcing bankrupts work ethics. Too much time wasted in taking care of issued tickets blindly assigned to your name by those who hired oversea not yet know what to do and try to ask around for contact, direction, technical knowhow, design flow, etc."
good,"Bureaucratic, political, bleeding edge tech. Very clique centric. WiFi division driven from overseas. Apt to mismanage resources and RIF if they misjudge."
good,"Each department is different & everything changes."
good,good to work with qualcomm need to enhance my knowledge in software industry so looking for another opportunity. They will provide Break fast and lunch as a complementary
good,"cutting edge technology"
good,Qualcomm was a nice place to work. The employees are cordial to each other. They flew my wife to a sales meeting in California. Technology was a bit outdated though.
good,"Extremely challenging workplace: with the compression of reducing both IT capital and operational expenses, the pressure was always on to find new ways to complete tasks and job requirements."
good,"I like the company overall, but given its an stablished hardware company, it does not the flexibilities that younger software companies have. Also seems like they had a lot of money and mismanagement made many parallel efforts."
good,"Engineers work on cutting edge technologies.People are passionate."
good,"Not as structured as my prior employee (IBM).  Have some processes in place, but could benefit by more structure and adherence to processes; however, there's a fine balance between that and productivity/creativity which Qualcomm excels."
good,The marketing organization inside Qualcomm does not appreciate any dissenting voices or opposing views. Everything has to be done by consensus. Those who drive things forward aggressively to actually get things done are discouraged.
good,"this is place for hard working people. Team work is necessary."
good,A Good place to work. But the management stresses more on execution than innovation. Good benefits and learning curve due to high demand on time to market.
good,This position was very new. It was fun and creative. I loved what I did. The opportunity was one that was challenging but very rewarding. I learned a lot.
good,"Great benefits, and good RSU and stock option.One of the best health benefit plans. Hectic work schedule before release, but you can get time some off between projects. Flex timeoff."
good,"1. There is great scope of learning."
good,Company has been transitioning or consolidating jobs to foreign countries to meet a financial plan established in 2015.  Result is layoffs in US and UK offices.
good,Salary is good. Compensation in terms of RSUs is also good. Flexible timing. WFH policy is there. But there is no work life balance.
good,"1. Had the opportunity to work with some smart and humble people. "
good,Good Company to work for when you start your career. Lots to learn. Fast paced work environment. Issues must be solved the same day.
good,"I have had a very progressive stay at Qualcomm. Right from picking up new skills technically to getting into core managerial activities, my learning curve has been very steep upwards."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Qualcomm is the interaction with very smart and friendly people. it makes the day very productive and fun.
good,"Great place to work, lot of new learning, good team work"
good,All is good Worklife balance Excellent for Learning and Career Growth. State of the art technology in telecommunications. Great SoC IP team. Excellent hardware and software applications team.
good,I worked with this company for over 1 year but during the transition from CSR to Qualcomm and also working through the BSI ISO accreditation process.  Worked with some very nice and friendly people in a relaxed environment.
good,"Qualcomm went from being one of the most innovative, creative places to work to a culture of fear and internal competition.  The culture became defeated as employees were forced to train their replacements and continually stand by as their peers were let go.  There was terrific support for internal information sharing and learning opportunities, including paid for training and education, for many of the years that I worked there."
good,"It is an exciting place to work only because the work is always highly technical and always cutting edge. However, the office politics and the utter lack of work culture can cut the deal."
good,Very mentally stimulating environment.  You work with very advanced technology in an exciting business area.   Employees are treated well and the working environment is very good.
good,long days. intense. lots of travel. very technical. strong engineering culture. centralized decision making. diverse team. politics is common. moral varies by team.
good,"Challenging, a lot of fun, a lot of opportunity to get new skills and knowledge. Easy to work, luxury offices, the most advance tools always available."
good,"Boss and team/group you work in sets tone - open culture, flexible work-personal life balance, individual freedom to pursue various options (depends on boss) and cannot complain about living in San Diego."
good,"Qualcomm is a great place to learn new technology with many nice colleagues.  And Qualcomm provides good benefits to its employees.  Overall, it's a good company to work for."
good,"The work pace wasn't consistent. I sat through long periods of underutilization interspersed with very stressful tight deadlines. They pay very well though, on the bright side."
good,"Might be I join the company at the time that no one in the group is good enough, Don't learn too much from them even the pay is good but the work is boring"
good,"Great place to work and really enjoy working till last year."
good,"Good overall work environment with convenient access to food (cafe and coffee) and onsite gym at main campus in San Diego. Depending on position, flexible schedules are accommodated."
good,"Your experience will vary greatly based on your team"
good,It was wonderful learning experience in the fast paced environment. Handled multiple Product Lines (PLs) and kept busy to the last day. Enjoyed being a valuable team lead to work with talented team.
good,Qualcomm was a great ride through the glory years as a technology innovator.  It still has good prospects as a product company however the vibe has changed.  Looking forward to seeing how QC prospers post-Apple settlement.
good,"People are focused on getting the work done.  Many smart hard working people there.  Work done at QUALCOMM is on cutting edge technology.  To advance you need to work very hard, and it's important to enjoy what you are doing."
good,No chance for a rollover with the headcount issues they were having. Work / Life balance was out of balance. Worked here 2 years and let go for 90 days then brought back and still did not get hired.
good,"Qualcomm - Established lifelong connections and professional work relationships. Company-like family, gained valuable technical skills applicable, portable and transferable skills from a variety of knowledge and experience"
good,"Qualcomm is a good place to learn and work; Good team work and I learned a lot on multiple systems."
good,Qualcomm has lots of technical expertise and they work on cutting edge IP.  The work place is very supportive of young talent. It provides good learning opportunities for people new to the industry
good,"Good company to work for but has since gotten too big and too bureaucratic."
good,Qualcomm is a great place to work. Company had great culture and employee benefits. Focus of work/life balance and allows plenty opportunities to advance ones carrier.
good,"Great place to work, great projects and very competent colleagues but consolidation in the industry leads to high uncertainty. Top management inadequate for a company of this size and complexity"
good,"interesting meetings with very inspiring content and people."
good,Qualcomm provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn and collaborate with other like minded engineers. Work ethics are highly valued here. My clients and previous manager always appreciated and encouraged me for my contributions by means of yearly reviews and awards. My suggestions on technical and non technical aspects were always valued by my team and clients.
good,"lack of management in work flow. too many unproductive meetings consumes a lot of time."
good,"I would recommend it to a young person with the support of their parents because it takes years for lower paid people to get a permanent job, but once you are in, it offers many benefits."
good,"Qualcomm is a very good place to work.  A great place to work if you want to invent or implement bleeding edge technology.  Matrix reporting structure allowed moving to new areas of technology within the company.  Qualcomm seems to be searching for direction to maintain margins and revenue since the phone market is getting saturated and high speed wireless is becoming more of a commodity.   Sadly, they have progressively outsourced more and more jobs outside the US."
good,Good company dealing with a maturing technical area. Need to find a way to reinvent themselves if they want to sustain margins and growth. Difficult to do because management is driven by engineers and lawyers rather than business people.
good,"good place to work, advance knowledge and career"
good,"Most people have to go through Manpower to get into Qualcomm. It's really hard to get rolled over though because of the low amount of reqs available. So they get you by signing a 2 year contract with Manpower. Releasing you for 3 months. Then bringing you back for another 2 yr contract. All that time with the promise that you'll get rolled in but without ever seeing any benefits, etc."
good,"If you do not work in an area that positively effects the bottom line (adds to the profit margin), then you will be considered secondary in all aspects. Otherwise, great people to work with and with luck one can move into one of the profitable areas of software development."
good,"It was productive and great learning experience."
good,"Qualcomm is very, very people oriented and highly competitive. The chances for contract security, present within the framework of the company, is very unlikely for advancement."
good,"As a software developer testing out the Qualcomm Dragonboard and other hardware being released, I worked with my team on finding uses that consumers might be able to capitalize on. The work was interesting, although definitely fast-paced."
good,"Had awesome time working at Qualcomm."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Good company with positive culture."
good,"Great company and workplace. Employees are very cooperative,"
good,"working with customers and cross functional development, support and business units. Offfers a variety of tasks and are rewarded for success."
good,One of the best jobs I have ever had. Qualcomm takes really good care of its people and I would work there again in a heartbeat. More companies should model themselves after them!!!
good,"Nice Work Culture and Good Management."
good,"Flexible work environment. Learnt a lot of new technologies, management is great and very co-operative. Co-workers are very friendly and willing to share knowledge"
good,My first experience in this company in drive testing especially i get chance to work in verizon wireless on the their software.management so good .good quality of work .
good,"Good Benefits: 401K, ESPP, healthplans , and facilities"
good,"Qualcomm brand is known for excellent benefits. Because of the changing trends benefits are getting down. Work/Life balance totally dependent on team, not dependent on company. Job security is moderate because of changing trends."
good,"Qualcomm is a great place to work for someone who is able to focus on the technical parts of their job and doesn't look up too often to see where their effort fits into the big picture."
good,Salary was on par with what other companies pay in Silicon Valley. But you get to live in beautiful San Diego! Bi-annual bonuses and merit increases RSU bonuses although those will be dwindling down in terms of numbers of RSUs given out Didn't have to pay any premiums for family healthcare (It changed later in 2015 and now employees have to pay for their spouses)
good,"Good worklife balance, great benefits. Lots of work assignment. Many teams internally to move around in depending on what work we want to do."
good,Good work life balance. CEO change has changed the culture at Qualcomm and not for the better. Tend to let people who work harder than most go simply because they figure they will have an easier time finding another job.
good,"I have worked at Qualcomm for 12 years and have enjoyed working here. I have enjoyed working with my co-workers. They are very smart and skillful. "
good,"Qualcomm is a great place to work at, but you should know how to move up. You will find colleagues with great technical skills who remain on same position for a longtime.."
good,"Fun Place to work with supporting tech leads. Colleagues are good and it is fun to collaborate. Technology path is good, every engineer opinion counts in to make decision and progress."
good,The pace in Q is not so fast but as contractor you have tons of things to do. Believe that full-time position will be much better.
good,"Typical day at work is extremely busy, mostly with many working meetings throughout the day that leaves time to work only in the evenings/weekends. Very high schedule pressure. Need to give very frequent status updates to the management that increases overhead further."
good,"The work is ok, the management is ok, the job is not too hard. "
good,They have excellent benefits. Qualcomm has a family friendly atmosphere and very relaxed working enviroment. I highly recommend checking them out.
good,Qualcomm was a typical high-tech place to work. Good salary and bonuses but focused on the wrong things. Employee satisfaction turns a backside to playing nice with China.
good,"Always learning new things."
good,"Its a good company to work for."
good,"The last team I was on at Qualcomm was stellar. We worked hard, shared information and learned many new techniques and tools we utilized in our department."
good,"Involved in LTE related work."
good,Diverse workforce and many opportunities for team and individual contributions.
good,"Make a list of the tasks I want/need to accomplish for the day, and integrate the things that come up unexpectedly. use the list as a guide and reminder to help keep you on task."
good,"Qualcomm is a wonderful place to work.  It is best to be in their main San Diego offices.  I worked in many different divisions and held many different titles.  I performed a great variety of work and was able to innovate, be a team player, get my deliverables done on time.  They offer excellent benefits."
good,"Technically a great company."
good,"Fun work environment and good  learning experience"
good,"The company has huge number of projects. A normal day will be pretty busy fixing bugs, implementing and delivering new features with very close deadlines. There is plenty of room to learn new stuff if you are self motivated."
good,Good company to start your career with. they deal with world class technologies and you get hands on experience with them
good,Working with highly motivated professionals made me learn great things and develop strong knowledge.
good,"Testing on Emulators"
good,It is an ideal place to work. One gets to work on the latest technology. Learns many things. Interacts with other teams. 
good,Definitely an employer of choice and Fortune 100! Great place for anyone innovative and ambitious.
good,"I have been working in this company from last 2 years.Its really nice to work there,very good working environment is there to work for."
good,"Great place to work for, from both professional and personal growth point of view."
good,"Its good to work here , but I am not getting work of my experience and interest"
good,"The typical experience at Qualcomm was not at all complicated . the standard job there was to be the food prep/food distributor, and clean up. Two people worked as cashiers as two other people took their costumers orders."
good,"I joined Qualcomm through an acquisition of CSR.  I would say that the epicenter of the company is in San Diego, and as I worked remote, it was difficult to stay connected to HQ.  My team was dispersed, which was fine, but for such a large company, it is easy to understand how one can feel disconnected.  I enjoyed my time there, and would work there again."
good,Qualcomm is a great organization however I was not given the opportunity to advance. As a women in tech doing contract work you find yourself in ambiguous situations. I believe the if the right people or in the right position to succeed the impossible becomes the possible. If Qualcomm was to focus on how to help the new generation lead I think that is key to any organization's future.
good,"Excellent people, great products and willingness to try new things even if the odds of success are low.  This was before the contraction, have not heard much about things there since."
good,Work will be so reaponsible and work life balance is depends on each Team and designation. Good work though and its good for an individual who would like to learn
good,This internship was a great look into the world of technology. WHile working I got to test new phones and applications before they reached the global market.
good,"Working for a larger corporation, the average employee often gets overlooked.  The health benefits were great, unlimited vacation time and sick pay.  The hours were very flexible and we could come and go as we pleased.  However, many tasks and expectations were very time consuming which actually caused us to work long hours.  As time went on, we started to lose head count and more and more was expected out of us.  Also, the upper management has no idea what the details are in achieving results and therefore, someone in my position often got overlooked."
good,It was a great place to work for.   Enjoyed my tenure there.   Lot of scope for career advancement and very good compensation for the hard work people put in.   Work Life balance is not good.
good,"A large number of opportunities available!  There are still challenges with promoting and adopting new ideas from a culture perspective.  There is hesitation for taking risks, especially with unfamiliar tech."
good,"The company is Ok, but a bit slow moving to new products development. In general people are good there. I can't say it's really fun to work there. No ping pong table -:)"
good,Amazing place to work on the latest technologies and grow your skills. The work is complex with so many parts and you have a chance to understand and work with many components.
good,"Qualcomm Santa Clara campus has an onsite gym, open to all employees 24 hour 7 days. Besides all of the machines seen in other gyms, there is also a table tennis room. There are also basketball courts in the parking lot and a mini-golf field in front of the reception building. Volleyball court can be set on the grass field."
good,Learned a lot while I was there.  I enjoyed having access to fitness centers.  Nice cafeteria and the staff was very nice.  I was let go without completing my assignment which was very disappointing.
good,"Overall, a good company to work for.  Company is currently expericincing some challenges both internally and regulatory which drives uncertainty and stress."
good,"Solid business processes are in place at the top level. The mainstream programs are very large and are well managed in general. The company culture is heavy on meetings. Being a global company with global customers, there is always an opportunity to work with someone in person or virtually. While this can be good, many employees are allowing themselves to have quite poor work/life mix."
good,Qualcomm employs some of the brightest engineering minds in the world.  Employees are encouraged to push the limits of technology. The work is challenging and the goals are aggressive but the products are something to be proud of.
good,Good people and good environment to work in. friendly co-workers. The  culture is accepting and inviting to all. Over all great place to work. The hardest part of the Job is Training. Qualcomm does not provide training manuals. It is all as they call tribe-able knowledge. Management is good over all nice and straight forward with answer and concerns. The most enjoyable part was the name. The prestige of working at Qualcomm.
good,"Great company to work in until the recent layoffs. There is freedom to contribute your ideas and work-life balance is great. "
good,Back when Irwin was CEO it was a great company. R&D and culture was great.  Slowly over the years the culture has gone downhill and less and less is spent on R&D.
good,"Great place to work but this was just before all the layoffs. Everything changed after that. Very sad."
good,"Lots of good work and benefits but also lot of stress due to quick turnaround requirements"
good,"Qualcomm has great training course "
good,"Lack of career advancement but balanced life/work environment with good benefits."
good,Software engineer with a niche to develop cutting edge solutions. Over 12 years of industry experience. Developed software from application level to device driver.
good,The workplace was fun to work at but the company itself was not that great. The Shift supervisors tried to keep distracted from the fact that as temporary employees we did the same or more work than permanents while getting absolutely no benefits otherwise.
good,"When I joined Qualcomm it was an incredible company for which to work.  Over the past couple of years, the culture has changed.  The company is now all about the shareholders and cutting costs at the expense of it's employees.  Employee benefits drastically changed to where you now have to spend thousands of your own money on deductibles before you see any real benefits.  We've had our bonus/raise structure cut from twice per year to once per year.  Plus bonuses and stock allotments are smaller than in previous years.  Private offices have given way to cubicles.  Then those cubicles were reduced to even smaller cubicles.  Each non-management employee now gets about 50sqft in which to work.  Company events such as summer picnics and Christmas parties are gone.  And countless other changes and cutbacks have been made over the years."
good,"Hectic work, No Work life balance, Works in Advance system, Good learning opportunities."
good,"in some departments there is a lot of flexibility, however others have strict schedules.  ability to transfer to other groups."
good,Management has high expectations but I learned so much the time I was there. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced schedule. The best part of the job were my co-workers.
good,"I enjoy working here. I met some good people and some hard people to deal with. Beside learning the new technology, I gain a valuable knowledge of how to communicate with many different type of people from India, U.S  and Canada under stressful situation."
good,"Overall good if u get quality work"
good,"There are many things to put here.Though I have been in the organization for 2.5 yrs till date, but I would like to put feedbacks that I got from other colleagues here too. That would make the review more comprehensive & neutral."
good,"work is sometimes hard but pay is pretty good!"
good,"Provide diverse and complex support to the director, his reporting teams and other various leaders in QMT as needed. Exposure to confidential information and upper management levels requires use of tact and diplomacy on a regular basis. Write/track/maintain correspondences, arrange meetings, team building events, and travel plans/visas/airport car service/associated expense reporting, arrange luncheons, schedule appointments, answer, screen, route and respond to calls, set up and maintain files, order office supplies and tear down models. Coordinate special projects and compile information and complete reports. Act as an information sources on departmental/organization policies and procedures."
good,"The typical day involved integrating Qualcomm chip sets into demonstration phones for carrier evaluation."
good,"I have worked at Qualcomm for just under 4 years.  Overall it has been a positive experience.  I've had the opportunity to learn many different facets of the software development process.  I work as a Software Developer for the Snapdragon platform, which leads to having an understanding of the entire system from the hardware layer to the application layer."
good,"Overall it is a good place to work. "
good,"Talented work force.  And the company has lot's of helpful groups.  It takes getting used to all the process including meetings, filing requests, etc.  Compared to a startup company, things move slowly.  But I assume when you get used to the Qualcomm system it will make things more efficient.  I haven't been here long enough to tell."
good,"Generate Pixel yield map, sample map, defects review map, and classify defects. Knowledge in MEMS process. "
good,Typical day at work starts with good amount of work to be done along with fun and help from co workers.
good,"Qualcomm is generally good in terms of working environment and culture. Uniquely positioned, Qualcomm is able to sustain a steady growth with its vision in cellular technology. However, Qualcomm is not a typical semiconductor company in such a way that its market expension is horizontal. So other than working directly at cellular technologies, you don't feel your creativity is supported and job security is strong."
good,"Qualcomm has always been a leader in wireless technology. As such, the work environment is demanding an requires constant improvement."
good,Long work hours to meet the organizations expectations and deliver the product to the customers. Very high pressure.
good,"Management is overly aggressive with schedules, resulting in large workloads for undersized teams."
good,This company became Kyocera. The same 12hr shifts. I even had the same desk when Kyocera took over.
good,"Challenging to work there, but the benefits cannot be beat. Plenty of resources to help you with your job."
good,Had to help the basic jobs a lot of the time. The company as a whole is great and most of the people as people are great
good,Work space culture  is great but work-life balance is quite worse at the same time
good,Qualcomm had a pretty good internship program with other interns who are interested in the same things you are as well as good managers that take care of you.
good,"A good place to work and advance. They promote a ""can do"" attitude and provide the tools and training to promote success within the Dept. Management in the Dept. I worked for was mostly good but there are a few areas where they could improve and be less dependent on the personal whims of certain management individuals. I would probably still be there if  certain individual didn't hold a grudge against me. My opinion of course but it does matter.Workplace is employee friendly with diversity as a foundation. Sometimes there is a ""live to work"" expectation, rather than a ""work to live"" expectation so work / life balance got a marginal rating in my opinion. Great facilities for physical fitness and personal health. They provide meals for employees working long or odd hours. On site cafeterias and snack venues. Plenty of clean safe parking. Generally a wonderful place to work. I was there for over 20 years and don't regret any of it!"
good,"I have a great team at work, very supportive and always ready to help and teach. I get to work with different teams in my role and get to work with some great engineers. "
good,You help the company and they compensate you for that is a good company except for the amount of meetings. the teams are to big be allowed to have time with your boss when need it
good,"After years of challenges to its core business model, Qualcomm is a company headed in the correct direction. The transition to 5G mobile networks positions the company for future success."
good,"In the early days, Qualcomm was the BEST place to work.  They fostered an environment of open communication from executives to worker bees.  In the last few years, the focus has been on driving the stock price with very little regard on how that shift has effected it's loyal employees."
good,"Qualcomm offers other benefits over and above the basics such as providing in house medical and eye care facilities, gyms at all of their locations, rec fields, clubs, festivals, libraries, company stores, and relaxation areas where employees can get away from the stresses of day to day problems."
good,"Good place to work fellow technicians are great, but the customers we supported were very demanding.  Management was okay, but often would have you do what the customer wanted and not what the SOP."
good,"I worked at Qualcomm for 20 years in different roles, and on the whole, it was a good experience. I worked hard, but I was also remunerated amply. In my job there were many times when I worked long hours, but my bosses made sure I got some compensation (whether it was extra hours off or bringing in lunch). One of the things I learned is that the higher up's often make decisions, without having a firm plan.The workplace structure often rigid on certain things,  but allowed for an individual to decide on some parts of their role."
good,"Opportunities for growth, learning, career development, specially for Electrical/Hardware Engineers. Has competitive compensation, benefits, comparable to any top tier companies(semi conductor chip)."
good,Came in for a rough ride as Qualcomm had layoffs and reorganizations happening.  Got less than hoped for in hours and saw canceled events due to uncertainty there.  Good company and wise in restructuring ideas.
good,"I enjoyed my 24 years there but now looking for a company similar to what Qualcomm was 20 years ago. It's no longer that great innovating company it once was, not saying that's a bad thing, its just now very corporate and slow moving as large companies tend to get."
good,"Overall, Qualcomm is decent company.  The technology developed here is great. The company has a lot of great resources which you can use to develop your skills."
good,"Good employer, but going through some challenging times right now.  Should get better in a year or two.  I would recommend Qualcomm as an employer to anyone."
good,"As a legal support assistant, I was responsible for a multitude of tasks.  I worked actively in a very high paced, demanding environment.  I was assigned to a team that typically consisted of at least six attorney and three paralegals, however my duties often extended beyond the team. I provided direct supported to my team with reviewing, processing, and handling various documents for filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other government agencies.  I also worked actively with both domestic and foreign outside counsels, often transmitting applications and other legal materials.  I worked actively with various vendors, such as outside counsel. The workplace culture has definitely changed over the years but management has tried to make it a fun place to work. even thou it does get complacent at times."
good,"great company to work for, lots of perks for their employees. management are there to help you and work with you if needed.The work is not hard at all.you have some down time.  I would say the only bad thing is the pay,"
good,"Its fun as the benefits are great compared to other companies."
good,If you are a fresher its a good place to start your career as you can learn a lot from the people around you. Pay is above average and benefits are good.
good,I loved the job until they switched my managers. I got work done more efficiently when I wasn’t being micromanaged. Very friendly & safe work environment.
good,"Company is going through difficulties."
good,Qualcomm is a great company to work for.  The company creates incredible technology and implements great technology and solutions to run the business.
good,"Really great place to work with many friendly, talented people. You'll learn a lot & you will work with many, many teams. QC has lots & lots of pillars - one team does this & another team does that - even though you could probably do both steps, "
good,"slow career progression, misguided management, autonomy and project ownership, focused on business partnerships, group projects, internationally focused"
good,Qualcomm offers a vast range of positions at a Fortune 500 company to gain experience and build up your skills.  Competitive benefits and salary with decent work life balance
good,If you in san diego this is one of the best company you can opt for.great benifits like 401k matching and good insurance coverage dental vision and health .
good,Fast pace company but balance with many life activities onside.  Everyone seems to have their skill set and cross training seems not forced by the manager.  People have/share high wall office.  Most of people close their office door so very little interaction between co-worker.
good,"The patent department was extremely busy when I worked there due to trying to put processes and procedures in place to handle the workload.  But, they had recently purchased software that would handle what was needed, but we were the ones working out the kinks."
good,"At Qualcomm, there is always an new project or effort under way that offers new challenges to meet the project goals. "
good,Qualcomm was a great place to work. They provided great pay and benefits as well as several onsite amenities. Unfortunately changes by management removed me from my level of expertise without proper training and/or guidance.
good,"I learned that what you give is what you get. If you work hard, you'll be good at what you do and your superiors will see that in you and move you up. Therefore both will benefit."
good,"I started working for Qualcomm in 2007.  It had an exciting but laid back start-up feel to it then.As the company has gotten larger, it's lost it's ""cool"" vibe and is now just another mega-corporation with it's eye solidly on the bottom line.  Still a good company to work for, but not anything like it used to be."
good,"Initially environment similar to startup with excellent communication, team culture focus, and job growth opportunities.  After significant product/financial/staff growth in short period of time culture changed to meet corporate demands at any cost."
good,"Global company with very fast-paced engineering. Short product life-cycles and a focus on cost-reduction. Teams are large. Generally, merit-based advancement."
good,"Full time employee since 6 years."
good,"A true leader in the wireless communication industry. You can learn a lot. Compensation wise, it's good comparing to other semiconductor companies, but definitely not as good as those Internet companies."
good,"Listen to your people and support them,it will usually be a win-win for everybody. Be more result oriented in biz and development. Request local management to show timely results and be efficient with resources."
good,"It is the same as other high tech firm:"
good,"Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside."
good,Tough as a first year company after acquiring the account. Many bumps and learning curves to overcome. Hardest part was convincing prior company's staff that change is a good thing.
good,"Qualcomm has and continues to be a growing company in the mobile industry.  I have worked at Qualcomm and subsidiaries since 1991, and really think the strength of the company is in the employees they hire.  There is a can do attitude in all areas of the business.  It makes coming to work easy."
good,"work is hectic ,need  to spend more hours to deliver the things on time. "
good,"Qualcomm is a leader in mobile semiconductor chipsets including modem, multimedia, graphics and location-based solutions. The work-life balance is not great and depends on the group you are working with. The compensation and benefits are at par with rest of the semiconductor industry."
good,"Very good company to learn and grow"
good,"It's a good company. Most of people in headquarter San Diego are nice. In San Jose office, it depends on which group you work with."
good,"In order to enjoy the positive aspects of this company, you will have to be in the right team. With the recent trends in the company its not going to be a safe company anymore. I hope it retains its good name earned for so long"
good,"Great culture and atmosphere. I can't complain about my management team. I thoroughly enjoyed working here. My only critique is that I think that due to the layoffs going on, they are becoming less innovative. Companies like Google, Apple, etc. hire where the talent is and they keep their talent. Qualcomm's culture doesn't embrace working remotely despite your continued performance. I think this is a flaw."
good,"Qualcomm, located in San Diego,  is a fun place to work where people play hard and work hard. More recently the company culture has taken a turn for the worse."
good,"the company has gone too big....and lots of fat management there burning the company's money..."
good,"Qualcomm is transitioning out of its core business model from the past 20+ years. Cellular handset technology continues to be a growth item, but it appears now to be reaching levels that will flatten out."
good,"I had an excellent time working at Qualcomm however, I was contracted through a staffing agency and they only had a very finite amount of full time positions available. Which was the reason I left, seeking Full time employment with benefits."
good,"I was a contractor - can't really comment.  That is to say, I was not treated as an employee."
good,Good Place to Work. #1 in mobile chipsets. It has really good work culture and as we know it is pioneer in telecom domain. Have Learned a lot here.
good,"Decent work, cutting edge technology, great benefits, excellent opportunities to grow, respectable work."
good,"A place where you can grow endlessly."
good,"Great technology."
good,"Work culture is one of the best. Full support from the team"
good,"I had opportunity to work on new projects, lead multi-site development team, manage project schedule and delivery of quality software."
good,Flarion was a private company before they were obtained by Qualcomm. This company was innovative and the job was also. Great place to work.
good,"Very stable company with great compensation and benefits.  The work is challenging and employees learn a lot on the job.  Downside is the work-life balance, employees are expected to stay long hours."
good," Collaborated with team of software analyst in the development of Blackberry Mobile devices."
good,"worked on SPI, SRIF & PCIe basic bring up. Co-workers are good. Management is pretty bad."
good,"The overall experience in this company is good, great benefits and quite some in-house seminars / training opportunities. The work load is medium and above, depending on the project. The pay and bonus are not attractive competitive comparing with other bay area companies."
good,Very taleng groups and competitive working environment. I have learned a lot for semiconductor process experience from this company
good,"A company that mostly cares about its employees, practices inclusion, and is aiming for greater diversity. I was only briefly there but employees seemed  loyal and engaged."
good,Good work and balance of social life aspects.  Lucky enough to be flown down to san diego and put up in ucsd dorm rooms for qualcomm world cup.  Was once atheros employee but when bought out by qualcomm things changed.
good,"cutting edge technology from a progressive company."
good,"A lot depends on the group you are in. Work is often interesting and intense, in most groups working on modem, work pressure is a lot, there isn't any work life balance, however you do get to learn a lot as well. Compensation is good, but overall package is not as good as the big players, AAPL, GOOG, MSFT etc., again that depends on the group you are in. In hardware groups compensation is really good specially for San Diego, which is not as expensive as bay area."
good,I really enjoyed working from home.  I was pleasantly surprised at how I transitioned to a telecommuting position.   I reported to a Manager that I had had in a previous position.  She recruited me to Qualcomm after having worked with her in a previous position.
good,"Supporting QUALCOMM Android powered emulators within US continent as well as overseas on Repair, Build, Maintaining and upgrading on both hardware and software."
good,"Working with Qualcomm was one of the best experiences. Learnt many things and accomplished many projects. I enjoyed working with teams from all over the world (USA, Taiwan, China, Korea, Singapore, India). But had to work some unsociable hours."
good,"With two decades of experience, Qualcomm culture is wonderfully unique, as we are not only challenged to take risks and learn from one another in our professional relationships but are engaged in cutting edge technologies, employee networks, and a mix of events that truly keep us connected and equipped for success."
good,"Qualcomm is an international workplace.  The most enjoyable part of my job was scheduled very flexible and allowed employee to work from home.  As a PCB Designer, it was very challenged to handled multi complicated boards."
good,"Qualcomm Inc is a great place to work. good benefits. great co-workers competitive pay. Would recommend working for Qualcomm."
good,"Work day involved attending status meetings with department group. Giving updates on progress of project with additional subject matter of concerns with input from Electrical and Mechanical requirements to achieve goals for a finished functional board design. Working with co-PCB Designers to establish task for the day on project."
good,"Great people, lots of engineering talent, long hours however. The work is challenging and cutting edge technology. Good room for working on different projects and types of programs."
good,"Job environment is good and expectations are reasonable."
good,"Qualcomm is a busy place, plan on working long hours, but in return you work with some of the smartest people.  There is a lot to learn and a lot of opportunity to contribute.  I was really surprised on how much latitude that management will give you if you have good ideas.  I felt like I made a difference."
good,"...If you're on the right team."
good,On daily basis I was required to go through our ticketing system servicenow and check the tickets that were assigned to me and respond accordingly to each ticket.
good,"Working at Qualcomm is challenging and rewarding. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the smart and wonderful people I work with. The hardest part of the job is the relative uncertainty associated with the business. Law suits, regulatory challenges, and so on that lead to cost cutting and layoffs."
good,Highly Competitive and Fast Paced company. Relying too much on third party off the shelf applications instead of indigenous home grown software development.
good,"Fast paced and cutting-edge work. Sometimes the work becomes monotonous, especially if you are in some execution team. Very open and collaborative environment."
good,"Qualcomm is a great place to work. They try to make it fun and provide a lot of opportunities for team building outside of work. I just wish they provided more opportunities for upward movement. Also, as a Test Technician this is a contracted/temp job."
good,Between the ACA (Qualcomm jumped the gun in anticipation of the employer tax and never went back) and all of the lawsuits work was less fun and quite frankly became more of a typical corporation.  There is a reason we used to be top 10 IT companies to work for and in recent years we are not even close to being mentioned.  Still benefits wern't terrible compared to other southern based companies and despite the culture changing I still had high hopes
good,"Team culture is be fit, work hard and have fun. Innovation forum is present for exposure to new ideas. Open door policy by management to encourage better communication."
good,"It's a good company with most coworker friendly. I worked in the video codec team, we work together and help each other. It's the best company I have ever forked for."
good,I started working at Qualcomm as a temporary employee for Manpower in 1998 and started as a full time employee in early 2000. I was in a recent large layoff that was inevitable. I was an excellent employee with stellar reviews.
good,I absolutely love working . Not only is my team collaborative and supportive but the entire company is as a whole. Our company has a strong sense of community that is felt in every office globally.
good,"Qualcomm is good place to work, really i'm happy to working here. Management support is good, team members very genuine and having knowledge in their working area."
good,"Good place to work for with good pay and new technique. Work and life balance. Some times not easy to go with some of the managers."
good,"Excellent benefits and amazing co-workers. Truly an innovative company. The workplace culture was an exciting one, but the hours were quite long and often ran over into the weekend. My team was incredible and my direct manager was the best I've ever had."
good,First time working in an actual working enviornment. Learned a lot and had a lot of fun doing so. Met very cool and important people. Overall had a great expirience.
good,"It's a great company and has good compensation package."
good,"Typically the days starts with processing the previous nights test results, checking for any FW or SW crashes during the test. Then import the results into EXCEL, and verify data manually or through the use of macros."
good,Work life balance in Qualcomm is very good. Our day starts at debugging the issues and meeting the deadlines to meet customer requests.
good,Qualcomm was a very creative place to work in the 90s. Lots of excitement and new things to explore. People are still very supportive and willing to do what it takes to get things done. Company started to get very lean in the late 2010s and stress was at an all time high. A changing global market caused some chaos leading to a restructuring and a loss of jobs. Some positions were out sourced and some were near shored to Mexico.
good,"There is a lot going on at Qualcomm in many different groups. While I was there, we experienced several major re-orgs and my once awesome role in the organization changed to one that was mired in process and it became clear that individual ability to make a major impact on the business was limited... to none. At that point the career became ""just a job"" and it was time to look for a new opportunity. That being said, there are groups that I know work ridiculous hard there and are creating very cool things. It just happened I was unable to transfer into these orgs at the time."
good,Great place with wonderful people.  Too many wiki pages (very difficult to find) and not enough documentation.  This leads to way to much tribal knowledge and makes it hard to come up to speed quickly.
good,"Focused on Returned Material Authorization from customers, Quality Alerts, Product Changes and Customer Notifications that are the result of Quality issues or excursions."
good,one of the best places to work everyone is nice the pay was great its a good place to work if you can get in no weekend work is also good
good,"Exciting work ar latest Technology node"
good,"Great place to work, with fair pay and excellent benefits.  Depending on the group you work in, the  bonuses and equity benefits may vary greatly."
good,"As you probably all know by now, Qualcomm has decided to reduce its workforce. There are many good, hard working people who are losing their jobs due to no fault of their own."
good,"The typical day is to come in and just do what is needed and required of you. Emails is the best form of communication for issues and updates."
good,It is a highly actively environment and multi-cultural as well. You have to keep up with the constant changes in technology as well as customer request for specific technology that will be made and tested according to various OEM design and Carrier specifications.
good,"Benefits and salary are fantastic.  Nice place to work with nice, helpful people.  Local management was fantastic.  high-tech company doing exciting things."
good,"good place to work, good money but its hard to get hire, i meet lots of nice coworker there. and learned lots of thing there too, i wanna go back there but I need a permanent job not temporary."
good,"1.福利待遇还不错。"
good,"Everyday is a busy day"
good,"very good work life balance."
good,"QC has less projects atleast from sep 2013 to till date which is causing the layoffs. we found typically work is less and headcount seems to be high. High salary offers is being now paid off by qualcomm, I mean Qualcomm offers high salary but now that it is running short of projects, it has to cut down the man power."
good,very nice place to work great products also good environment
good,"Its fun in Qualcomm, i like the environment here, the people are very good."
good,"Currently I am working in a contracting position at Qualcomm, Raleigh, NC as a Chip Level Verification Engineer. As a part of this position my responsibilities include verification of debug subsystem of the ASIC at full chip level by developing constrained random based test-bench and test cases , preparing and implementing detailed test plans for design modules and tracking tests against test plans, resolve test failures using ARM AMBA protocols (AXI, AHB, APB). This experience has given me the knowledge as well as the confidence to venture for challenging full time positions ."
good,"Enjoyable environment, good collaboration and mutual respect."
good,Good Compensation and Work/Life balance
good,"Amazing place to learn the latest advances in wireless technology,competitive,fast paced,healthy casual work environment."
good,"A well balanced work/live experience is possible, if you choose to have one.  Time on the job and/or living ones life is largely left to the individual to decide their own appropriate balance."
good,"They provide a nice relocating package for interns include housing and travel expense reimbursements."
good,"Really enjoyed my time there."
good,Highly enjoyed working at Qualcomm.  My manager was very supportive and easy to talk to.  I learned a lot from her.  The company culture was inclusive and employee friendly.
good,"fast pased and very demanding. in my experience, progressing in the company was difficult. I did dishwashing and food prep but mostly dishawashing but wasnt advancing."
good,The people are very knowledgeable and ready to help out. It forces you to keep on your toes at all times. Career progression can be little slow but truly exceptional people tend to stand out.
good,Qualcomm is the best company regarding caring for their employee in San Diego. It does have few areas to be improved like others company i.e. management and interview process.
good,"I had worked at the Raleigh, NC server design group for 2 years. This group had disbanded during the summer of 2018 due to corporate management decision not to pursue that market.  It was a good group with good people."
good,It is quite interesting by working at qualcomm because it is friendly environment and the team is very productive to finish tasks on time. The supervisor is very cooperative and friendly to make things easier.
good,Great place to work.  You were valued; your skills were enhanced; the group was capable and friendly.  Immediate manager was driven and highly intelligent.
good,"Before 2015, it's a good company; After 2015, this company changes it's company culture, especially in the treatment of employees. A lot of laid off happen every year. The working condition is not stable any more. The company treats employee as a cost instead of assets."
good,Qualcomm Incorporated is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company that designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services. It derives most of its revenue from chipmaking and the bulk of its profit from patent licensing businesses.
good,"People that work here are genuinely helpful and friendly"
good,"execution is a hard part since talented young engineers are leaving."
good,"8 to x with people looking for options for good food slogging out in labs and meetings "
good,"Good place to work, however its time to move on given the current management. Seems like the management is not interested in carrying the technology leadership role anymore rather looking after their own interest. It gives a bleak future in that case and time for the current employees to look for other opportunities"
good,Lots of meetings.  Culture is fast paced with many types of ethnicity.  People are well educated coming from top engineering schools in US as abroad.  Would work there again.
good,I have worked at Qualcomm as Wireless Engineering intern for 6-months. Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely apply there for a full-time job after graduation.
good,"Qualcomm is a strong engineering company with a portfolio of excellent products and outstanding engineering talent."
good,Great culture and they have an Xbox room so that you can relax when you are on your lunch break. I wish they didn't hire through temp agencies and hire for contract jobs.
good,"overall it is a good place to work with good compensation. The company has focus on mobile technology, but it not doing well recently compared to other SW company, due to the fact that mobile market becomes saturated. Hopefully it will get better in the long run."
good,"Enjoyed my time their, management was supportive in procuring needed tools and allowing investigation of new technologies, coworkers were helpful and non-territorial. Other divisions were willing to invest time in new initiatives if there was reasonable expectation of gains"
good,"*typical day - 4 hours of project meetings, address sustaining issues, work on project and non project enhancements (requirements gathering and definition, testing and, specifications, sql, analysis)  Interface with offshore teams."

good,"it is a good company to work with, since it is a product based company work will be a bit more depending on from where you were working prior to qualcomm."
good,"This is a good place to work."
good,Good work environment with multi talented engineers. We have freedom to change the domains internally to get  expertise in the entire product cycle. Challenging and interesting place
good,"it was a good learning experience in working as firmware engineer in signal processing domain."
good,"Good team lead, and line manager but module I was working on was relatively static between targets and so not much juicy dev work was coming my way. Other teams were getting interesting work on a daily basis."
good,Company offered many training options in equip maint. Trained on many tool sets. There was a pool and ping pong table in the break room as well as direct tv for our viewing pleasure. It is a good company.
good,Overall Qualcomm is a Good Company and a good place for learning as it has good infrastructure. Employee Benefits are very good. Regarding working culture it is based on the team but they expect long working hours.
good,"Although the company was once a golden opportunity, it has become the leader of the market and now suffers from the same political gridlock other large corporations do."
good,"Average place to work for. Lot of politics and favoritism. In short, it depends on which team you work for. If you manager and team is good then you would like Qualcomm."
good,"Qualcomm has great benefits, and compensates its employees very well. The on-site food options and gyms (and pool) are amazing. Management is a little messy, with unclear accountability at times, but overall still a relaxed and challenging place to work. The only drawback is a lack of universal purpose, so work can feel less rewarding at times."
good,"Qualcomm is very fun place to work with open culture & independence to innovate . New ideas are always welcome here."
good,Best place I've ever worked for. Extremely professional environment and surrounded by very intelligent people.Q is a great place to learn fast paced engineering.
good,I enjoyed every moment when I was there. If I have a chance I will go back and work for Qualcom. high tech company they hired very smart engineer and intelligent individual.
good,Most talented group of folks I ever worked with. Great teamwork. Excellent pay and benefits. No real career planning or opportunities for career growth.
good,"Qualcomm runs a hard-driving workplace.  The contract required me to load the daily release of Android to a phone (and/or tablet, sometimes) and smoketest the build to catch any glaring flaws in the build, before passing it on to QC."
good,Worked on Prototypes and State of the Art Technology. Amazing co-worker environment. Potential for advancement internally. Decent benefits. Responsive to employee feedback and well structured.
good,Ideal place to start your career and learn the trade. Best place to be if you are working on wireless technologies. Work life balance might be an issue depending on which you end up working for. Overall could not have asked more a more better place to start the career
good,"Like anywhere your team is key to having a good time at work. I really enjoyed my team. It was a great group of really smart people. Many of them worked like crazy, but a few had really good work life balance. I enjoyed my time here since it was so flexible, paid well, and allowed me to work on my own terms."
good,"I am a contractor at Qualcomm and am made to feel just like the rest of the work force with generally, nice hospitality. A few perks are available such as free use of fitness centers in some of the buildings, flex hours (core hours of course) and lunches can be purchased through the cafeteria and delivered to your building."
good,"Corporate culture great and encourages and provides resources for life-work balance, including outdoors/physical activities."
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits. Average work hours. Have own offices, relaxed environment. Treats employees well. Corporate governance is less than ideal"
good,There where ping pong tables but was not aloud to use them  but still a good place to work there were family oriented. flexible hours.
good,The management is very supportive. It has been a great company till now. But in recent times it has been under financial stress.
good,I only gave up the job due to surgery which kept me out of work over 90 days. I can not embelish a job where I only saw my co workers a maximum of 20 hrs
good,"Have a fantastic work culture, most of the staff members nice and always energetic with that big smile, it makes life fully charged and finds ways and means to enjoy work and perform at peaks"
good,"Good work life balance, great innovative place with very smart people on teams. Diverse culture and a lot to learn. Can get very difficult to get recognition."
good,"Before the big downturn and they laid off many people, this company was a great place to work.  Later it became very difficult to complete all your projects due to everyone taking on 2-3 jobs that the other people that got laid off were doing.  Management was great until the end of my 19 years."
good,"Excellent Place to work for Entry Level Engineers - Great Platform for learning various technologies"
good,"Great place to work and learn new technologies"
good,Very good work but demands more than 10 hours a day work. Salary and other Benefits are good and at par with others.
good,"Function: 	- Responsible for testing software and hardware performance of Qualcomm chipset integrated  handhelds that involves radio transmission between Mobile devices and Carriers Radio Access Network under criteria set by carriers"
good,"Management is very hands on and on top of their game. "
good,"Really it is a great place to work.  The documentation system or lack therof and a hundred other things can be frustrating, but the important thing is that everyone really is trying very hard to do good work.  That's what makes Qualcomm great, and made me a better engineer for my time there."
good,It's a very fast paced and ever changing environment. Great people and great benefits. The best part was getting performance reviews (and raises) twice a year!
good,"Performing high quality staffing coordination activities requires attention to detail and diligent effort.  There is a lot of responsibility in ensuring that the candidates are treated well and have a positive experience going through the interviewing process. The job requires communicating with candidates, agency representatives, recruiters, and hiring teams in order to set up interviews in a quick and orderly fashion. In addition, there is a need for great organizational skills along with patience and perseverance particularly when dealing with the human factor. Creative problem solving is the key to meeting stakeholder’s needs and ensuring a positive interview experience for each and every candidate. I have successfully coordinated on average 370 interviews per month, approximately 90 candidates per week while supporting over 200 requisitions.  The company has recognized my abilities relying on me to take on more work load and supporting higher volume recruiters in their filling positions.  In addition I have also been responsible for tracking daily, weekly, and monthly numbers for the scheduling and sourcing teams using MS Excel for analytics."
good,Its very good place for the communications background people. there is a chance to explore lot of fields in EE
good,"Cutting edge technologies like Devops,DataCenter."
good,"This place is a very supportive work environment, and the boss is a good humored man who enjoys what he does and is very understanding of his employees."
good,"It was a great place to work. But for my division, when we were hit with the government sequester my division had to reduce a lot of people so I had to leave. The technology was great, and the pay and benefits generous."
good,".This review will be based on my experience only. I worked at Qualcomm Tech Inc for over 16 years overall. Several QC-buildings have coffee stations (a great way to start the day) co-workers were very friendly, and the workflow was somehow moderate, some days were very stressful- dealing with engineers due to their customer pressure, project deadlines or last min emergencies. But, if you like your job, you truly enjoy bad days as well. QC Tech Inc wasn't just an employer, they became a family too. I was lucky to work with a great group, very understanding management staff. QC provides great health, vision, and dental benefits insurance."
good,"Very Informative and Knowledgeable people around, Great work environment."
good,Overall a great place to work. Good culture and Management. There is a lot of collaboration between the teams which helps business to be more productive.
good,Overall a good employer. Very satisfied but in the end our divistion was sold to another company
good,"Normal work hours is 8-6 pm. As a software automation engineer I learned so many things in relation to end-to-end system testing be it software, hardware, and bug tracking. Management always emphasize the important of transparency at work."
good,"Great work environment. Manager was always willing to help and give encouragement whenever either me or other coworkers needed it. Workplace was very relaxed, but everyone got their work done."
good,"I had the pleasure of working as a technical writer and team manager at QC for 20 years. Challenging work, but great folks. Treated me well, even in the layoff."
good,"Qualcomm has great compensation and excellent benefits.  I very much enjoyed the team I worked with and my direct supervisor was always available for me even though he was in San Jose, CA and I worked in Red Bank, NJ.  I would recommend Qualcomm for anyone looking for a challenging work experience and great benefits."
good,"When I was originally hired into Qualcomm, the company worked very hard at making sure that the employees were well taken care of and that it was good place to work, but towards the end of my tenure there it become increasing less about employee satisfaction, and more about the bottom dollar, and I think that it negatively affected the culture in very real and damaging ways."
good,"Great  place to  work and to  learn new  technologies.  very  easy environment to  work, not pressure . good  managements , "
good,Strong leadership and projects get completed.  Flexible hours and employee benefits.  Opportunity to move around if you desire to gain that additional exposure

good,"Fast paced, great opportunities to learn new technology, encourages new ideas and innovation, rewards talented people and success. Overtime working is a regular expectation from management and peers. Good compensation and benefits."
good,got an opportunity to work on different projects that helped me to improve my skills.management is easy to approach. learning sessions are great. cross multi functional team work
good,"The products are leading edge technology and therefore challenging.  Working on large development teams can be rewarding and frustrating at the same time.  Management works with the individual contributors to help with technical development.  They focus on team interfacing and project tracking."
good,"it's a good place to work. Work life balance is very decent. Easy going and intelligent engineers working on cutting edge technology. "
good,"a typical day at work is engineers would submit tickets to get their test system fix."

good,"Good company, Could learn a lot, Nice office, Good career growth, Food provided. Working hours flexibility, Leave flexibility, No politics except few tamil networks"
good,Good working environment with good benefits.  Nice professional coworker assist and introduce me to new skills and project.  But advancement for my position was limited.
good,work has always been fun. there is more to life work balance than just work. i have enjoyed working here. work with some of the smartest people around
good,Great culture at the company. It was a great time working with all of the different people at the company. Free healthcare and centers onsite for everyone to use.
good,Still like a college campus with knowledge sharing a big plus. Great opportunities to learn about technologies and learn about other cultures from India and China.
good,Different teams follow different cultures. One cannot generalize to be just about Qualcomm. It also depends on your superiors. You might end up working day and night like a zombie or might take off at 4 everyday or work from home for at least 2 days of the week. Its all there.
good,career advancement is hard. managers are mostly senior level people who have no clue about what is really needed for their own org to be productive. difficult to change position or move around within the company
good,Qualcomm was a great place to work. They trained me to all jobs performed. It would be busy at times but that's expected. I would go back if something opens up.
good,good place to work. a lot of intelligent and brigh people work here. work/life balance is the really good. collaboration with different groups/sites is important

good,"While Qualcomm is a huge company, likely they use you contract up and just need you for the short time. It is a great resume builder and help you prepare yourself for the next phase of career you plan to go into."
good,"Qualcomm has been a dynamic exciting place to work. The culture is to push the technology limits. There are ping pong tables in some of the break rooms. "
good,"Very demanding schedules. A lot of meetings that take up a lot of time. Some time to work on personal projects of interest, but mostly on your own time (> 40 hrs)."
good,"Qualcomm is a leading technology company , with many inventories that build foundation of advance telecommunication.  Qualcomm can do better in current market environment.."
good,Average work load comparing with Silicon Valley companies.  Better to work at the headquarter in San Diego.   Company provides many online training classes.

good,"Good exposure to technologies, get to work on upcoming wifi features."
good,"Great to work in a company which is ahead of the technology"
good,"Qualcomm is a great place to work. Provides you with a low opportunity to grow professionally. You get a chance to work with very talented people (engineers, leaders)"
good,I wasn't a direct employee of Qualcomm. Contracting through my company. My experience is limitted to what I was working on. I could not generalize that.
good,"Qualcomm is one of the largest employers in San Diego. We are proud of our contribution in a city that is a high-tech hub for telecommunications and such diverse areas as biotech, clean technologies, computer peripherals, multimedia and software. Qualcomm's San Diego facilities are only minutes away from miles of beautiful beaches, top-ranked universities and cultural attractions, all set in an ideal climate that encourages an active lifestyle."
good,Working at Qualcomm has been very rewarding an I have learned a lot about event management. I work with a great team and we do great work together. I would recommend anyone to work here.
good,"the work is usually good, you get to work on latest protocols. Pay is ok. lots of perks but you get a good hike only during promotion. work culture is good."
good,Qualcomm's growth over the 20 years I worked there was amazing.  We went from a small company unsure of making payroll at times to a fortune 500 company in about 12 years.  A very stressful and at the same time rewarding company to work for.  Management was very good at providing meaning and long term vision to the various organizations and departments within the company.  I look back on my time with Qualcomm very fondly!
good,"Awesome company to work for. My manager is the best, but I can say that only for myself. Currently job security is an issue based on company possibly being sold."
good,"Great opportunities within the company, fun corporate culture, excellent pay and benefits. Very interesting and exciting to work with staff across the globe. Opportunities for international travel."
good,"I used to work for Ikanos Communication which was acquired by QCA, Qualcomm Atheros. to have DSL technology two years ago."

good,Management listens to employees needs via survey. Meeting work deadlines is always encouraged at work.As long as tools  (software or hardware) are important in meeting deadlines budget is not a problem.
good,"Smart and exciting team of people to work with. Cutting edge projects and state of the art technology utilized. Top notch Wireless, Wi-Fi, and network technology utilized to develop state of the art products."
good,I was a contractor with Qualcomm for 2 years. I was out of the industry for a few years and Qualcomm gave me the opportunity to get back in the game. My manager and coworkers were very supportive and I was able to ramp up quite quickly. I was able to help the team hit major goals such as taping out 3 different processes. Very thankful for Qualcomm and would not hesitate working for them again in the future.
good,"Work life balance is definitely a hit, with one working for around 12 hours a day minimum. The turn around cycles for the products are very small 3-6 months and hence there are various category of chips to deal with. "
good,Good place to work. Have fun.Salary is gud. Good place to learn so many features. Knowledge gaining is a gud scope. Focous is so much in regresion activities.
good,"All of the people I work with were great. Great boss. Give you a project / assignment and let you go do it. No micro-management. Management would stop by and see how you're doing. Let you set your own hours. The hardest part about this job is me waking up in the morning Once I'm up and at work, everything is good."
good,The company used to focus on sustaining and supporting skilled people. Very flexible work and life balance. management knew exactly what need to be done and how to do it.
good,"- Challenging Job with new products coming in every day to interact with the Qualcomm chip."

Each day, my self and one other collegue greet an average of 30 candidates per day. We give them their schedules and Qualcomm packets, go over the schedule with them, tell them briefly about Qualcomm and ""Qlife,"" and answer any questions they may have. Our Center also displays all of Qualcomm's fabulous products, in a hands-on environment for the candidate's to explore.

good,I really enjoyed my 8 years at Qualcomm and would have liked to remain there many more.  Until a recent shift in management it was a top notch place to be with amazing benefits and more.  The new management is all about how much money they can generate for shareholders and no longer have their focus on their employees.  I was lucky enough to work with an amazing team of people and has so far been my favorite place of employment I have ever had in my life and regret that they felt the need to cut 25% of our department after having done the same thing a few years ago.  Many wonderful employees lost their jobs and it will hurt the company in the long run.
good,"Qualcomm seems to be a very well run company, and the team I worked with are all top-notch. My manager is especially strong technically, and also friendly and easy-going, a rare combination, and his team are similar in nature. As a contractor, I am insulated from any yearly review and political drama, but I don't see any major signs of issues. I think the design tool CAD environment is the strongest I have seen, very well organized, standardized, and well maintained, if a little rigid. The location in San Diego is very nice, but the area is very expensive to live in. If I were able to stay in San Diego permanently, I feel I would have a likely path to transition to a permanent employee."
good,"The job was very easy and laid back. Co-workers are super friendly, and the atmosphere was family oriented. however, progress was slow, and the opportunity for growth stunted. Uncertainty for a stable future was the norm."

good,"Qualcomm was a great place to work. I worked closely with 7 other technicians, 3 software developers, 1 lead, 1 manager, 3 Logistics handlers, 2 Administers, and approximately 12 planners..."
good,Very laid back environment that provides ample amount of flexibility and freedom
good,"There is no typical workday at Qualcomm, but is is never boring."
good,"From Qualcomm,Inc. "
good,I had to work twelve hours a day to test and troubleshoot cell phones. After worked sometime I stayed late with coworkers  to play basketball and volleyball.  Even thought the jobs was not easy but after all I felt good.
good,"Place really serves as platform to launch our career. Many classes are available to expand our horizon and also work life balance is good. For wireless folks, it is a dream place to work at."
good,Used to be very exciting environment to work with very talented engineers until 2015. Very long working hours expectations not enough reward.
good,"Held role as contractor (via outside hiring firm) Engineer I supporting interface between Product Engineers and Production Test. Position required long hours because of shift overlaps between engineering and test departments. Contractors are denied benefits and are required to end contract after maximum of 18 months and take a 3 month break, without guarantee of re-hire. Management is understanding of employee time and workload needs, efficient at giving clear instructions, and seem truly concerned with employee satisfaction in the workplace. Great place to learn, train, and work with intelligent people. However, unless you have a permanent position, you will not have benefits and always have an end-of-contract date looming, which will disrupt your long-term plans that require steady employment such as retirement saving, buying a house, supporting a family, etc."
good,"Qualcomm allows you the independence to grow and pursue methodologies that you think would benefit the company. It's a good work environment.However, Engineering Managers aren't the best at managing responsibilities."
good,"There is a loss of market share which has impacted the company. They are now trying to find new targets to expand into.  The management is struggling to find relevance so the Job culture is deteriorating.  It is at a cross-roads between recovery and slow steady decline, only time will tell which path is chosen."
good,Qualcomm has a very good work culture. For a newbie I think it is one of the best places to start your career from. We have flexible work hours. Work is not too much once you get the hang of it.
good,"Productive and fun place to work and my manager was a very cool person to work with. "
good,"Worked there as Jr.SQL developer and got a good experience on analyzing the data."
good,It used to be a great company with lots of technical challenges you would face everyday but in last few years the company got entangled in many legal issues with customers and government causing a lot of distractions for the engineering groups.
good,Working here was the easiest job I ever had. They are very clear about expectations and respect your knowledge as a professional. The class participants were some of the hardest workers I have ever taught.

The work environment is fast, demanding, but also one where a person can make a difference ...voice your opinion on how a product works, offer suggestions to make the product better, get out there with the customers to show them how to create a better experience. Whether you are writing product definitions or product code, everyone has a voice to be heard!"

good,"Going to work at Qualcomm every day for me was like going to Disneyland. As many sights and sounds there are at the famous theme park for kids, there were for me at Qualcomm, but not only was it an amazing place to be, it was where I was learning and working. A typical day at work in the department I was in at times could be dull when there were not a lot of devices to service, or problems to troubleshoot. But when work came in, it came in a flow, and that flow thanks to our co-workers became a rhythm, and that positive vibe, rhythm, flow, engulfs you and before you know it you've completed more tasks and work than you thought you would, and the day is over. The management was very unique. Each manager and manager above that manager, had his or her own style of operating. But one thing they ALL have in common: they always wanted those who they managed, and just those around them, to be happy and comfortable while they worked. Even if it meant doing one or two things a little unorthodox, the happiness of employees always came first. Hardest part of the job was leaving each day feeling like theres so much more I wanted to learn, so much more I wanted to do. Most enjoyable part of the job: everything."
