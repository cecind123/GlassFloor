bad,"No teamwork, people are rude. Meds went missing. It wasn't a good place to work at. I was told in the interview one pay and when I got my first check it wasn't"
bad,Poor management poor HR.   They care about quantity not quality. I am surprised they are still open for business management will pass anything and everything.
bad,Pouco espírito de equipa e fraca formação dos colaboradores
bad,"Poor management through out the entire warehouse.  Working with people from the ghetto, very unsanitary through out, unsafe work environment, no team work."
bad,"While you may try to convince yourself that you are part of an amazing global team at the end of the day you are just a number and you will be treated harshly without remorse or empathy even if you are doing a great job and and had a great review."
bad,"Management lied right from the beginning just to get me to come on board.things just never got better, poor management,  most of the co-workers were impossible to work with. It is not a very fun place to work at all. So many better places to work I am glad to be out of there."
bad,"This company hires temps, and some on probation for 45 days before they are hired and become Union. This company finds a reason not to hire you in the 45 days. In 45 days I was there I saw A lot of people come and go. No one was hired."
bad,The people who run the company have no vested interest in the business other than to pocket the profits that are left after expenses.  The purchase of Brunswick was a real estate deal.  They have no interest in the businesses that are sitting on the land.
bad,No room for advancement. Current manager is heartless and bland. Didn't take job seriously at all. I started my day by doing a bunch of work my manager didn't get done forcing my job responsibilities to be set on hold. The culture was great before AMF took over. The hardest part of the job is making sure the company doesn't think your stealing. That's right. Take a pen home and your job is done.
bad,The boss is terrible he lies causes trouble between employees manipulates employees plays favorites then when he fires you he lies to unemployment so you cant get it.  i would never refer them to a friend or enemy.
bad,Your hard work and dedication mean nothing to them. they will use you for as long as they can before they throw you under the bus.
bad,I worked here for 2 and a half months in a 3 month probationary period. I got laid off because they did not have enough money to keep me. It's alot of work for little pay. I pretty much was treated like a piece of garbage the whole time I worked there. If you like working long hours and getting treated like garbage apply here.
bad,"I wanted to be a bartender and they gave me a chance but overall it was the first horrible bartending job and the first horrible job I have ever dealt with in my entire life for a 23 year old. Coming from a low income family that lives on section 8 throughout his life, a passionate person that love helping people, and a person that did 5 years of volunteering, I had to walk out and it was unprofessionally. I do deserve the consequence but that's life. The only thing I learn from them is being an a hole to my co workers, and they're are times I was being at times because the stress from the management. The management is just ridiculously horrible. The kitchen manager and supervisor was the only the awesome manager in Lakeville. They're 3 nut head manager. One, is that  guy office manager thinks he's the king because he deals with your paperwork. Two, is that assistant manager that will always be that guy even if you have a bad up morning, he will find another way to make it more worst than your mother funeral, and finally but least the general manager. That is such a 2 face and will talk so much smack behind your back to other co workers but not tell you what you're doing wrong at work in front of your face. He doesn't even wanna help the co workers to be a better workers. He just want the money. Here's the funny side of the corporate, they will hire a general manager that used to manage at other place but will not promote the assistant manager that work for them more than 5 years. It doesn't make sense, it really don't. I loved all my co workers from CSR and servers. We are"
bad,"As I have worked at the Corporate office, It is not all it is cracked up to be.. Hr staff are very Caddy and are half the time clueless of actual employment law ...be careful"
bad,Poor management and leadership! Engineering is a joke they are more worried about meetings rather than fixing the problems they created! They treat their employees like dirt! Hr is a joke they don't care about the employees! You can't use your vacation when you want to! The weld Tech's are nothing but a joke! A very stressful and racist work environment! I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here!!!!
bad,"Nothing nice to say. Management is terrible. The way you're treated is terrible. If the 'click' doesn't like you, you have no chance of survival. No compassion from above."
bad,Terrible management and HR.. lack of advancement.. lies blames each other for not telling the truth... old managers were great.. new managers sneaky and lazy!
bad,"Fast paced - no benefits before 90 days! Hot, dirty, low pay, personal favouritism among employees, difficult work areas where expected to multiple jobs although it wasn't what I was hired to do - I felt like a monkey - trained for the amusement of the management staff. I ruined my personal clothing because no uniforms were offered, nor was there a uniform allowance, or compensation for destroyed clothing while working for this company."
bad,"-The union is controlled by the company, when I was let go the union cut me a check for my union dues and deleted me off their records so that they didn't have to help me out; and miraculously every time a new union contract comes along and brunswick wants a change made they will have a union steward make the change in exchange for a cozy office job directly with the company."
bad,"Pay cap at 15 an hour in assembly for the rest of your life. If someone calls in, your forced to do their job plus your own job. Half the crew on lines call in all the time because being forced to to other peoples jobs. Management only cares about numbers and bonuses for themselves. Your not viewed as a person. The union sides with them always and don't care.no work stability, they constantly move you wherever they want. If you make a complaint to hr, your a liar and may as well start looking for a new job. A bunch of teenagers work there who play on phones and tablets all day resulting in poor quality of product, and constant horseplay of goofing off. No accountability at all. If john doe keeps making a mistake, everyone gets blamed because poor management. Floaters job description is to do nothing unless they feel like it. Job bids are fixed. If you win a bid and they want to keep you where your at, theyll cancelled your bid and repost it or wash you out and repost it. If you bid to a different shift, the supervisor will talk to other shift supervisor and cancelled your bid. If your harassed,and you report it, they will say prove it, and if you prove it, they still do nothing. Old people there are always making racial slurs.that can't keep any workers because when new people show up and see what's going on, they either quit, call in, or don't come back. And there's a lot of drug dealing going on in there in young people."
bad,"They set you up to fail and when you ask for help, you dont grt it. Poorly managed and very behind the times. Not a good place for stability. The only good thing is they have an on site cafeteria, but is only available on first shift."
bad,"This is not a place you work if you want to advance unless you know someone.  No work/life balance, managers are worthless, and mine would throw her own employees under bus in a heartbeat!"
bad,"Too many people that don't know how to do their job or are unwilling to do it. Unfair treatment for different ""races"". Fights all the way against employees that are receiving short term disability or FMLA."
bad,"Poor mgt, unorganized, unprofessional, daily harassment from team leads accusing you of ""racial"" conversations/comments about them and HR did nothing!"
bad,As a current employee of Brunswick Life Fitness the management here absolutely is disrespectful plays favorites and makes you feel like you're doing something wrong when you're doing your job for new employees you're expected to know more than you currently do and if somebody that works there helps you they're reprimanded because they're not focusing on welding there helping you learn the job.
bad,"I worked there for 5 years and I was great for the first two years, then they moved to Hadley rd. Prisoners get more respect and treated better than they treat their employees. No integrity what so ever. If you like being miserable all day long go work at Brunswick and you will find it."
bad,"Work your butt off and still get yelled at or talked down to...A lot of drama between workers.  Some supervisors are serious jerks.  There are (were) good people there.  Stay on the good side of the bosses, or else."
bad,Worked at hammer strength in Falmouth for 4 years. Loved my job and all the coworkers but anything above a floor worker is part of a clique and you will never advance unless you are apart of that clique. Also do not go in giving 110% it’s a waste. I met any and all requests joyfully but it never gets you anywhere. If management was redone I would likely return.
bad,Not working well with family life hard schedule with kids. Stressful got injured while working a dangerous environment. Need something where I can be a mom and a wife family comes first. Not very understanding.
bad,Not the worst place in the world but long term temp everyone is out to get you if you show any skill and crew leaders are a joke that do nothing but stand around all day
bad,I thought it'd be exciting to work in the boating industry. Turns out they don't pay nearly as well as other industries such as defense or aerospace but I was willing to sacrifice finances for a rewarding career.  The office politics were immature at best...it's basically a fraternity of guys who have worked together forever that call the shots while the new comers do all the work and get taken advantage of. No real opportunity to move up unless one of the old guys retires.  Do you want to spend 3 weeks in the frozen tundra of Poland working 16 hour days getting yelled at daily? Then join the European boat group. If you want to work with an enthusiastic group of guys who are passionate about boats look elsewhere.
bad,"Work was frequently micromanaged by head of department, with little chance to work on projects or any chance to learn. Uses contract employees to avoid having to provide benefits and drops them once they feel they have gotten enough out of them. Was given no notice of this after months of promises to be brought on full time. Was called by staffing agency after work and told not to come back the next weekend. Unreliable with no real benefits to work. (Worked in the offices not manufacturing departments)"
bad,Too many cheifs and not enough indians. Poor management along with lay offs. Poor safety practices along with threats of being wrote up. Bosses don't know what's going on
bad,Management is very poor. Have little knowledge of jobs to be performed. Supply is a joke. Material quality is very poor. If you can get it. Engineering is former line workers. With no engineering back ground. Problem solving and design issues are out sourced. Costing to much money. Material used to complete project is poorly selected. Example: Exterior vinyl for cushions was not U/V resistant. Causing failure. Who dose this?
bad,"quantity not quality. company doesn't care for the employees at all. human resources are terrible and extremely one sided, and very poorly handled. hours start early and your days will end late. they claim to work 4 ten hour days a week, in the entire time i was there didn't see less than 5 ten hour days, and a lot of 6 day 60 hour minimum work weeks. overtime is MANDATORY. don't like it they will fire and replace you without notice."
bad,"Unless you are a high level employee, don't expect job security, good pay increases or any other perks. Managers are put in place who do not have the qualifications to lead the departments they are responsible for."
bad,I worked as a temp for 9 months before they hired me on. They then hired me October 15 so they wouldn't have to pay me holiday pay for Christmas and New Years.
bad,Management at this place is a joke. There was really nothing that I learned from this place. The only good look about working at Brunswick was that you got discounted bowling and billiards.
bad,"Brunswick makes a good product and has a great culture of safety.  Very fast pace environment, requiring broad collaboration across divisions and functions."
bad,"A lot of empty promises. Uneducated and unexperienced management and co-workers. Union is not helpful. They through you to the dogs with no training. Forced overtime during the week and weekends. No parts to fix the equipment so you try to use what ever you can find. They treat you like second class citizen. The pay is better then most for the area. Benefits are decent for the area. No bonuses unless your management. Forbes ranked it as a great place to work, I'm guessing if your in management. If you want a stress free job that you get paid as much as the lazy guy next to you this is the place. But for me that's very unfulfilling."
bad,"It needs to be more of a straight across the board company I don't like the fact some people can never do anything wrong or could get pulled aside because they are ""always"" working hard"
bad,"Very poorly managed, especially the customer service department. HR and the president could careless even though they have been told time & time again by several different employees. Very high turnover rate due to management issues. Benefits are okay except for the health insurance, very high out of pocket before they cover anything. My co-workers were wonderful if only the higher-ups would have taken their employees complaint seriously."
good,"They dont promote from within. Regardless of what they tell you. "
good,"El gerente de mi área no era ordenador, tenia muchas áreas de oportunidad como en delegar actividades y en orientar a su equipo de trabajo."
good,"Mal trato de personal por parte de altos mandos, no existe seguridad para empleados, no hay equipación adecuada, lo cual afecta la salud de los empleados."
good,i got to learn something new and exciting and the coworkers where cool . I had fun learning about the lanes and to see how they work. it was okay job.
good,Brunswick was always in chaos.  You never knew what the corporate office would throw at you next.  Including laying off all bookkeepers at al facilities in one day with no severance pay or warning.   Communication between management and employees was non existent.    I loved my work and I learned quite a bit.  I liked my co-workers and tried to support them as best I could given the restrictions I was under.
good,"The biggest issue thats come up is management is not true to their word and does not do things by the book. Also, this company keeps employees who do not do their work but instead makes other employees cover the work thats not being done plus doing their own work."
good,I had a great group of people that I worked with there.  We had a bowling league that was really fun and I still keep in contact with a lot of people.  The only bad thing was the downturn in the economy in 2006 and people stopped buying boats so I got laid off.
good,Crestliner builds the best aluminum fishing boats in the industry today
good,training is not always consistent and feedback is not helpful; the training needs to be more streamlines and the training is not every day. could be more consistent
good,The industry has changed since I worked there.  There was a lot of competition with local industry but there were alos local partnerships that benefitted the community.
good,The company does not provide career paths for employees that want to advance on their careers. Their yearly goals and review of your performance does not count towards your bonus
good,"Was good job but had no career advancement opportunities with management. I loved my co workers and the patrons that I was able to see two to three times a week. I did not like the low pay or the lack of career advancement that the company had to offer. I wanted to learn more but there was no ""time available"" to teach, because we were always in need and teaching new hires."
good,"I  thought after almost 30yrs I would have job security oops guess I was wrong, make way for someone cheaper less experience after 4+yrs their still looking"
good,"A typical day at work for me typically begins with lane maintenance. I operate a machine that cleans and oils each lane. Once that is finished, I can begin machine maintenance on the 48 lanes we have. From day to day, I communicate with the employees up front to keep them informed of which machine I will be working on. When I am performing maintenance on a machine, I could be replacing a part, making adjustments, cleaning parts, or even lubricating pivot points. I work alone typically, but there are two other mechanics that work in the same facility at different times. We try to keep a record of work performed so any issues could be resolved quickly in the event that something goes wrong. It can be a stressful job on occasion due to high volume of business, but I do enjoy the feeling of getting a machine fixed and running again. I feel a sense of accomplishment and I know that customers will be happier that their machine will be running without issue. While working here, I have learned a lot of tricks to working with machines and tools. I have learned a small amount about electricity, plumbing, and even HVAC equipment. As a maintenance mechanic, the machines are not the only part of my job. If a monitor fails, it is my job to replace the board and ensure it works again. The same goes for snackbar, bathroom, and computer equipment. I have good relationships with some employees, but others bring unnecessary stress to the environment. I try to avoid the issues other bring and stick to what I am there to do, my job."
good,Show up and build boats. The co-workers are diverse and friendly.The hardest part of the job were the hours.
good,Work at least stayed in the united states.
good,Good company besides that Management changes frequently. Doesn’t allow for much of a future when all management changes on a daily basis. That is all I can say
good,Brunswick is a great company to work for.  The only downfall for being a field mechanic is the long days of work and sometimes months without going home to see your family.  I would recommend to get the experience
good,Brunswick was not a bad place to work there was just no potential for advancement in my mind. Long hours and on top of that was too far of a drive for me on a daily basis five to six times a week
good,Been employed here for a while easy work although there is no overtime and i see you can not move up raises are minimally portioned per worker. Thats my review
good,It was a clean work place it was alot of mandatory overtime very hot in the summer not alot of heavy lifting washing and drying the tubes to get the decking put on.
good,A pretty decent first job for those trying to get into a work force. But not something to make long term. Good company just was under a lot of changed when employed here.
good,ta mais ou menos mas podia melhorar qual coisa....
good,Very organized and structured environment. Difficult to move up in due to quantity and quality of applicants. Good starting place for people of all ages.
good,Very demanding and challenging. Management has a very relaxed way of going about business. I would recommend this job to someone who's energetic due to the fact that there's a lot of walking
good,This is a good place to work the only thing that could be better was letting all depts know what was going on. Sometime the shipping dept did not know if orders were up to dated
good,"We were switched to a 4 day, 10 hour schedule with the intention of taking Saturdays off of our work schedule. Instead, they decided to work us Monday - Saturday every week. The compensation was great but the management lacked any sort of communication and lacked consistency in their reasoning for decisions."
good,"Think twice before starting... if u don't train well or can't keep up with a fast paced company then this isn't the place for u. Also it is very drama filled and can get hostile.. in the short amount of time I have been here I have seen many people come and go the turn over rate is super high and people like to gossip.. so basically think of high school. "
good,"intern, years ago. less than impressed with the culture and management decisions made while working there (2005-2006). Hopefully things have changed for the better."
good,Working with new people everyday. Seeing different cultures and having many different conversations. Helping other with locating items and returning items.
good,"It paid the bills, but unfortunately the ebb and flow of the business meant that the needs fluctuated from week to week and thus Saturdays came frequent."
good,Basicially working their was alright but the people I work around was kinda cool. But its was alright the money was good.. the co-worker was the worst part.
good,My typical day would get to work and count all finances through the business day for the company. Look over the over/short for the day before and verify lost preventions. I learned to be an officiant worker and help other when need. Also able to step up when need to take care of a problem within the company and solve the issue. The hardest part of the job was to be able to take the management role when general manager issue me my position. Made it a little difficult for the first few days then it got easier as the days went by. Most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers that came in there and got to know then person to have there time more enjoyable at Brunswick.
good,"There are lots of inefficiencies within our department, namely with resource allocation which overlaps with our constant struggle with a lack of resources--we are very short-staffed. The end user demands are high and they expect a high quality of service and in order to meet those requirements, the IT department needs to invest in a more structured support department and one with more personnel."
good,"ok work place you would have to be at work and not miss any days "
good,It was a fun job because I got along with most people there. Although there were some people who were very slow when working so working with those people wasn't the greatest. Overall its a fun environment and was a great learning experience.
good,"I don't mind working here. they have decent benefits. it is a very physical job however, and they are very quick to cut your work if you are injured instead of accommodating you for small things."
good,"It was a good experience, colleagues are helpful , well informed and technically sound management , which care about you work-life balance. Supportive"
good,Well to be honest it was descent it working there and when i was working there at the location i was at it wasnt the best environments to work in as far as employees.
good,"Had the opportunity to learn various positions, while having accepted a position as Production Superintendent.  Great people at the plant level. Not much room to grow professionally."
good,Fast paced environment and cool co-workers is what keeps you going at this place. The management is good and for the most part will do everything possible to help you succeed.
good,"Start early work  long days"
good,Brunswick is a very fast paced job. You must be good with power tools and a tape measure. Depending on wich department your in you can work up to 50 hours a week. You also work mandatory saturdays. You only get one Saturday off in each month. I consider that over working the employee.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, y gran calidad Humana con el personal."
good,Good company with great innovations but not enough focus on improving toxic culture in some departments.  Some really great people overall and amazing products.
good,"Brunswick Smelting has provided opportunity for personal and professional development. Challenges with regard to attaining business objectives while being mindful of safety and environmental stewardship are paramount. Adhesion to personal values of integrity, honesty & respect developed strong support & respect from my crews."
good,"Dans l'ensemble ca va"
good,"A good place to work friendly people we all did are work like we were told to get done that day and we would help each other out if they needed it but new computer hiring system is not user friendly  ,I have A lot of problems trying to get signed in to check on jobs"
good,"the work itself at brunswick is pretty straightforward. mostly fast paced and in order. compensation is pretty decent. but the management is not the best certain times, they tend to change things back and forth frequently confusing workers which would lead to production delay and confusion. it does get pretty boring especially since its just one job and they do not allow music. but at the end of the day, they pay for the work. also, if you try to do different jobs and end up really good at them, there is room for advancement"
good,"I was the General Manager and had a great team that worked for me.  We worked well together.  We worked hard, but had time to have fun as well."
good,Feel for the most part it was a great place to work. Hardest thing was keeping kitchen clean while bowling leagues were bowling.
good,Great place with lots of benefits. Start work at 5 am and get off at 3:30 or later. Get a raise every 3 months. Starting out at 13.75. With over time at 1.5x pay.
good,"Pues el area donde laboraba no era de mucho agrado para mi, porque manejaba alcohol y era muy fuerte"
good,i would cook food clean and server beer i cleaned and also do orders for us and ran the reg hired people trained bank stocked and cleaned bar and snack bar
good,its a good place to work but sometimes they set you up for failure if u are a group lead or supervisor you can get fired very easily.. good company though
good,"This was a great opportunity, we were all sad to see the acquisition. The entire marketing team (along with many others) were let go in favor of AMF's team."
good,"I am thankful for the time I worked there, However, it is not a place for new welders to start or a welder that is not experienced in aluminum welding, They have a lot of good honest people that work there and I am thankful for the ones I met why I was there."
good,Great company. I thought I'd retire from here. Once a new president came in and saw the bonus potential to sell out they did. Ruined many lives in the process. Sold out to our bitter rival. Imaging McDonalds and Wendy's merging. Yeah like that. Upper management lost its way but the Brunswick Brand is strong and a great company
good,Brunswick is dedicated to it's employees.  They have a win program that employees can enter any suggestion they have and it will be considered.  All and all a great company.
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits.  A bit of an old school cover your backside middle management culture persists, however Senior management is very solid."
good,"Great professional company with high expectations although rewarding if you put in the work."
good,"A typical day as a Treasurer was far from typical.  I wore many hats at Brunswick CSD.  I would assist accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, HR, and whatever else was needed of me. I would for the opportunity to discuss this in person via interview."
good,I found the work challenging and had a steady advancement during my tenure.
good,"I enjoyed working for Brunswick very fast past company, Some management was good some was bad , overtime was exhausting at time a lot was mandated ,many employees didn’t stay at company , their was a massive turnover in this facility , days were long most days 10 to 12 hrs of overtime, was too much for young girls due to having little children at home , some days didn’t go well due to lack of products their were days of waiting"
good,"Brunswick Corporation makes pontoon boats in Fort Wayne, IN.  The products are well made by great employees who are focused on quality and safety.  They provide great benefits as well."
good,Working as a host/lane server is a really great job but also is a downer for me because I only work one or two days on the weekends because I host parties so I only get work when they need me so it's not a balanced work hours.
good,"The pay was good, and we did get a lot of time off. My supervisor was fair and he made sure u had the things you need. I've learned lots of things on building boats and ever since i've worked there, ive been knowing lots more on how to fix alot of things."
good,Company is always willing to hear ideas and always look to change for the better.  Great company to work for! People are fun to work with and the current growth is great!
good,"The culture varies greatly between the different divisions of Brunswick Corp. While there's absolutely some great positions, management and benefits the corporation as a whole struggles to place any emphasis on individual importance and keeping them from getting lost in the ranks. If you don't mind being just a number and are looking for a comfortable paycheck, go for it."
good,dentro do periodo dentro da empresa cresci em vários aspectos profissionais e me serviu muito para vencer meus limites
good,Its a great experience working here. People care about you and your growth as an employee. They make fun products that make it a great time to interact with as a business.
good,"good benefits"
good,Good place to work and provided a lot of jobs for Leland NC and surrounded areas. I loved working here we become like family with around 500 employees. I miss working here
good,"Loved working at Brunswick. Had a variety of jobs including filing sales and use tax, account reconciliations, expense reports and accounts payable."
good,"Even though the place had perfect schedule for my life style the work load was very unorganized. You are scheduled five, eight hour days but there would not be enough work to get the full forty hours, then they would mandate Saturdays which ended up becoming straight time pay making up for the lost hours during the week."
good,Getting onto the phones and greeting customers that would visit the center. Taking down messages and knowing promotions.
good,"Interesting & challenging, small but promising enterprise."
good,All in all Brunswick is a GREAT company to work for.  Their bowling operations are are well run and offer the cleanest facilities in the industry.
good,"Working in a lab doing testing, building, recording and reporting of cell farms."
good,"They offer great benefits with bonuses 401k matching and health benefits. Hours are good with possible over time, and the pay is great for the area..."
good,Company's overall strategy relies on product development but it has good operating mechanisms in place to conduct business. The company has good people and cross-functional talent.
good,"Everyday was varied and you never knew who was going to walk through the door next."
good,Working here was nice and the area was beautiful. There were a lot of crane lifts and when I was not working on with the crane I was a Hydro Mechanic taking apart and rebuilding the unit
good,"Overall, I love working with the company but there are many days where I just feel over worked. Often times I feel as though I am doing everyone’s job. Some days are relaxed but most you are stuck, especially as a shift lead. When people don’t do their positions task you get the short end of the stick and have to pick up their slack."
good,It's a job so do want you can and keep it moving to better yourself never get comfortable always go for better !.......................................
good,"I was assigned to the research centre of Brunswick group, where I aided in aspects such as creating biographies, conducting secondary research, and putting together presentations."
good,Treat people like people respect you for your hard work promotions easily earned. Praise people for staying on task and focused.
good,The Supervisors were easy to work with and willing to do ny assignment with you if you needed help.
good,Typically a great place to work. Just not enough hours of work to maintain an everyday living. The task provided were manageable and enjoyable. Would still be there if more hours were available.
good,exelente  empresa  fue donde  me dieron la  oportunidad  de  ocupar  mi primer  puesto de  confianza
good,"Brunswick was a well structured company with long-term plans and opportunities for advancement, specially if willing to relocate. I learned a lot from the exposure to the various business, sites and product lines that Brunswick has."
good,"Worked as a cashier."
good,Overall a decent place to work. The people are great and it's fun. Some projects get sidelined based on corporate though.
good,I guess u can say i had a fun time working theri the peopl was nice and kind..i like  the environment the employees was nice and kind ..the mannager knew what he was doing..he taught me the ropes on what to do on a forklift..and he was kind and generous and supportive..
good,This place isn't very bad to work at. There are things that can be better just like any job but i have worked here for 2.5 years and I'm still here. This place is easy for me to work at because i love working with people.
good,"Good Place to learn and to start a career. Not a long term career job. I learned a lot under my engineering supervisor. The benefits are great here, but pay is below fair market average."
good,"it is good job and people are vary friendly there . we build  engines and it is hard job , the mus enjoyable part of my job it is after we done from building small part and after we join them together  correctly we see what we have made ruing in front of are eyes ."
good,The job is fun and I enjoy working with the customers that come in. I also enjoy ensuring that they have a safe and fun time with their experience at the Bowling Center.
good,Builder of Fiberglass boats that strives to exceed customer's expectations of being the highest quality boats in the world.
good,I was expected to do more at same pay as others had to lead with no lead pay had to train people that had never used any of the equipment that had to be used they started hiring people that didn't speak the same language as other so train was extremely hard. I was in the company for a long term to make a living so when they hire people that just don't want to work r not even show up it makes it harder on everyone
good,Very nice facility with a lot  amenities. Do not have much more to say. Didn't work there very long. Would have liked to but work had declined. I was the last temp to be hire so first to go
